    
      The purpose of this randomized, open-label study is to evaluate the immunological efficacy of
      two first-line strategies of antiretroviral therapy:

        1. emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate coformulated plus efavirenz (or lopinavir/r)
           intensified by enfuvirtide during the first 24 weeks of therapy.

        2. emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate coformulated plus efavirenz (or lopinavir/r)

      Patients with lymphocytes T CD4+ cell (CD4)count below 100 per mm3, or CD4 cell count below
      200 per mm3 and past history or presence of AIDS defining event and na√Øve of any
      antiretroviral therapy will be eligible. This multicenter study will enroll 220 patients
      (n=110 in each arm). The planned duration of the study is 48 weeks from the enrolment of the
      last subject.

      The primary endpoint will be immunological success defined as CD4 cell count above 200 cells
      per mm3 after 24 weeks of initial treatment. The durability of this response will be
      evaluated and patients will be followed for 48 weeks.
