      has a well established data on its efficacy and safety in the hypertensive population (see
      package insert, Appendix 3). The side effect profile of isradipine is related to the primary
      mechanism of action of the agent as a vasodilator of the vascular smooth muscles and
      myocardium, and includes hypotension, bradycardia, weakness, and syncope. As per package
      insert, the most common adverse effects are headache (13.7% with active treatment versus 14%
      placebo), dizziness (7.3 vs 4.4) and peripheral edema as reflection of the vasodilatory
      effect which is dose dependent with incidence of about 3.5% at 5 mg, 8.7% at 10 mg and 8.5%
      at 20 mg. Of note the incidence of edema is substantially lower compared to CR preparation
      (9:13:36% for the respective doses). The other side effects include angina, asthenia,
      flushing, heart failure, and palpitations. According to the package insert, the adverse
      effects are usually not serious, dose dependent, and respond well to dose reduction or
      discontinuation of therapy. Isradipine has no effect on atrioventricular or sinoatrial
      conduction. The only absolute contraindications for isradipine are hypersensitivity to DHP
      compounds and hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Until our
      studies, isradipine has not been tested in the PD population.
