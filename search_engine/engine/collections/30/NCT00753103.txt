      systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. Current treatment regimes using corticosteroids and
      cyclophosphamide have improved patient survival but are associated with treatment associated
      morbidity and mortality. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine
      which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitis. Anti-TNF therapies have
      been used successfully in the management of other inflammatory autoimmune diseases. This
      phase II cohort study has been designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of anti-TNF
      monoclonal antibody (Infliximab) therapy for patients with ANCA associated vasculitis when
      used in addition to standard immunosuppressive therapy.
