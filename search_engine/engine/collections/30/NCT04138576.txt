    
      Primary goal:

      To study the efficacy of systemic pharmacotherapy as part of combination therapy and its
      impact on the:

        -  thickness of the skin-fat fold (ultrasound examination);

        -  change in the venous clinical severity score (VCSS);

        -  change in the CEAP clinical class of CVD;

        -  evolution of CVD symptoms characteristic for CEAP class C4 (sensations of skin
           tightening, burning, itching, pain, and exudation) using the Visual Analogue Scale
           (VAS).

      Secondary goals:

        1. To study the efficacy of systemic pharmacotherapy as part of combination therapy and its
           impact on the:

             -  area of affected skin determined by curvimetry technique (only in selected centers
                that use this technique routinely) before and after the treatment in patients with
                skin changes of CEAP class C4a or C4b in real clinical practice;

             -  skin density determined by durometry technique (only in selected centers that use
                this technique routinely).

        2. To evaluate the changes in the quality of life using the CIVIQ-14 questionnaire (global
           index score [GIS]) .

        3. To study the tolerability of systemic pharmacotherapy as part of combination therapy in
           patients with skin changes of CEAP class C4a or C4b.
