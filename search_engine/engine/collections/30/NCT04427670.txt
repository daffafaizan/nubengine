      of the inability of motor control on the speech structures. There are many therapeutic
      approaches in Pakistan that are in use for the patients with dysarthria following stroke. One
      of them is one to one intervention which may include one dysarthria client along with the
      speech therapist. The therapist delivers step by step instructions to the client. The
      essential assessments are being held to initiate the treatment. The application of this
      intervention approach leaves some drawbacks, such as, the patients find it difficult to
      relate and adapt to the treatment offered. Generalization also seems to be complicated. The
      patients express a lack in motivation and support. The other mode of approach is group
      intervention, in which multiple dysarthria clients along with their caregivers & speech
      therapist are included. In the later one, there are greater chances of recovery for patients
      as they get peer support and build confidence through newfound friends, peer communication
      with realistic social setting, learning through teaching, increased awareness of skills and
      it is time constraints. The culture of practicing group sessions with dysarthria patients is
      lacked in Pakistan, which intends to meet and compensate for all the drawbacks and lacks of
      one on one intervention. By including the Dysarthria patients, therapist and the caregivers
      in the group intervention, there're greater chances of reduced anxiety for both patients &
      caregivers regarding disorder & its recovery.
