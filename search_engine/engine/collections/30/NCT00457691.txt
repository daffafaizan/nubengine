      Study A6181122. The DMC determined Study A6181122 had met pre-specified futility criteria and
      was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint to demonstrate a statistically significant
      improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with sunitinib plus
      FOLFIRI versus placebo plus FOLFIRI. No new safety findings were noted. Pfizer notified
      clinical trial investigators involved in the study and regulatory agencies of these findings.
      Patients receiving benefit on treatment as determined by the investigator may remain on
      study.
