      be implicated in its initiation, maintenance and adverse consequences. The SNS is composed of
      an afferent and efferent arm, which brings sensory information to the brain (e.g. brainstem
      and hypothalamus) and transmits sympathetic outflow from the brain to the peripheral organs,
      respectively. Selective removal of the afferent renal component of the SNS can modulate
      central sympathetic outflow to the kidney, heart and vasculature in animals. The specific
      contribution of afferent nerve signalling in hypertension and in the potential
      antihypertensive effect of renal denervation has not been studied in humans.
