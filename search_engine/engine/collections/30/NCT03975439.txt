    
      Yakima County has a large hispanic farmworker population. The peak work times are between May
      and September. There is a growing body of research that shows the risk of agricultural
      workers in work environments with extreme heat.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to look at incidence of non-diagnosed chronic kidney
      disease within Yakima County to inform future studies to examine other factors and unique
      bio-markers that may help in the early diagnosis of heat related injuries in agricultural
      workers.
