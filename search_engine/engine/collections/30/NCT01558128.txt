      significant outcome implications. Incidence after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is
      estimated at 26-33%, while those undergoing valvular surgery bear a greater burden at 33-49%.
      Clinical and socioeconomic complications resulting from postoperative atrial fibrillation
      include an increased risk of death (10%), congestive heart failure (4%), prolonged hospital
      stays, and increased rate of discharge to care facilities over those who remain in sinus
      rhythm, (7%). Although a body of evidence exists for electrical or pharmacological
      cardioversion to sinus rhythm postoperatively, there is a marked paucity in the literature
      regarding efficacy and outcomes combining the two. More specifically, we seek to evaluate the
      efficacy of DC cardioversion when combined with amiodarone. Improved outcomes with multimodal
      cardioversion may decrease the postoperative clinical burden of atrial fibrillation on
      cardiac surgery patients.
