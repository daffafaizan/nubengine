      I. To assess electroencephalography (EEG) changes of women with and without history of
      chemotherapy exposure undergoing volatile general anesthesia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate if chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment is associated with an increased
      sensitivity to general anesthetic agents captured by the patient state index (PSI) and
      observable in changes in alpha (8-12 H) activity in the frontal regions of the EEG) and other
      study features such as EEG power, burst suppression analysis, burst suppression ratio, and
      coherence analysis.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between preoperative cognitive function and
      electroencephalographic changes under general anesthesia. II. To assess the relationship
      between EEG signatures under general anesthesia and postoperative cognitive function.

      III. To collect blood specimens for extracting information on serum lipids and cytokines at
      two different times, before anesthetic induction, and 30 to 60 minutes upon arrival to the
      postoperative anesthesia care unit.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cognitive function assessment BrainCheck over 10 minutes before surgery, day
      1 after surgery, and day 2 after surgery (if patients are still admitted to the hospital) and
      3D-confusion assessment over 10 minutes twice daily (BID) on day 1 after surgery and day 2
      after surgery (if patients are still admitted to the hospital). Patients also undergo EEG
      during surgery and collection of blood samples 30-60 minutes after surgery.
