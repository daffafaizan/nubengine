      I. Perform in a blind study a multicentric study by analyzing serum from patients at
      diagnosis (with a known tumor v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma
      derived homolog (MYCN) status determined in the Children's Oncology Group [COG] reference
      lab), in order to confirm our previous data and to define the most appropriate MYCN/control
      ratio cutoff capable of determining positive and negative cases.

      II. Define the limits of the procedure in non-metastatic patients and in those with reduced
      tumor burden (International Neuroblastoma Staging System [INSS] stage 1 and 2).

      OUTLINE:

      Circulating DNA is extracted from serum. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of
      MYCN is performed and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Real-time quantitative PCR is
      also performed.
