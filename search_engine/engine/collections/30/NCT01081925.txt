      The prevalence of CHF is between 2 and 4% and rises with age (in 70- to 80-year-old people is
      between 10 and 20%). CHF is the cause of 5% of all acute hospital admissions and accounts for
      2% of expenses on health. The most common causes of worsening of the chronic CHF are
      ischemia, arrhythmias, valvular dysfunction, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, volume
      overload or fluid retention, high output conditions (infection, anemia, thyrotoxicosis),
      drugs (NSAIDs, cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones) and medication
      nonadherence. The goal of this study is to determine the proportion of various reasons of
      acute worsening of CHF, using commonly available methods including assessment of serum drug
      levels.
