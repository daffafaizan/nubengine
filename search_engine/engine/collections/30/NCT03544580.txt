      ; progressive bone resorption may be prevented by using augmentation procedures with use of
      graft materials. The gold standard in regenerative procedures is autogenous bone graft
      because of osteoinduction , osteoconduction and osteointergration properties required in
      regeneration. In autogenous bone graft there is need for a second surgical site , donor site
      morbidity and limited availability will lead to challenge for alternative bio-materials.

      Extracted healthy non functional teeth from human are considered to be a dental waste all
      over the world. High proportion of extracted sockets are left untreated for physiological
      healing. Inadequate or failure of bone healing in sockets has been seen due to absence of
      bone graft material. Stem cells, matrix , trace metal ions and growth factors are rich in
      human tooth. Bone and dentin tissue structure are different but ratio of components is
      similar (mineral 70% , collagen 20% and body fluid 10% by weight). Dentin after
      demineralization is mainly composed of type 1 collagen 95% and non collagenous proteins as
      growth factors.
