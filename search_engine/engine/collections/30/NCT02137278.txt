      antiarrhythmic and psychiatric drugs, are associated with orthostatic hypotension and
      syncope. This phenomenon is much more evident in the elderly and with multiple therapies. The
      present study was aimed to investigate, in patients affected by reflex syncope, the clinical
      effects (reduction in syncope recurrence and associated symptoms) and the laboratory tests
      (negativization of carotid sinus massage and tilt table test) when such drugs are
      discontinued or reduced
