      2020 after obtaining ethics committee approval.A total of 128 men with distal ureteral stones
      were randomly divided into 3 groups. All patients received standard medical therapy. Patients
      in group 1 (n=43) were instructed to masturbate at least 3-4 times a week, patients in group
      2 (n=41) received tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day, and patients in group 3 (controls, n=44) received
      standard medical therapy alone. Rates of expulsion, need for analgesic, and ureterorenoscopic
      lithotripsy were compared between the groups.
