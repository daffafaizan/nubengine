      program for people with chronic stroke. Participants with stroke living in the community will
      be randomly assigned to either the dance group or the control group. Participants will attend
      classes 2 times a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes are change in balance balance
      (measured with the Mini BESTest) and change in gait speed. Participants will be assessed
      before and after the 12 week program.
