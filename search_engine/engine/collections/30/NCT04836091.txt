      health outcome measures among male couples by assessing whether exposure and use of the app
      results in improvements in participants and couples' self-reported sexual health and
      prevention behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. The study will enroll both partners of the 42
      male couples into a 2-month randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control condition of
      one month. Couples will be assigned to either the immediate intervention group ("intervention
      arm") or the waitlist-control group ("waitlist-control arm"). All participants will take an
      assessment survey at baseline, and the intervention group will be oriented on the
      installation and use of the app upon randomization to that group. The waitlist-control group
      will follow the same procedures one month later. Participants/couples randomized to the
      intervention arm will have access to the intervention app for two months (ie, day 1-60) while
      those assigned to the waitlist-control group will have access to the app for one month (ie,
      day 31-60). All participants in the randomized controlled trial will complete a short
      follow-up survey at month 2 and a brief exit interview.
