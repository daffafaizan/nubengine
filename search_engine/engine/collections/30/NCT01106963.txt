      (AKP) and nail position marked as a distance from tip of nail to tibial plateau (NP) and to
      the tuberositas tibiae (NT).

      We evaluated postoperative outcome results of 50 patients in the last 3 years with healed
      fractures initially treated with intramedullary (IM) reamed nails with 2 or 3 interlocking
      screws on both parts of the nail and with the use of medial peritendinous incision for nail
      entry portal. Patients marked a point on the visual analog scale (VAS) that corresponded to
      the level of postoperative AKP felt. Two groups of patients were formed on the basis of AKP
      (pain level was neglected): groups A and B, with and without pain, respectively.

      We found that the difference between the two groups concerning NP measurements was
      statistically significant, but not concerning NT measurements (P < 0.05). Patients were
      classified by pain with high accuracy (98%) according to a classification tree.

      We conclude that the symptoms of AKP did not appear if the tip of the nail position was more
      than 6.0 mm from the NP and more than 2.6 mm from the NT. However, for better evaluation of
      these results it will be necessary to examine more postoperative patients with AKP.
