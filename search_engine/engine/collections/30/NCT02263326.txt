    
      DESIGN HIV-1 infected subjects with CD4 nadir > 200 cells/mm3, no history of virologic
      failure and plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 48 weeks while on any United States
      Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommended or alternative three-drug
      antiretroviral regimen will be randomized to dolutegravir (DTG) plus lamivudine (Arm 1) or
      continuation of their current regimen (Arm 2) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is virologic
      failure defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA > 50 copies/mL before or at Week 24

      All subjects will undergo routine monitoring including plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4/CD8 count,
      hematology, chemistry and fasting lipids. Resistance testing will be done in all patients who
      experience virologic failure. Single-copy HIV-1 assay will be done to quantify residual
      viremia.

      DURATION 48 weeks

      SAMPLE SIZE 90 subjects

      POPULATION HIV-1-infected men and women, 18 years and older, with CD4 nadir > 200 cells/mm3,
      no baseline resistance, no history of virologic failure, and HIV RNA <50 copies/mL for at
      least 48 weeks prior to study entry while on any DHHS recommended or alternative three-drug
      regimen

      REGIMEN Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to:

      Arm 1: dolutegravir 50 mg plus lamivudine 300 mg once daily OR Arm 2: Continue current DHHS
      recommended or alternative three-drug antiretroviral regimen
