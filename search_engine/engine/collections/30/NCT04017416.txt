      consists of; 1. information on consequences of using and not using a hearing aid, 2. a
      physical prompt as a reminder to hearing aid use and 3. a behavioural plan to use a hearing
      aid. The aim of this study was to test efficacy of the I-PLAN intervention, delivered
      face-to-face by study audiologists. 160 first-time hearing aid users were recruited at the
      hearing aid fitting appointment. Adult patients were allocated either to the I-PLAN group or
      Standard Care group. Adult patients were allocated to the groups based on the clinic
      schedules of study audiologists.
