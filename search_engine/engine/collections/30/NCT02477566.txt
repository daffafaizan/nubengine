      GnRH agonist according to a protocol used routinely. The long-acting Triptorelin group use
      long-acting Triptorelin 1.875mg during the luteal phase on Pituitary down-regulation , the
      Short acting Triptorelin use short-acting Triptorelin 0.1mg/d,x10d, then 0.05mg/d until
      E2<40pg/ml in serum, was initiated during the luteal phase. Gonadotrophin stimulation of the
      ovaries was started when serum E2 concentrations declined to < 40 pg/ml and a vaginal
      ultrasonographic scan showed an absence of follicles > 10mm diameter. Ovarian stimulation was
      started wih 150-250 IU/day of recombinant FSH (Gonal F, Serono, Switzerland); the initial
      dose was determined by clinical judgement of the clinician according to the patients's age,
      body mass index, basal FSH and E2. Transvaginal ultrasound and E2 measurement were used to
      monitor follicular growth, and gonadotropin dosages were adjusted accordingly. Ovulation was
      triggered by intramuscular administration of 5000-10,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin
      (HCG, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) when at least two follicles reached a diameter of 18 mm. Serum
      HCG value were measured at 12 h after HCG trigger using the immunoassay. Oocytes were
      retrieved 36 h after the injection of HCG.
