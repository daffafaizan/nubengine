      (IU) by cold knife. Recurrence rate after such procedure is quoted as 35-70% in 2 to 5 years
      follow-up. Possible surgical alternative procedures include: open surgical urethral
      re-construction, urethral stents usage & laser IU. According to existing data (Nd-YAG laser-
      retrospective) the recurrence rate after laser IU is far better comparing to cold knife
      urethrotomy. The current research intends to address this question using prospective
      randomized methods.
