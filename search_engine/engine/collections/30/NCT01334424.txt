      procedures and is one of the main factors in impairment of splanchnic perfusion by
      compressing vessels. An hypoperfusion - reperfusion human model is observed during and soon
      after laparoscopic surgery. After deflation of the abdomen, intrabdominal pressure and
      splanchnic blood flow normalize, representing reperfusion.

      Reactive oxygen species is produced in metabolic and physiologic processes, and harmful
      oxidative reactions may occur in organisms that remove them via enzymatic and nonenzymatic
      antioxidative mechanisms.

      Propofol (2, 6 - diisopropylphenol), a highly liposoluble anaesthetic, has a potent
      antioxidant activity against lipid peroxidation in both in vitron and in vivo studies.
      Propofol also attenuates ischemia - reperfusion induced lipid peroxidation in humans. On the
      basis of this knowledge, we hypothesized that propofol has preventive effect for gut
      hypoperfusion - reperfusion induced injury in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomy.
