      28.9% of eyes in persons aged 40 years or older. [1] While often idiopathic in nature, ERM
      formation has been associated with retinal tears, possibly due to a breakdown of the
      blood-retinal barrier [1-3]. Pathological analysis of ERM content shows inflammatory
      mediators such as cytokines, growth factors and interleukins, which can promote fibroblast
      remodelling that leads to a contractile scar formation on the retinal surface. [1, 4-8] For
      this reason, ERM formation has been suggested to be an aberrant tissue repair or
      wound-healing process driven by inflammatory reactions. Since corticosteroids inhibit the
      inflammatory cascade and fibroblast transdifferentiation, administration of a corticosteroid
      following retinal tears should theoretically reduce the risk of ERM formation. [9-10] In this
      study, we aim to assess whether administration of a topical corticosteroid would attenuate
      ERM formation following laser retinopexy of retinal tears.
