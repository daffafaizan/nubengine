      advanced Parkinson with motor fluctuations, reducing motor symptoms in late stage levodopa
      responsive patients, who are not adequately controlled by optimal medical therapy alone.
      However, DBS is presently employed in less than 2% of Parkinson patients. Although a
      proportion of Parkinson patients are for various reasons not suitable for DBS, currently
      there is a significant under-utilisation of this approach and in part this is due to
      perceived surgical risk. Other limitations to adoption are availability of surgeons and
      infrastructure, particularly outside the USA, and expense.

      The objective of this project is to collect and assess safety data for a new DBS device for
      treatment of Parkinson and validate a new surgical technique employing a skull mounted
      device. The device, called Picostim, is highly miniaturised and optimised for Parkinson, with
      current controlled outputs and a rechargeable battery. In typical use, an inductive recharge
      is required once per week for one hour and service-life is projected to be 17 years. This
      project aims to advance the technology of DBS so that it is possible to treat a greater
      proportion of patients more easily, by shortening and simplifying procedures thereby reducing
      surgical time, complexity and cost, while increasing patient satisfaction and quality of
      life. Up to 25 patients will receive the Picostim implantation and will be followed up over a
      one-year period.

      This pilot study will be sufficient to make an application for a CE mark in Europe and should
      inform future studies that are envisaged to be required to prepare an FDA pre-market
      application.
