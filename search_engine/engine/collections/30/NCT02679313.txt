      [e.g., heterophoria, accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratio] when measured
      in a manual phoropter versus a trial frame. These differences may be due to variations in
      proximal vergence, differences in head and eye position and restriction of the peripheral
      visual field. Further, a number of standard clinical oculomotor procedures require the use of
      Risley rotary prisms. While prism is typically introduced in a smooth, ramp-like fashion with
      manual phoropters, step changes in prism are created with electronic phoropters. The precise
      effect of these variations on clinical measurements is unclear. Accordingly, after a routine
      refractive examination, a standard clinical near assessment (comprising near heterophoria,
      AC/A ratio, horizontal vergence ranges, amplitude of accommodation and negative and positive
      relative accommodation) will be carried out on the same individuals through: (i) a standard
      manual phoropter (American Optical model 11625), (ii) an electronic phoropter (Topcon
      CV-5000) and (iii) a wearable adaptive refractor (VisionFit). The latter resembles a trial
      frame mounted on a helmet carrier (similar to a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope headset)
      but includes adaptive lenses that can be changed electronically.
