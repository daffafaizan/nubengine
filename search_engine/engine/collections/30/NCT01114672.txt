      and kidney respectively to make the active form 1-25-Vitamin D. This active metabolite and
      related analogs have been synthesized and are frequently used in the treatment of
      hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. However the active metabolite
      may not be back metabolized to the precursor forms which may have functions in other organs
      including the skin. Supplementation of hemodialysis patients with oral vitamin D forms would
      provide a source of precursors for use throughout the body.
