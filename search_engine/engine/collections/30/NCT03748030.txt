      induced cardiac toxicity, including inflammation, in left-sided breast cancer patients
      undergoing radiotherapy using hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI).

      Methodology: A imaging pilot study composed of 15 left-sided breast cancer patients receiving
      standard radiotherapy is proposed. Patients will be imaged at baseline, within the first
      month post radiotherapy, and within the first-year post radiotherapy using a hybrid
      3T-PET/MRI system (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare). The PET imaging protocol is designed to
      assess changes in both myocardial perfusion and inflammation. The MR imaging protocol,
      acquired simultaneously, will be used to identify heart volume, wall motion, mature fibrosis
      or scar.

      Outcome: The findings of this studies will validate the utility of hybrid PET/MRI to detect
      early inflammatory response, changes in myocardial perfusion, and heart function as a
      function of radiation dose in a human breast cancer population. This will allow consideration
      of new techniques to minimize or eliminate heart complications to future cancer patients and
      provide a non-invasive technique to serially image patients post radiotherapy and to
      investigate the effect of new interventions. Success of this study will stem from a unique
      collaboration of Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, Imaging Scientists, and
      Cardiologists.
