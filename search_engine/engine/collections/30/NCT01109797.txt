      peer-to-peer social networking in which subjects receive "usual care" from their current
      diabetes provider outside the parameters of the study. The second intervention will be a
      traditional transition clinic model, where subjects will receive the standard of diabetes
      care from a team of combined pediatric and adult practitioners and educators, with added
      educational modules and behavioral evaluation and support designed to facilitate the
      transition to adult care (i.e., that foster "developmentally tailored care"). The first is a
      much less intensive intervention from the standpoint of the providers and gives special
      prominence to peer support; the second is provider-intensive. The goal of both interventions
      is to improve self-efficacy (confidence in taking ownership of and managing one's diabetes);
      i.e., to prepare the patient to move from primary support by family and providers to a
      reliance on self-ownership and self-management as a responsible, independent adult.

      Optional sub-study available for parents, spouses, and significant others.
