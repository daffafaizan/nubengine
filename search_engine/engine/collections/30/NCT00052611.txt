      has been shown to prevent the progression of another type of precancerous polyps (a type of
      abnormal growth) in patients at high risk for colorectal cancer. There are, however, no
      published studies yet looking at this drug in humans for the prevention of head and neck
      cancers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved celecoxib for arthritis and the
      prevention of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (a type of precancerous
      syndrome in some families that can lead to colon cancer).

      This study is being done to find out several things:

        -  Is celecoxib, also known by the trade name Celebrex Â®, effective in reducing the
           expression of precancerous markers (biological signals for specific cellular activities)
           in oral leukoplakia and dysplasia (abnormal growth) of the oral mucosa?

        -  Is celecoxib effective in reducing the size of oral leukoplalda lesions and/or presence
           of dysplasia?

        -  Does the reduction in precancerous markers correspond with reduction of oral leukoplalda
           and/or presence of dysplasia?

        -  What are the side effects of celecoxib in this patient population?
