      Investigators are using this medical imaging for performing the 3D cephalometric analysis.
      Investigators apply a set of well described landmarks of three-dimensional reconstruction of
      the skull from patients suffering from diverse craniofacial malformations. Then a set of
      specific measurements is taken from the patient and provide insights how to modify the
      anatomy of the patient to improve the skull's architecture and symmetry
