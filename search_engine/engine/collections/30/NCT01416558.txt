    
      Primary Objective:

      To determine overall response rate (ORR) and to exclude that it is 20% or lower.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine compliance and toxicity of the therapy.

        2. To determine clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients with measurable disease.

        3. To determine duration of response.

        4. To determine progression-free survival (PFS).

        5. To determine overall survival.

        6. To assess biomarkers, e.g. SPARC expression in the tissue of the primary or metastatic
           tumor.
