      Primary

        -  To assess the 24-week (6 months) progression-free survival of patients with extensive
           stage small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
           dimethylxanthenone acetic acid.

      Secondary

        -  To assess efficacy and safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate predictive molecular markers for gene expression analyses, serum proteomics,
           and pharmacogenomics. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over 30 minutes, and
      dimethylxanthenone acetic acid IV over 20 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples may be collected periodically for predictive molecular markers for
      gene expression analysis, plasma proteomics, and pharmacogenomics.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
