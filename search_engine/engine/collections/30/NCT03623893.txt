      (MCIH) in infants with an inguinal hernia (5-30%, most studies report 10%), with the highest
      risk in infants aged less than 6 months. Metachronous hernia is associated with the risk of
      incarceration and general risks and costs of a second operation. This can potentially be
      avoided by contralateral exploration at the first operation. On the other hand contralateral
      exploration may turn out to be unnecessary, is associated with additional operating time and
      cost, and may be associated with additional complications of surgery (including testicular
      atrophy, wound infection) and anesthesia. Both policies to routinely explore the
      contralateral side or not are used in the treatment of unilateral inguinal hernias in
      children. There is no high-grade level of evidence of the superiority of one of either
      policy.
