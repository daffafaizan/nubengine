      the sleep of cancer patients with insomnia. Participants will receive access to the Internet
      program (called SHUTi, or "Shut-Eye") as well as to self-hypnosis recordings designed to
      improve sleep. SHUTi provides an online, tailored educational program to individuals who are
      experiencing sleep difficulties, including those having difficulty falling asleep, waking in
      the middle of the night, and waking too early in the morning.
