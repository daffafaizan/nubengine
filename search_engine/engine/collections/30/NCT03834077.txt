      with ankle range of motion limitation. Although, tissue flossing is widely extended among
      athletes due to its effectiveness in pain, function and range of motion, the evidence is
      limited.

      The aim of the present protocol is to determine the effectiveness of tissue flossing in
      patients with tennis elbow.
