    
      A three group, single blinded, randomised trial was designed to compare the effects of

        1. aerobic plus active exercise and

        2. aerobic plus resistance exercise to

        3. control group of bone marrow/haemopoietic recipients not recieving exercise.

      The hypotheses being tested is that

        1. Exercise improves the physical performance of transplants recipients.

        2. Exercise improves the quality of life of these patients;

        3. resisted exercise added to aerobic exercise increases muscle strength or lean muscle
           mass and

        4. There are no adverse events during either form of exercise
