    
      This is a randomized, three-sequence, three-period crossover study to assess the
      bioavailability and PK of a single dose of atropine administered sublingually in healthy
      adult volunteers. At least 15 healthy male and female volunteers will be enrolled to obtain
      approximately 12 evaluable subjects in the per protocol population. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of three treatment dosing sequences (A, B, or C).
