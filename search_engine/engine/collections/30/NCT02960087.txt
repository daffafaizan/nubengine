      cancer. Radiation therapy can be given using machines that are outside the body (called
      "image guided external beam radiation therapy") or by brachytherapy, which is a form of
      radiation therapy where the radiation source is placed directly into the prostate gland near
      the tumour. The standard or usual treatments for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer are
      low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy which involves placing radioactive seeds in the prostate
      which deliver radiation over several months, image guided external beam radiation therapy
      (IGRT), or IGRT plus high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost.

      High Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy is another type of brachytherapy which delivers a high
      dose of radiation to the tumour over a period of minutes. The radiation is delivered under
      computer control through flexible needles, which are temporarily inserted into the prostate.
      This form of radiotherapy targets cancer cells within the prostate gland. HDR brachytherapy
      is another type of radiotherapy for prostate cancer that has the potential to help target
      your cancer more accurately while causing fewer side effects compared with standard radiation
      therapy. HDR brachytherapy is an option for treatment in some hospitals now but the best dose
      of radiation is still unknown. This study is testing a new dose of radiation for HDR
      brachytherapy.
