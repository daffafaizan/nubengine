    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the activity of iron chelation therapy (ICT) with deferasirox, in patients with
      anemia due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Reduction in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements. II. Hematologic improvement.
      III. Change in serum ferritin levels from baseline to the end of the study as measured on a
      monthly basis.

      IV. Safety and tolerability of deferasirox.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Blood and marrow samples will be taken to study erythropoiesis and the impact of iron
      overload on erythropoiesis.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive deferasirox orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment continues for up
      to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
