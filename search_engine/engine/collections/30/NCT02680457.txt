      calculated using the formula for clinical trials of mean differences with an "n" of 6
      patients per group was obtained. Patients between 30 and 65 years of age will be included
      with T2DM, without hyperglycemic drugs, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) 6.5 to 11.0 % and with written
      signature consent. They were assigned randomly by sealed envelope either to received insulin
      Degludec (Novo Nordisk A/S. Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or insulin Glargine (Sanofi-Aventis
      Deutschland GmbH. Frankfurt, Germany) [10 international units (IU) subcutaneous (SC) every 24
      hours for six days], patients who were administered initially insulin Degludec corresponded
      then insulin Glargine and vice versa, with a washout period of 14 days between each
      intervention.

      The clinical findings and laboratory tests included a metabolic profile and biosafety, which
      will be made at baseline. Body weight, body mass index and blood pressure were performed
      during the initial visit, likewise, interstitial glucose concentrations by ambulatory
      continuous glucose monitoring system (GuardianÂ®, Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge), through
      which the mean amplitude of glucose excursions (MAGE) and area under the curve of glucose
      were calculated, which served to assess the glycemic variability. Adverse events and
      adherence to treatment are documented. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U test, Chi2,
      Fisher exact test. It is considered with significance at p <0.05.
