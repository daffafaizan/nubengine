      clobazam is the only 1, 5-benzodiazepine that is currently approved for clinical use in the
      United States. In previous clinical trials clobazam has been shown to have a greater efficacy
      and produce fewer side effects in individuals when it's adverse event profile is compared to
      the traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam. As a
      benzodiazepine, clobazam has been found to have anticonvulsant properties, and structural
      differences as a 1,5-benzodiazepines that appear to have a broader spectrum of anticonvulsant
      activity than those found in 1,4-benzodiazepines. In previous reports, clobazam has been seen
      to be effective in ether terminating or reducing both EPC in particular and partial status
      epilepticus.
