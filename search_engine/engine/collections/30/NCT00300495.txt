      develop atrial fibrillation require additional treatment and are more likely to stay in the
      hospital for longer period of time increasing the costs associated with the operation.

      We propose a study to see if oral amiodarone given for one week before surgery can prevent
      atrial fibrillation after pulmonary resection. We plan to evaluate the incidence of atrial
      fibrillation in patients who received preoperative amiodarone and compare them to the
      incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients who did not received preoperative amiodarone.
