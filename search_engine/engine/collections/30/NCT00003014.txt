      with adjuvant radiotherapy vs carboplatin. II. Compare quality of life of patients before and
      after treatment with these regimens. III. Compare the acute and intermediate (1-2 year) side
      effects of these regimens in these patients. IV. Determine the incidence of late side effects
      (such as bowel dysfunction) of treatment and second malignancies in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive a single dose of carboplatin IV. Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy once
      daily, 5 days a week. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1
      year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 800 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
