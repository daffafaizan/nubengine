    
      This is a retrospective cross-sectional observational study to characterize the clinical and
      epidemiological profile of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) 5q types II and III,
      in follow-up at the Brazilian Unified Public Health System (SUS). This study aims to provide
      baseline data, which in the future may be used by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MS) to
      assess the effectiveness of nusinersen. The clinical and epidemiological data will be
      collected from patients´ medical records, such as the score for the Hammersmith Functional
      Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) and the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) at baseline, the WHO
      motor milestones at baseline, disease duration, age at the time of disease diagnosis, age at
      the time of disease screening, SMN2 (gene copy number), history of hospitalizations, history
      and characterization of previous surgical procedures, treatment dosage used, patient
      caregiver´s profile (ie, a family member or companion, who is responsible for taking care of
      the patient for most of the time). Other variables of interest that will also be collected
      are patient´s age and gender, geographic distribution, attending physician expertise and care
      structure where the patients were treated. The data acquisition will be performed using a
      paper and eletronic CRF (Case report Form). Written informed consent will be obtained from
      patients who meet the study elegibility criteria. The study will be performed in Brazilian
      public hospitals (centers) that are able to provide the treatment with nusinersen under the
      SUS scope. The total sample of patients and number of participating centers will be defined
      by the MS - SCTIE (Secretariat of Science, Technology and Strategic Supplies)/ DECIT
      (Department of Science and Technology). However, the initial estimation is a sample of 100
      patients to be included in 10-15 centers.
