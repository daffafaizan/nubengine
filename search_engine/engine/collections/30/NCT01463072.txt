      I. To evaluate the tolerability (grade 2-5 toxicity, neuropathy grade 2 or higher, need for
      dose reductions, or delays) of weekly nab-paclitaxel in older adults with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (response and time to progression) of weekly nab-paclitaxel in
      older adults with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer using a stratification factor
      based on patient age (at least 5 patients age 75 years or older and no more than 15 patients
      age 65-70 years).

      II. To explore predictors of the need for dose reduction, dose delays, or grade 2-5 toxicity
      and neuropathy grade 2 or higher based on a cancer-specific geriatric assessment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
