           an gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) and external beam radiation

        -  Correlative imaging and tissue biopsy analysis will be performed to assess the
           radiographic response to enzalutamide plus gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH)
           therapy as well as intratumoral androgen signaling
