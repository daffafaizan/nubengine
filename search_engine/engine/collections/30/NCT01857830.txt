    
      There are 3 parts to this research study, Part A, B, and C.

      In Part A, participants complete a brief online questionnaire sent to them via email by the
      study coordinator.

      During Part B of the study, participants stay at La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, CA for 6 nights
      and participate in a meditation retreat being held at the resort, or stay at the resort
      without participating in the retreat. During their stay, participants attend two in-person
      research assessments throughout the week. Assessments will be 4 days (96 hours) apart for all
      participants and will include a fasting blood draw, body measurements, and self-report
      questionnaires.

      Part C of the study includes a brief online questionnaire that is completed 1 month after
      participants leave La Costa Resort.

      This study includes 3 groups: a group of "novice meditators" from the greater San Diego
      Region that are randomized into either the 1) Relaxation (Control) group or 2) Retreat group.
      The third group is comprised of self-selected "experienced meditators" who are already
      enrolled in the retreat. In total, 99 participants were recruited for this study.

      The Retreat group stays at La Costa Resort and attends a 6 day meditation retreat
      intervention as well as completes all research study assessments and questionnaires.

      The Relaxation (Control) group stays at La Costa Resort for 6 nights, but does not attend the
      meditation retreat. They attend once daily lectures on science topics and complete all
      research study assessments and questionnaires.

      The Experienced Retreat group participants have an ongoing meditation practice and have
      enrolled themselves in the April 2013 meditation retreat. All of the Experienced meditators
      attend the meditation retreat and complete all research study assessments and questionnaires.
