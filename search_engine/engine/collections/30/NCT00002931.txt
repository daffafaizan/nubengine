        -  Estimate the antitumor activity of 2 courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin regimens with
           autologous stem cell rescue in patients with relapsed germ cell cancer.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects of paclitaxel, carboplatin and etoposide (VP-16) with stem
           cell support followed by paclitaxel, carboplatin and ifosfamide with stem cell support
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC or IV 4 days prior to peripheral blood stem
      cells (PBSC) apheresis. Autologous bone marrow harvest is performed when adequate stem cells
      cannot be collected.

      Patients then receive course 1 of high-dose chemotherapy beginning on day -7 with paclitaxel
      IV over 24 hours. On days -6 to -4, patients receive etoposide IV over 2 hours and
      carboplatin (CBDCA) IV over 30 minutes 3 times daily. Following a 2 or 3 week recovery, a
      second course of chemotherapy begins on day -7, consisting of paclitaxel IV over 24 hours,
      then CBDCA and ifosfamide on days -6 to -4.

      Reinfusion of PBSC and marrow begins on day -2 in both course 1 and 2. In addition, G-CSF IV
      is given twice a day until 3 consecutive postnadir days of granulocytes of at least 1000/mm^3
      are maintained. On day 0, stem cells with or without bone marrow product are again
      administered.

      Surgery may be performed after course 2 if indicated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The expected accrual rate is 12 patients per year over 2 years.
