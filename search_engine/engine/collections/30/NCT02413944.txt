      clinical suspicion of hypoadrenalism, or any active medical condition or treatment that might
      alter blood cortisol levels. Pregnant women and patients whose medical or mental condition
      precludes obtaining informed consent will be excluded.

      In the morning of the first visit, 1 mcg of ACTH1-24 will be injected directly into a
      peripheral vein. Blood and salivary samples will be drawn before injection, and 30 minutes
      after. Salivary cortisol will be drawn also 60 minutes after injection. At least two days
      later, in the morning of the second visit, 1 mcg of ACTH1-24 will be injected through short
      cannula in a peripheral vein, followed by injection of 5 ml of normal saline. Blood and
      salivary samples will be drawn before injection, and 30 minutes after. Salivary cortisol will
      be drawn also 60 minutes after injection. Blood cortisol results and salivary free cortisol
      results will be compared between tests.
