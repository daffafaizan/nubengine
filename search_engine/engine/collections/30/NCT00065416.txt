      leading reason for using complementary or alternative medical (CAM) therapies. Therapeutic
      massage is one of the most popular CAM treatments for neck pain, but little is known about
      its effectiveness. This study will lay the groundwork for a full-scale trial that evaluates
      the effectiveness of therapeutic massage for chronic neck pain.

      The study will involve two phases. During Phase I, researchers will develop and pre-test key
      components for a randomized clinical trial. In Phase II, the safety and efficacy of massage
      for CNP will be evaluated. The changes in symptoms, function, and quality of life in massage
      and self care groups will be evaluated midway through treatment, at the end of treatment and
      at 6 months post randomization.
