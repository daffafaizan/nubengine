      sensorimotor function. The purpose of this study is to investigate acute effects of foam
      rolling with healthy participants. Study group will receive foam rolling exercise actively by
      themselves on elbow.

      Foam rolling exercise will be applied 10 times each for 1 minute. These exercise will be
      performed as 2 sets. After each set will be a resting period for 30 seconds. A total of 1
      session will be performed. Second evaluation will be performed after exercise at the same
      day. Control group will receive no foam rolling exercise. They will be handed a brochure
      about the proprioception and its role in injury prevention and foam rolling. Control group
      will be evaluated for the first time. Afterwards, second evaluation will be performed after
      resting period (2 minutes) at the same day.
