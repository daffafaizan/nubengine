      I. Determine the 1-year treatment failure rate in patients with inoperable locoregionally
      advanced or metastatic medullary or differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated with
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (tanespimycin).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. Determine the 1-year
      progression-free rate in patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the time to treatment failure and time to subsequent therapy in patients
      treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of patients treated with
      this drug.

      V. Correlate the incidence rate of RAS, RAF, and RET mutations with clinical outcome in
      patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type of thyroid
      carcinoma (medullary vs differentiated).

      Patients receive tanespimycin intravenously (IV) over 2-6 hours on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years from study entry.
