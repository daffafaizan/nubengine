      kidneys . It gives a useful information in several conditions such as evaluating unilateral
      renal disorders, assessing individual kidney function before and after intervention, and
      before live donor nephrectomy. Different radiopharmaceuticals such as technetium-99m
      dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA), technetium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaaceticacid
      (99mTc-DTPA), technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3), Iodine 131
      orthoiodohippurate and more recently technetium-99 m ethylenedicysteine (99mTc-EC) were used,
      However, 99mTc-DMSA as a static renal agent is considered the most reliable method to measure
      relative renal function and the most appropriate tracer for renal cortical imaging . In some
      papers, it is emphasized that relative renal function calculated with 99mTc-DTPA is as
      reliable as 99mTc-DMSA .â€¬ The investigators design the study to evaluate the difference in
      estimation of split renal function using the available two radiopharmaceuticals: Tc-99m DTPA
      and Tc-99m DMSA.
