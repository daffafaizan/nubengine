      DTI is used primarily for assessing white matter of the brain and spinal cord. DTI can depict
      alterations to the white matter tract and quantify these changes. Disturbances of diffusion
      (restriction or increase) may be assessed quantitatively by measurements of apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), is used to measure
      diffusive strength. Diffusion anisotropy can be assessed quantitatively by using the
      fractional anisotropy (FA) parameter, which may be also visualized on fractional anisotropy
      maps. FA is considered as a marker of white matter integrity.

      Image acquisition will be conducted on a 1.5-Tesla MR scanner.

      The imaging will be done throughout the following sequences:

        1. Conventional MRI sequences: sagittal T1W, sagittal and axial T2W sequences.

        2. DTI sequence: Single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) and parallel imaging
           techniques to achieve motion-free and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) DTI.

      Post processing:

      The diffusion-tensor imaging data is transferred to an offline workstation utilizing software
      used for reconstruction of the Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI) with regions of interest were
      defined and measured on the ADC and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. diffusion tensor
      tractogram will be constructed on the acquired data source.
