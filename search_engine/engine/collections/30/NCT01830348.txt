      healing less than 30% will be eligible for randomization, providing they meet all other
      inclusion criteria. Four weeks of blinded "treatment" follows the screening period, and an
      observation period of six weeks (to 10 weeks post first treatment) follows the 4-week
      treatment period. If the ulcer closes during the treatment or observation period, the closure
      will be confirmed two weeks later, and at this time the subject enters a durability
      assessment period of up to 12 weeks.

      All aspects of Standard of Care are followed throughout the study period.
