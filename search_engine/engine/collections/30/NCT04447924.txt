    
      This trial is a single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-armed,
      parallel-group trial in healthy volunteers aged 18 - 40 years. The trial will investigate the
      effect of daily intake of the probiotic strain Bif195 or placebo when co-administered to
      daily intake of 800mg of Ibuprofen.

      The trial includes a run-in period of two weeks duration followed by a six weeks intervention
      period where Bif195/placebo and Ibuprofen is co-administered.

      Subjects will participate in the trial for a total duration of 8 weeks including the run-in
      phase. Besides the screening visit, the trial will consist of 5 visits.

      After having given their written informed consent, subjects will complete the screening
      procedures to evaluate their eligibility for participation in the trial and complete a run-in
      period of two weeks duration to washout possible pre-trial probiotics and/or use of
      medication. After baseline assessments at Visit 2, subjects will start daily intake of 800mg
      of Ibuprofen and also be randomly assigned to 6-weeks daily intake of Bif195 or placebo
      product in a ratio of 1:1.
