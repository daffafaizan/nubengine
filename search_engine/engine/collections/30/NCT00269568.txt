    
      This is a multicenter, randomized study. 564 healthy women, age 18 years or older, with an
      intrauterine pregnancy, and requesting a medical abortion, will be recruited to participate
      in this prospective clinical trial. This study will provide an evaluation of oral
      mifepristone 200 mg and vaginal misoprostol 800 mcg administered simultaneously in women up
      to 63 days gestation. The aims of the study are to compare the complete abortion rates, at 7
      and 14 days after misoprostol administration, when using mifepristone 200 mg orally and
      misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally are administered simultaneously and 24 hours apart in women up
      to 63 days gestation. Assessment of side effects (nausea, vomiting, pain) as well as
      acceptability will be done using pre and post-study questionnaires, and visual analogue
      scales. Complete abortion rate within 24 hours is expected to be 90%.
