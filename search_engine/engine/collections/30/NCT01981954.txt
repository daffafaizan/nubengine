      cord defect), the bladder muscle (detrusor) contracts strongly and without warning (also
      known as neurogenic detrusor overactivity) and the urethra (the passage connecting the
      bladder with outside) does not relax. Though these children cannot void, urine leakage can
      happen when the overactive contractions are strong, and/or the pressure in the bladder is so
      high that it overcomes the closed urethra (overflow at high filling bladder pressure). This
      high bladder pressure puts these children at risk for kidney damage and can decrease the
      quality of the bladder. Therapy was aimed to decrease the high filling bladder pressure and
      the overactive detrusor contractions.
