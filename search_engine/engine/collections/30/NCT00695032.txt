      Primary

        -  Identify and evaluate the early biomarkers of renal toxicity in patients with solid
           tumors treated with cisplatin and ifosfamide.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the modification of biomarker studies and blood concentrations of cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive standard chemotherapy comprising cisplatin and/or ifosfamide.

      Blood and urine samples are collected on days 1 and 2 (or day 3 if receiving ifosfamide only)
      during the first 3 courses. Samples are analyzed to determine plasma concentrations of
      residual cisplatin and to obtain urinary-protein profiles to measure renal toxicity.
