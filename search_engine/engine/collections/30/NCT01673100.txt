      especially critical for previously sedentary individuals who have undergone percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Changing behavior to adopt and maintain recommended
      physical activity levels in this population is difficult. Interventions to accomplish
      behavior change will not work unless they can be adopted into a person's busy lifestyle. This
      proposed study fills a gap by testing the feasibility of an innovative, targeted intervention
      (Physical Activity Promotion Telehealth Intervention), delivered by a practical and feasible
      platform (cell phone). The asynchronous targeted daily interaction will consist of 5-6 text,
      picture, and/or video messages delivered to the subject's cell phone each day. Upon
      successful completion of this study, it is believed that these feasibility findings will
      provide a foundation for the testing of a larger clinical trial to promote physical activity
      in this population.
