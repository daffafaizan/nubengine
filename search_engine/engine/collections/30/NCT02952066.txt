      dedicated bronchoscopy suite located on third floor of Pavilion H module room #2, and will be
      performed only once as part of a standard of care bronchoscopy procedure scheduled by the
      participants pulmonary physician. This entire study (biopsy) will add 10 minutes or less.
      Following the biopsy, and after being discharged from the hospital, the participant's study
      participation will end.

      Bronchial Biopsy: The investigator will collect five lung (bronchial) specimens (1-2 cubic
      millimeters each) from three zones of the participant's airway which will be individually
      coded, and stored for the computer image analysis of TRPV1 in the investigator's laboratory.
      Following analysis the samples will be destroyed. The results of the analysis cannot be used
      for determining a clinical diagnosis. Therefore, the investigator will not provide any
      findings to either the participant or their physician.

      Participants will not get any personal benefit from taking part in this study. Their
      willingness to take part in this research study, may, in the future help doctors better
      understand and/or treat patients with asthma.

      There will be no cost to the participant for having the bronchial biopsy performed.

      Participants will not receive any rewards or payment for taking part in the study.
