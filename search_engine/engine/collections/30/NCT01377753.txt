        -  Pilot study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of thermal laser ablation
           of focal prostate tumors.

        -  Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors
           estimated at 2 to 4 years.

        -  Some prostate cancers prove to be small, low grade, and noninvasive and they appear to
           pose little risk to the life or health of the host. Recent patient series suggest that
           20% to 30% of men undergoing radical prostatectomy have pathologic features in the
           radical prostatectomy specimen consistent with an insignificant or indolent cancer which
           poses little threat to life or health.

        -  We propose that patients with low volume and low grade disease can be best served with
           focal ablation of the visible prostate cancer without the side effects of urinary
           incontinence and erectile dysfunction associated with radiation therapy or radical
           surgery.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      -To determine feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance image-guided focal laser ablation
      of biopsy confirmed and MR visible prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Greater than 18 years of age

        -  Organ confined prostate cancer, observed on MR, and confirmed by Transrectal biopsy

        -  Preoperative workup as dictated by the NCCN.org prostate cancer guidelines

        -  PSA < 15 ng or PSA density < 0.15 ng/ml in patients with a PSA > 15 ng

      Design:

        -  Pilot study, testing feasibility, safety and tolerability of thermal ablation of focal
           prostate cancer

        -  It is anticipated that 15 patients will be accrued for this study
