      Once eligible candidates had undergone PCI, they were admitted to the coronary intensive care
      unit and received standard treatment according to the institutional protocol based on
      American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology
      guidelines.20 Simultaneously, patients were randomized assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      Danlou tablets (4.5 g oral dose taken once daily) or matching placebo for 90 days according
      to a computer-generated site-stratified, block randomization schedule. Danlou tablets were
      approved by China Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ischemic heart disease in
