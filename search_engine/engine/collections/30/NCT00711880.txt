      study to evaluate the efficacy of SativexÂ®. Subjects with peripheral neuropathic pain
      characterised by allodynia, were screened to determine eligibility and entered a seven day
      baseline period. Subjects then returned to the centre for randomisation and dose
      introduction, and received either placebo or Sativex in a double blind manner for five weeks,
      with a follow up visit 7 to 10 days after the end of the treatment period. The primary
      efficacy measure was the difference in pain severity at the end of treatment, measured using
      a peripheral neuropathic pain 0 to 10 numerical rating scale.
