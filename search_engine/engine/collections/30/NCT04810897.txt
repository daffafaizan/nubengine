      the automatic postural adjustments and axial movements that accompany simple activities, such
      as supine to standing, getting up from sitting or turning over in bed. The present study is
      designed to allow patients and their relatives to perform exercises by themselves
      conveniently at home. The results were considered a vital component of a complex intervention
      and were played an integral part in the implementation process of exercises in functional
      performance. Furthermore, this study will prove sufficient high-quality evidence to
      investigate whether improvements in function due to exercise-based rehabilitation are
      associated with reducing axial rigidity in individuals with PD.

      Currently, there is a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of home-based exercise programs
      in PD patients in Thailand. For the present study, we devised a home-based 10-week exercise
      program focusing on segmental rotation and task-specific movements for turning practice to
      determine effects on axial mobility and turning. The aimed of this study to examine the
      effects of a 10-week task specific home-based exercise program on turning kinematics, gait
      and stepping characteristics, the Functional Reach test (FRT), the Unified Parkinson's
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Freezing of Gait questionnaire (FOG) and the Fall Efficacy
      Scale International (FES-I) in individuals with PD.
