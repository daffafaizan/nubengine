      stress disorder (PTSD) outcomes for veterans receiving exposure therapy via telemedicine
      versus in-person care. Specifically, prolonged exposure therapy (PE) was conducted with
      veterans individually, either in person or via videoconferencing technology. PE is designed
      to help clients face fears related to a traumatic experience by guiding individuals through
      exposures to the memory of the event (called "imaginal exposure") and exposures to feared
      situations (called "in vivo" exposures).

      The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of whether telemedicine can be used as a tool
      to extend effective, specialized mental health services, such as PE to veterans with limited
      access to care. This is measured in part through patient and therapist satisfaction ratings
      in each condition.

      A secondary aim is to determine if therapy delivered by telemedicine affects the quality of
      care in terms of clinical outcomes and the quality of patient-therapist interaction. This is
      measured by relative changes in symptoms, primarily in PTSD, depressive symptoms, and anxiety
      symptoms.

      A tertiary aim is to examine whether results from neuropsychological testing predict
      treatment outcomes across conditions. This includes seven measures of executive functioning.
      The hypothesis is that poorer performance on these measures may be associated with less
      improvement on measures of symptom severity.
