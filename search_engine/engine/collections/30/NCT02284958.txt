        1. To determine perceived levels of disability and baseline levels of walking activity in a
           sample of those with chronic low back pain (CLBP)

        2. To determine the uptake and adherence to a pedometer-driven walking program for people
           with CLBP

        3. To test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a walking programme to improve outcomes
           for CLBP compared to a standardized back care education package

        4. To test the feasibility of a walking programme in a sub-sample of rural Saskatchewan
           farmers/agricultural workers.
