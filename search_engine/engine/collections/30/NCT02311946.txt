      each of the six cohorts of 10 healthy subjects. Each cohort will receive two treatments in a
      fixed-sequence. In Period 1, all subjects will receive a single 125mg dose of palbociclib
      alone and undergo serial pharmacokinetic blood sampling for up to 120 hours post-dose. In
      Period 2, all subjects will receive daily 40mg doses of Rabeprazole for 7 consecutive days,
      and approximately 4 hours after the Day 7 rabeprazole dose each subject will receive a single
      125mg dose of palbociclib. Subjects will undergo serial pharmacokinetic blood sampling up to
      120 hours post-dose.
