      injection of colloidal rhenium sulphur and technetium (0.4 ml, 20 MBq of Nanocis®; CIS Bio
      International, France) at the four cardinal points in the subareolar area. Lymphoscintigraphy
      will be obtained 3 hours after the injection. Immediately before surgery, the axillary
      drainage will be checked using the CarolIReS camera (FOV 10x10 cm²). During surgery, the
      search for radioactive nodes will be performed using the CarolIReS probe. In order to
      evaluate the CarolIReS camera sensitivity, the activity of the removed SLNs will be measured
      immediately after their resection by a gamma ray counter and they will then be submitted to
      pathological analysis with frozen section.

      immediately after their resection by a gamma ray counter and they will then be submitted to
      pathological analysis with frozen section. After SLN removal and during the pathological
      analysis, the axillary area will once again be checked using the CarolIReS camera (followed
      by a further surgical excision in the case of remaining SLNs).

      When the pathological analysis will diagnose a metastatic SLN, complete axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND) will immediately be performed. In the case of negative SLN, serial sections
      and detection of cytokeratine (AE1/AE3; Dako, Zymed, CA, USA) will be performed during
      standard pathological analysis. Macrometastases will be defined as clusters of cancer cells
      ≥2 mm, micrometastases as clusters of cancer cells ≥0.2 mm and <2 mm, and isolated cancer
      cells as clusters of cancer cells <0.2 mm. ALND will be performed in cases of macro- or
      micrometastases.
