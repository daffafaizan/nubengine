    
      Collection of:

        -  subcutaneous adipose tissue of term infants and preterms after birth and at term during
           a clinically indicated operation.

        -  blood before the operation.

      Measurement of the fatty acid composition (especially arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic
      acid) in subcutaneous adipose tissue and blood.

      Aim is to compare the composition of the fatty acids in blood and adipose tissue of preterms
      at term and term infants. To calculate the fatty acid value in each infant the proportion of
      adipose tissue is determined with PEAPOD before discharge from hospital.
