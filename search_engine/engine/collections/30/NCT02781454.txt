      neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking.
      Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades
      for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in
      diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons following
      spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking excitotoxicity. Based on
      previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central nervous system at
      concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent unpublished studies in the
      laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts have also demonstrated that
      mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express high levels of mutant
      cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs survival in these
      animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic agent, much is known
      about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We anticipate that by
      excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the known neuroprotectant
      properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further study in an ALS
      clinical trial.
