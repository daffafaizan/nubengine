      patients with unipolar depression receiving TMS. Patients will be scanned before and after a
      full course of TMS and clinical measures for depression severity and memory will be obtained
      at the same times.The project has the following aims and hypothesis: (1) to determine the
      therapeutic antidepressant mechanism of action of TMS at the circuit level (2) to study the
      use of fcMRI as a state biomarker for depression (3) to study the use of fcMRI as a predictor
      of response for depression.
