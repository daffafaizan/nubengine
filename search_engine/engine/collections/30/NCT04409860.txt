           To compare response rate and survivals of locally advanced stage cervical cancer
           patients with residual lesions who had CCRT alone to those who had adjuvant chemotherapy
           after CCRT.

        2. Patients:

             1. Cervical cancer stage IIb to IVa with a histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma,
                adenosquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma

             2. Complete CCRT(Radiation Does: A point 85Gy(+/-10%)，B点50Gy(+/-10%)，concurrent
                paclitaxel and cisplatin once a week for six cycles)

             3. MRI is performed within 4 weeks after CCRT and shows residual lesions (non-lymph
                node≥10mm，lymph node shortest diameter≥15mm).

        3. Methods:

      The patients who have residual lesions after CCRT are randomized to arm A by observation or
      arm B by adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.
