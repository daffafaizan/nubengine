      landmarks including spinous processes, laminae, and intervertebral interspaces prior to the
      initial needle placement and compare this to standard palpation of the bony thoracic spine
      for thoracic epidural placement. The investigators will evaluate and compare the two needle
      localization techniques by the following outcomes: time to identify the epidural space by
      loss of resistance, needle passes, skin punctures, recovery room pain scores, and epidural
      success.
