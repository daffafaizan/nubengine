      combined prospective and retrospective arm. Pregnant women who underwent diagnostic imaging
      to evaluate for suspected PE at our institution were prospectively enrolled from February
      2014 to August 2015. Both d-dimer and BNP serum levels were drawn, and a MWS was assigned.
      All pregnant women diagnosed with a PE that underwent diagnostic imaging and had a d-dimer
      level drawn from January 2009 to June 2014 were retrospectively enrolled. Patient electronic
      records were used to apply the MWS and analyze their risk.
