      usual dosages. The study will determine whether a shorter duration of immunosuppression will
      permit the donor cells to be effective against the cancer without causing more severe GVHD
      (Graft Versus Host Disease). Also to be determined is whether the patient's cancer can be
      prevented from relapsing after blood stem cell transplant by using prophylactic treatment,
      giving a donor leukocyte infusion BEFORE a relapse happens.

      In this research study samples of blood and bone marrow will be analyzed. These samples will
      be examined to study the cellular production of inflammatory cytokine levels in attempt to be
      able to predict which patients will have complications like GVHD or relapse.
