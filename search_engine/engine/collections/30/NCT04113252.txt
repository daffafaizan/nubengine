      study participants were not hospitalized at discharge, the study team will begin that
      standard of pain management at the participant's first outpatient clinic visit. Study
      participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups. All groups will receive a gift card if
      participants return the completed medication diary to the study team.

        -  Group 1 will complete a medication diary. Also, group 1 will be encouraged to return any
           unused tablets to the study clinic.

        -  Group 2 will be asked to complete a medication diary. Group 2 will also have a 50/50
           chance of receiving money for each unused opioid tablet returned to the study clinic.

        -  Group 3 will be the same as group 2 except in addition, they will be given a coaching
           session about the use of pain medication and a simple way that may help participants use
           less opioid pain medication.
