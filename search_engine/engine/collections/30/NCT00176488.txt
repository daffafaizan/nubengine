        -  Assess the efficacy of sequential use of epirubicin hydrochloride followed by
           vinorelbine ditartrate in patients with stage IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IV breast cancer.

        -  Measure the biological response to this regimen in sequential tumor biopsies and
           peripheral mononuclear cells from these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor response with changes in the gene expression of microtubule-associated
           protein 4.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1 and vinorelbine ditartrate IV
      over 6-10 minutes on days 3 and 17. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously
      on days 4-14 or pegfilgrastim IV on day 4.

      For patients with stage IIB (T3, N0), IIIA, or IIIB disease, treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. For
      patients with stage IV disease, treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and after course 1 for research studies. Patients
      with accessible tumor for biopsy undergo sequential biopsies and core needle biopsies at
      baseline and after course 1. Tumor tissue samples are used for determination of p53 status by
      western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and DNA sequencing. Microtubule-associated
      protein 4, p53, and p21/WAF1 expression is analyzed by western blotting.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.
