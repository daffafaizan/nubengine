      fibrosis and interstitial lung disease among a cohort of adult patients after complicated
      pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in two groups: in a group of patients who were
      prescribed LongidazeÂ® for treatment or prevention as part of routine clinical practice, and
      in the group of patients who underwent dynamic observation.
