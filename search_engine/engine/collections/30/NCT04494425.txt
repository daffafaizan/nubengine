      previous lines of endocrine therapies given for the treatment of metastatic disease. All
      patients must have historically confirmed HR positive (either estrogen receptor and/or
      progesterone receptor positive), HER2-low (defined as IHC2+/ISH- and IHC 1+) or HER2 IHC >0
      <1+ expression, as determined by central laboratory testing results, advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer.

      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of trastuzumab deruxtecan
      compared with investigator's choice chemotherapy. This study aims to see if trastuzumab
      deruxtecan allows patients to live longer without the cancer getting worse, or simply to live
      longer, compared to patients receiving standard of care chemotherapy. This study is also
      looking to see how the treatment and the cancer affects patients' quality of life.
