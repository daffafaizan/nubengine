      fatigue, and an impaired physical performance including a reduced work capacity.

      To perform ordinary daily activities many elderly people exert close to their maximum
      physical capacity, and even a small reduction of performance capacity may cause significant
      impairment in physical and social activity. Postoperative decline in strength and work
      capacity may thus cause previously independent living persons to become dependent upon
      assistance from others. Hence, it is important to avoid the postoperative reduction of
      physical performance and to minimize postoperative fatigue.

      It has been shown that Erythropoietin treatment reduces the need for blood transfusions in
      patients undergoing planned colonic surgery. However, the effect of Erythropoietin treatment
      upon postoperative rehabilitation has not yet been studied.

      Therefore the main hypothesis in this study is that perioperative treatment with Darbepoetin
      Alfa would improve the physical capacity in aspects by reducing postoperative fatigue and
      improve work capacity, balance and quality of life compared to placebo treatment.
      Furthermore, the researchers expect Darbepoetin treated patients to have fewer perioperative
      complications and less need for blood transfusions.
