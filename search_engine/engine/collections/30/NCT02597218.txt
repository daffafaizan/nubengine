    
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease that includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
      pulmonary embolism (PE). It is a common, potentially lethal disorder that can occur among
      postoperative patients. Liver surgery implies a prothrombotic state, as a result of an
      alteration of the equilibrium between synthesis and use of pro and anti coagulant factors
      after a parenquimal resection. The use of antithrombotic prophylaxis following surgery is not
      standarized, and current practices vary depending on the attendant surgeon's particular
      experience or hospital's customs and habits.

      In published research, postoperative patients have been studied as a whole so far. There is
      little evidence regarding patients undergoing hepatectomy. Furthermore, the use and need of
      extended prophylaxis remains unexplored in this group of patients.

      The objetives of the following study are:

        -  To estimate the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) [deep vein
           thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and fatal PE] in a third level center in
           patients undergoing any hepatectomy within 90 days after surgery.

        -  To estimate the incidence of portal thrombosis (PT) in a third level center in patients
           undergoing any hepatectomy within 90 days after surgery.

        -  To identify and describe factors associated to the development of VTE in patients
           following hepatectomy.

        -  To identify and describe factors associated to the development of PT in patients
           following hepatectomy.

        -  To describe major bleedings or minor but clinically relevant bleedings during the period
           in which those patients received chemical thromboprophylaxis.
