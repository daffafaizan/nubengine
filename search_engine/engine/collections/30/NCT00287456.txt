      diabetes and has been proven to be more effective in blood glucose control than subcutaneous
      injections. However, the pump has not been utilized for CF related diabetes. The insulin pump
      is connected to the patient via a small plastic catheter. The catheter is inserted with a 24
      gauge needle (in a fashion similar to an IV catheter) just under the skin. The catheter is
      then changed every three days. The patient wearing the pump may then give himself or herself
      a "bolus dose" of insulin every time he or she eats, without needing to give a shot. A
      further advantage of the pump is that a very low dose of basal insulin may be given
      throughout the day. This low dose of insulin mimics the normal pancreas and may be especially
      advantageous for the insulin deficient CF patient. It is likely that bolus dosing will
      improve high HGP and will be more effective than subcutaneous insulin. Furthermore,
      continuous basal insulin will likely improve protein catabolism.

      This is a pilot study to determine efficacy of the insulin pump. Each subject will be
      provided with the pump and with all materials needed for use with the pump. Each patient will
      also be provided with a glucose meter and test strips. He/she will be asked to wear the pump
      for six months and to check his/her blood sugar levels three to four times per day. Prior to
      the pump placement and at the end of six months, each patient will undergo the following
      measurements: 1) whole body protein turnover using the stable isotope [1-13C] leucine; 2)
      DEXA scan for measurement of lean body mass; 3) anthropometric measurements; 4) Hemoglobin
      A1c.
