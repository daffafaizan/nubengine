      motor function. However, this evidence is largely limited to noradrenaline and dopamine, with
      little evidence to support a similar effect for serotonin. What remains to be tested
      therefore, is whether acute serotonergic administration induces neural or behavioral changes
      during motor learning also. Using a sample of 60 female participants (with the possible
      inclusion of male participants at a later date), the investigators aim to test the effects of
      a serotonergic challenge on motor learning and plasticity in healthy participants.
