      malabsorption of fluid, electrolytes, and nutrients. In this randomised, double blinded,
      crossover intervention study we aim to investigate how different protein sources affect
      intestinal absorption in patients with an ileostomy and intestinal insufficiency. Three oral
      solutions with different protein sources (hydrolysed whey, whey, and casein) will be
      administered in three different four-week intervention periods. The results will facilitate
      improved counselling and treatment of patients with an ileostomy.
