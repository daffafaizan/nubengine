      experience in performing robotic pancreatoduodenectomy in high-volume centers. Based on the
      univariate and multivariate analysis, the elevated BMI, ASA 3, the need for venous resection
      and vascular variations in arterial liver supply were considered significant in increasing
      the degree of "difficulty" in the robotic pancreatoduodenectomy. The Robot ADDICT Score will
      be calculated in all cases of the International Consortium on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic
      Surgery (I-MIPS; www.i-mips.com).
