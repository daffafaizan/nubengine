      include patients with MS who 0-5.5 according to the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
      and between 18-65 years. The patient will be randomized into a combined training group and a
      control group. The patients in the control group will not apply an exercise training. The
      combined exercise training group will be given combined exercise training, consisting of
      Pilates and aerobic exercise, three times during 8 weeks. Both groups will be reevaluated 8
      weeks after the initial assessment.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
      IL, USA). The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the
      Wilcoxon Test. The significance level was set at p< 0.05.
