    
      Patients with active plaque psoriasis will be withdrawn from systemic and topical
      medications. After washout, we will select active psoriatic lesions of at least 25 square cm
      in size to receive either placebo ointment or a proprietary ointment containing PTH for 8
      weeks. We will see the patients every 2 weeks. We will evaluate the lesions by examination
      and digital photography at each visit and measure parameters of calcium metabolism
      periodically during the 8 weeks.

      At the conclusion of the 8 weeks, we will obtain punch biopsies from the treated lesions and
      from one lesion without treatment. If the patients elect, we will transition them into an
      open label trial with the PTH ointment including up to 1000 square cm of psoriatic lesions
      and monitor them for duration of effect and changes in parameters of calcium metabolism.
