      Universiteit Brussel performs exercise tests in both trained and untrained populations. The
      aim of the maximal effort test is to evaluate endurance capacity and provide recommendations
      to monitor training load. Until now, this is done by objective parameters such as heart rate,
      speed, time, power, etcetera. Researchers already presented a method to quantify training
      intensity distribution in elite endurance athletes based on the rating of perceived exertion.
      However, during pilot testing and everyday experience, these cut-off values are not always
      applicable to each individual athlete, nor are they the same for different sports. Therefore,
      the investigators want to investigate the possible relation between the exercise intensity,
      and objective and subjective parameters. Thereafter, the investigators want to provide
      recommendations to a new way of methodological approach during, and trainings advice after
      maximal effort tests.
