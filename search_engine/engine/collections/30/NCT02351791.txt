    
      Six types of patches are tested:

      Patch 1: Standard adhesive with own feces

      Patch 2: Standard adhesive with own feces mixture

      Patch 3: Standard adhesive with simulated feces

      Patch 4: Standard adhesive with simulated feces mixture

      Patch 5: Standard adhesive with buffer (control)

      Patch 6: Standard adhesive with buffer feces mixture (control)

      Each subject is randomized to one of two arms testing three patches on the peristomal skin
      (patch 1, 3 and 5 or patch 2, 4 and 6). Furthermore, within each arm an attempt will be made
      to randomize each of the three patches on the peristomal skin to one of three locations
      surrounding the stoma (upper left, upper right, lower).
