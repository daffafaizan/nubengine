      majority of these tumors are inoperable by virtue of adjacent organ infiltration. In this
      study, inoperable gallbladder and pancreatic cancer patients will be treated with high
      precision radiotherapy using Tomotherapy delivering higher dose of radiation along with
      chemotherapy. It is expected that this high dose precise radiotherapy along with chemotherapy
      will lead to good symptom relief and make some of these tumors operable.
