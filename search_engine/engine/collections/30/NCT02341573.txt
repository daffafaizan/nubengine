      health of children. It's urgent to explore effective ways to alleviate the pain caused by
      asthma.

      In our research, 160 asthmatic children are randomly divided into a Chinese medication group
      (80 cases) and a Western medication control group(80 cases). Patients in the Chinese
      medication group are treated with a series of experienced chinese herbal formulas, whereas
      the western medication control group received a leukotriene receptor antagonist and a
      bronchial relaxant. The Chinese medicine syndromes and western medicine symptoms are scored.
      Pulmonary function and asthma control test score will be applied in this study. We evaluate
      the situation of asthma from different aspects, including index of pulmonary function and
      score of asthma control test. Real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression levels
      of some inflammatory mediators in peripheral.
