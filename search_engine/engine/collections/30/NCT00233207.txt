    
      BACKGROUND:

      This study will use IC14, a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing CD14,
      to block CD14 medicated cellular activation in patients with sepsis-induced ALI. Research
      results of antibody interaction with CD14 suggest that CD14 has a central role in the
      recognition of bacterial products and the induction of innate immune responses. Although
      beneficial, when this response is combined with a component of alveolar stretch it may induce
      an exaggerated response that can be harmful. This study will implement strategies to block
      CD14-mediated cellular activation and will evaluate whether this strategy has a beneficial
      effect in reducing alveolar inflammatory response, mechanical ventilation days, multiple
      organ failure, and severity of organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis-induced ALI.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The primary outcome of this study will be alveolar lavage concentrations of interleukin-8
      that will be measured post-treatment at Days 2 and 3, and Days 6 to 8.

      The key secondary outcomes of this study will be: 1) Worst Murray Lung Injury Score (measured
      at Days 1 through 7, and Day 28); 2) Worst Multiple Organ Dysfunction (MOD) Score (Marshall)
      (measured at Days 1 through 7, and Day 28); 3) Infections-nosocomial and/or surgical site
      infections (measured at Day 28); 4) Ventilator-free days (measured at Day 28); and 5)
      Mortality (measured at Day 28).
