    
      GTPS, widely known as trochanteric bursitis, encompasses a spectrum of disorders (gluteal
      tendinopathy, tears, bursitis, and ITB syndrome) that are difficult to distinguish by
      clinical exam alone. Better understanding of US imaging characteristics in relation to
      clinical symptoms may be helpful in identifying those patients who would most benefit from
      corticosteroid injections and other non-operative treatment options.

      Point-of-care musculoskeletal US use has been shown to reduce repeated hospital appointments,
      improve accuracy of diagnosis, and provide expedited treatment, thus improving quality of
      care in an outpatient musculoskeletal clinic. US assessment is not routinely included in the
      management of GTPS patients and ideal imaging modalities are not established.
