      health care professionals to detect delirium. The sensitivity and specificity of CAM-ICU was
      91-93% and 89-100% respectively. In addition, it has been translated to many version to
      diagnose deliriums for all over the world. In Thailand, there is no common tool used for
      detecting delirium in ICU. The use of CAM-ICU may be useful in Thai ICU settings.
