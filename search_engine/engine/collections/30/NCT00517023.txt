      the diagnosis and management of syncope.This demonstrated a significant increase in
      successful diagnosis following use of implantable loop recorders. Here there were 442 syncope
      admissions to Eastbourne in 2001. Diagnostic rate was 42%. In addition, time to diagnosis was
      quicker and therefore so was introduction of therapy. This resulted in significant increase
      in time to recurrent syncopal episodes and improved general wellbeing in an unselected
      population with syncope of an unknown cause.

      The "Post-EaSyAS" study evaluated extended (2.5 years) follow up of these patients. The
      "Tis-EaSyAS" study evaluated 3 different tilt protocols with long term ILR follow up
      describing the positive predictive value of tilt testing in unexplained syncope.

      The EaSyAS II study elaborates further the above by using the ILR to avoid hospital admission
      and optimise the use of a falls/syncope clinic, potentially improving cost effective
      diagnosis and management of syncope.

      ILRs will be implanted without patient admission and with follow up in a syncope/falls
      assessment clinic, compared to optimal protocol driven current management.

      The ILR used has capabilities to record and transmit heart rhythm abnormalities to a wireless
      receiver which will then relay the information to the clinician via the internet. It is hoped
      that this will shorten diagnosis times and speed up commencement of treatment for patients,
      and will avoid expensive tests and more expensive hospital admissions.
