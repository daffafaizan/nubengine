      diabetes management intervention in a federally-qualified community health care setting to
      improve multiple clinical and behavioral outcomes. LUNA-D will recruit non-insulin using
      adult type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with two or more chronic diseases. Half will
      be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) arm and half to the Usual Care (UC) arm. The
      SI is an intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a medical
      provider (MP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based
      group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Usual Care is represented by
      passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral
      health and traditional health education. Biological measurements will be taken at baseline,
      3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures,
      medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be
      obtained across the study.
