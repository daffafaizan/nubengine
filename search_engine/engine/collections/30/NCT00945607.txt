      Subjects will be randomized to either the standard of care (SOC) arm or the intervention arm.
      The principle investigators will be blinded to the arm assignment. The intervention utilized
      will be six weekly on-site GRT sessions. In addition, subjects will be provided with a CD
      utilizing a standardized GRT script and music for home use twice daily during the study
      period. During the intervention period, they will also be provided with a diary and required
      to keep a record of date and time of CD utilization at home. The subjects will also be
      required to record their stress level before and after each of the two home sessions. The
      sessions must be at least 4 hours apart.

      The SOC arm will consist of an education session with the nurse or nurse practitioner and
      supportive care / symptom management as needed. This group will also be required to keep a
      daily diary in which they record their stress levels twice daily, at intervals separated by
      at least 4 hours.
