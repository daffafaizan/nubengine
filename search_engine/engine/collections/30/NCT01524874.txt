      on numerous genes, including insulin and androgens. Mounting literature demonstrates
      associations between VitD insufficiency and cancer, diabetes and heart disease. VitD
      insufficiency, defined by concentration of serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD) <33ng/ml
      (82.5 nmol/ml), is common at all latitudes; the prevalence is estimated at ~35% in "healthy"
      populations. VitD testing and replacement is gaining popularity in clinical practice. It is
      not known whether there is a difference in the effect of equivalent doses of emulsified vs.
      non-emulsified cholecalciferol (VitD3) supplementation, reflected by quantitative changes in
      serum 25-OHD. However, clinical observations revealed that in an average of 4.4 months,
      subjects taking 4000 iu daily of the emulsified form of cholecalciferol improved their 25-OHD
      levels by 6.76 ng/mL more than those taking 5,000 iu daily of the non-emulsified form. The
      safety of taking 10,000 IU/day has been confirmed. Taking this dose for 12 weeks should cause
      a robust increase in serum 25-OHD. This study will provide preliminary data comparing three
      high quality VitD3 supplements, one a powdered capsule, one a chewable tablet, and the other
      a lipid-emulsified liquid. Future studies will compare the "better" supplement to
      conventional VitD replacement using VitD2.
