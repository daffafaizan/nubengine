      newborns who are fed by gavage or parenterally, exposure to the nutrient smell that initiates
      digestion disappears. For this reason, it is known that odor stimulation is applied to
      preterm newborns to improve nutrition. It is known that fragrances such as fragrant essential
      oils, the smell of breast milk, and amniotic fluid have positive effects such as shortening
      the transition time to oral feeding in preterm newborns, increasing nutritional tolerance and
      weight gain, increasing hunger symptoms, providing analgesic effect in painful procedures,
      and reducing hospital stay. However, no study was found to jointly evaluate the effect of
      odor stimulation with breast milk on early nutritional cues, transition time to oral
      nutrition and abdominal perfusion in preterm newborns.
