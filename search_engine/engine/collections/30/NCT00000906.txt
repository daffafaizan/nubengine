      of severe pain. In order to use methadone with HIV protease inhibitors correctly, it is
      important to evaluate and quantify interactions between the protease inhibitors and
      methadone.

      Patients receive their usual daily dose of methadone followed with ritonavir and saquinavir,
      respectively, twice a day. Patients are evaluated on Day 4 for safety and tolerance, and
      their ritonavir dose is increased. On Day 8 patients are evaluated for a steady-state level
      of methadone. After 2 weeks of the protease inhibitor therapy, they return for methadone
      pharmacokinetic sampling at Day 15 over 24 hours. Both protease inhibitors and methadone are
      administered on Day 15 on an inpatient basis. On Day 30, patients are assessed for safety and
      tolerance.
