      cancer biology through a direct activity on cancer cells or indirectly through modifications
      in host response (immune system, angiogenesis, nervous system). Alterations occur both
      systemically and locally on the surgical site and is supposed that can affect cancer-related
      outcomes after months or years.

      It is not known whether the action of this short exposure to anesthetics on the host and
      cancer biology is driven by epigenetic alterations in gene and protein expression during the
      immediate to early post-anesthesia period.

      An altered gene and protein expression profile may affect the response of the immune system,
      angiogenesis and the nervous system and induce more or less propitious conditions to tumor
      progression. Data from studies in animals and humans show that gene expression may change in
      the brain and heart after only a short exposure to general anesthesia and that changes may
      persist for several weeks.

      Methods: The GENEXAN is a randomized, controlled, monocentric, genomic trial aiming to test
      the hypothesis that regional (paravertebral) anesthesia, compared to general anesthesia,
      would elicit a differential gene and protein expression pattern in cancer tissue and normal
      surgical microenvironment after breast cancer surgery in women.

      Discussion: This research will serve to map gene and protein expression profile after surgery
      with different anesthetics and elucidate which genes specific to biological systems may
      affect tumor biology in the immediate operative period.

      The findings may also address further research depending on the tissue specificity of the up
      or down-regulated genes.
