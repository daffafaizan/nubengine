      (steroid application, silver nitrate, and betadine). These three treatments are standard of
      care and patients would have been treated with one of them anyway. Patients will be followed
      for an observation period of six weeks with follow-up appointments, per standard of care,
      every two weeks (+/- 3 days) in order for a physician to evaluate if the treatment method is
      working. If during a follow-up visit, the physician determines the treatment method is not
      working, the follow-up period will end and participation in the study will be complete. In
      addition, if a patient is given a different form of treatment during the observation period,
      such as in the emergency department or through their primary care physician, the follow-up
      period will end and participation in the study will be complete.
