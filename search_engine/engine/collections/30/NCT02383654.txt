      treatment in a ALS patient. one subjects will be treated (n=1). The patient will receive
      brain transplantation of ADSCs and combines intravenous infusion ADSCs 4 times. Subjects will
      be assessed by adverse effects and functional outcomes of clinical: PI max , PE max,and
      Haloscale respiration, ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS) are analyzed at 1 month, 3
      months, 6 months 9 months and 12 months.

      Brain MRI scans will be obtained before and after the treatment. Long term follow-up will be
      performed at 1, 6 , and 12months for safety reasons. Brain CT for check operation safety
      before and after brain implantation.

      Timing of Study: 12months recruitment period after approvals
