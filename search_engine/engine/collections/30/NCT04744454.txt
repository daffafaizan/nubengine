      further observational data on the safety and effectiveness of Cresemba for six years after
      authorization is obtained in at least 600 subjects under routine clinical practice. As the
      safety and effectiveness results obtained from the clinical development program of Cresemba
      are based on randomized trials using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, data from the
      present post-authorization study where Cresemba is used in routine clinical practice per
      approved label is anticipated to provide important information on safety and effectiveness in
      a real-world population in Korea. This non-interventional study is designated as a PMS study
      and is a commitment to MFDS.
