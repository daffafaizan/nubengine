        1. Analysis of baseline levels of CTC and CTC PD-L1 and prognosis efficacy of patients:
           Objective remission rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS);

        2. Dynamic monitoring of CTC and CTC PD-L1 at baseline before treatment, after two cycles
           of treatment, and as the disease progresses.

        3. Consistency analysis of PD-L1 and CTC PD-L1 expression in tissue specimens.

      Secondary outcome:

      Duration of response(DOR), Disease control rate(DCR), Safety of the combination therapy.
