      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (tanespimycin) and bortezomib in patients
      with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of
      11/27/09).

      II. Determine changes in biomarkers (e.g., HSP70, client proteins, and ubiquitination of
      proteins) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor specimens from patients with
      advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of 11/27/09)
      treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine responses in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the toxic
      effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive tanespimycin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours and bortezomib IV over 3-5
      seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      tanespimycin and bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at least 12 additional patients are
      treated as above* at the MTD.

      NOTE: *Bortezomib is not administered on day 1 of course 1 only. Patients are followed at 3
      months.
