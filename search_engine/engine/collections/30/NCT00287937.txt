      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose of vorinostat (SAHA) when administered with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxic effects of this regimen in
      these patients.

      II. Assess, preliminarily, evidence of antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

      IV. Determine the in vivo effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of vorinostat (SAHA).

      Patients receive oral SAHA once or twice daily on days 1-14* and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
      followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      have stable disease after the completion of 6 courses may receive single-agent SAHA at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      NOTE: *During the first treatment course only, patients receive SAHA on days -4 to 10.Cohorts
      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience DLT. An additional 6-12 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month.
