      patches, in parkinsonian patients experiencing disabling dyskinesias due to their levodopa
      treatment. The principal adverse effect from this dose level of nicotine is expected to be
      nausea on acute administration to nicotine-naive patients. Because tolerance to the effects
      of nicotine is achieved by repeated dose, the study is designed to gradually escalate from 6
      to 24 mg per day, taken in 6 separate oral doses of 6 mg each. The study is designed to see
      if doses which can be tolerated by parkinsonian patients will also reduce the severity and
      frequency of the dyskinesias experienced following administration of levodopa, the gold
      standard medication for Parkinson's disease.
