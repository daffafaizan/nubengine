      its antibacterial activity has not been well established. In the present work, we will
      analyze the effect of long-term treatment with azithromycin (AZ) on airway oxidative stress
      markers in exhaled breath condensate of adult patients with stable non-CF bronchiectasis.
      Patients will be randomized in an open label model to receive AZ 250 mg three times per week
      during three months or nothing.Dyspnea (Borg scale), exacerbations (NÂº) in the last three
      months, sputum volume (cc), sputum colour (15-point scale), and health related quality of
      life (Questionnaire St.George) will be measured in both groups before and after treatment.
      Lung function, sputum culture, CT scan (Bhalla score) and inflammatory markers in blood (ESR,
      PCR),exhaled air (Nitric Oxide,) and exhaled condensed air (pH, nitrites, isoprostane) will
      be assessed before and after treatment. Relationships between clinical and inflammatory
      markers will be studied
