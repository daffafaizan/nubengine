    
      This is an open-label (volunteers will know the identity of assigned treatment) study in
      healthy adult volunteers and will consist of 4 consecutive parts, A, B, C, and D. Advancement
      to parts B, C, and D will occur only if the objectives of the preceding parts are met.
      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited for each part of the study. This will be the first
      study in which 42491293 will be given to healthy adult volunteers. Part A will investigate
      the measurement of radiation (referred to as radiation dosimetry) of 42491293. Part B will
      measure the regional brain kinetics (activity) and binding properties of 42491293. Part C
      will assess the dose dependent blocking of 42491293 by 40411813 in brain tissues following
      single oral doses of 40411813. Part D will assess the 'duration of occupancy' of the
      metabotropic glutamate receptor-2 (mGluR2) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) site in the
      brain by 40411813 compared to peripheral clearance. In this study, 42491293 will be
      radio-labeled and evaluated as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for use
      in imaging studies of the brain to detect binding of 40411813, a compound being developed for
      treating patients with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. In
      Parts A,B,C, and D, [11C] JNJ-42491293 (300 to 370 MBq) will be dosed as an i.v. bolus
      injection. During Part C and D, JNJ-40411813 (up to 500mg) will be administered orally (by
      mouth) 1.5 to 3 hours prior to scheduled PET scans.
