      risk of coronary heart disease, so much so that consensus panels routinely include it as part
      of a cardioprotective regimen for healthy people, but the physiological or mechanistic basis
      of this protection is uncertain. Understanding the mechanisms has considerable public health
      significance because it will allow development and testing of targeted interventions to
      produce comparable cardioprotective effects more directly or in cases where aerobic exercise
      is not possible. This application proposes to test the hypothesis that aerobic training leads
      to attenuation of the inflammatory response to LPS stimulation and to examine the role played
      by exercise-induced increases in vagal activity, improvements in mood, and decreased
      expression of Toll Receptor 4 (TLR4), the cognate receptor for endotoxin expressed by
      monocytes.
