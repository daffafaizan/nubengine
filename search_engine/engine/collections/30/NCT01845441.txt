      allows for "arousable" sedation, which is particularly appealing for use in patients with
      compromised neurologic function. While Precedex has been shown to be equivalent, if not
      superior to, conventional sedation in the procedural setting, it has not yet been evaluated
      in the setting of endovascular treatment of acute stroke. This setting is particularly ripe
      for evaluation, as there is currently controversy over the best method for management of
      patient sedation in light of the auxiliary need to preserve neurologic function. In order to
      evaluate the benefit of Precedex in this setting, it must be compared to the usual standard
      of care. Through the investigators double blinded randomized trial, the investigators will
      obtain information on the comparison between two arms, one receiving Precedex and the other
      the usual standard of care at the investigators institution, for achieving and maintaining a
      pre-defined level of conscious sedation, while preserving baseline neurologic status. This
      assessment will optimistically serve as the basis for future large-scale studies and
      ultimately to the establishment of Precedex as a first-line sedative in the management of
      acute stroke and cerebral vasospasm patients undergoing endovascular intervention.
