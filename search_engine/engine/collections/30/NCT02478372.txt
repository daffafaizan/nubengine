      orthopaedics within the United Kingdom in a number of centres (Malviya et al., 2011, McDonald
      et al., 2012, Scott et al., 2013) demonstrating improvements in patient outcomes. However as
      the ERP involved in all of these papers are a redesign of a number of key elements of the
      clinical pathway it remains unclear as to the level of significance each component may have
      on the patient's reported outcomes.

      The use of Local Infiltration Analgesia (LIA) as the primary post-operative analgesic
      technique has grown in popularity in Scotland over the past 5 years (Scott et al., 2013). A
      number of large cohort series have concurrently reported significant improvements in early
      ambulation and shortened lengths of stay (Malviya et al., 2011, McDonald et al., 2012) yet it
      remains unclear as to whether this is due to the introduction and use of the LIA technique or
      the overall development of the ERP programmes.

      The aim of this parallel group randomised controlled trial was to test two different methods
      of regional analgesia (LIA and Epidural) and their impact on attainment of predetermined
      rehabilitation criteria for direct discharge home and to consider the impact of each
      technique on long term functional status up to one year post surgery.

      Epidural analgesia when utilised as post-operative analgesia is predominantly used in the
      format of a continuous infusion of a set volume of analgesia (+/- adjuncts such as fentanyl)
      resulting in both a motor and sensory blockade, which as would be expected increases with the
      volume infused. Ambulatory patient epidurals have been used for a number of years within
      maternity services which provide adequate pain relief whilst enabling the patient to be
      mobile (Stewart & Fernando, 2011). Therefore to provide a fairer comparison with the LIA
      technique the standard epidural analgesia technique within the Golden Jubilee National
      Hospital was adapted to a Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA) system with no
      background infusion.

      The planned long term follow up period ( One year) was developed to enable greater evidence
      of the impact of each method on functional capacity, Patient Reported Outcome Scores (PROMS)
      and to monitor the incidence of adverse incidents over a longer period of time than
      previously published literature.
