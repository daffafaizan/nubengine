      I. Establish the safety and toxicity profile of sorafenib administered daily to
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine explant and allograft expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), microvessel density (CD34) and Ki67
      (proliferation marker).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
