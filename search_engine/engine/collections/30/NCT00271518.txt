      in stimulating height velocity and improving height in children with short stature due to
      insufficient endogenous Growth Hormone secretion. Currently somatropin is available in daily
      injection formulations. The requirement of daily administration causes significant burden and
      interruption of normal daily life. A product with less frequent dosing regimen will provide
      considerable improvement over currently available conventional replacement therapy regimens.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical comparability in terms of
      safety and efficacy of a new sustained release recombinant human growth hormone formulation
      to that of daily growth hormone.
