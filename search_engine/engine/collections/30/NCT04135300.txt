      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and kinetics of a single intravenous infusion of
      BBM-H901 in hemophilia B subjects with â‰¤2IU/dl residual FIX levels. Three subjects will be

      to 4-8weeks prior administration of BBM-H901. All subjects will undergo 52(+- 2) weeks safety
      observation and will be encouraged to enroll in an extension study to evaluate long- term
      safety of BBM-H901 for a total 5 years.The first subject will be dosed at 5x1012 vg/Kg and
      undergo 2 months safety observation of which the data will undergo review by an independent
