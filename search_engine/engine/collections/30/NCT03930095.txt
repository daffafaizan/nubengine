      acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT) or a Non-directive support Therapy (NDST).
      Assessments were at pretreatment, mid term, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up.Data were
      analyzed using the Mixed effect regression models comparing both groups in primary outcome
      measures. Secondary outcome measures and putative process variables were assessed and also
      analyzed. The latter were tested as mediators of efficacy.
