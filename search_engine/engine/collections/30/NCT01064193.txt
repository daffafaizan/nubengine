      improve clinical pregnancy rate of IVF-ET. First, local injury to proliferative phase
      endometrium might induce the decidualization of the endometrium, and increase its
      implantation rate. Second, local injury to the endometrium might provoke the wound healing,
      involving a mass secretion of different cytokines and growth factor, which are beneficial for
      embryo implantation. Last, the injury might make the endometrium maturation.

      This study proposes to evaluate the efficiency of an endometrial injury in the first
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycle on the rate of clinical pregnancy, in assisted
      reproductive technologies. This study will compare 2 groups of patients. The first group will
      undergo biopsy of the endometrium before the IVF; the second will undergo the IVF alone.
      Inclusions will be conducted on 33 months; the patients will be in the study for a period of
      36 weeks. The total duration of the study is 39 months
