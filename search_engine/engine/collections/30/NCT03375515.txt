      acceptable degree of side effects is variable. Opioid titration is a process to obtain the
      tailored dose. Conventional titration is administered by a clinician or nurse. PCA is that
      patients control cancer pain by self-administration of intravenous opioids using programmable
      pump. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of PCA titration versus conventional
      titration intravenously for severe cancer pain (10-point numerical rating scale, NRS â‰¥ 7).
      Injectable Hydromorphone was selected as pharmaceutical analgesics, which works as well as
      morphine and oxycodone and had similar side effects.
