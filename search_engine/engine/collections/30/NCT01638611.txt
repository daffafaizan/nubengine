    
      Primary Outcome:

      To assess the tolerability and safety after subcutaneous single ascending doses of HIP2B in
      healthy male subjects. Adverse events including local injection site reactions/pain will be
      assessed during the study. Ongoing adverse events will be followed to resolution or for 30
      days (whichever is sooner). Clinical laboratory evaluations including amylase and lipase will
      be reviewed. Vital signs and ECGs will be used to evaluate subject safety.

      Secondary Outcome:

      To assess the pharmacokinetics (including Cmax, AUClast, AUC0-âˆž, tmax, t1/2, tlag) in healthy
      male subjects after subcutaneous single ascending doses of HIP2B.
