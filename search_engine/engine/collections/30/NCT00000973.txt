      central nervous system infection in patients with AIDS. Untreated, the encephalitis is fatal.
      The best treatment for this disease has not been determined. Presently it is standard
      practice to administer a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Little is known about
      the pharmacokinetics of pyrimethamine in patients with AIDS receiving AZT. Furthermore, there
      are reports that patients already exposed to toxoplasmosis may not have uniform absorption of
      pyrimethamine.

      Patients receive the study treatment for a total of 22 days. Patients are given an initial
      dose of pyrimethamine followed by a lower dose given as a single oral daily dose for 21 days.
      Patients continue to receive AZT at the dose prescribed prior to enrollment in the study.
      Patients receive leucovorin calcium once a day. Neither the leucovorin calcium nor the AZT
      are provided through the study.
