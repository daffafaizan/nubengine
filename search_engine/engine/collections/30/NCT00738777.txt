      efficacy of three different endocrine treatment regimens (Anastrozole +/- Fulvestrant or
      Tamoxifen) in changing proliferation-index and inducing apoptosis during a 2-6 week
      pre-operative treatment period in breast cancer patients. These results will be correlated to
      gene expression profiles, phosphorylation status of the ER, SNPs in CYP450 sequences,
      tamoxifen metabolite concentrations, changes in estrogen serum levels and protein expression
      patterns.
