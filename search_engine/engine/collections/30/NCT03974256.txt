      Technologist in Medical Electro-Radiology or/and Pharmacy Technicians, manually for
      radiopharmaceuticals labelled with Technetium-99m (99mTc), or using an automaton for
      radiopharmaceuticals FDG.

      At present, there are automatons on the market but only for radiopharmaceuticals FDG.

      However, these automatons are currently only used to split into individual doses
      radiopharmaceuticals FDG, the labelling radiopharmaceuticals being carried out before
      delivery in nuclear medicine departments.

      The Sysark SAS's company has created and patented, with the collaboration of the Center of
      Research in Automatic Control of Nancy (CRAN, mixed unite of research 7039 common to the
      University of Lorraine and the CNRS) an innovative automaton for the preparation of
      radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 99mTc, used to perform scintigraphy examinations of
      nuclear medicine department.
