      (DLT), combined with the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) to confirm its positioning,
      some controversies have aroused; the main concern being the use of the right-sided
      double-lumen endobronchial tube (R-DLT). Alongside this persistent controversy, the anatomy
      of the right tracheo-bronchial tree seems to be the principal cause of reticence for using
      the R-DLT. Compared to the left main stem bronchus, this anatomy is relatively complex and
      can be divided in two issues: 1) the variable length of the right main-stem bronchus (RMSB)
      and consequently, the variable level of insertion of the right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus on
      the lateral part of the RMSB and 2) the alignment of the lateral orifice of the R-DLT in
      regard of the RUL bronchus origin. A as part of an extensive study of the tracheo-bronchial
      tree anatomy with high resolution CT-scan, we had the opportunity to measure differently the
      length of the main stem right bronchus and the angulation between the RUL bronchus origin and
      the lateral aspect of the right side main stem bronchus.
