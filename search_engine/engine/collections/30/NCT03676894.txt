      women currently experiencing female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and stress-predominant
      mixed urinary incontinence (SMUI) with a degree of intrinsic sphincter deficiency for a
      minimum duration of 6 months prior to enrolment. Diagnosis of SUI with a degree of intrinsic
      sphincter deficiency will be performed using urodynamic and clinical assessment.

      Subjects will undergo sham, intravaginal, and the combination of intravaginal and
      intraurethral treatment with the 2940 nm Er:yttrium aluminum garnet Er:YAG laser at two time
      points, 4 weeks apart. Primary objective is to assess the tolerability and safety of the
      intraurethral 2940nm Er:YAG laser technique in combination with intravaginal 2940nm Er:YAG
      laser method for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence through 6 months follow-up and
      extend to 12 months follow-up.

      Secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of the intravaginal and combination of
      intraurethral/intravaginal laser treatments using subjective and objective measures, as well
      as improvement in quality of life through 6 months follow-up and extend to 12 months
      follow-up.
