      Psychological interventions show some promising effects on psychopathology but have been less
      successful in reducing AH related distress, which patients report to be a priority. Research
      suggests that distress is associated with the hearer relating to AH in a passive and
      subordinate manner. A novel approach thus teaches assertive responses to AH through the use
      of experiential role-plays. A single centre pilot study in the United Kingdom evidenced a
      large effect of this approach on AH distress but independent multicentre studies are required
      to ascertain effectiveness across different settings. The planned feasibility trial aims to
      estimate the expected effect for a subsequent fully powered prospective, randomized,
      controlled, parallel-group, two-armed, multicentre, open trial set up to demonstrate that
      adding a Relating Module (RM) to Treatment as Usual (TAU) is superior to TAU alone.
      Feasibility questions relate to patient recruitment, therapist training and therapy
      monitoring in different types of psychological and psychiatric outpatient facilities. A total
      of 75 patients diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (ICD-10, F2) and persistent
      distressing AH will be recruited across 4 sites and receive either 16 50-minute sessions of
      RM plus TAU or TAU alone within a 5-months period. Assessments will take place at baseline,
      at 5 months (post-intervention) and at 9 months (primary outcome).
