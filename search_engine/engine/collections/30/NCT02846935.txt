    
      Primary objective: To determine the objective response rate to oral THU-Dec in patients with
      3 separate biologic subsets of refractory/relapsed lymphoid malignancies:

        1. T-cell lymphoma,

        2. Aggressive B cell lymphoma,

        3. indolent B-cell lymphoma .

      Secondary objectives:

      (i) To evaluate the toxicity of oral THU-Dec in these patients; (ii) To evaluate hypotheses
      regarding mechanisms of resistance and predictive biomarkers.
