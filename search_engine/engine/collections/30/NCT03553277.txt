      approaches, comparing entomological indices will be measured through standard household
      monitoring of Aedes aegypti population densities, while DCZV transmission will be measured
      through door-to-door surveillance for active dengue disease and through serological
      monitoring for DCZV exposure in a randomized cluster trial.

      The investigators will establish a cohort of 3,400 persons, primarily children 2-12 years of
      age and adults who have not been previously infected with DCZV who will provide annual blood
      samples when they are healthy (longitudinal cohort), whereas in the same clusters the
      investigators expect to monitor up to 27,500 residents for active dengue disease (febrile
      surveillance cohort). The cohort will be monitored for a period of 2 years. The use of
      spatial repellents has never been tested on a large scale to reduce disease and could change
      vector control practices worldwide, reducing the amount of chemical insecticides applied and
      also prevent the development of insecticide resistance. The investigators plan to implement a
      short questionnaire to determine levels of acceptability and perceived efficacy amongst
      participating households.

      The project will be carried out in the Amazonia City of Iquitos, Peru, which has a
      well-established infrastructure for studying urban dengue fever. The study will generate
      rigorous evidence, documenting and evaluating the impact of SR products on human infection
      rates, to be considered and used by academia, industry and public health key stakeholders at
      the global, regional, national and/or local level and drive efforts to acquire full
      recommendation of SR products for inclusion in disease control programs.
