    
      The study is an Open Label, Non-Comparative study intended to verify the method used to
      measure the duration of ColdZymeÂ®. Each participant will be his own control as samples are
      taken before application of ColdZyme and used as an internal control. Samples will be taken
      from the oropharyngeal membrane using a cotton swab before application, and 1, 3, 5, 10, 20,
      and 60 minutes after application. Glycerol will then be extracted from the swabs using water
      and the concentration of glycerol will be measured.
