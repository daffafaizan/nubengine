    
      The study has a before-and-after design, to allow comparison of the intervention before its
      implementation and after its implementation. This design permits a reliable assessment of
      baseline characteristics prior to implementation of intervention and over time, particularly
      in situations where randomization is not feasible (e.g. due to contamination of treating
      physicians). The point at which the intervention will start to be delivered for new study
      participants is when 150 patients are accrued to the Before arm.

        1. Before/control arm (Before arm) Usual care by Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM)
           oncologist.

        2. After/intervention arm (After arm) Provision of a healthy bones prescription, verbal
           counselling, and written educational materials regarding healthy bone behaviours by PM
           oncologist or delegate (e.g. clinical fellow), in addition to usual care by oncologist.
           The intervention may be delivered again at a subsequent follow-up at the request of the
           patient and/or at the discretion of the oncologist.
