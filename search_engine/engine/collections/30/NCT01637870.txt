      cesarean delivery compared to a vaginal delivery. Known risk factors for wound complications
      are obesity, premature rupture of membranes, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders,
      emergency cesarean delivery, twin delivery, chorioamnionitis, increased surgical blood loss
      and preeclampsia.

      This study is aimed at determining whether or not the use of a suction device placed on the
      wound instead of a standard sterile dressing will decrease the prevalence of wound
      complications and wound infections in women at high risk for post operative complications.
      The investigators will compare the results from the participants of this study to an existing
      data set of historical controls who underwent cesarean delivery. The study involves placing a
      single use, portable negative wound pressure system kept in place while in the hospital after
      surgery (on average 48-72 hours) in women who meet criteria for increased risk of wound
      complications. The investigators will then compare the rates of wound infection and wound
      complications between these two groups.
