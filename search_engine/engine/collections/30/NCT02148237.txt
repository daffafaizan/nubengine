    
      This study is to determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect sizes of
      home-based individual breastfeeding consultation alone and combined with financial incentives
      to increase breastfeeding (BF) duration among low-income Puerto Rican mothers. These
      interventions will be tested in a Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which
      capitalizes on the current goals of WIC and on the current practice of using incentives to
      support BF - factors that are likely to increase potential for sustainability and
      dissemination of the intervention. We will follow a three phase strategy. During the
      Formative Phase we will consult WIC staff, Puerto Rican postpartum mothers, and experts in
      BF, behavioral health incentives, and WIC populations and settings to develop intervention
      and research manuals. During the Implementation Phase, we will pilot the interventions and
      research procedures. We will randomly assign 60 Puerto Rican women who initiate BF to:
      Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) or TAU with financial incentives (also known as Contingency
      Management; (CM). A bilingual breastfeeding counselor visits participants at home for problem
      solving issues around breastfeeding. Participants also receiving CM will receive cash
      incentives if they show breastfeeding. We will conduct assessments at baseline, 1, 3, and 6
      months postpartum, measuring BF duration, BF exclusivity, BF self-efficacy, and infant weight
      gain. In the Evaluative Phase, we will examine monthly recruitment, consent, and enrollment
      rates, as well as attendance and retention rates for the interventions and for research
      participation (i.e., feasibility and acceptability).
