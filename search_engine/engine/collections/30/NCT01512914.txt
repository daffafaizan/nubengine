      laparoscopic surgery have provided conflicting results. One of the factors that might
      contribute to failure of the instillation technique may be related to inadequate distribution
      of local anesthetic throughout the peritoneal surface. In contrast, nebulization should
      provide a uniform spread of drugs throughout the peritoneal cavity and thus may be beneficial
      to improve pain relief after laparoscopic procedures. The investigators reported that a
      microvibration-based nebulization device (Aeroneb ProÂ® system, Aerogen, Galway, Ireland)
      could be used for ropivacaine delivery into the insufflation gas required to create
      pneumorpeitoneum. The investigators hypothesized that intraperitoneal ropivacaine
      nebulization would provide superior pain relief than ropivacaine instillation after
      gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. This randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial
      was designed to assess the analgesic efficacy of ropivacaine nebulization before or after
      surgery compared with intraperitoneal ropivacaine instillation and placebo after gynecologic
      laparoscopic procedures.
