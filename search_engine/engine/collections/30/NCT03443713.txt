      be collected during this time. Subjects will wear the Dexcom G6 CGM system and a physical
      activity monitor. The Subjects will complete 2 exercise visits in-clinic and 4 exercise
      visits as an outpatient. Subjects will be randomized to aerobic, anaerobic or high intensity
      interval exercise sessions for 30 minutes each. Physicians will review CGM and insulin data
      every 7 days and make insulin dose recommendations that the subject will adjust in the dose
      calculator.
