      mortality, and therapies that have proven effective in HF with reduced EF have not been shown
      to improve long-term prognosis in HFpEF. Inhibition of circulating neprilysin could augment
      deficient NP-receptor GC signaling and therefore be beneficial in HFpEF, as suggested by the
      decrease in NP following administration of valsartan/sacubitril in the phase 2 (PARAMOUNT
      study). Use of valsartan/sacubitril is currently being tested in the multicenter PARAGON-HF
      trial with HFpEF patients. The investigators suppose the best candidates for LCZ696 therapy
      will be patients with HFpEF and advanced concentric LV hypertrophy and obesity, i.e. having
      the lowest BNP bioavailability.
