           a PORT, inserted prior to starting chemotherapy. A port is a small device that is
           inserted under the skin (usually near the collar bone) by a minor surgical procedure and
           is then connected to one of the large veins inside the chest. The port will be used to
           give the intravenous medications.

        -  During the first cycle, the participant will receive trastuzumab intravenously on Day 1.
           Cycle 2 will then start one week later. On this day, bevacizumab will be given
           intravenously first followed by trastuzumab and then oxaliplatin. The participant will
           then start taking capecitabine tablets orally twice a day for 14 days. Each treatment
           cycle is 21 days long.

        -  Participants will have the following tests and procedures at specific time points during
           study treatment; physical exam, blood tests, CT scan, MUGA scan or echocardiogram, and
           urine test.
