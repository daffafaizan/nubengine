      clinical trials to potentially prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, despite the strong
      links between sleep disruptions, cognitive decline, and AD, sleep enhancement has yet to be
      targeted as a lifestyle intervention to prevent AD. Approximately fifteen percent of AD may
      be prevented by an efficacious intervention aimed to reduce sleep disturbances and sleep
      disorders. Chronic insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder occurring in at least forty
      percent of older adults. Individuals with insomnia are more likely to be diagnosed with AD
      and demonstrate a decline in cognitive function at long-term follow-up. AD is characterized
      by the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau tangles in the brain, and growing evidence shows
      impaired sleep contributes to the accumulation of Aβ. An intervention aimed at improving
      insomnia may represent a critical opportunity for primary prevention to slow cognitive
      decline and potentially delay the onset of AD. Therefore, the long-term goal of this research
      agenda is to understand how addressing sleep disturbances, via sleep intervention, may delay
      the onset of AD.
