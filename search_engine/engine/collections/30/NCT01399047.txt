    
      Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is a fatal disorder. Currently treatment is
      symptomatic. Thus, there is a real need to intervene and slow the progression of this
      disease. Preliminary data on genetic knock-down of the ability to mount an immune response in
      cln3-knockout mice is supportive of a strategy for treating JNCL with an immuno-suppressive
      agent. Many drugs with the ability to suppress the immune system are steroidal and deemed
      unsuitable for long-term administration to children. Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) is used
      as an immunosuppressive agent in allogenic transplants in pediatric patients and is therefore
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediatric use.

      The study design is a double-blind, randomized, 22-week cross-over study of mycophenolate
      mofetil vs. placebo. After a 4-week washout period, subjects will undergo blinded crossover
      from active study drug to placebo or from placebo to active study drug.

      Subjects and caregivers will be evaluated in person in the University of Rochester Batten
      Center (URBC) at screening/baseline, and at weeks 8, 12, and 20. In addition, subjects will
      be evaluated by their local clinician who is a formalized member of the research team. Such
      contacts will occur at Weeks 2, 4, 14, 16, and any unscheduled or early termination visits.
      There will also be regular telephone contact between the URBC and the local clinician.

      We have selected the dosage currently FDA approved for use in children being treated for
      prophylaxis of renal transplant rejection.
