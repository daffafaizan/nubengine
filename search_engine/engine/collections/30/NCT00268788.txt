      modality in Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN). In order to maintain neuromuscular performance
      patients require lifelong treatment. Hospital-based treatments have high cost and
      inconveniences to patients, particularly in chronic disorders. Immunoglobulin preparations
      are now available for subcutaneous use as IgG replacement therapy. The safety and efficacy of
      subcutaneous infusion is reported to be comparable to i.v. preparations, and has been applied
      successfully in other autoimmune disorders. However patients with MMN have not previously
      been treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin.

      Hypothesis:

      Subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment is efficacious and safe with less patient
      inconvenience.

      Primary endpoint:

      Isokinetic muscle strength at the end of treatment A vs B (subcutaneous vs i.v.)

      Secondary endpoint:

      Medical research council score (MRC-score), 9-hole peg test, 10m walking, Nerve conduction
      parameters, SF-36.
