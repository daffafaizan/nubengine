      I. Improve the outcomes of post-prostatectomy radiotherapy prostate cancer patients via
      selection and treatment optimization with advanced molecular imaging with dose escalation.

      II. Establish the role of advanced molecular imaging with fluciclovine F18 (fluciclovine
      [18F]) and gallium Ga68-labeled prostate specific membrane antigen PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA) PET/CT
      in influencing post-prostatectomy radiotherapy decision-making.

      III. Establish the role of advanced molecular imaging with fluciclovine 18F or 68Ga-PSMA in
      altering radiotherapy treatment volumes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/CT over
      approximately 30 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA IV, wait 60 minutes, then undergo a PET/CT over
      approximately 30 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
