      anemic oncology patients is non-inferior to the administration of two units of red blood
      cells in terms of the number of annual transfusion episodes. If demonstrated, our findings
      will cut the total transfusion episode time in half and avoid exposure to an additional unit
      of red blood cells while freeing up scarce hospital resources.
