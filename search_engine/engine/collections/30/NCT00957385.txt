      successfully complete further chemotherapy, are not candidates for allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation (alloBMT) due to their age. Rather, this group of patients is simply observed
      until relapse occurs. In this age group, the median duration of CR is only ~10 months. The
      survival of patients <60 years of age who are not candidates for transplantation (due to
      donor unavailability), and who are in CR2 or higher is also extremely poor. Several lines of
      evidence suggest that the immune system - and in particular AML specific CTLs and NK cells -
      is capable of recognizing and clearing AML cells.
