    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase II study. Patients will be enrolled in 2
      treatment arms (Arm A: IFX-1 monotherapy; Arm B: IFX-1 + pembrolizumab combination therapy),
      both consisting of 2 stages whereas Arm B starts with a safety run in portion. Enrollment
      follows an optimal Simon's 2-stage design with an interim analysis of treatment response
      after Stage 1 prior to patient enrollment into Stage 2.

      Arm B will start after â‰¥3 patients have been treated in Arm A and no toxicity concerns have
      emerged. In a safety run-in part of Arm B, escalating doses of IFX-1 will be investigated in
      combination with pembrolizumab in order to identify the MTD or RP2D. Patients will be treated
      until progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or treatment discontinuation for any
      other reason.
