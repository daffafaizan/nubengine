      medical indication at 39 weeks gestation are associated with improved maternal and perinatal
      outcomes compared to expectant management.1 In the wake of these landmark findings, labor
      inductions without medical indication are becoming increasingly common not only on a nation
      scale, but locally as well. Recent data show that labor inductions without medical indication
      encompass nearly one third of all inductions at Christiana Care Health System.

      Labor induction can include both mechanical and pharmacological measures to ripen the cervix
      and stimulate uterine contractions. The ultimate challenge, which has been the focus of
      numerous studies to date, is to determine which mechanical and/or pharmacological products
      and which clinical settings are safest and most efficacious for inducing labor.

      Currently, transcervical Foley catheters are the gold-standard mechanical method of cervical
      ripening. However, new-emerging data has shown that hygroscopic cervical dilators,
      traditionally used for early pregnancy termination, may be a viable alternative. DILAPAN-S® ,
      a hygroscopic dilator composed of a synthetic hydrogel was approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for cervical ripening in 2015 and has been the subject of recent
      investigation. In a single-center, randomized, open-label trial consisting of 419 patients,
      Saad et al showed that DILAPAN-S® is not inferior to the Foley catheter for pre-induction
      cervical ripening at term; there was no significant difference in maternal and neonatal
      adverse events and patients with DILAPAN-S® were more satisfied than patients with the Foley
      catheter as far as sleep, relaxing time, and performance of desired daily activities.2

      Furthermore, in the pursuit of improving patient satisfaction with consideration of
      healthcare resources, studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of outpatient
      mechanical cervical ripening.3 Sciscione et al, showed that in a low-risk population of 1,905
      patients, no adverse outcomes were associated with outpatient Foley catheter cervical
      ripening and patients on average avoided 9.6 hours of hospitalizations compared to the
      inpatient group.4 The ACOG practice bulletin on induction of labor now states that outpatient
      cervical ripening, particularly mechanical methods, may be appropriate in select patients.5
      Based on the literature cited above, it is plausible to hypothesize that DILAPAN-S® used for
      outpatient cervical ripening may optimize patient satisfaction and healthcare resource
      utilization without compromising patient safety and efficacy. The purpose of this trial is to
      perform a noninferiority randomized clinical trial comparing DILAPAN-S® to the Foley catheter
      for outpatient cervical ripening in term elective labor inductions, examining time spent on
      the labor and delivery unit, patient safety, and patient satisfaction feedback.
