      comparing irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) with EP in patients with extensive-stage SCLC. The
      response rate and overall median survival were significantly better for IP, i.e. 84.4% and
      12.8 months with IP, versus 67.5% and 9.4 months with EP, respectively. The 2-year survival
      rates were 19.5% for IP and 5.2% for EP (7). These encouraging results prompted us to explore
      the use of IP in LSCLC.
