      scores for brain metastases. First the current clinical models will be optimized with a new
      prognostic model and nomogram. Radiomics is a tool to analyze tumor characteristics based on
      CT and MR images. These tumor characteristics may reflect tumor biology and outcome.
      Therefore it is investigated if radiomics improves prediction of long term survival after
      stereotactic radiotherapy for brain metastases. Moreover, the predictive value of radiomics
      for local failure is investigated.
