      myocardium and to reduce definite infarct size. However, reperfusion itself also causes
      irreversible myocardial damage - a phenomenon described as reperfusion injury. Reduction of
      ischemic and reperfusion injury by ischemic conditioning has been identified as a potential
      target to reduce myocardial damage.

      Remote ischemic conditioning and local ischemic postconditioning might be in particular of
      clinical benefit in higher risk STEMI patients with Killip class â‰¥2, where mortality rates
      are high.

      The Remote Ischemic Conditioning with Local Ischemic Postconditioning in High-Risk
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients (RIP-HIGH) trial is a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial aiming to compare the impact of combined remote ischemic conditioning and
      local ischemic postconditioning vs. standard of care on clinical outcome in high-risk
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention.
