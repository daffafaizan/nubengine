    
      80 adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will be recruited. They are randomized to
      receive either an autologous FMT as a placebo or FMT from a healthy donor (frozen and
      thawed).

      The patients are followed up with fecal samples to detect microbial changes. The follow up
      lasts 1 year after the FMT and a follow up colonoscopy will be done 52 weeks after the FMT.
