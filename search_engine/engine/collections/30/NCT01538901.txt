      are prone to develop skin tumors, i.e skin cancer is the most frequent malignancy in organ
      transplant recipients. OTP frequently develop extensive areas of actinic damage, epidermal
      dysplasia, wich accounts for increased risk of aggressive skin cancer development in
      susceptible patients, and are referred to as "field cancerisation". Therefore the whole area
      of field cancerisation has to be treated. In our study we will treat this areas with two
      different methods and not only the single visible lesions of actinic keratoses.In this open
      prospective randomized intraindividual study one half of the patients' scalp or face will be
      treated with Imiquimod 5% cream for 4 weeks, 3 times a week, and the other half with
      Methyl-aminolaevulinate 16% cream photodynamic therapy, two applications in two weeks
      interval. The pre- and post treatment extension of field cancerisation will be assessed by
      means of a highly sensitive digital fluorescence imaging system.
