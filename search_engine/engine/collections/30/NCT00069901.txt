      biodegradable polyglutamate polymer. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the toxicity,
      estimate the response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with
      newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with CT-2103
      in combination with carboplatin.
