      related peritonitis was a major complication for these patients. Severe and prolong
      peritonitis may led to membrane failure and drop out of peritoneal dialysis. Among the
      pathogens, G(+) bacteria came from skin surface and G(-) bacteria came from gastrointestinal
      tract. The later might be related to the pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract, and led to
      peritonitis if constipation or diarrhea developed. In addition, intestinal pathogens may be
      related to chronic inflammation in uremia patients. There was a MIA syndrome (malnutrition,
      inflammation and atherosclerosis) noted before, and chronic inflammation may be related to
      malnutrition. Today, we know that nutrition status and inflammation marker (CRP) may be
      associated with patients' outcome. Many gastrointestinal syndromes such as constipation
      suffer our patients. The dialysate in the abdominal cavity may further exacerbate the
      appetite. The probiotics was though to improve the pathogens in intestinal tract, improve
      gastrointestinal function. We want to decrease the incidence of peritonitis by using the
      probiotics. In addition, the improvement in gastrointestinal function can increase the
      nutrition status.
