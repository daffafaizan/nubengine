      toxicities and short half-lives which require frequent intravenous dosing. Alternatively, MSL
      109 has demonstrated safety and effectiveness in neutralizing CMV isolates at concentrations
      easily maintained in AIDS patients.

      Patients receive induction therapy with intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet daily for 14
      days, then are placed on standard maintenance therapy with the induction drug for at least 11
      months or until progression. Patients are randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of MLS 109 or
      placebo every 2 weeks during induction and maintenance. They are followed at weeks 2 and 4
      and every 4 weeks thereafter for 40 weeks. Patients who have not progressed by week 40
      continue study drug with follow-up every 2 months until CMV progression occurs. AS PER
      AMENDMENT 11/29/96: Enrollment onto the current study has been discontinued. To study the
      enhancement of humoral immunity, a high-dose cohort has been added. Patients are now
      randomized to MSL 109 given at a higher dose or placebo administered at the same intervals as
      before. Randomization is weighted 2:1 in favor of high-dose MSL 109. Interim analyses will be
      performed to provide for early discontinuation, as indicated. Patients randomized under
      earlier versions may continue on their original study assignment if a study endpoint has not
      been reached.
