      differ from usual care in a number of different ways. First, while the patient is in the
      hospital, an interdisciplinary group of providers will round on the patient on a regular
      basis. This interdisciplinary team will be composed of an attending physician, clinical
      pharmacist, nurse, case manager, and social worker, who will all evaluate the patient's needs
      from a variety of perspectives to ensure that the patient is prepared for discharge and
      self-manage post-discharge. During the patient's hospital stay, a clinical pharmacist will
      also conduct a detailed medication reconciliation of home medications, assess
      medication-related risks, and provide relevant education to patients participating in the
      program. After the patient is discharged from Rush University Medical Center, a Master's
      prepared social worker will then contact the patient and conduct an assessment from a
      psychosocial perspective to identify any unmet needs. Lastly, a clinical pharmacist will be
      available to patients enrolled in the Combined Social Worker and Pharmacist Program, should
      they have any medication-related questions post-discharge.
