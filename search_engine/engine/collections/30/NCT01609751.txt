      frequency and severity of attacks of diverticulitis, the research project will take account
      of this by:

        1. Monitoring dietary fibre using a diet diary

        2. Measurement of height and weight to determine BMI

        3. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes

      As well as keeping a diet diary, subjects will be asked to keep a general health diary, and
      to complete gut health questionnaires at start, 6 months and 12 months.
