      (experimental arm) compared to iVAPS (commercially available therapy)

      Participants already established on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) will be recruited to
      participate for 3 nights in a monitored sleep unit. They will have a sleep study each night:

      Night 1 will involve an evaluation of their current NIV settings. Some of these settings will
      be used to set up AutoEPAP iVAPS and iVAPS.

      Night 2 & 3: the participants will be randomised to AutoEPAP iVAPS or iVAPS. They will have
      sleep studies on each therapy, whereby their sleep and sleep-breathing will be monitored and
      evaluated.

      After each night, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how well
      they slept.

      Phase II: To compare sleep-breathing and therapy adherence for patients who use AutoEPAP
      iVAPS (experimental arm) compared to their usual therapy (Spontaneous Time (ST) mode).

      Participants already established on non-invasive ventilation (NIV; ie. ST mode) will be
      recruited to participate for 14 nights. This study will occur at home. The participants will
      be randomised to trial AutoEPAP iVAPS or ST mode therapy for Week 1 and 2. Data will be
      collected onto the respiratory device (i.e. Juno) detailing objective usage, air leak and
      breathing parameters (e.g. oxygenation). Participants will also complete a questionnaire
      after each week to evaluate subjective sleep quality and comfort.

      Blood samples will also be collected Pre-week 1, and after week 1 & 2 to measure oxygen,
      carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels in the blood. Blood samples will be taken from the ear
      lobe.
