      between 9 and 24 months old, with confirmed or discarded infection for HIV determined by
      molecular testing. Samples from the volunteers will be subjected to rapid tests and
      serological and molecular reference tests.

      After obtaining consent from the child's guardian,a brief interview will take place with
      completing the questionnaire of inclusion in the research. Then, the collection of fluid in
      the oral cavity as well as the fingerstick puncture will be conducted for the HIV rapid tests
      procedures.

      The results of the rapid tests will be compared with the ones from the molecular testing and
      the concordance will be determined for each age group separately.

      The study has being conducted by four clinical research sites at Brazil, distributed in three
      different states, and a clinical research site at Tanzânia: Instituto Fernandes Figueira (IFF
      - Fiocruz) at Rio de Janeiro; Hospital Geral de Nova Iguaçu (HGNI) at Rio de Janeiro,
      Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) at Amazonas; Secretaria
      de Estado de Saúde Pública do Pará (URES - Materno Infantil - UREMIA) at Pará and National
