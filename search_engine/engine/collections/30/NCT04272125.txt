      is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is an ideal target for CAR-T. Some
      researches have revealed that CD123 is a marker of leukemia stem cells, which indicates that
      the eradication of CD123 cells may prevent relapse of leukemia. In this study, investigators
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting CD123 in patients with
      relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The primary goal is safety and efficiency
      assessment, including adverse events and disease status after treatment.
