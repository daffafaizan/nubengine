    
      This is a Phase II prospective clinical trial. Following registration, patients will be
      required to undertake a baseline questionnaire assessment of daily living activities using
      the Modified Barthel's index, as well as cognitive assessment using MMSE.

      Patients will undergo MRI scan of the brain for radiotherapy planning purposes. During
      radiotherapy planning and for each of the five radiotherapy fractions, patients will be
      immobilised in a custom fitted stereotactic mask system, to minimise head movement. During
      treatment, patients will have daily online setup corrections to ensure treatment accuracy.

      Patients will be treated with WBRT/SIB using VMAT, delivering a total of 20 Gy in 5 fractions
      to the whole brain and 50Gy in 5 fractions to the brain metastases, delivered once daily on
      working days. Anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory medication will be prescribed to minimise
      acute toxicity.

      Following therapy completion, patients will be seen every 3 months for the 1st year, then
      every 6 months thereafter. At each clinic visit, clinicians or study investigators will
      monitor for toxicity from therapy, document neurologic symptoms and signs and performance
      status as well as Modified Barthel's index and cognitive assessment.

      Patients will have contrast-enhanced MRI brain at 3 months and 1 year, and contrast-enhanced
      CT brain at 6 months and 9 months in the first year and every 6 months after the first year.
      Serum creatinine levels will be done prior to each scan to ensure safety of intravenous
      contrast administration.
