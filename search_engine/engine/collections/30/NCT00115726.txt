      Little is known about the effects of these medications on the successful conduct of
      anesthesia and surgery. Diuretics like furosemide may contribute to low blood pressure during
      surgery, an outcome associated with cardiovascular complications. However, many patients are
      recommended to take their diuretics on the day of surgery. We wished to determine if
      preoperative administration of furosemide contributes to intraoperative hypotension compared
      to placebo.

      Comparison: We conducted a randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial to compare the
      effect of furosemide with that of placebo on intraoperative hypotension using intraoperative
      blood pressure recordings in patients who take furosemide chronically and were undergoing
      noncardiac surgery.
