      down AD without altering its natural evolution. The development of new therapies has
      primarily focused on preventing the progression of AD. This therapeutic strategy involves
      being interested in patients with an early stage of AD such as a mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI). We hypothesized that the combination of Lecitone®Se with 200 IU/day of vitamin D can
      slow or even improve cognitive decline, particularly executive functions.

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral
      intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with the effect of a placebo on changes in performance
      obtained in the TMT B in the older adults with a MCI.

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

        -  To compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo on changes in executive performance in patients with a MCI.

        -  To compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo on changes in variability of stride time in patients with a MCI.

        -  To compare the effect after 24 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo and a delay phase of supplementation on changes in executive
           performance in patients with a MCI.

        -  To compare the effect after 24 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo and a delay phase of supplementation on changes in variability
           of stride time in patients with a MCI.

        -  To determine the compliance and tolerance of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3
           in patients with a MCI.
