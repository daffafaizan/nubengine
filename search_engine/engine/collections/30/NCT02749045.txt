      for consent to be part of the study. If the patient is found to have one or two vessel
      disease and it is planned by the interventional cardiologist that FFR will be used, then the
      previously consented patient will be deemed appropriate for the study. The standard procedure
      will be followed for FFR testing using regadenoson. The patient will then receive the
      standard dose of Tc-99m sestamibi. The interventional cardiologist will proceed with
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if appropriate. Patients will proceed to the cardiac
      catheterization laboratory holding area post procedure. Patients will then be scheduled to be
      taken to the nuclear cardiology laboratory one to three hours following the coronary
      angiogram for standard SPECT acquisition. Patients will be monitored for 2-6 hours or
      overnight as clinically indicated following diagnostic coronary angiography and PCI. Low dose
      resting myocardial perfusion scanning may be performed the next day if stress myocardial
      perfusion study was abnormal.
