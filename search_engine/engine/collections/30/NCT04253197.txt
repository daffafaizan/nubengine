      accreta, increta, and percreta, which are associated with significant maternal and fetal
      morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound evaluation, with grayscale, is the recommended first-line
      modality for diagnosing MAP. Grayscale ultrasound features suggestive of placenta accreta
      include the loss of myometrial interface or retroplacental clear space, reduced myometrial
      thickness and the presence of intraplacental lacunae. Using a staging system by antenatal
      ultrasound can predict placental invasion antenatally.
