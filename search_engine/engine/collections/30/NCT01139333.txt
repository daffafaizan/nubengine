        -  To evaluate Mer and Axl expression in samples from pediatric patients with acute myeloid
           leukemia (AML).

        -  To determine if abnormal expression of Mer and Axl is associated with poor clinical
           characteristics (e.g., induction failure or relapse) of AML in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived samples from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia are analyzed for Mer and
      Axl expression by flow cytometry and western blot assays.
