    
      MTN-045 is a cross-sectional study that will utilize questionnaires, including DCEs and joint
      decision tasks, and IDIs to assess heterosexual couples' preferences related to DPP products
      that could be used to prevent unintended pregnancies and HIV infection. One main goal of the
      study is to determine heterosexual couples' preferences for a DPP product to inform product
      delivery and future product design to maximize uptake and willingness to use among
      sub-Saharan African heterosexual couples. Another main goal of the study is to assess the
      level of influence of the male partner on a woman's preferences for a DPP product and on her
      decision-making process regarding product preferences and use.

      The MTN-045 study population will consist of approximately 400 heterosexual sub-Saharan
      African couples of reproductive age who have been in a relationship for â‰¥ 3 months and are
      interested in contraception and/or HIV prevention. Women who are currently using
      contraceptives as well as those not using contraceptives will be eligible. Couples who are
      living together as well as those not living together will be eligible. All participants will
      complete survey questionnaires, first separately from their partner, then followed by a joint
      couples' decision task. Up to 80 participants, i.e., one or both partners from a subset of up
      to 40 couples, will be selected to complete an IDI.
