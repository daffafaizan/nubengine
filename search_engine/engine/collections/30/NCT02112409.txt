      arms of study group using concealed allocation method. A computerized random-number generator
      will be used to formulate an allocation schedule. Group A will receive cell salvage and acute
      normovolemic hemodilution during operation; Group B will only receive cell salvage as sole
      autologous transfusion strategy.

      Members of the research team should attend all operations and record all data. Anaesthetic
      technique including drugs usage, equipments and monitoring devices are standardized as per
      protocol. Intraoperative fluid management is recorded in details.

      All patients enrolled in the study (group A and B) underwent cell saver technique during
      surgery using Cell Saver® 5+ autologous blood recovery system-Haemonetics devices. All
      patients allocated in group A also received additional acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH)
      after induction of anaesthesia. As a standardization measure, before starting skin incision,
      500ml blood will be collected from the radial artery to a standard blood collection bag and
      stored as CPD blood at ambient temperature. Simultaneously, 500ml Voluven® (6% hydroxyethyl
      starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride) will be infused through a peripheral vein.

      All autologous blood will be re-infused back to patient at surgery completion or within 6
      hours of withdrawal. Autologous blood will be given to patient during surgery at any point if
      there are 30% or more body blood volume loss.

      Allogenic blood will be administered when the intraoperative hemoglobin concentration fell
      below 8g/dl despite completion of autologous blood transfusion or when autologous blood not
      available; adequate volume correction by mean of collected autologous blood and crystalloid
      fluid administration, or when presence of ischemic electrocardiogram changes (2mV ST segment
      elevation or depression on 3 leads monitoring); persistent hypotension or tachycardia >20%
      from baseline.
