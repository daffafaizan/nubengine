    
      Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised with a sudden onset , with pains in the little finger
      or toe joints, progressively affecting various joints and symptomatic morning stiffness. For
      subjects with RA, morning stiffness entails a quite essential restriction in the everyday
      life and in the life quality. This observational, uncontrolled, multicentric study is aimed
      to assess the improvement in the activity status or QoL of subjects with RA being treated
      with the Tempus tablet. A total of 8,000 subjects with diagnosed, active RA will be included
      in the study The study will apply to 2 target groups: general physicians, practicing doctors
      and interns (in-house doctors) with an observation period of 3 months; and specialists
      (rheumatologist) with an observation period of 9 months. Three subjects are expected per
      in-house doctor and 10 subjects per rheumatologist.
