    
      Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. Current
      research suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is primarily spread through droplets and
      aerosols. As per current literature, the spread through asymptomatic carriers, as well as
      highly contagious carriers ('super spreader') play an important role in the infectiousness of
      the virus. It is currently unclear, if the contagiousness of children differs from adults.

      In the proposed investigation, measurement of the particle size and concentration in
      respiratory aerosols will be conducted via the Resp-Aer-Meter (Palas GmbH). First step will
      be to establish the measurements with this new device. Thereafter, a comparison between PCR
      SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative participants, as well as between children and adults, will
      be conducted. In addition to the measurement of aerosols, the clinical symptoms suggestive of
      COVID-19, lung function (FEV1) and laboratory inflammatory markers, if available, will be
      analyzed.
