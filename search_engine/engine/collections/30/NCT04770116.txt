      controls (30 intervention, 30 sham). This was estimated from a power analysis and based on
      previous results. Patients are recruited from the University Children's Hospital Zurich.

      At first, the participants will complete a baseline assessment of neuropsychological measures
      (cognitive tests and questionnaires). After completion of the baseline assessment, the
      participants receive deep sleep enhancement with auditory stimulation for seven nights, but
      half of them will only receive sham stimulation (device application, but no stimulation).
      Additionally, they wear an actigraph throughout the whole week. Afterwards, they fill in
      again some questionnaires (intermediate assessment). One month after study inclusion, the
      first follow-up will take place where neuropsychological and (optionally) neurological
      measures will be collected. The second follow-up takes place six months after study inclusion
      and involves again filling in questionnaires about post-concussive symptoms.

      The study will be monitored regularly in terms of data validation and source data
      verification. Adverse events and device deficiencies are carefully documented and reported
      according to the guidelines of swissmedic and the responsible ethics committee.
