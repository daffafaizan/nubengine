    
      Type 2 diabetes is an atherosclerotic, pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative stress.Both
      vascular oxidative stress and inflammation are CVD risk factors and impact endothelial
      function.

      Carvedilol has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies (although limited in
      size) to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties: (1) reduce the inflammation
      markers such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); (2) reduce oxidative stress via
      dually eliminating existing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppressing the generation of
      ROS; (3) prevent lipid peroxidation in myocardial cell membrane; (4) protect endothelial and
      vascular muscle cells from oxygen radical-mediated injury.

      This project is about studying the effect of carvedilol CR on blood vessels of diabetic
      hypertensive patients as compared to Lisinopril alone.

      This study involves weaning patient off their current antihypertensive medications and
      starting them on Lisinopril and Carvedilol CR or placebo for 6 months and studying the
      effects of the drugs during this period and thereafter.
