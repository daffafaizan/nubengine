    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and doxorubicin
      hydrochloride (doxorubicin) in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

      II. To assess the clinical response rate of advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients
      receiving the combination of pembrolizumab and doxorubicin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with
      respect to time to response.

      II. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with
      respect to duration of response.

      III. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with
      respect to progression-free survival (PFS).

      IV. To explore the clinical activity of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced STS with
      respect to overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare response rates between patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression with those
      who have PD-L1 absent.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of doxorubicin hydrochloride followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 1-3 hours on day 1 of courses 2-7 only. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
