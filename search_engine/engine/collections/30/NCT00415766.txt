      maturation and to trigger ovulation in assisted conception. Recombinant technology has
      allowed the production of r-hCG inj which all urinary contaminants are absent. Hence, this
      would allow the safe subcutaneous administration of a compound with less batch-to-batch
      variation. This study will investigate the effectiveness of the recombinant hCG compared to
      the currently used urinary hCG.
