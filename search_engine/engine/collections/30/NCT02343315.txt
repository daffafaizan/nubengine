      in globally as well as in Nepal. There is no consensus on treatment of CLBP, however motor
      control exercises have good evidence on improvement in pain and disability in CLBP
      population, whereas transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a common treatment
      of choice with some evidence. But, we do not know if supervising these motor control
      exercises (SMCE) and TENS have any added benefit over home exercise program (HEP) which is
      commonly prescribed mode of exercises. We plan to conduct a three armed randomized control
      trial to answer this question to compare effects of SMCE, TENS and HEP versus SMCE and HEP
      versus HEP alone on disability and pain at two weeks and six months follow up. Three
      way-mixed model analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used as the statistical test.
      Appropriate post hoc analysis will be done to compare within group and between group
      differences.
