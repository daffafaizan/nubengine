      patients with biliary pancreatitis may recover spontaneously without sequelae, but in 10-20%
      of patients, the disease is severe and mortality rates of up to 30% are detected in these
      patients. In patients with severe pancreatitis, aggressive fluid replacement, organ damage
      follow-up, appropriate antibiotherapy, and endoscopic sphincterotomy and radiological
      interventions may be of great benefit. In the evaluation of acute biliary pancreatitis, many
      scoring systems have been established (Atlanta, Ranson, APACHE, BISAP etc.) from past to
      present to determine morbidity and mortality of the disease. There are limited number of
      studies in the literature about the immune parameters in the evaluation of acute
      pancreatitis. In a studies, serum inflammatory markers such as IL-1, IL-6 and CD4, CD8 T
      lymphocyte and Treg population were evaluated.Treg cells are reported to be an independent
      prognostic factor in determining the severity of acute pancreatitis. In patients diagnosed
      with acute biliary pancreatitis, determination of the course of the disease at the time of
      diagnosis is extremely important for treatment and survival.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the correlation between morbidity and
      mortality of acute biliary pancreatitis with lymphocyte subtypes via Flow-cytometry.
