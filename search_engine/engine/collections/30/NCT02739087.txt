      catheterization lab. Next the participant is transferred into the MRI scanner where a focused
      MRI examination is performed. Catheters are then guided into the heart chambers using
      real-time MRI guidance to perform conventional cardiac catheterization steps. If time allows,
      additional research MRI is performed before the participant is returned to the x-ray
      catheterization lab. If any MRI guided catheterization steps are unsuccessful, the clinically
      indicated step is performed after the participant returns to the x-ray catheterization lab
      using conventional x-ray guided pictures.
