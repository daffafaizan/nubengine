      can save lives, it can lead to some serious side effects such as infection or liver damage.
      The risk for those effects increases the longer people are on PN.

      Teduglutide is an investigative medicine being evaluated as a possible treatment for people
      with PN-dependent SBS. Teduglutide is similar to a protein the body makes. When people have
      SBS, their bodies do not make enough of the protein and they have trouble getting nutrients
      and fluids from the food they eat and drink. We want to see if teduglutide can help decrease
      the amount of PN needed because the body is doing a better job of taking up what it eats and
      drinks. We also want to find out how safe teduglutide is and record any side effects.
