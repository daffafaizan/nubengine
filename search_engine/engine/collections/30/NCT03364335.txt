      of two fixed-dose combinations of leucine and sildenafil or two fixed-dose combinations of
      leucine, sildenafil and metformin compared to placebo. Subjects meeting all the inclusion
      criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of five study arms.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the percentage change in body weight in
      subjects from Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1) to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24)
      receiving two fixed-dose combinations of leucine and sildenafil or two fixed-dose
      combinations of leucine, sildenafil and metformin compared to placebo. Secondary objectives
      will also assess changes in absolute body weight, percentage of patients with â‰¥5% body weight
      loss, change in waist circumference, change in HbA1c, change in fasting glucose, change in
      blood lipids such as cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, change in blood pressure and
      changes in in C-reactive protein. In addition this study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of NS-0200 and NS-0300.

      Patients will have one screening visits which will determine their eligibility based on lab
      tests. Once qualified, patients will be randomly assigned to either one of the treatment
      groups or the placebo control group and monitored for a total of 24 weeks. Patients will
      return to the clinic each month for lab tests, and routine examinations.
