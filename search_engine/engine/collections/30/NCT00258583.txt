      Simmons Center for Interstitial Lung Disease to to place past, current, and future medical
      record information into a UPMC Simmons Center for Interstitial Lung Disease Research
      Registry. By placing the medical record information of many patients into a research
      registry, researchers will be able to conduct research studies directed at increasing our
      knowledge about interstitial lung disease. It is anticipated that the research registry will
      assist out investigators by allowing researchers to review and study the medical records of
      many individuals to answer questions about interstitial lung disease and its treatment. In
      addition, it will help researchers identify and recruit patients for participation in future
      research studies.
