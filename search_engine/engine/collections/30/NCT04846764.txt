      have been selected based on the literature and previous work of CHU Rennes team. They are two
      experiments that have produced promising results concerning the existence of a rapid
      neocortical learning system in declarative memory, and have in common the use of prior
      knowledge to promote learning.

      In the first part of the study, these two tasks will be put in competition for their
      resistance to the effects of age. Brain aging is characterized by its deleterious impact on
      hippocampal functioning, and memory aging leads to an alteration of associative memory.
      Therefore, this first part will allow the learning paradigm that presents the best potential
      in brain-damaged patients to be retained in the second part of the ANéRAVIMM study.

      The third task stems from recent work by CHU Rennes team in collaboration with Dr. Besson of
      the University of Liege, in the context of a very recent model of memory. It aims at
      estimating the ability to develop a representation of visual objects in memory at the entity
      level, i.e. an integrated representation, unifying all the perceptual, conceptual and
      contextual features of perceived information. This task has been adapted for the ANéRAVIMM
      project in order to test the hypothesis that this mnemonic representational level of the
      entity in memory could support rapid neocortical associative learning in declarative memory.
