    
      This trial is a single-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Up to six patients with
      confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma; six newly diagnosed, high-risk patients with
      prostate adenocarcinoma; and up to six healthy volunteers will receive 20.0 (Â± 3) mCi of
      intravenously administered 99mTc MIP 1404 or 99mTc MIP 1405. Whole-body planar scintigraphic
      images will be acquired at various times post-injection over 24 hours. A pelvic SPECT/CT
      image will be acquired on the first day. Blood and urine will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic measurements and metabolic analysis over 24 hours. Each patient will receive
      an initial study drug administration and a second study drug administration approximately 14
      to 21 days after the first. A final follow-up visit will occur approximately 2-3 weeks after
      the second study drug.
