    
      Time in the waiting list for undergoing AT at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Chania
      General Hospital "St. George" is approximately 3 months. In the present study, children will
      be recruited and randomized in the Active Comparator (AT group) or in the Control Group (No
      AT group) at the time of the initial clinic visit, if they fulfill the Inclusion Criteria and
      their parents consent to participation in the study.

      Children in the AT group will undergo the baseline study evaluation at the end of the 3-month
      waiting time and thus immediately prior to AT. They will also undergo the follow-up study
      evaluation at 3 months postoperatively.

      Children in the Control group will undergo their baseline study evaluation at the time of
      entering the surgical waiting list. They will undergo the follow-up study evaluation 3 months
      later, immediately prior to AT.
