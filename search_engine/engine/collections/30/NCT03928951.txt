      antibiotic prescriptions. Increase of bacteria resistance to antibiotics is promoted by an
      inappropriate use of those antibiotics but initial prescription in emergency departments is
      complicated by brief clinical examinations, unavailable sampling results and risks of
      multi-resistant bacteria. Large diffusion of new recommendations for urinary infection
      management should improve the quality of initial antibiotic prescription. However emergency
      physicians have no knowledge of the reassessment of antibiotherapy 48 to 72 hours after
      initial prescription by general practitioners which is a quality criterion of good antibiotic
      use. The main purpose of this study is to estimate the reassessment rate by general
      practitioners of the urinary infection antibiotherapies prescribed in emergency departments.

      Patients will be informed during their consultation in one of Toulon - La Seyne sur Mer
      hospital emergency departments. If they don't express opposition to their data collection,
      they will be included. A form will then be completed by emergency physicians with initial
      prescribed antibiotherapy, patients' general practitioners contact information and if
      patients have a shared medical file or not. 4 to 5 days later, patients' general
      practitioners will be contacted to know if urinary analysis results were transferred from
      emergency department to practitioners, if antibiotherapy was modified and if patients' shared
      medical file was consulted.
