      diagnosis of chronic liver diseases. Detection and staging of liver fibrosis has become
      important; however, until about the last decade, it depended on an invasive liver biopsy.
      Liver biopsy is limited by high cost, low patient acceptance, interobserver variability
      during microscopic evaluation, sampling error, poor reproducibility, and, importantly, an
      invasive nature with a complication rate of 3% and a mortality rate of 0.03%. With the
      emergence of elastography techniques, the need for liver biopsy has rapidly diminished for
      diagnosis of clinically significant liver fibrosis. Magnetic Resonance Elastography has
      gained increasing popularity in recent years, in large part due to its higher technical
      success and ability to overcome some of the weaknesses of ultrasound-based methods for
      assessing liver fibrosis.
