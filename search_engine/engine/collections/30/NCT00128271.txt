      common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States and the leading indication for liver
      transplantation. Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that bavituximab binds
      viruses and virally infected cells and prolongs survival in infected animals. This study will
      examine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab when administered to patients with chronic
      HCV infection who do not respond to or relapse after treatment with pegylated interferon plus
      ribavirin combination therapy. Groups of patients will be treated with escalating doses and
      followed for 12 weeks.
