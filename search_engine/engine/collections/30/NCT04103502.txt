      however, we will increase enrollment to 24 subjects (12 in each group) to ensure that
      researchers acquire the necessary 20 usable datasets for analysis and also to account for any
      subjects that may drop out of the study. All TKAs should be judged clinically successful
      based on the surgeon's evaluation and each patient's Forgotten Knee Score. Each subject
      should have a well-functioning prosthesis, be at least six months post-operative, and should
      have good-to-excellent post-operative passive flexion.
