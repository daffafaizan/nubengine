    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine the safety of bintrafusp alfa in combination with hypofractionated radiation
      therapy for patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and recommend a phase II
      radiation dose.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate objective response rate, local progression free survival, progression free
      survival, overall survival with the study regimen.

      II. To correlate expression of TGF-beta related pathways with clinical outcomes.

      III. To examine intratumoral pharmacodynamic changes in the immune microenvironment using
      paired biopsies before and after therapy with the study agents.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To correlate immune biomarkers from pre- and post-treatment tissue, blood, and stool with
      clinical study endpoints.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of radiation therapy followed by a dose-expansion
      study.

      Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy once daily (QD) on weekdays
      (Monday-Friday) for 15 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Beginning 1 week after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive bintrafusp
      alfa intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days for up to 2 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2
      years.
