      already existing study, and who have been followed since birth. Reward processing will be
      measured in two temporally close testing sessions involving two methodologies,
      electrophysiology and fMRI. Information will also be collected pertaining to experimental and
      problematic drug use, as well as information about mood, at the recording sessions. Drug use
      and mood information will then be collected once again in quarterly follow-up sessions for
      one year. The goal is to examine if PCE status and reward processing are risk factors for
      problematic drug abuse and risky behaviors in emerging adulthood, and if these factors
      interact to increase such risk.
