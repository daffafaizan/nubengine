      the Korea national statistical office, suicide is the second major cause of death in
      adolescents and is increasing. Depression, one of the well-known risk factors of suicide in
      adolescents, can cause maladjustments to school and family life, problems of interpersonal
      relationship and drug abuse so that work to trigger the suicidal ideation and behavior. In
      his study, we planned to examine the relationship between suicidal ideation and behavior and
      several risk factors by using the standardized diagnostic clinical interview, especially an
      objective suicide evaluating method which has recently developed.
