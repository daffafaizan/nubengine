      disease prior to June 2011 were analyzed. Following this analysis, a staging system was
      defined based on morphological extent of disease (stage I to stage IV for primary disease,
      and stage R for recurrent disease). Specific surgical technique was used for each stage.
      "Pit-picking" technique was performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis in stage
      I and stage IIa patients. For stage IIb and stage III patients, the Bascom Cleft Lift
      /modified Bascom Cleft Lift techniques were performed. For stage IV patients, the rhomboid
      excision with the Limberg flap technique was used. Demographics, perioperative data,
      short-term and long-term outcomes were evaluated according to the disease stage.
