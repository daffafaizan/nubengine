    
      This PMOS will be conducted in a prospective, open-label, single-country, multicenter format.
      The investigational sites will be consulting rooms of GPs (general practitioner),
      pneumologists and centers with experience in the treatment of patients with lower respiratory
      tract infection, AECB (acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis) and CAP (mild
      community-acquired pneumonia). Since this will be a PMOS, Klacid®SR will be prescribed in
      usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local market authorization with regards to
      dose, population and indication as well as local guidelines. The decision to prescribe or not
      prescribe Klacid®SR would be taken prior to entry of a subject in the study.

      Follow-up of patients should enable two patient visits during this period.
      Screening/Inclusion Visit will be performed when the decision to start the treatment with
      Klacid®SR is made. Inclusion of patient in the study will succeed at day 0 (S/I Visit). The
      Second Visit will follow 10 - 16 days after the Screening/Inclusion Visit.
