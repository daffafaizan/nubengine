      will aid the dental community in fabricating properly designed prostheses that can
      predictably survive the oral environment.

      Patients who qualify for this study will be randomized (as in chanced with the flip of a
      coin) into two groups. The first group is a metal-ceramic group where patients will receive a
      bridge with a metal substructure underneath. The second group is an all-ceramic group where
      patients will receive a bridge which is made of hard ceramic material. All patients will
      receive two dental implants which will bond to bone for a period of 4-6 months. An impression
      or mold of the implants will then be made and a bridge will be fabricated based on the
      randomization of the patient. Patients will be asked to return at 6 months and yearly
      thereafter up to 5 years. During these recall appointments, photographs will be taken and
      impressions of the bridge and other teeth will be made. This will allow us to measure the
      amount of wear happening with the bridge and the other teeth. The investigators can also
      examine the amount of bone around the implants as well as the integrity of the bridge.
