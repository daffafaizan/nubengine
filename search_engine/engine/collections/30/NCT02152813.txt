    
      This proposed study aims to compare the effects of unilateral and bilateral transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). It will compare the effectiveness of bilateral TENS +
      task-oriented training (TOT) with unilateral TENS+TOTin improving muscle strength,
      co-ordination, dynamic standing balance, walking performance, and functional mobility in
      patients with chronic stroke.

      The null hypothesis will be that bilateral TENS+TOT and unilateral TENS+TOT are not
      significantly different in promoting the recovery of these functions.
