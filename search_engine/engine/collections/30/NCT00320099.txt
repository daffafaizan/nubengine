    
      Objectives:

      Comparison, in patients with septic shock, of efficacy and safety of the combination of
      moderate doses of corticosteroids and intensive insulin therapy to that of moderate doses of
      corticosteroids; and of efficacy and safety of hydrocortisone alone versus hydrocortisone
      plus fludrocortisone Methods

      Study design :

      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomised trial on parallel groups

      Study treatments :

      Experimental arm A:

      A1=50 mg iv every 6 hours of hydrocortisone (hemisuccinate), 50µg through the nasogastric
      tube of 9 alpha fludrocortisone, for 7 days AND strict control of blood glucose levels with a
      target of 4,4 to 6 mmol/L using continuous iv infusion of insulin up to intensive care unit
      discharge.

      A2=50 mg iv every 6 hours of hydrocortisone (hemisuccinate) for 7 days AND strict control of
      blood glucose levels with a target of 4,4 to 6 mmol/L using continuous iv infusion of insulin
      up to intensive care unit discharge.

      Control arm B:

      B1:50 mg iv every 6 hours of hydrocortisone (hemisuccinate), 50µg through the nasogastric
      tube of 9 alpha fludrocortisone, for 7 days.

      B2:50 mg iv every 6 hours of hydrocortisone (hemisuccinate)for 7 days. Study Primary outcome
      : In-hospital mortality

      Sample size calculation :

      The expected in-hospital mortality rate in the control group is 50%. To detect an absolute
      reduction in in-hospital mortality rate of 12.5 %, that is 37.5% in the experimental arm
      versus 50% in the control arm, and considering risk alpha of 0,05 and a risk beta of 0,20,
      254 patients per treatment arms are needed, for a total of 508 patients.
