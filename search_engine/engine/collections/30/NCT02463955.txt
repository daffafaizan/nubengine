      bronchoscopes. The latter is less invasive and less expensive, but flexible bronchoscopes are
      difficult to manipulate within the pleural cavity and do not provide an adequate orientation
      within the pleural space. It is therefore associated with a lower diagnostic yield than
      thoracoscopy with rigid thoracoscopes. On the other hand, rigid thoracoscopes are associated
      with more pain, a higher cost, and usually require one-lung ventilation. Gastro-intestinal
      endoscopes allow a better orientation than bronchoscopes in cavities, and have wider
      operative channels. The EXPLORE study investigates the feasibility and safety of single port
      transdiaphragmatic thoracoscopy using a flexible gastro-intestinal endoscope under two-lung
      ventilation with controlled capnothorax.
