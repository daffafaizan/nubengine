      developing insomnia. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a key component of COPD management, yet it
      does not address sleep. Comorbid insomnia may interfere with Veterans achieving maximum
      benefits from pulmonary rehabilitation. Implementing an insomnia-specific treatment in
      Veterans with COPD undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation will likely lead to improved sleep
      that could help improve and sustain the benefits gained from pulmonary rehabilitation.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare sleep and health-related
      functioning in Veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and insomnia
      receiving an Internet-based behavioral treatment for insomnia during home-based pulmonary
      rehabilitation (HBPR) versus those only receiving HBPR. Veterans 40 years and older, who
      received care from the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, and who have COPD and insomnia will
      be recruited for this study. Participants will undergo a sleep and health assessment that
      will be performed prior to the beginning of HBPR and at the end of HBPR and 6-months later.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either Internet-based behavioral treatment for
      insomnia plus HBPR or HBPR only. Both the insomnia treatment and HBPR will be provided
      remotely.
