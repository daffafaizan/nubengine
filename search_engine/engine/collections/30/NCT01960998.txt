      pelvic floor muscle training including bladder control strategies has been shown to reduce
      the severity of incontinence and reduce the time to regaining continence. This study will
      test an evidence-based pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to
      telehealth format and pilot tested in a VA-funded pilot/developmental trial. Training is
      begun 1-4 weeks before surgery and continued 6 months after surgery. Content is accessed on a
      secure website in daily 10-minute sessions which transition to weekly sessions for
      post-operative months 3-6. In the investigators' pilot study, Veterans reported that they
      appreciated receiving the training in the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive
      style of the learning experience, and felt better prepared to deal with urine leakage and
      empowered with new knowledge and skills to help themselves.

      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of the telehealth-delivered, evidence-based,
      intervention developed in the pilot/developmental study. Participants will be randomized 1:1
      to treatment or to a control group. Content for both control and treatment groups includes
      general information about prostate cancer; perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care
      management. The treatment group will ALSO receive pelvic floor muscle training and bladder
      control strategies. Outcomes are measured with brief validated questions administered by the
      telehealth platform, and again at 9 and 12 months by mailed questionnaire or the telehealth
      platform.
