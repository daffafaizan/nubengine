      water (e.g. along coasts). For centuries, these plants have been used in folk medicine, and
      among other things they are believed to have pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effect.

      Even though experiments have already investigated halophytes as a pain relieving substance,
      the mechanisms in relation to pain and/or itch are still unknown. Therefore, the
      investigators wish to investigate whether halophyte-based cream applied to the skin can
      reduce itch applied by means of small needles from the plant mucuna pruriens (also called
      cowhage) or by histamine (an itch-evoking substance formed in the human body). Further, the
      investigators wishes to investigate whether long-term application of halophyte-based cream
      has a pain-relieving effect on heat/cold and pinprick stimulations.
