      I. Optimize and develop functional DCE-MRI pulse sequences, which involve the injection of
      MRI-visible contrast agents, for imaging in the head/neck, abdominal and pelvic regions.

      II. Determine the ideal radiofrequency (RF) coil setup to maximize signal to noise ratio of
      the optimized pulse sequences.

      III. Distill the findings of specific aims 1 and 2 into streamlined protocols that can be
      used in subsequent studies for cancer phenotyping and treatment monitoring in a quantitative
      manner.

      IV. To establish a virtual reference image repository for future studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo DCE-MRI over approximately 30-60 minutes consisting of an
      anatomical scout image to localize the region of interest, a set of pre-injection scans to
      calibrate the dynamic image set, a dynamic image set during which contrast agent will be
      injected, and a set of post-injection scans to calibrate the DCE-MRI database.
