      in preventing heterosexual acquisition of HIV infection among women. This Phase III study is
      powered to detect effectiveness (biological efficacy combined with adherence) of 33 percent.
      Women in South Africa and Zimbabwe (N=4,500) at risk of contracting HIV will be invited to
      participate and will be followed for up to 24 months, with a total study duration of 4 years.
      All women will receive safer-sex counseling, free male condoms and diagnosis and treatment of
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Half of the participants will be randomly selected to
      receive an Ortho All-Flex latex diaphragm and Replens lubricant gel. We will assess whether
      women using diaphragms and lubricant gel have lower rates of HIV or STI infection than do
      their non-diaphragm and gel counterparts. Additionally, we will investigate the long-term
      acceptability of the diaphragm in this study population.
