      because of the advent of better SL designs, better materials, and greater awareness of the
      technology. SL market growth has also likely increased because SLs were once reserved for
      patients with complex ocular surface diseases, though advances with SL technologies have
      allowed SL fitting to include patients with dry eye and even patients who have relatively
      uncomplicated refractive errors. While SLs are maintained and cared for much like soft
      contact lenses (e.g., they require a contact lens care system), SL wearers also need help
      with applying their lenses. Patients specifically are advised by their care provider to
      insert their SLs with their fingers (tripod method), a DMV inserter with an open or closed
      end (hole potentially aides in vision), or a specialized o-ring that is balanced on a finger.
      Our clinic also utilizes a tea light candle with a DMV inserter attached to the top of it
      when patients have mobility issues. While work from this investigator's study group has found
      that 54% of patients prefer DMV inserters for applying their SLs as compared to the above
      other options, these preliminary data were obtained through a cross-sectional electronic
      survey from subjects who completed their SL fitting up to two years ago. Therefore, the goal
      of this proposal is to conduct a randomized controlled study aimed at learning the best
      method for applying SLs and factors associated with successfully completing SL application
      and removal training. These data are needed because it will help practitioners with patient
      education and because it may increase the likelihood that patients will be successful with
      SLs.
