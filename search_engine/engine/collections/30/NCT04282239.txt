      nerves (PECS) block 2 to alleviate post-operative pain in cardiac surgery patients. The
      investigators anticipate enrolling a total of 220 participants in one of two groups, an
      interventional PECS block group and a control group not receiving the block. The intervention
      will occur in the operating room after the completion of the cardiac procedure and prior to
      the transfer of the participants to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU). Both
      groups will receive the standard-of-care (SOC) pain regimen; the intervention with receive
      the PECS block in addition to SOC pain regimen. The procedure takes approximately five to ten
      minutes and will be conducted by the attending cardiac anesthesiologist. Pain will then be
      monitored hourly in the post-operative period in the CTICU. Additional measures will be
      investigated that are regularly logged in the electronic medical record.
