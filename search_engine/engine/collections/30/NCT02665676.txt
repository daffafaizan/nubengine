      Embryonal tumors arise from cells that are normally present in the developing embryo and
      originate in developing tissues and organ systems. These tumors occur almost exclusively in
      children, and are usually diagnosed in children before age 5 years.

      The group is heterogeneous and includes relatively common pediatric tumors as well as rare
      tumors. Three common types of embryonal tumors in children are neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor
      (WT), and retinoblastoma. Other embryonal tumors, include medulloblastoma and
      rhabdomyosarcoma.

      Patients & Methods:

      From January 2001 to December 2015, retrieval & analysis of the medical records of pediatric
      patients with embryonal tumors will be made at the pediatric oncology department, South Egypt
      Cancer Institute which represents the largest referral center in Upper Egypt. These data will
      be categorized according to demographic characteristics, clinico-pathologic features,
      treatment modalities received, and outcomes of treatments in these patients.
