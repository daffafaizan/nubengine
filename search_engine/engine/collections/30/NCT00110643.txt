      laser therapy, a technique that uses laser energy to try to improve the appearance of skin.
      This type of laser treatment creates changes in a layer of the skin called the dermis without
      causing an open wound in the skin. It is not yet clear how much improvement can be seen with
      these treatments or exactly how the skin's response causes these improvements. In this study,
      we are interested in learning how well such a laser works to improve the symptoms of acne.
      The laser used in this particular study will be the CoolTouch IIÂ® laser, manufactured by ICN
      Photonics, Inc., and has not been FDA-approved for the treatment of acne.
