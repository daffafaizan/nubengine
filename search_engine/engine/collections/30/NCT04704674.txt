      improved assays are needed to measure the efficacy of vaccines. Transmission-blocking
      vaccines (TBVs) work by inducing antibodies that inhibit parasite development in the mosquito
      interrupting transmission. Efficacy of vaccines may be estimated by in vitro membrane feeding
      assays using immune sera and laboratory mosquitoes, but qualified assays that measure
      transmission in the field are needed to assess transmission-blocking interventions in natura.
      Clinical trials of TBVs have started elsewhere on the continent in Mali, and we expect to
      expand TBV studies here in Liberia in the near future. This protocol will use a longitudinal
      cohort to gather information of malaria transmission based on the rates of blood smear
      positive individuals by month, season and year in Fleh-la and Marshansue, in Salala, Bong
      County, Liberia. Individuals in the villages will be approached first for participation,
      including permission to contact their household and neighbors of their compound for
      participation. Households will be identified using census data and individuals will be
      consented for participation. Malaria smears will be obtained at monthly visits, in
      conjunction with mosquito collections in/around village residences. Parasite infection rates
      in locally caught mosquitoes will be assessed longitudinally for differences by season and
      year. A total of 400 volunteers from Fleh-la and Marshansue will be enrolled. Participants
      will be followed for up to 3 years, to collect data that will guide the design of future
      community-based trials of TBV.
