      deformity to nearly any alignment desired. The investigators ability to analyze spino-pelvic
      alignment has evolved concurrently; however, the investigators goals in deformity correction
      are still not completely understood. With increasing ability to assess whole body alignment,
      the investigators must establish a baseline for the "normal" population inclusive of age
      related changes. the investigators hypothesis is that global body alignment will vary based
      on sex and progressively vary with age.

      The goal of this study is to create an open access database of "normal" volunteer full body
      radiographic images obtained using the new EOS biplanar x-ray imaging system. The system
      provides a radiographic view of the weight-bearing skeleton equivalent to plain radiography.
      The development of an open access database of full body images and global spine parameters
      will provide spine surgeons with normative data that can be used to guide clinical decision
      making and surgical planning. Furthermore, the database can be used by researchers to obtain
      control measurements for comparison in studies of various spine, and potentially non-spine,
      pathologies.

      Specific Aims

        1. To create an open access database of radiographic full body images in the sagittal and
           coronal planes of subjectswithout spine deformities or acute or severe chronic disease,
           across a range of age groups from 20 to 80 year old males and females.

        2. To document age related changes that occur in radiographic parameters in the spine and
           pelvis by including subjects across a wide range of ages.
