      I. To determine progression free survival (PFS) for 6 months (PFS-6) in patients with
      recurrent or progressive meningioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival (OS). II. To determine tumor response rate (TRR). III. To
      assess quality of life with treatment (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      courses 1-4. Beginning on day 1 of course 5, patients may choose to receive bevacizumab IV
      every 3 weeks or remain on the every 2-week schedule. Patients also undergo electric field
      therapy using Optune (formerly NovoTTF-200A System) daily over 18 hours. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
