      individual predictors of HCV reinfection in Kenya, as well as identifying individual
      utilization intervention approaches and dosing that reduce reinfection risk and treatment
      cite level risk factors (frequency of visits, community vs hospital location etc.).
      Determining the risk factors specific to reinfection and understanding the impact of
      concurrent harm reduction interventions will guide service delivery and implementation of HCV
      elimination strategies in Kenya and throughout the region.
