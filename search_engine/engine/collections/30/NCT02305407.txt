      impairment (VCI) is the consequence of ischemic damage to dynamic factors such as cerebral
      hypoperfusion, rather than to cerebral gray matter. However, it is still unclear which
      regions are affected by MMD and how these regions respond to the progressive cognitive
      decline. In other way, the investigators need to detect spatial patterns in the brain
      activity of MMD in order to understand its pathophysiological nature.

      Surgical revascularization has been accepted as the only effective form of treatment in
      preventing future ischemic episodes. However, its effectiveness in cognitive protection is
      still unknown. Thus, the investigators determine to quantitatively evaluate cognitive and
      radiological outcomes in adult MMD postoperatively and during follow-ups.
