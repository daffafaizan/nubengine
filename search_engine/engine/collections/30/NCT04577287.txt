      impairment. After stroke, the cortical excitability of ipsilesional hemisphere is decreased;
      in contrast, the cortical excitability of contralesional hemisphere is increased.
      Conventional physical therapy is beneficial to motor recovery, but early rehabilitation was
      not always help the patients get full recovery. tDCS is an adjuvant tools which deliver weak
      direct current through scalp to promote motor recovery in stroke rehabilitation. The
      anodal-tDCS increases cortical excitability, while the cathodal-tDCS decreases cortical
      excitability. Previous studies demonstrated that both monocephalic techniques of tDCS can
      improve motor function in chronic, subacute, and acute phase, but it is still inconclusive
      that which monocephalic montages had better effect, especially in acute phase. There are
      several studies supported the benefits of monocephalic tDCS combined with rehabilitation
      programs on upper and lower limbs motor function in acute stroke. However, there is no
      evidence that directly compared the effect of monocephalic tDCS in acute stroke patients. The
      objective of the study is to compare the effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS combined with
      conventional physical therapy for 5 sessions on motor performance in acute stroke at
      immediate, and 1-month follow-up.
