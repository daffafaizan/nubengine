      divided into experimental group and control group, in order to verify the effects of adding
      load on gait symmetry after stroke. 40 individuals will participate, and the calculation of
      sample size was performed from the ratio variable symmetry of swing time, based on previous
      study. Whereas about 15% of individuals could give up to participate in the study during
      their course (dropout rate), we determined a number of 20 participants in each group.
