      one-third of abortions in the United States in 2014. Although women generally tolerate
      medical abortion well, pain and bleeding are common and expected side effects. Up to a
      quarter of women rate their pain as severe during their procedure. Pain management for
      medical abortion is challenging given that the most acute pain occurs at home rather than
      under the supervision of medical professionals. Currently there is insufficient evidence to
      recommend an optimal regimen for pain control in medication abortion and there are concerns
      surrounding narcotic prescribing and the opiate abuse epidemic. This is a four-arm,
      prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing dextromethorphan
      administration in conjunction with the current standard regimen (NSAIDs and narcotic
      medication by request- commonly oxycodone or codeine) to the standard regimen alone. Pain
      will be evaluated by analgesia usage and self-reported pain scores. Investigators will also
      investigate factors influencing pain and subjective components of the patient narrative.
      Ideally, a non-opioid adjunct to NSAIDs or narcotics could be used to control pain and
      significantly curtail or avoid opioid use. Investigators seek to test the efficacy and safety
      of dextromethorphan as a non-narcotic analgesic for medication abortion.
