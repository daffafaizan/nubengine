      development in order to maximize the benefits of individual drug therapy while minimizing
      adverse cognitive/language-related side effects. The investigators' objective in this
      application is to elucidate the relationship among drug exposure as measured by plasma drug
      levels, its neurophysiological effects, and consequent effects on the cognitive processes
      observable in everyday language use. Using topiramate (TPM) as a prototype, the investigators
      will apply the tools of clinical pharmacology, computational linguistics, neuroscience, and
      engineering to the design and execution of randomized, double blind, crossover studies using
      three (3) doses of TPM, one (1) dose of a comparator drug (lorazepam-LZP) and a placebo. In
      order to isolate the cognitive effects of TPM from those possibly arising from an underlying
      medical condition, subjects will be healthy adults. The investigators will capitalize on an
      innovative system for automated language and speech analysis (SALSA) developed in our
      laboratory, to quantify the effects of TPM administration on effective language use, a
      crucial component of normal day-to-day functioning.
