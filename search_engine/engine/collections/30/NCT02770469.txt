      intervention group. Participants attended seven weekly sessions and one follow-up session
      that lasted for about 2 hours each. All sessions were conducted by two Korean female
      bilingual licensed clinical psychologists.

      The specific aims of this study were to: (1) Implement and evaluate the effects of tailored
      intervention on perceived stress, coping and quality of life among Korean American breast
      cancer survivors; and (2) Conduct a process evaluation to assess the feasibility and fidelity
      of the intervention, which will provide data that can inform the development of future
      interventions.
