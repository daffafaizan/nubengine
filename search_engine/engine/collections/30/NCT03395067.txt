      obesity prior to IVF on global reproductive outcomes and maternofetal metabolic and
      cardiovascular risk factors.

      This is a randomized controlled trial in obese infertile women (body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m2)
      before starting an IVF cycle. In the intervention group, the aim is a weight loss of at least
      10% in a 16-week period of treatment based on a multidisciplinary approach and support
      groups, which includes diet, physical activity and psychological therapy. IVF will be started
      immediately after this period. Patients included in the control group will start an IVF cycle
      immediately after the randomization. The results of this study may allow the identification
      of patients who would benefit from obesity treatment, so as to establish appropriate
      preventive and therapeutic strategies and to reduce the maternal obesity impact in future
      generations.
