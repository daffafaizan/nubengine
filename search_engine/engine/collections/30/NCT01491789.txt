      VSail-Access simulator is a variation on the VSail where the cockpit is fitted with a seat.
      The VSail simulator is a generic sailboat cockpit powered by a pneumatic ram and custom
      designed software. The sailor sails the simulator around virtual courses displayed on a
      computer screen in the same way as a real sailboat on water. Electronic sensors provide real
      time feedback to match the movements of the virtual sailboat displayed on the screen with
      those of the simulator. Sailors can select wind strength and conditions to suit their
      ability.
