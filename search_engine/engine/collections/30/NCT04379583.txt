      variants are detected from a saliva sample collected at home. The HairDx Test report is
      designed to help individuals understand the meaning of their results and encourage a
      conversation with a healthcare professional. The information provided by the HairDx Test
      report is not intended to start, stop or change any course of treatment. The purpose of this
      study is to collect DNA samples from subjects. The DNA samples will be used for the
      analytical validation of the HairDx Test. The results of this study will not be shared with
      the subjects.
