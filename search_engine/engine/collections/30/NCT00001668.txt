      in a syndrome of multiple neoplasias. Patients with VHL disease develop retinal angiomata,
      renal cysts and/or carcinomas, CNS hemangioblastomas as well as pancreatic cysts and
      pheochromocytomas. Investigators have shown the gene to be a tumor suppressor type
      proto-oncogene located at chromosomal locus 3p26. The gene includes three exons whose gene
      product targets a cellular transcription factor Elongin SIII. Binding of the VHL proteins to
      two subunits of this elongation factor inhibits transcription and may play a crucial role in
      the clinical development of the von Hippel Lindau phenotype.
