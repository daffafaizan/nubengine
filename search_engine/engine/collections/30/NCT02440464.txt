    
      The study is designed as a Phase II, multi-center double-blind trial that randomizes patients
      with high risk Multiple Myeloma to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo 60-120 days after
      allogeneic HSCT. The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare progression
      free survival from randomization as a time to event endpoint between patients randomized to
      Ixazomib maintenance or placebo. Secondary objectives are to describe for each treatment arm:
      rates of grade II-IV and III-IV Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, best disease
      response rates, disease progression, transplant related mortality, overall survival, rates of
      Grade â‰¥ 3 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      Version 4.0, incidence of infections, and health-related quality of life.
