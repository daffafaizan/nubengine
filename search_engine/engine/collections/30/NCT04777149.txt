      can restrict independence, social participation, and overall quality of life. Evidence shows
      that short duration of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can strengthen the transmission
      of information through the spared corticospinal pathways and improve UE functional recovery
      in individuals with tetraplegia. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is a
      clinically accessible NIBS approach, has been used to modulate cortical plasticity and
      improve hand function. However, the high variability in the reported effects of tDCS raises
      questions about its clinical value and highlights the need to investigate more robust NIBS
      protocols. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a novel NIBS approach that
      produces more consistent facilitatory effects compared to tDCS. TRNS delivers a low
      alternating current with a continuously changing intensity over a wide frequency range.
      Further, tRNS has excellent tolerability and no risk of skin burns since it is a polarity
      independent stimulation approach. When tRNS is applied over the motor cortex, it increases
      cortical excitability in the hand representation area and enhances motor learning in healthy
      adults. Despite the potential promise of tRNS in increasing corticomotor drive for improved
      motor performance, its application in persons with SCI is novel. Therefore, in this study,
      the investigators propose to use tRNS to augment the therapeutic effects of functional task
      practice (FTP). Our aim is to compare the efficacy of a 3-day tRNS+FTP protocol on cortical
      excitability, UE motor, and sensory function to tDCS+FTP and to sham-stimulation+FTP in
      individuals with tetraplegia.
