      fibrosis (CF). A better understanding of the primary pathogenesis of CF is essential in order
      to reveal the features that may lead to the onset of progressive lung disease. Discerning the
      nature of the CF defect could resolve longstanding controversy and result in a new
      therapeutic opportunity that may address pathophysiology. Recently the investigators have
      developed an innovative technology, termed 1-µm resolution optical coherence tomography
      (µOCT), which enables real-time cross-sectional microscopy of the functional epithelial
      surface of living airways.
