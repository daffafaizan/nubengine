      that secrete large amounts of the inactive precursor steroids dehydroepiandrosterone(DHEA)and
      especially its sulfate DHEA-S. The marked reduction in the formation of DHEA-S by the
      adrenals during aging results in a dramatic fall in the formation of androgens and estrogens
      in peripheral target tissues, a situation that has been proposed to be associated with
      age-related diseases including skin atrophy, insulin resistance and obesity. Moreover, much
      attention has been given to the benefits of DHEA administered to postmenopausal women,
      especially on the bone, skin, vagina and well being after oral as well as percutaneous
      administration of the precursor steroid.

      Therefore this study proposes to study the effect of 0.3% DHEA cream during a period of 12
      months administered twice daily to postmenopausal women. During the study several biological
      and clinical parameters will be evaluated. In summary, these include blood steroid levels,
      distribution of hormonal receptors in the skin, sebaceous gland activity, skin hydration,
      skin wrinkles and finally skin genomic evaluation.

      Subjects will be evaluated at specific time intervals for the above mentioned parameters as
      well as tolerability and adverse reactions.
