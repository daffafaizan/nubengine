      escalated dose of cisplatin and fluorouracil until the MTD is reached. There will be no
      intra-patient dose escalation. Sorafenib will be administered orally at a dose of 400mg bid
      for 28 days in the all patients. Cisplatin at the dose of 10-20mg/m2 will be administered at
      day 1 and day8, and fluorouracil at the dose of 170-330mg/m2 will be administered
      continuously at day1-day5, and day8-day12 via the implanted catheter system. A cycle is
      defined as 28 days and 3 cycles of this combination therapy will be continued. At the end of
      each cycle, adverse effect will be evaluated and dose escalation will be determined. In Phase
      II, there will be 28 patients enrolled. Time to progression of this combination therapy at
      the recommended dose will be evaluated.
