      of local anesthetics along the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.Recently,
      ultrasound has been used to identify intermuscular planes to carry out transversus abdominis
      plane and obturator nerve blocks.Thus, to validate this new method, the investigators
      conducted a retrospective observational study comparing ultrasound and the conventional
      landmark-based technique for superficial cervical plexus.
