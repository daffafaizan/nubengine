      or placebo for 10 weeks on the expression of Sirt-1, AdipoR1(adiponectin receptor 1) &
      AdipoR2 (adiponectin receptor 2) genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and
      circulatory levels of Resistin, MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) and Adiponectin of
      type2 diabetes patient. In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, placebo-controlled,
      88 men and women with type 2 diabetes are enrolled in the study from the Iranian Diabetes
      Association. After signing informed consent all individuals complete a general information
      form , 24-hour food recall for 3 days and beck depression questionnaire will be taken from
      the participants at the beginning and the end of the study. Selected samples are randomly
      classified into 2 blocks of groups receiving supplement and placebo. The supplement group,
      will receive mg 1800mg EPA(Eicosapentaenoic acid ) & 900mg DHA( docosahexaenoic acid)
      (total=2700mg) for 10 weeks and the placebo group will also receive placebo (containing 2700
      mg of edible paraffin) (similar in terms of color, shape and size). Patients are recommended
      to sustain their diets and medication dose (s) during the study and also advised to maintain
      a constant level of physical activity. Blood samples will be collected after 12 hours fasting
      and anthropometric variables, biochemical parameters, target gene expression and physical
      activity before and after the trial will be measured
