      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).(1) It develops in 30-75% of
      recipients of allogeneic HSCT depending on the degree of histocompatibility between the donor
      and the recipient, number of T-cells in the graft, recipient's age and GVHD prophylactic
      regimen used. (2-4) Novel strategies designed to effectively prevent the development of this
      life threatening complication of allogeneic transplantation are urgently needed.
