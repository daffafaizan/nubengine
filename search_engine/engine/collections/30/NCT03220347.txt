    
      Parts A, B and C will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up.

      Screening Period:

      The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90010. The informed
      document (ICD) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff prior to
      the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be completed
      within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90010.

      Treatment Period:

      During the Treatment Period, CC-90010 was initially administered orally once daily for 3
      consecutive days followed by 4 consecutive days off drug every week (3/7-days schedule) in
      each 28-day cycle in Part A. Alternative dosing schedules (eg, 2-days-on/5-days- off each
      week, 3-days-on/4-days-off every other week, 4-days on/24 days off) may be evaluated one
      dosing schedule at a time or ≥ 2 dosing schedules given in parallel, based on the review of
      available safety, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy data by the SRC.

      Following completion of dose escalation in Part A, selected expansion cohorts will receive
      CC-90010 in Part B. The SRC determined the RP2D for Part B to be 45 mg CC-90010 given once
      daily for 4 consecutive days on followed by 24 consecutive days off (4-days-on/24-days-off)
      in each 28-day cycle. A cohort s of up to approximately 20-25 subjects with relapsed and/or
      refractory DLBCL (Cohort 1) will be enrolled in Part B expansion.

      Enrollment in advanced BCC (Cohort 2) will be stopped due to recruitment challenges. An
      additional cohort of approximately 15 evaluable subjects with R/R DLBCL (Cohort 3) will be
      enrolled under an alternative dosing regimen of 30 mg CC-90010 3days-on/11-days off in each
      28-day cycle. The food effect assessment (Part C, Spain only) will evaluate the impact of
      food on CC-90010 when administered at the RP2D of 45 mg 4-days-on/24-days-off, by comparison
      of PK parameters following fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie meal) conditions in
      approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      Follow-up Period:

      In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose
      of CC-90010 for safety.

      After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (±
      2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or
      the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.
