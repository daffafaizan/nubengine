      with peripheral vestibular disorders (PVD). Inclusion criteria consisted of: a) 20 to 70 year
      old, b) confirmed diagnosis of PVD on neuro-opthalmic, neuro-orthoptic, electronystagmography
      and caloric testing; and use of a home computer. Exclusion criteria consisted of those with
      migraine, central nervous system disorders (for example cerebral vascular accident or
      Multiple Sclerosis), recent fractures of the spine or lower extremities, inability to stand
      for 20 minutes continuously, or presence of dementia. It was hypothesized that a home-based
      computer gaming treatment delivered in a monitored telerehabilitation platform would be an
      effective treatment for those with PVD in that increased gaze stability and improved balance
      would be observed post-treatment. It was also hypothesized that decreased dizziness would be
      reported post-treatment. After initial assessment (pre-treatment), three in-clinic sessions
      were given to each participant to develop their specific home treatment computer program and
      ensure ability to use the program effectively. They were then started on their home program
      and monitored by a trained vestibular physical therapist for a 12-week telerehabilitation
      program. After the completion of the 12-weeks, the participants returned for a post-treatment
      assessment.
