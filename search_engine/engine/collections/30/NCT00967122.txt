      and after a band holiday, in addition to surveying hunger/satiety and behavior changes.

      Materials and Methods:

      Adults â‰¥ 18 years of age who previously underwent LAGB at New York University Medical Center
      and have lost sufficient excess body weight and agree to have their band temporarily loosened
      for a 2 week period will be invited by the health care provider to participate. Patients of
      both genders and all races are eligible for participation. Patients will need to consent to
      complete a questionnaire and to have blood drawn when the band is loosened and refilled.
      Patients will only be excluded if they are not willing to have their band loosened or if they
      will not present for follow-up.

      Sample size:

      For this pilot program we plan to enroll 15 patients. Since patients will serve as their own
      controls before and after meals as well as before and after band adjustments, we anticipate
      adequate power to assess for significant variations.
