      At the time of admission, the patients received and signed an Informed Consent to adhere to
      the Study Protocol. On this occasion, the patients were also given a summary scheme of the
      clinical and radiographic checks to which they would have undergone in case of adherence to
      the Study Protocol.

      40 patients were included in the trial and were randomly allocated (1:1) in a Piezoelectric
      Group (PG) and in a Control Group (CG) (that provided for the use of a traditional
      oscillating saw) utilizing sealed envelopes. The envelopes were prepared and shuffled by the
      same senior surgeon involved in the surgical procedures and drawn by a researcher not
      involved in the surgical procedures or the clinical and radiographic assessment.

      The patients were not aware of the instrument used during surgery. In both groups, patients
      were treated with the same surgical technique, a distal linear osteotomy of the first
      metatarsal bone (S.E.R.I. technique). Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed
      during the multiple follow-ups.

      The final follow-up was at 1 year.
