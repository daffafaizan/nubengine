      severe symptoms that can lead them to the emergency department. Mixtures of antacid and
      antispasmodic were widely used over decades to relieve this acute pain with moderate, yet
      questionable, improvement in pain score. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the novel
      acid-lowering agents, are undoubtedly effective to reduce acid secretion and control
      dyspeptic symptoms in short-term and long-term duration. To our knowledge, no previous study
      was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such agents on immediate pain relief in patients
      with severe dyspeptic symptoms in emergency care. Clinically, they are frequently used to
      treat this circumstance in an unofficial manner since intravenous proton pump inhibitor alone
      is not yet considered as a well-approved indication to alleviate such condition.
      Pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, reaches its peak serum concentration within one hour
      and its acid-lowering effect occurred within first hour following a single intravenous
      infusion. Thus, it theoretically has rapid onset and prolonged action on acid reduction. Our
      primary aim of the study is to evaluate the immediate effect of intravenous pantoprazole in
      addition to the combination of oral antacid and antispasmodic agent (the conventional
      regimen) on the relief of severe acid-related dyspeptic pain.
