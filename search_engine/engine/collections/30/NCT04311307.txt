      subjects with GSDIa and ten age and gender-matched healthy subjects.

      Interventions: Three experiments will be performed for each subject. During the first in
      hospital experiment, two oral D-[6,6-2H2]glucose loads will be performed 2 hours before
      breakfast and at lunchtime, respectively. The third oral D-[6,6-2H2]glucose load will be
      performed at home (random time). Capillary blood samples will be collected on filter paper at
      specific time points after each oral D-[6,6-2H2]glucose load. During the experiments,
      subjects will be monitored by subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).
