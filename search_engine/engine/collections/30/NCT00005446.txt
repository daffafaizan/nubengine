      Studies suggest that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) lowers the risk of coronary heart
      disease in postmenopausal women. However, it is not known whether higher endogenous levels of
      estrogens in the postmenopausal period likewise have a protective effect.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study used an existing resource of frozen blood samples from a cohort of 7,058
      postmenopausal women enrolled between 1985 and 1991 for a study of endogenous hormones and
      cancer. The cohort was followed up to identify incident cases of coronary heart disease. One
      hundred thirty cases of coronary heart disease (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or
      death from coronary heart disease) were expected to occur by the end of follow-up. A nested
      case-control study was conducted in which each case was matched to two women from the cohort
      who were the same age as the case, donated blood around the same time, and were alive and
      free of heart disease as of the date of diagnosis of the case. Frozen serum samples from
      cases and their matched controls were analyzed for total estradiol, bioavailable estradiol
      (the estradiol fraction not bound to sex hormone binding globulin) estrone, total
      cholesterol, and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conditional logistic
      regression for matched sets were employed to determine whether estrogen levels were lower in
      the cases than their matched controls. The association between estrogen levels and
      cholesterol fractions was also investigated.
