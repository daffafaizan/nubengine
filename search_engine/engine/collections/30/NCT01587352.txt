      I. To determine the overall objective response rate (RR) to vorinostat in patients with
      metastatic uveal melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. To determine the
      tolerability of vorinostat in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in histone acetylation status by
      immunohistochemistry.

      II. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in known proliferation and apoptotic markers
      including Ki67 by immunohistochemistry and BIM, survivin, c-myc, Mcl-1, cleaved PARP,
      gamma-H2AX and RAD51 by western blot.

      III. To assess for changes in pathways such as the MAPK pathway with treatment. IV. To
      describe the evolution of circulating cell-free, tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      levels measured by pyrophosphorolysis activated polymerization (PAP) in plasma of patients
      under treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma.

      V. To correlate overall objective RR with GNAQ, GNA11, SF3B1 and BAP1 mutational status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 3 days weekly for 4 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
