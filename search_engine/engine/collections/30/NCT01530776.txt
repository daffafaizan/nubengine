      childbearing period has the potential to slow the accumulation of weight gain among this high
      risk group. Previous interventions to prevent postpartum weight retention among Blacks are
      sparse and limited by poor intervention adherence, high attrition, and failure to include
      pregnancy in the study design. The proposed research aims to overcome these shortcomings by
      developing an intervention that 1) focuses solely on Black women, 2) incorporates Black
      mothers' information needs, values, and social context, 3) uses technology to facilitate
      participant engagement, and 4) includes both the pregnancy and postpartum periods.
