      cardiovascular disease risk factors in South Asians, the second fastest growing ethnic group
      in the US and one with disparate rates of coronary heart disease. Identifying and
      understanding the links between social networks and cardiovascular disease is key to the
      development and testing of family- and community-level prevention interventions for
      minorities.
