      levels. Significant lowering of pulmonary oxygen uptake during exercise, as well as
      significantly lower blood pressure values at rest have been observed after supplementation
      with nitrate. However, no study has yet described a direct comparison between different
      nitrate-rich beverages with respect to the bioavailability of nitrate/nitrite and the
      possible hemodynamic effects. Based on the gaps in current literature, our main goal will
      therefore be to gain further insight into the effects of nitrate supplementation with
      different sources on plasma nitrite levels.
