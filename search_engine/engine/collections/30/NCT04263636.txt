      and estimate the necessary task and environmental lighting adjustment in order to address
      lighting needs of patients following bilateral pseudophakic presbyopic corrections.
      Specifically, the aim of this study is to identify the minimum light intensity in which
      patients that underwent pseudophakic presbyopic correction with trifocal IOLs can reach their
      maximum visual acuity (measured when lights are at the 100% lighting level)
