      established. Presently, the method of skin closure is a matter of the surgeon's personal
      preference. Currently, there is limited evidence regarding which method is considered
      "superior" in terms of post operative pain, patient satisfaction, and cost effectiveness.
      This information would be incredibly valuable in helping guide surgeons in their choice of
      skin closure technique; and with the rates of Cesarean deliveries rapidly rising, it is
      important to determine the best method of skin closure in order to optimize patient care.

      After a patient is consented she will be randomized into either the control group and receive
      the standard metallic staples or the experimental group and receive the absorbable staples
      for her skin closure procedure. One day after her procedure the RN will ask the patient to
      rate her pain using a 10cm VAS pain scale. Two or three days after the skin closure and
      before the patient is discharged a short survey about the patient's satisfaction of her scar
      appearance will be administered. The PI will go back and review the patient's chart to
      determine the amount of narcotics administered.
