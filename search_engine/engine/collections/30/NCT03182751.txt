      prospective randomized, controlled trial of perioperative TXA demonstrated reduction in
      transfusion requirements for intertrochanteric hip fractures treated with short,
      cephalomedullary nails. This was clinically, though not statistically, significant.
      Investigators recently conducted a randomized, controlled trial at this institution to
      evaluated the use of TXA in patients with femoral neck fractures treated with
      hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty and found clinically, albeit not statistically,
      significant reduction in transfusion requirement (accepted for publication). Perhaps
      tempering the effect seen with perioperative administration of TXA is the blood loss that
      occurs prior to surgery, the so-called "hidden" blood loss that can be as substantial as 1/3
      of total blood loss from a hip fracture. This raises the question whether administration of
      tranexamic acid at the time of initial presentation after fracture could improve the
      perioperative care of these patients by decreasing the proportion of patients requiring
      transfusion and decreasing total blood loss.
