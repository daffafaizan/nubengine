      analgesia, analgesic requirements, ambulatory distance, and flexion following hip
      arthroplasty.

      Primary Hypothesis: Differing the catheter insertion site (femoral vs. psoas compartment) for
      a perineural local anesthetic infusion is not associated with lower pain scores during the
      24-hour period beginning the morning following hip arthroplasty.
