    
      The primary purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the effect of Power
      Training combined with interval Treadmill Training (PT続) on walking capacity and performance
      in children with CP with walking limitations. To identify key muscular mechanisms associated
      with improved walking mobility, the effects of PT続 on muscle performance and architecture
      will be examined. The premise of the PT続 protocol is that a combined impairment and
      task-specific approach that is developmentally appropriate and targets muscle power deficits
      specifically, is necessary to drive changes in both clinic and community-based walking
      activity.

      In this randomized multi-site clinical trial, 48 ambulatory participants with CP will receive
      either PT続 or an equivalent dosage of traditional strength training combined with traditional
      treadmill training (comparison group) for 24 sessions, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Outcomes
      will be collected at baseline and immediately post-treatment. Short and long-term retention
      effects will be assessed at 2 and 6 months post.
