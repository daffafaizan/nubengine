      conformal techniques in patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the prostate. II.
      Determine the morbidity of high-dose 3D conformal therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal
      radiotherapy 4-5 days a week for at least 8 weeks. Cohorts of 20-40 patients receive
      escalating doses of radiotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 10% of patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
