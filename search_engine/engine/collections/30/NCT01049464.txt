      unstable patients in the intensive care unit. Loss of atrial contraction and the sequential
      atrioventricular contraction decrease the overall cardiac output which results in severe
      inadequate tissue perfusion. Medications aim for rate and rhythm control are recommended to
      treat new onset atrial fibrillation. These drugs (verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone and beta
      blockers) may further compromise the patients' cardiac output by its' negative inotropic
      effect.

      Magnesium sulphate with the cell membrane threshold potential stabilizing effect has been
      reported as an effective drug for rate and rhythm control for post-operative atrial
      fibrillation and the atrial fibrillation presented in the hospital emergency unit. However,
      there was inadequate data about the efficacy of Magnesium sulphate for treatment of new onset
      atrial fibrillation in the hemodynamically unstable patients admitted in the medical
      intensive care unit.
