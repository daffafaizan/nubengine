      dexamethasone, and lenalidomide (D+L) in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, a subgroup
      with limited treatment options. Lenalidomide offers an alternative way of treating CLL. In a
      Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetics study (study 1398/180) in healthy male volunteers, it was
      demonstrated that lenalidomide administered at a dose of 100 mg twice a day for 6 days had an
      acceptable safety profile with grade 1-2 rash and pruritus being the primary adverse events
      associated with the administration of the compound. In myeloma and MDS, lenalidomide has been
      studied mostly at two doses: 25 mg/day and 10 mg/day. In CLL significant toxicity was
      observed with these two dose levels, including tumour lysis syndrome and tumour flare.47,48
      We therefore plan to start therapy with lenalidomide at a relatively low dose of 5mg/day,
      days 1-28, with cycle 1 and escalate to the maximum dose of 10mg/day with cycles 2-12. We
      have elected to administer lenalidomide continuously as opposed to pulsing over 14-21 days of
      each cycle to reduce the risk of tumour flare reaction (TFR), when this agent is reintroduced
      with each cycle. Finally, lenalidomide will be administered in combination with
      Dexamethasone, at a dose of 20mg/day for 4 days in each 28 day cycle as this allows
      convenient oral administration. We and others have demonstrated that Dexamethasone level is
      effective in CLL patients who are refractory or have relapsed following primary Fludarabine
      therapy. The combination of D+L will likely reduce toxicity, especially TFR, whilst improving
      overall efficacy without promoting the emergence of chemoresistant clones in which tumour
      suppressor genes have been inactivated.
