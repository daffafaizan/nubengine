      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. It has been shown that different coffee preparation and
      brewing methods influence the concentration of compounds present in the final coffee brew.
      Unlike coffee traditionally consumed in the western world, Turkish coffee is not drip
      filtered, but rather its method of preparation involves slowly boiling water that is mixed
      with thinly ground coffee beans. This style of preparation results in a greater amount of
      biologically active components (caffeine and diterpenes) remaining in the liquid. In addition
      to preparation styles, roasting process greatly affects the chemical composition of the
      coffee. Coffee types differing in content of major constituents differ with regard to
      cardiovascular health effects.

      Purpose/Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of boiled unfiltered
      (Turkish) coffee consumption on the plasma cardiovascular risk parameters of healthy
      subjects. The study also explores whether two unfiltered boiled (Turkish) coffee beverages
      that differ in content due to different roasting degrees will differentially affect
      cardiovascular biomarkers.

      Methods: In this crossover intervention study, healthy, nonsmoking, habitual Turkish coffee
      drinkers (n=28) were randomized to consume at least 3 cups of Light (LR) or Dark (DR) roast
      Turkish coffee brews per day for 4 weeks after a washout period (WO) of 2 weeks. Subsequent
      to each coffee abstinence period, both groups received the alternative intervention. After
      the first WO and the coffee intervention periods, anthropometric measures, blood pressure,
      heart rate and 13 biochemical parameters were collected and dietary records were completed.
