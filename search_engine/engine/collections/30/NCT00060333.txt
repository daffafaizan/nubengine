      I. Assess the recurrence rates in patients with desmoplastic melanoma (DM) >= 1 mm deep
      treated with adjuvant radiotherapy after surgical resection.

      II. Assess recurrence rates in patients with locally recurrent DM treated with adjuvant
      radiotherapy after surgical resection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the impact of adjuvant radiation therapy after surgical resection on disease free
      and overall survival.

      II. Evaluate the immediate and long-term morbidity of the addition of radiotherapy to
      surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 8 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo radiation therapy twice weekly over
      approximately 2.5 weeks for a total of 5 fractions in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
