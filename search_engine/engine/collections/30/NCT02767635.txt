      of 1% to 3% in the general population and has a higher rate up to 14.5% in strenuous jobs.
      Botulinum toxin type A injection was an emerging option in treating lateral epicondylalgia.
      In this study, the patients were randomly assigned into three groups:

        1. Botox-Epic group received 20 units of Botox injection into lateral epicondyle;

        2. Botox-Tend group had 20 units of Botox injected into tender point of muscles;

        3. Steroid group had 40mg of triamcinolone injected into lateral epicondyle.

      The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare the effects of injection with
      corticosteroid and botulinum toxin type A via two different sites in patients with lateral
      epicondylalgia.
