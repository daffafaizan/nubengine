    
      This is a prospective single-center open-label randomized 6 month study. There will not be a
      washout period. Treatment will be for 26 weeks.

      Subjects will have baseline disease severity assessments. Subjects will be instructed to take
      adalimumab according to the labelled dosing regimen. Subjects will be randomized to either
      standard-of-care or to an electronic reporting intervention.

      The reporting intervention consists of reporting the experience with the treatment (whether
      the treatment was taken, the efficacy of the treatment, and any issues that have come up) at
      weekly intervals for 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks thereafter.

      Subjects will return for evaluation at 12 & 26 weeks (or end of study). At each visit the
      subject will be scored for disease severity and adverse events. The assessor of these
      measures will be blinded to treatment group assignment. At the baseline and at the end of
      therapy visit (26 weeks), all subjects will complete a HS self-assessment questionnaire,
      treatment satisfaction questionnaire and physician trust survey. Pregnancy tests will be
      completed on females of childbearing potential at the baseline visit.
