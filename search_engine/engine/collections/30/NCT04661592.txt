      Rather than using a set of fixed, predetermined sequences to elicit ERPs this new method
      draws on a database of candidate word stimuli to generate a different, random stimulus
      sequence each time a scan is carried out. The goal of this is to reduce habituation to the
      stimulus sequences which is hypothesized to improve the repeatability of the component
      measurements. Characterizing how individuals respond to the stimulus sequences is an
      important step in the validation of the generation method itself. Understanding the degree of
      variability and prototypical values of each ERP component is crucial to the understanding of
      typical brain functioning. For this type of technology to be clinically viable in quantifying
      brain health, the investigators must first quantify the degree to which a healthy brain
      naturally fluctuates in it processing capability. This study is being carried out to assess
      how repeatable the ERPs elicited by the new method are while also considering the impact of
      intraindividual variability observed in previous investigations. Thus, by comparing the
      results of the scans over time, an assessment of the reliability of the new stimulus
      sequences can be made.
