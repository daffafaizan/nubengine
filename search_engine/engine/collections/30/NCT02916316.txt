      of possible early markers of cardiotoxicity estimating an overall maximum risk equal to 20%
      of patients. The sample size, required to obtain an estimate of conventional anthracycline
      cardiotoxicity in the population, has been calculated with a confidence interval of 95% and a
      maximum acceptable error of Â± 0.075. According to the conditions described above, the sample
      size of patients treated with conventional anthracycline results to be 124 patients.

      Considering a 10-15% of not evaluable patients, the sample size is fixed at 150 patients
      treated with R-CHOP. The duration of the enrollment phase is defined in 2 years.

      With this sample size should be possible to assess the risk of cardiotoxicity related to
      predictors with a worst group frequency at least of 10%.
