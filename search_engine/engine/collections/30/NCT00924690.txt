      used to help increase colon cancer prevention behaviors. Two sets of intervention messages
      will be developed: generic and behavioral. Using a randomized control design the
      investigators will evaluate the behavioral messages among women. This message testing
      protocol will help them determine if the messages are relevant, acceptable, comprehensible,
      memorable, and motivating for the target audience. The investigators' hypothesis is that the
      behavioral messages will receive more positive ratings than the generic messages. If so, they
      will be used to promote cancer screening and physical activity in future intervention
      studies.
