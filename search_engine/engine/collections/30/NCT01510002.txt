      prophylactic central neck dissection should be the standard operation for papillary thyroid
      cancer. However, it is still unclear if this approach has any benefit on survival or
      locoregional control of the disease. In addition, potential advantages of this more
      aggressive surgical approach should outweigh the risk of morbidity. The purpose of this
      retrospective cohort study is to determine whether prophylactic central neck dissection is
      beneficial for patients with papillary thyroid cancer staged preoperatively as node negative.
      In this study outcomes of total thyroidectomy versus this plus prophylactic central neck
      dissection for papillary thyroid cancer are compared in a 10-year follow-up. Patients
      operated between 1993 and 1997 (n=282) underwent total thyroidectomy alone, whereas patients
      operated between 1998 and 2002 (n=358) underwent total thyroidectomy plus prophylactic
      central neck dissection.
