      imaging. Although an array of non-invasive imaging techniques can detect a wide spectrum of
      complementary high-risk characteristics, no single modality can reliably identify vulnerable
      plaques associated with future stroke development. Substantial histological data suggests
      that specific plaque components identify patients at high-risk for future ipsilateral stroke
      and cardiovascular events. This implies that investigators need to look beyond the
      traditional paradigm where the basis for carotid endarterectomy were formulated by an
      invasive imaging modality that provided no information on the arterial wall composition.
      Alternative imaging strategies are therefore required targeting not only in vivo carotid
      morphology but also plaque biology and disease activity. This is fundamental to optimal
      risk-stratification and appropriate selection of patients for high-risk vascular
      intervention. One new approach is to use non-invasive molecular imaging targeted at plaque
      biology using hybrid systems such as positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging.
