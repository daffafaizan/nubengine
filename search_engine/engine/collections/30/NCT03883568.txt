      physical examination, blood draw, MRI scans, radiographs of knees and hands (only at baseline
      and 24 months), CT scan of the knee (only at baseline and 24 months), low radiation whole
      body CT scan (only at baseline and 24 months), HandScan (only at baseline and 24 months),
      motion analysis, and performance based tests. They will be asked to fill out questionnaires
      about knee, hand and hip osteoarthritis, and about general health and pain. The patient
      council in the consortium indicated that the load is acceptable. The patient council will be
      involved in the execution of the study. The assumed risk is minimal for an individual patient
      and minimal compared to the contribution to the development of knowledge of their disease.
      These risks include minimal events due to blood sampling itself (such as hematoma or
      localized bleeding), radiation exposure by radiographic imaging techniques (with a minimal
      increased healthcare risk), and exposure to MRI techniques (without known risks and without
      use of contrast agents).
