      to implement a prostate cancer screening decision support intervention (DESI) with a control
      condition in primary care in 2 clinical systems - PAMF (Palo Alto Medical Foundation) and
      UNC. The primary outcomes of interest are men's screening decisions and their subsequent
      healthcare utilization. Secondary outcomes include the likelihood that they review the DESI
      and their decision-specific knowledge. The 3 strategies selected by the PAMF and UNC health
      systems are: (1) mailing men a DESI in DVD; (2) inviting men to participate in a shared
      (group) medical appointment (SMA) to watch and discuss the DESI with a healthcare provider
      and other men; and (3) providing men options by inviting them to a SMA while also providing
      them a DESI in DVD which they can use individually if they are unable or choose not to attend
      a SMA. The 3 groups will be compared to a control condition that does not receive a DESI but
      will be encouraged to discuss prostate cancer screening with their physician. Because of its
      significantly larger patient population, the PAMF site will also evaluate these outcomes by
      targeting screening-na√Øve patients on their 50th birthday, when they first become guideline
      eligible to consider prostate cancer screening.
