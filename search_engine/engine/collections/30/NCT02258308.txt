      generated by health plans (Community Health Plan of Washington and Molina, who insure the
      majority of Medicaid enrollees in King County), individuals referred by primary care
      providers, and self referral. Eligible subjects that agree to participate are randomly
      assigned into a CHW intervention group or a control group. We expected to complete the study
      with 200 in each group.

      The intervention is in-home education and support by a community health worker (CHW). At the
      first home visit, the CHW assesses the participant's knowledge and skills related to asthma
      self-management, current status of the child's asthma, and resources and support for asthma
      self-management using a baseline questionnaire. The CHW inspects the home environment using
      an Environmental Home Checklist to identify environmental triggers that can cause asthma
      symptoms and affect asthma control. The CHW makes up to three follow-up visits and two
      telephone visits during the year the participant is in the study. Participants receive
      resources to help them control asthma, including vacuum cleaner, dust covers for a pillow and
      mattress and a "green" cleaning kit with cleaning supplies.

      The control group receives standard asthma care, as provided by a primary health care
      provider during the 12 months after enrollment. When the intervention period is over, the
      control group receives one visit with a CHW and the resources provided to the intervention
      group participants.

      The main outcome variables include asthma symptom-free days, caretaker asthma-related quality
      of life, and urgent health care utilization.
