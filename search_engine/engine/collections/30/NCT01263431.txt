      painful treatments have been developed, such as Doppler-guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation
      and stapled anopexy. Both techniques seem to be safe, causing little postoperative pain. A
      combination of the two techniques could possibly treat both bleeding and prolapse with
      minimal discomfort
