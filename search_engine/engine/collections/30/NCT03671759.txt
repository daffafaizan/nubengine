      utilize the Eureka mobile application. On the Eureka app, participants will be able to track
      caffeine consumption and answer questions about mood and sleep. Participants will also
      receive their randomization assignment through Eureka. Participants will be asked to modify
      caffeine intake habits in two-day blocks; these assignments are either a) to consume caffeine
      for one day, then avoid caffeine the next day, or b) to avoid caffeine for one day, then
      consume caffeine the next day. Participants will also be given a wrist-worn fitness device
      (Fitbit), to track sleep, step counts, and heart rate data.
