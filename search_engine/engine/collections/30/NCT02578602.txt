      I. To evaluate the precision of gadoxetate (gadoxetate disodium)-enhanced MRI in evaluating
      lesion size.

      II. To evaluate if there is a subjective improvement in the delineation of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) in the hepatocellular phase of contrast administration.

      III. To further assess the sensitivity of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI for the detection of HCC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the reproducibility of various tumor measurement techniques in the evaluation
      of HCC.

      II. To further evaluate how administration of gadoxetate affects diffusion weighted imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gadoxetate disodium intravenously (IV) and then undergo enhanced liver MRI.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2, 4, 8, and 12 months.
