      metformin for the treatment of GDM. The review will include RCT comparing these drugs versus
      insulin or making direct comparisons between the two oral agents in pregnant women with GDM.

      Investigators have pre-specified a series of maternal and fetal outcomes of interest.

      A comprehensive electronic search strategy will be complemented with a search of
      bibliographies from relevant studies and the contact of authors from the eligible studies
      regarding issues on study design or information on primary outcomes.

      The risk of bias of included studies will be analyzed and this information used to perform
      sensitivity analyses. If possible, data from original studies will be pooled into relative
      risks for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes.

      Heterogeneity will be explored for all the analyses. Analyses will be undertaken using a
      fixed effects model that will be repeated using a random effects model in case of substantial
      heterogeneity.

      Results of the systematic review will be published following PRISMA guidance.
