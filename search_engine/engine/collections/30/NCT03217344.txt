      authors propose surgical treatment other advocate for conservative treatment. Traditionally,
      fractures treated non-operatively undergo a 3-week period of immobilization followed by
      progressive rehabilitation program. Nevertheless, there is little evidence to support a
      3-week immobilization period. The purpose of this study is to bring evidence to support
      either a 1-week immobilization or 3-week immobilization period in non-operatively treated
      proximal humeral fractures.
