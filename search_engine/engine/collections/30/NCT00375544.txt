    
      This Phase I study is being conducted to examine the efficacy of the Light Sciences LLC
      (LSLLC) phototherapy device for home (self) - treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Clinical
      efficacy will be assessed by evaluating the level of reported pain, including the use of
      analgesics, various measures of functional improvement, and clinical symptomology during a
      three week period of daily treatments. Durability of the clinical response for twelve weeks
      following therapy will also be examined. In addition, device safety will be assessed. As this
      is an early stage-prototype device, subject input regarding the usability of the device will
      be sought.

      Subjects will be required to achieve three weeks of wash-out from all OA therapies prior to
      the start of phototherapy. Acetaminophen will be allowed during this time. During the three
      week active treatment and twelve week follow-up periods, subjects will be required to refrain
      from acetaminophen as well as OA therapies. However, subjects will be encouraged to speak
      with the investigator should any symptoms become difficult to manage. In addition to clinical
      assessments, subjects will be required to keep a daily diary.

      The clinical objectives of the study will be met if at least five of ten subjects report
      decreased pain scores and improvement on an osteoarthritis index. While minimum or no safety
      issues are expected, the occurrence of skin changes to the area exposed to the device will be
      carefully monitored.
