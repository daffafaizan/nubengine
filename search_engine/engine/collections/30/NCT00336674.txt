      diabetes (T1D), previously known as insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune
      disease in which the body's immune system reacts against and destroys the insulin-producing β
      cells in the islets of the pancreas. T1D classically affects children and young adults.
      Approximately 15% of people with diabetes have this form of the disease and no treatment is
      currently available to prevent it. Asymptomatic individuals in the pre-clinical stage of T1D
      can be identified by the presence of circulating antibodies to the islet autoantigens
      (pro)insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine phosphatase-like insulinoma
      antigen 2 (IA2). (Pro)insulin is the only autoantigen that is specific for β cells and
      several lines of evidence demonstrate that it plays a key role in driving autoimmune β-cell
      destruction.

      The ability to use self-antigens as tools to induce protective immunity, free from the side
      effects of conventional non-specific immunosuppression, is the 'Holy Grail' of autoimmune
      disease therapy. Animal models provide proof-of-concept for such antigen-specific therapy.
      For example, in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model of spontaneous T1D, transgenic
      over-expression of proinsulin in antigen-presenting cells in the immune system during
      development or in transferred bone marrow stem cells completely prevented diabetes. On a more
      practical and translatable level, immune tolerance to an antigen can be achieved by
      administering antigen to the mucosal immune system. Thus, immune responses to antigen are
      suppressed by feeding antigen ('oral tolerance') or by administering antigen to the
      naso-respiratory mucosa .
