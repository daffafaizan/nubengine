      infection/AIDS. Yet, it is associated with important short- and long- term side effects. In
      particular, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs may cause anemia, pancreatitis, mitochondrial
      dysfunction, lactic acidosis, lipoatrophy and reduction of renal function or of bone density.

      Our study aims to verify the safety and efficacy of a simplification of a dual therapy
      (Lamivudine plus Atazanavir with Ritonavir), confiding on the potency and high genetic
      barrier of ritonavir-boosted agents.
