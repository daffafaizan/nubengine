    
      Hygieia, Inc. is developing a device intended for use by insulin-requiring patients with
      diabetes. It will be a pocket-sized, hand-held device, combining a glucose meter with
      software that analyzes blood glucose levels recorded in the device's memory, and periodically
      recommends modifications in insulin dosage. The already developed software algorithms are
      based on the way an endocrinologist evaluates and frequently adjusts insulin dosage in a
      patient with diabetes.
