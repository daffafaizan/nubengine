      23 sub-20 football athletes. All subjects were randomly divided into two groups; a control
      group (10 minutes seated rest) and a CWI group (10 minutes in a 10 degree C) during seven
      days in a row. The investigators evaluated creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase
      (LDH) as molecular biomarkers for muscle damage. The blood samples were collected on the
      first, second, ninth and tenth days. Yet, the investigators assessed the peak of muscle
      activity and isometric strength of the knee flexors and extensors, potency of lower limbs,
      perceived exertion (PE) and total quality recovery perceived (TQRPer) in order to understand
      the treatment physiological effect on the subjects on the first and last day of experiments
      (before and after training).
