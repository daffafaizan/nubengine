      clinical trials and routine care. The classification of AEs mostly relies on the Common
      Toxicity Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) developed by the US-American National
      Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute.

      It is known, however, that the assessment of AEs can greatly vary depending on whether they
      are assessed by patients or by clinicians.

      Procedure: The patients (any oncological diagnosis, day clinic or inpatient for treatment
      with chemotherapy or immunotherapy; open 1:1 randomized) fill out an EORTC quality of life
      questionnaire electronically (C30 + further questions). These PRO data are immediately
      available for the clinicians. Independently of each other, two different clinicians conduct a
      medical consultation with the patient and electronically a CTCAE rating. For the intervention
      Group, clinicians see the PRO values directly next to the input options for the CTCAE rating.
      For the control Group, clinicians see the input options for the CTCAE rating. The similarity
      of the assessments is checked using intra-class correlation.

      The combined use of PROs and CTCAE data makes particular sense for AEs/aspects that are
      directly experienced by the patient (fatigue, pain, cognitive problems, emotional
      functioning, ...) and can only be adequately recorded by the clinician through communication
      with the patient.
