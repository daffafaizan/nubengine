      patients randomized to two neoadjuvant chemotherapy arms. The treatment protocol will be the
      same in both groups, only the regimens sequences will be evaluated: starting with
      anthracycline versus taxane, with or without carboplatin for patients with triple negative
      subtype. The chemotherapy regimen will follow the institution's routine, which includes the
      use of CA in the anthracyclical phase and, in the taxane phase, the use of docetaxel every 21
      days or weekly paclitaxel. The rest of the treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy)
      will not be part of the study and will be carried out according to institutional guidelines.
