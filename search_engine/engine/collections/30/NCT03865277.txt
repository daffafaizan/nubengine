      with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, whose tumours are hypoxic after 2 weeks of
      primary radiochmeotherapy, have a significantly lower chance of locoregional tumour control.
      The multi-center trial evaluates the value of radiation dose escalation based on hypoxia
      detection by 18F_misonidazole Positron Emission Tomography (18F-MISO-PET) for primary
      radiochemotherapy of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Patients negative for human
      papillomavirus (HPV) and with hypoxic tumours after 2 weeks of radiochemotherapy are
      randomized to completion of standard radiochemotherapy (70 Gy) or radiochemotherapy with
      escalated radiation dose (77 Gy). An additional interventional arm includes a carbon ion
      boost to 77 Gy. HPV positive tumours can be included in a control arm. Primary endpoint is
      local tumour control 2 years after radiochemotherapy. Secondary endpoints include acute and
      late toxicity (CTCAE 5.0), regional tumor control, overall survival, disease free survival,
      distant metastases, kinetics analysis of dynamic FMISO-PET scans, Quality of life (QoL). The
      hypothesis is that local tumour control 2 years after radiochemotherapy is higher in the dose
      escalated compared to the control arm.
