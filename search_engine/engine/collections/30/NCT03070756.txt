      study will be informed about the possibility of participation. Following informed and written
      consent, participants will undergo a PSG-diagnostic night according to clinical routine,
      followed by an auto-CPAP treatment night with a prismaLINE device (prismaLAB or prisma20A).
      The device settings applied in the treatment night are defined by the study protocol (see
      interventions). Following the auto-CPAP treatment night, study participation is completed.
      Any following treatment and patient care is administered according to clinical routine.

      Primary and secondary outcome measures of sleep stage and respiratory event indices are
      evaluated at diagnostic night and auto-CPAP treatment night.

      The enrollment consists of two phases. During phase 1 (training phase) 10 participants are
      enrolled and complete the study protocol. Phase 1 serves as a training phase to establish a
      common standard of data quality and acquisition. Data of the training phase are not included
      in the statistical analysis. Following the training phase the efficacy of the auto-CPAP
      algorithm is evaluated in a sample of 70 participants.
