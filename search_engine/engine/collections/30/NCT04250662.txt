    
      Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is a common and often debilitating problem among women. CPP is pain
      that is felt below the belly button and is severe enough to cause feelings of pressure, pain
      while sitting or standing for long periods of time, pain with intercourse, painful urination,
      and pain with bowel movements. Transcranial Direct Current Simulation (tDCS) is a
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique. As tDCS modulates nerve activity and connectivity,
      it is also expected to cause measurable changes in brain activity. Guided imagery is a form
      of hypnosis using words to direct one's thoughts and attention to imagined sensations. Guided
      imagery has demonstrated efficacy in reducing pain related to many conditions including
      cancer pain, chronic lower back pain, and post-operative pain. More information is needed to
      evaluate the effects of tDCS and guided imagery in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain.

      The study will consist of one visit. After informed consent is obtained, the following will
      be collected/completed: health history, demographics, vitals, and questionnaires (BDI,
      CAGE-AID, PCS, and VAS for pelvic pain). A urinalysis will be collected to assess for
      infection and a urine pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential. If a subject
      qualifies they will be randomized. Before treatment, subjects complete an EEG. Treatment will
      be delivered based on randomization group assignment. After treatment an EEG, VAS, GRA will
      be collected. Study staff will assess for adverse events during and after treatment.
