      oligodendroglioma treated with radiotherapy with or without adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine,
      and vincristine (PCV) following surgical resection. II. Investigate the effect of PCV on
      quality of life and neurologic function in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of PCV
      in these patients. IV. Correlate chromosomal lesions (1p and/or 19q, 9p, p53 loss and
      mutation, amplification of chromosome 7, or loss of chromosome 10) with progression-free and
      overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age,
      extent of resection, performance status, prior surgery, and participating center. Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Within 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients
      undergo radiotherapy over 7 weeks to the residual tumor volume. Arm II: Patients undergo
      radiotherapy as in arm I, then begin chemotherapy within 4 weeks after the completion of
      radiotherapy. Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral procarbazine on days 8-21, and
      vincristine IV on days 8 and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in stable and responding
      patients for a total of 6 courses. Patients with disease recurrence may receive 6 additional
      courses of chemotherapy as above or another modality at the investigator's discretion.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
