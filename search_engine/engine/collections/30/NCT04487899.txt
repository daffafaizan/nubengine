      simulator will be evaluated by measuring and analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Eighteen
      pilot pilots with the status of instructor or student assigned at the time of the assessment
      to the ALA 23 district of the Talavera la Real Air Base of the Ministry of Defense of the
      Government of Spain (Badajoz) were studied during a flight simulator session. Subjects were
      assigned by non-probability randomization to a group of instructors (IG; 7 subjects), and a
      group of students (AG; 11 subjects). HRV was recorded for 15 minutes at rest and during the
      simulation of a mission in the flight simulator.
