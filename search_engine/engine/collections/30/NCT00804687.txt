    
      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), single-dose, single-blind (a
      clinical trial in which the person giving the treatment, but not the participant, knows which
      treatment the participant is receiving), double-dummy, placebo-controlled, three-treatment
      period, cross-over (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the
      trial) study of JNJ-39220675 in participants with allergic rhinitis. The duration of study
      will be 20-64 days per participant. The study consists of 2 parts: Screening (that is, 30
      days before study commences on Day 1) and Treatment (consists of single-dose of either
      JNJ-39220675 solution [10 milligram], Pseudoephedrine tablet [60 milligram] or Placebo, in
      subsequent three-treatment periods, each separated with washout period of 6 days). All the
      eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 treatment sequences.
      Participants will be given dose approximately 2 hours before entry into the environmental
      exposure chamber where they will be exposed to ragweed pollen for 8 hours. Efficacy will
      primarily be evaluated by measurement of nasal congestion that will be assessed through nasal
      cavity geometry that is, minimal cross-sectional area of nasal cavity by Acoustic rhinometry.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
