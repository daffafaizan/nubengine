      74 Gy in 6.6 weeks can improve the disease Local Regional Control rate at 15 months (1 year
      after completion of RCT) by adapting radiotherapy target volume to the metabolic response as
      assessed on FDG-PET/CT performed at 42 Gy of concomitant radio-chemotherapy in stage III
      non-small cells lung cancer and warrant more extensive phase III study.

      Eligible patients will be allocated to one of 2 treatment groups:

        -  Arm A: Patients in the experimental arm will receive an individualized radiotherapy
           prescription up to a total dose of 74 Gy given in 6.6 weeks if they have a positive
           FDG-PET at 42Gy.

        -  Arm B: Patients in the standard arm will receive a single prescription of 66 Gy in 33
           fractions in 6.6 weeks, with 2 Gy fractions given once daily, 5 days a week, without
           target volume reduction or adaptation (whatever the FDG-PET result).

      In both arms, all patients will undergo 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (based platinum
      salts) and a curative radio-chemotherapy. In both arms all fields must be treated daily.
