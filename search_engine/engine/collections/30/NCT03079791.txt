      factors for mortality after cardiac transplantation. For this registry, patients planned to
      undergo coronary angiography either as a part of routine follow-up to screen for relevant
      cardiac allograft vasculopathy or because of clinical suspicion of relevant cardiac allograft
      vasculopathy will be considered eligible.

      Since the "Transplant Care Guidelines of 2010" recommend the use of intracoronary imaging
      during angiographic follow-up in patients after heart transplantation to recognize CAV as
      early as possible, OCT has become integral part of the CAV diagnostic in our center. Through
      its high resolution OCT (so called virtual histology) provides the earliest possible
      diagnosis of CAV as well as new insights into the differentiation of CAV types. We aim to
      correlate the findings of OCT with the level of immunosuppression.
