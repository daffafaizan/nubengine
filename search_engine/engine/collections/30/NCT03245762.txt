    
      The overall objective of this Phase 2 trial is to compare the change from baseline to morning
      of day 6 of Internasal Oxytocin (IN-OT) on suck and swallow competency in infants/children
      with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) who are in nutritional phase 1a.

      Study Hypothesis 1: The Study team hypothesize that replacing Oxytocin (OT) in infants and
      children who are in nutritional phase 1a will improve their suck and swallow, potentially
      even eliminating the need for gastrostomy tubes and nasogastric tubes for feeding, and
      decreasing the risk of aspiration with oral feeding.

      Study Hypothesis 2: The Study team hypothesize that replacing OT in infants and children with
      PWS will result in improved eye contact, daytime alertness, and feelings of bonding between
      the parents and the infant.
