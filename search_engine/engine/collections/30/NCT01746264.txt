      history, current medications and a brief dietary history was taken. The dietary history was
      taken to assess calcium intake in a day and was obtained via the validated Short Calcium
      questionnaire. Blood pressure, heart rate as well as height,weight, waist and hip
      circumference measurement was obtained by study staff. In addition, a brief physical
      examination to determine Tanner stage was also completed. This involved examination of both
      breasts and genitalia for adolescent female and only genitalia in males. A physical activity
      questionnaire (IPAQ) was also administered by the study staff at this visit. A blood draw of
      5 ml to measure plasma 25(OH) D, calcium, phosphorus was obtained as part of the screening
      visit. For girls who had started menstruating, a urine pregnancy test was also obtained.

      After the screening visit eligible subjects had baseline biochemical tests and an endothelial
      function assessment. Study participants received a pill container with six total pills of
      vitamin cholecalciferol (D3) (1 pill = 50,000 IU), with directions to take two pills once a
      month (100,000 IU) at the same time for a period of 3 months. Compliance was assessed at the
      3 month visit by counting the number of pills remaining in the container.

      At 1 month, the subjects had tests for serum calcium and 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels. A urine
      test for random calcium to creatinine ratio was also obtained.

      At 2 months, the serum calcium, 25 hydroxy vitamin D levels, and calcium to creatinine ratio
      tests were repeated.

      At the end of 3 months, biochemical tests and an endothelial function assessment were
      repeated. Medical history, questionnaires, and the physical exam were also repeated.
