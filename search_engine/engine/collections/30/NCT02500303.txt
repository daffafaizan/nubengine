      influence the rehabilitation and functional outcomes following LEA, in the long term in both
      those with and without diabetes.

      Therefore this study will be a prospective observational analysis of all those who undergo a
      LEA in one year within the Greater Glasgow & Clyde area with follow up at 6, 12 & 18 months
      from date of amputation.

        -  Primary Endpoint Comparison of rehabilitation and functional outcomes in those with
           diabetes to those without diabetes, up to 18 months post LEA.

        -  Secondary endpoints

             1. At discharge from rehabilitation, the characteristics of those who proceed to limb
                fitting following LEA to those who do not will be defined.

             2. At discharge from rehabilitation, the characteristics of those with diabetes that
                do not proceed to limb fitting following LEA compared to those who do.

             3. At discharge from rehabilitation to 18 months post LEA, a comparison of the
                characteristics in those with and without diabetes.

             4. From six months post LEA, at 6 monthly intervals (6,12 & 18 months), a comparison
                of the health status, social circumstances, mobility and quality of life measures
                in those with and without diabetes.
