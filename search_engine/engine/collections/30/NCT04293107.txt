      leaks up into the oesophagus (food pipe) causing highly unpleasant symptoms and sometimes
      needing hospital admission. Children with cerebral palsy suffer from a poorly contracting
      food pipe (oesophageal dysmotility). As a result, GORD is more problematic in these children
      and more common; of the 8000 children with cerebral palsy aged 5-16 in the UK, around half
      suffer from reflux disease. This is treated with medicines or surgery. There is not an
      accurate measure of their symptoms, though there is a suitable questionnaire in well children
      (the PGSQ). National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have recommended
      research to assess the effectiveness of medicines to treat GORD in these children (NG1
      research recommendation). In the first phase, the investigators will ask 6 parents/carers
      their opinions about the PGSQ using qualitative interviews, and alter the PGSQ if needed;
      then in the second phase, ask 20 parents/carers about their child's symptoms to understand
      the reliability of the PGSQ at two time points 2 weeks apart (test-retest). The investigators
      won't do any invasive tests on the children but will ask parents about their opinions of
      their children taking part in pH-impedance monitoring, which is used to assess severity of
      GORD and may be useful in designing future studies.
