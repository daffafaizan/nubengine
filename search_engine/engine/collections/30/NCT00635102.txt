      in alcoholic patients and healthy subjects. Preclinical studies have shown that compounds
      acting at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex, such as
      glycine, may reverse the effects of ethanol on the NMDA receptor function (Rabe et al.,
      1990). The amino acid glycine is a co-agonist of the NMDA receptor complex (Kemp et al.,
      1993). It binds to the strychnine-insensitive site and positively modulates the NMDA receptor
      (Mc Donald et al., 1990). Physiologically, the glycine site is not saturated, and
      administration of glycine can potentiate NMDA receptor mediated responses. In contrast,
      D-cycloserine (Hood et al., 1989) is a partial-agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA
      receptor, with dose-dependent NMDA antagonist properties. The NMDA antagonist activity of
      D-cycloserine should produce ethanol like-effects that can be reversed by the agonist
      glycine. This study is intended to evaluate possible contributions of the glycine site to the
      reduction of cognitive deficits of alcoholism and complements the current work at VA
      Connecticut Healthcare System on the NMDA antagonists in alcoholic and healthy subjects.
