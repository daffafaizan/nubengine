    
      This is a prospective observational study including patients undergoing TAVI with either
      self- or balloon-expandable valves. After the procedure, patients will be on ECG monitoring
      during the hospitalization period (or at least 72 hours), and an ECG will be performed daily
      until hospital discharge in all patients. Patients with new-onset persistent LBBB at hospital
      discharge (new-onset LBBB of a duration of at least 48 h which persists at hospital
      discharge, at least 3 days and up to 15 days after the procedure) will receive an implantable
      loop recorder Reveal ICM LINQÂ®, which will be implanted subcutaneously to record adequate QRS
      complexes and P waves. The patients will be followed in outpatient clinic visits at 1, 12, 24
      and 36 months after TAVR, or if symptoms suggestive of cardiac origin or relevant arrhythmic
      events occur. The device will be manually interrogated in each visit. Phone contacts will be
      also carried out every three months.
