      treatments have been used post TKR: IV opioids, epidural infusions, peripheral nerve blocks.
      No one method has been recognised as the best one.

      In this study we will compare two well established methods of pain treatment:

        1. continuous infusion of local anesthetics + opioids into the epidural space,

        2. patient controlled analgesia with IV Morphine.

      The study design is double blind.

      Patients will have a combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for the operation and then will be
      connected to 2 different pumps, one to the epidural catheter and one to the intravenous
      catheter, for the first 24 hours post-operatively.

      Pain scores, total analgesic medications other than study medications, adverse reactions to
      study medications, complications and patient satisfaction will be followed by blinded
      observers and compared between groups.
