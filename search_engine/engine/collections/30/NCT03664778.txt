      increased risk of developing a second breast cancer in the ipsilateral and the contralateral
      breast. Although mammographic screening is recommended annually, the sensitivity of
      mammography is limited in these patients due to the post treatment changes from previous
      surgery and radiation. We propose supplemental screening with an abbreviated form of breast
      MRI ("fast MRI") examination in addition to mammographic screening, in order to study whether
      we can detect subclinical disease that may not be detected on mammography or on physical
      examination. Several tumor characteristics correlate with overall survival such as the extent
      of local recurrence and the size of the local recurrence, with larger extent and increased
      size of local recurrence correlating with adverse survival. In addition, the shorter time
      interval to the ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence from completion of treatment, is
      associated with increased risk of developing distant metastasis and breast cancer mortality.
      We will assess additional cancer detection with fast MRI after negative mammography in the
      ipsilateral as well as the contralateral breast. The goal of the supplemental screening with
      fast breast MRI would be to detectsubclinical disease not detected on mammography and thus
      improve patient outcomes.
