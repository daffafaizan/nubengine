      heterogeneous diseases characterized by osteoarticular and dermatological manifestations.
      Inflammatory osteitis with hyperostosis is the central feature of the syndrome, typically
      affecting multiple areas and possibly progressing to irreversible osteoarticular damage.
      Owing to the relapsing-remitting disease course, the goal of management is to improve
      clinical symptoms and prevent disease progression. Therefore, it's meaningful to seek
      appropriate methods to evaluate current osteroarticular lesions. 68Ga-FAPI that targets
      fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is introduced in tumor imaging. However, FAP was also
      shown to be expressed in rheumatoid arthritis, bone lesions with acute to chronic
      inflammation, fibrosis and ischemic heart tissue after myocardial infarction, thus the
      investigators speculate that it is possible for SAPHO to be imaged with 68Ga-FAPI. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the performance of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT in SAPHO and to compare it with
      the performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT.
