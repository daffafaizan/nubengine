      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FR901228 (depsipeptide) in patients with
      recurrent malignant gliomas who are taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs).
      (Phase I) II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. (Phase I) III.
      Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. (Phase I)
      IV. Determine the clinical efficacy of this drug, as measured by 6-month progression-free
      survival and objective tumor response, in these patients. (Phase II) V. Determine the safety
      profile of this drug when administered at the phase I MTD concurrently with or without EIAEDs
      in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.
      Patients are stratified according to study phase (I vs II), concurrent use of enzyme-inducing
      anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no), histology (recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme/gliosarcoma vs recurrent anaplastic glioma), pre-operative candidacy (yes vs no),
      and measurable/evaluable disease (yes vs no). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups (group A: no EIAEDs or group B: concurrent use of EIAEDs).

      Phase I (group B only): Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1,
      8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of FR901228 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of up to 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Phase II (groups A and B):

      Group A (phase II): Patients receive FR901228 as in phase I at dose level 1. Group B (phase
      II): Patients receive FR901228 as in phase I at the MTD.
