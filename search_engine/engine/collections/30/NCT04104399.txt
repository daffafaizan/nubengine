    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group single ascending dose
      (SAD) study. There are 4 cohorts of 8 subjects (8 active and 2 placebo) planned for
      evaluation under fasting conditions. One of the planned dose levels will cross over after a
      washout period to receive the same single dose of XC101-D13H or placebo under fed conditions.
      Dose escalation will be supervised by a Safety Monitoring Board (SMB). Dose escalation to the
      next dose level will not take place until the SMB has determined that adequate safety,
      tolerability, PK, and core-lab analyzed ECGs from the previous cohort and all previous
      cohorts have been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort. PK data from all
      available cohorts will be used to guide the dose-escalation decisions.
