      tocilizumab in RA patients. Participating patients are among those for whom tocilizumab is
      indicated and who are scheduled to receive tocilizumab as part of their normal care, in full
      compliance with the FDA-approved prescribing information. Study assessments consist of
      clinical evaluations and laboratory tests conducted in conjunction with the first three
      monthly intravenous infusions of tocilizumab. These assessments are designed to provide a
      better understanding of the pharmacodynamic effects and mechanistic actions of tocilizumab
      and help guide the clinical development of other therapeutic agents for RA. A total of 15
      patients are expected to participate for approximately 10 weeks.
