      many different colon preparations, however endoscopists traditionally recommend the patient
      remain on a clear liquid diet for at least 24 h prior to their colonoscopy to reduce
      continued residue inflow into the colon from the small bowel, in addition the large volume
      preparation with PEG. The most common problems leading to less than adequate colon cleansing
      include lack of compliance with the clear liquid diet and difficulty taking the large volume
      preparation.
