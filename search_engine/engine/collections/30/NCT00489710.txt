      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated
           with talabostat mesylate.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate changes in specific cytokine levels and peripheral blood flow cytometry with
           progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral talabostat mesylate once daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are obtained from patients at baseline and after each course for biomarker
      correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for serum cytokines and chemokines and for T-cell
      subsets and NK cells by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood lymphocytes are obtained at baseline
      and after course 1 for future assessment by gene microarray analysis.
