    
      Advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly chemosensitive disease displaying a
      dismal short-term prognosis with more than three quarters of patients in progression 12
      months after the initiation of conventional chemotherapy. Approximately 2/3 of TNBC are
      expressing EGFR and breast cancer, including TNBC, is a disease highly sensitive to
      anthracyclines. Furthermore, data from a phase I trial, in 26 patients with different solid
      tumors, show very little toxicity and signs of efficacy of anti-EGFR-IL-dox.

      The EGFR assessment will be performed centrally and only patients with EGFR positive tumors
      will be included. The patients will be treated with the anti-EGFR-IL-dox until progression
      and followed-up according to standard practice for patient with TNBC.
