      (BJI). More than 80% of the strains isolated in France are methicillin-susceptible (MSSA).
      During the early phase of MSSA BJI management national and international guidelines recommend
      the use of intra-venous type M penicillin with a dosage ranging from 100 to 200 mg/kg/day.
      Pharmacological properties of this class of penicillin require 4 to 6 infusions by day.
      Continuous infusion of beta-lactams is increasingly used especially in intensive care units.
      It allows an improvement of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) parameters and a
      reduction in time dedicated to infusion preparations by the nurses. However pharmacological
      data regarding such administration is required for type M penicillin.

      Design A 6-day, prospective, randomized, open-label, monocentric crossover study

      Participants Twelve adult patients with MSSA BJI

      Intervention Patients will be randomized in two groups: the first group will receive 3 days
      of cloxacillin (150 mg/kg/day) through 4 intermittent infusions/day followed by 3 days of
      cloxacillin (150 mg/kg/day) through continuous infusion (2 infusions during 12 hours). In the
      second group the infusion modalities will be inverted and continuous infusion will be
      preceded by a loading dose. Serum concentrations of cloxacillin will be determined at Day 3
      and Days 6 The area under the curve / minimal inhibitory concentration ratio will be use to
      establish the equivalence between both administration modalities.
