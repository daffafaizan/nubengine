      recurrence, has limitations due to the invasive nature of glioblastoma. TTFields may decrease
      the tumor aggressiveness outside the target area potentially by multiple pathways, including
      immunogenic cell death and DNA repair inhibition sensitizing to radiation. We hypothesize
      that combined SRS and TTFields will be complementary, improving outcomes with minimal
      toxicity.

      In this open-label, phase II trial 40 participants with recurrence will be treated with SRS
      and TTFields, starting in 2020. Recurrence will be defined on FET-PET or MRI using RANO
      criteria.

      All patients will begin treatment within 14 days from baseline imaging evaluation and at
      maximum 42 days from screening.

      The attempt to obtain the Methyl-guanine methyl-transferase (MGMT) gene promoter methylation
      and IDH1 and IDH2 mutation from primary tumor are made during the study whenever not defined
      before entering to the study.

      TTFields treatment will be initiated as in clinical routine at patients home. Admission to
      hospital will not be necessary.

      SRS must be delivered within 7 days of TTFields start. A 5-day SRS regimen is allowed.
      TTFields should be interrupted only during SRS. The sample size of the study was calculated
      for the comparison of survival against a historical control.Overall survival will be
      stratified by volume, PET-based treatment, SVZ invasion, MGMT methylation status, time to
      first progression, and TTFields compliance.
