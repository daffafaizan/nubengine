      an investigational drug or drug combination to learn whether the drug or drug combination
      works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug combination is
      being studied.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Nivolumab (OPDIVO)

        -  Ipilimumab (YERYOY)

      This trial is studying whether nivolumab and ipilimumab work to treat INI1-negative cancers.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved combination nivolumab and
      ipilimumab for the specific diseases in this study but it has been approved for other
      diseases. Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been tested in children to find out a safe dose of
      this combination.
