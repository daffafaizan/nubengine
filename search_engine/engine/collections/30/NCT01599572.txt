      homes; 53 nursing home elderly were eligible and therefore were screened for low serum zinc
      levels (<70Âµg/dL). Of these, 31 (58%) had low serum zinc levels. Participants were randomized
      into either the placebo (N=16) or the zinc supplemented (N=15) group. Six participants did
      not complete the study for various reasons including refusal to take study capsules, and
      advice from their physicians; one participant in the zinc group experienced nausea on two
      consecutive days following ingestion of the zinc capsule at the beginning of the study. A
      total of 25 participants completed the study with 13 and 12 receiving the placebo and zinc
      capsules, respectively, over a period of three months
