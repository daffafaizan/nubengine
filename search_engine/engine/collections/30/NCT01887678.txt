      co-administered intra-articular (IA) injections vs placebo IA injections on the change in
      knee pain in patients with moderate to severe knee pain associated with osteoarthritis.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate reduction of pain and stiffness and change in
      physical function.

      Safety is evaluated by the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events during the
      treatment period and follow up period for all randomized patients.
