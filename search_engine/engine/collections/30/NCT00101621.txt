      M40403 in subjects with pain related to cancer. Because the effects of M40403 have not been
      previously investigated in subjects with cancer-related pain, the safety of single doses of
      0.0625, 0.125, and 0.25 mg/kg of M40403 will be evaluated in an open label phase of the
      study. These doses of M40403 are similar to doses that were used in subjects who were
      experiencing pain in prior clinical studies with M40403.
