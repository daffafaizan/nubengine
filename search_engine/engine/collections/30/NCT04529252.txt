      neurodegenerative forms of spinocerebellar ataxia as well and other nucleotide repeat
      diseases with the exclusion of Huntington's Disease. The analysis will be conducted to
      provide better clinical, genetic, and pathological characterizations of neurodegenerative
      forms of spinocerebellar ataxia. The investigators would like to create a repository for
      samples on these cases as well as prospective cases who are seen via clinic, support groups,
      referrals etc. The investigators will perform clinical evaluations utilizing ataxia pertinent
      scales. The investigators project to expand the present genealogical bank by collecting more
      specimens and identify more families in the process. All this will be performed in
      collaboration with basic scientists in order to conduct proper laboratory investigation that
      will help arrive at a cure for neurodegenerative forms of spinocerebellar ataxia and
      nucleotide repeat diseases excluding Huntington's Disease .
