      Cyclosporin A. Subjects will be evaluated for hematologic response through day 240. Subjects
      who do not demonstrate a partial or complete remission by day 120 will be randomized to
      receive either a second course of ATG or continue their current regimen. Subjects who do
      demonstrate a partial or complete remission will continue their current regimen through day
      240 or maintenance of a complete remission for 30 days. The last day of study treatment will
      be day 240.
