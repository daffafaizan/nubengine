      anesthesia were randomly assigned to either group C (n = 31, placebo), group P (n = 33,
      pregabalin), group PD (n = 29, pregabalin and dexmedetomidine) or group D (n = 31,
      dexmedetomidine). One hour before spinal anesthesia, patients received pregabalin 150 mg or
      placebo orally and a bolus dose of 0.5 μg /kg IV dexmedetomidine was given over 10 min before
      induction of spinal anesthesia, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/hr or the same
      calculated volume of normal saline till completion of the surgery. Clinically relevant pain
      for 24 h after surgery including time to first analgesic request visual analog scale (VAS),
      ketorolac dose, and patient controlled analgesics (PCA) volume consumed were recorded.
