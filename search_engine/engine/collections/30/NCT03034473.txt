      microarray-based gene expression signatures and single gene biomarkers (including
      5-Fluorouracil (FU) metabolism, apoptosis, Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS), CpGCpG island
      methylation phenotype (CIMP) and TGF-beta pathway), which have been established in patients
      treated with standard 5-FU based RCT in the GRCSG trials (e.g. the CAO/ARO/AIO-94-,
      CAO/ARO/AIO-04-phase III trials). This validation will be incorporated into clinical routine
      in all participating centers as a model for the treatment of solid tumors. If the KFO179
      biomarkers are predictive at a satisfactory level in the validation set, we will propose a
      prediction algorithm to stratify the patient population into a "high"-risk and "low"-risk
      population to develop local and distant cancer recurrence.
