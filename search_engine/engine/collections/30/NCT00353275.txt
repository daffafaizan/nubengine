      with necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI). The primary objective of this study is to
      verify feasibility of the intervention, provide unbiased and evidence-based estimates of
      treatment effects, and obtain data needed to design and direct a larger multi-center trial if
      necessary. The multi-center trial (n >100) will have adequate power to identify a 30%
      difference in favorable outcome defined as discharge alive from the hospital without an
      amputation in less than the median number of hospital days. Secondary objectives include
      evaluation of specific hypotheses relating the intervention to cytokine and neutrophil
      responses. These preliminary data will provide the basis for future research and grant
      applications, lend insight into the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia results in adverse
      effects, and improve outcome through the development of evidence-based therapeutic strategies
      for patient care.
