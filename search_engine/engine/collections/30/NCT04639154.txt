      use invasive techniques such as joint injections, nerve blocks and/or neurolysis,
      neuromodulation, and cement augmentation techniques to diagnose and treat pain syndromes
      unresponsive to conventional medical management. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is an
      interfascial plane block where local anesthetic (LA) is injected between the erector spine
      muscle and the transverse process. It is a simple procedure, with easy sonographic landmarks,
      for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracic, abdominal, lumbar, and urologic
      surgery. The ESPB was initially described to relieve chronic pain from metastatic disease and
      rib fractures.

      The ESPB provides blockade of ventral and dorsal ramus from T1-2 to T8-12 with easy insertion
      of a catheter into the distension induced by the injectate. It is performed away from the
      pleura and neuraxis, with low risk of complications in these structures.To our knowledge it
      is the first time study to evaluate the effectiveness of tramadol hydrochloride as adjuvant
      to local anaesthetic in ultrasound guided ESPB in the management of chronic chest wall cancer
      pain. Our hypothesis is that tramadol, when added to the local anaesthetic solution injected
      for ESPB, may improve analgesia and decrease the opioid consumption in patients with chronic
      chest wall cancer pain
