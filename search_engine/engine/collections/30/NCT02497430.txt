    
      The ARIES GBS Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in vitro
      diagnostic test designed to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) nucleic acid from Lim Broth
      enriched vaginal-rectal specimen swabs obtained from pregnant women.

      The objective of this study is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of ARIES GBS Assay
      through a multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected, left-over enriched Lim
      broth specimens.

      Diagnostic accuracy will be expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity and specificity.
