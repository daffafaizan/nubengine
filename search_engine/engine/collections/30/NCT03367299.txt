      lymphoblastic leukemia) will receive homogeneous supportive care, chemotherapy and
      blinatumomab immunotherapy, and will be homogeneously analyzed for response at prefixed time
      points from induction day 1. For risk-oriented therapy, patients in complete remission (CR)
      will be stratified by risk class according to the diagnostic characteristics and MRD (minimal
      residual disease) study results during early consolidation.
