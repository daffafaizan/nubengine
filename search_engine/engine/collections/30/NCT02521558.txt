      application used to deliver cognitive rehabilitation tasks to patients with mild cognitive
      impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. An
      estimated 100 patients will be enrolled into the study (~50 patients with mild cognitive
      impairment, ~50 patients with Alzheimer's disease).

      Participants will either receive memory tasks designed to help stabilize or improve memory
      (Intervention Group) or a set of word or math puzzles (Control Group). Participants will
      complete memory tasks or puzzles for a six month period. The investigators will conduct pre-
      and post- neuropsychological testing to assess changes in cognitive status (e.g., memory,
      language, executive functioning) in the intervention group. Neuropsychological tests
      assessing changes to cognition will be completed prior to participant assignment to the
      Intervention or Control Group. Both groups will then be assessed again using
      neuropsychological tests. The investigators will also assess changes in performance on
      cognitive rehabilitation tests over the six month period to determine the efficacy of these
      tasks.
