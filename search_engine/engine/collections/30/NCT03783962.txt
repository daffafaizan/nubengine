      lesson versus a passive observed lesson to a behavioral weight loss intervention results in
      significantly greater weight loss. Additionally, the study will examine whether interventions
      designed to promote cooking at home can increase participants' sense of food agency, and
      overcome common barriers to cooking at home such as time scarcity and budget constrictions.

      Overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants (n=64) will be recruited. Recruitment
      and study initiation will occur in two waves. Wave 1 aims to recruit 32 individuals who will
      then be randomized to 1) a 24 week, 24 session group behavioral weight loss intervention with
      12 bi-weekly cooking lessons; or, 2) the same 24 week, 24 session group behavioral weight
      loss intervention with 12 bi-weekly cooking demonstrations. Both groups get the same
      intervention and the same counselor delivered intervention elements; the presence of active
      cooking lessons vs. passive observed cooking demonstrations is the only difference between
      conditions. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 3 and 6 months. Wave 2 (n=32) will follow the
      same process as Wave 1 approximately two months after Wave 1 is initiated.
