      the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Heavily calcified lesions form a particular
      threat to DES; both damage to the polymer coating during vigorous advancement and inadequate
      diffusion of the drug to the subintima through extensive calcium arcs could contribute to the
      ineffectiveness of DES when implanted into such lesions, or may lead to primary stent
      delivery or expansion failure. Rotational atherectomy can effectively ablate calcified
      plaques. In the DES era, data concerning rotational atherectomy are scarce. DES implantation
      following rotablation seems a rational combination, but is only poorly supported by
      controlled studies. In the present study, we are using the polymer-based slow-release
      paclitaxel-eluting stent (TAXUS; Boston Scientific), with or without prior rotablation, in an
      angiographically well defined group of patients with complex calcified coronary lesions. This
      prospective, randomized, controlled study aims at evaluating the long term effects of both
      strategies in this complex cohort of patients.
