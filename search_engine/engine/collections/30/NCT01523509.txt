      cavitated, non-cavitated, healthy. Radiographs will similarly be scored.Although contrast
      agents are classified as drugs this is not a study of drug properties or effect on cells
      since the properties of the agent are already well know and its safety record well
      established. This study will be recording the radiopacity of the contrast agent on healthy
      tooth surfaces, non-cavitated tooth surfaces and cavitated tooth surfaces. The outcome for
      each surface type will be presence or absence of a radiopacity on a radiograph which will be
      made at the one and only visit for each study subject. The radiograph contains the data from
      the intervention (placement of contrast agent) and the outcome will be assessed some weeks
      later after the completion of the data collection.
