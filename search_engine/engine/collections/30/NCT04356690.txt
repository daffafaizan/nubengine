      of etoposide in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Randomization
      will be performed with a 3:1 allocation ratio. Treatment will be comprised of etoposide
      administered intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 in patients with COVID-19
      infection meeting eligibility criteria. Subsequent doses of etoposide will be allowed if the
      investigator and treating physician believe the patient had clinical benefit from etoposide
      therapy but subsequently has evidence of recurrent clinical deterioration. Subjects
      randomized to control will receive standard of care treatment. No placebo will be used.

      The rationale for the use of etoposide to treat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is the high
      mortality associated with the hyperinflammatory response to the virus, which is similar to
      that seen in other secondary types of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Autopsy studies of
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID patients show a high number of cytolytic
      T cells in the lungs of such patients. Early autopsy results of COVID patients at Boston
      Medical Center demonstrate significant hemophagocytosis in lymph nodes and spleen. Comparable
      studies in the related coronavirus infection severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have
      demonstrated hemophagocytosis, a hallmark of HLH.15 By targeting the T cells and monocytes
      driving the cytokine storm in patients with the more severe forms of COVID infection, we hope
      to alleviate the progression of lung and multi-organ dysfunction characteristic of patients
      who die from this illness.
