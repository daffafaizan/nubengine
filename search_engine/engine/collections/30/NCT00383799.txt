    
      Multicenter, prospective and randomized study in phase IV. A total of 302 patients will be
      included in the study within 40-50 institutions in Spain. Patients with regular and
      monomorphic tachycardia ≥ 120 bpm, QRS ≥ 120 ms and haemodynamically well tolerated will be
      randomized to receive iv amiodarone (single dosage: 5 mg/kg in 20 minutes) vs iv procainamide
      (single dosage: 10 mg/kg in 20 minutes). The study period will be 40 minutes from infusion
      initiation. Study variables include the presence of clinically cardiac significant adverse
      events: hypotension, syncope, heart failure, symptomatic sinus bradycardia, AV block,
      proarrhythmia and tachycardia acceleration (<20 lpm)and death. Total observation period will
      be 24 hours after the end of the infusion.
