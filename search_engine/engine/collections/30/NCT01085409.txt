      new pharmaceutical is nowadays only reimbursed if there is evidence of cost-effectiveness.
      This can be determined by different types of economic evaluations, of which cost-utility
      analysis (CUA) is preferred in most guidelines. In CUA the health outcome of a technology is
      measured in quality adjusted life years (QALY). Utilities to calculate QALYs should be based
      on decisions under uncertainty (decision utilities). However, the health care literature
      describes several problems that lead to bias in the measurement of decision utilities. These
      biases lead to an inaccurate estimation of the value of a health state and can therefore
      cause policy makers to allocate resources inefficiently. To solve some of these problems, it
      was suggested to determine experiences associated with different health states by measuring
      well-being moment-to-moment (experienced utility) by the Experience Sampling Method or the
      Day Reconstruction Method.

      Differences between the utilities measured using traditional preference based measures
      (decision utility), and using the new state-of-art methods ESM and DRM (experienced utility)
      in a range of populations with differing conditions and severity of health state will be
      investigated. Since somatic, psychosomatic and psychological conditions are likely to differ
      in the way they experience and affect well-being, we will involve patient groups from each
      category in this study as well as healthy controls.
