      two groups according to the presence of active cancer: cryptogenic embolic stroke with active
      cancer (cancer-associated stroke) vs. without active cancer (cryptogenic embolic stroke). All
      patients will undergo brain MRI/MRA, 12-lead electrocardiography, transthoracic and
      transesophageal echocardiography with injection of agitated saline, and 24-hour Holter and/or
      telemonitoring. Duplex ultrasonography to detect venous thrombosis of the lower extremity
      will also be performed in patients with a positive right-to-left shunt on echocardiography.
