      promise in animal studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in reducing tobacco and
      cannabis craving and use. NAC's efficacy in treating addiction may be attributable to its
      central nervous system effects in reducing excessive glutamatergic activity, oxidative
      stress, and inflammation. NAC has been shown to improve cognition and reduce impulsivity,
      which in turn may strengthen inhibitory control when presented with contextual cues. To date,
      no RCT has examined NAC for smoking cessation in the setting of tobacco-cannabis co-use. In a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT, the investigators will examine a novel pharmacological
      treatment, NAC, for concurrent tobacco use disorder (TUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD) in
      dual users of tobacco and cannabis. Sixty adult daily cigarette smokers who 1) use cannabis
      regularly and 2) consent to receive interventions to stop smoking cigarettes and using
      cannabis will be randomized to receive NAC 3600 mg per day or placebo over 8 weeks.
      Participants in both groups will receive 8 weekly cognitive behavioral therapy sessions
      addressing both tobacco and cannabis use. Outcomes will be assessed at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.
      Primary aims are to determine NAC's efficacy in decreasing cigarette use, nicotine dependence
      levels, and craving; and cannabis use, CUD severity levels, and craving. Exploratory aims
      include examination of changes in neurocognition with NAC and their potential mediational
      effects on cigarette and cannabis use outcomes.
