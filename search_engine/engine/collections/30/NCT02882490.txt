      disabling than the tics themselves.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a parent training program to control
      disruptive behaviors in children with Tourette Syndrome. In addition, social cognition will
      be examined in all the participants to analyze its relationship with the severity of
      disruptive behavior and the treatment response.

      42 children with Tourette Syndrome and moderate disruptive behaviors will be randomly
      assigned to a 10-week Parent Training Program or a 10-week Supportive Therapy. Clinical
      response will be evaluated after the intervention period, and three and six months later.
