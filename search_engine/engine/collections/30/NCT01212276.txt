      original affected tissue and invade distant tissue and organs. Treatment for metastatic
      melanoma includes medical treatments (chemotherapy or immunotherapy), surgery, or radiation
      therapy. MORAb-028 is a recombinant human immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal antibody that
      recognizes a cell surface diacyl ganglioside named disialoganglioside (GD2). GD2 is
      overexpressed in tumors of neuro-ectodermal origin such as melanomas, neuroblastomas,
      small-cell lung carcinomas, and many sarcomas, while absent in most normal tissues. GD2
      expression has been demonstrated in human melanoma and small cell lung cancer by thin layer
      chromatography and radiolabeled anti-GD2 antibody detection. It is hypothesized that one mode
      of action of MORAb-028 is complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent
      cytotoxicity is a mechanism for killing tumor cells in which an antibody bound to the target
      cell surface fixes complement, which results in assembly of the complement membrane attack
      complex that punches holes in the target cell membrane resulting in subsequent cell lysis.
      IgMs strongly bind to C1Q and robustly activate complement-dependent cytotoxicity. MORAb-028
      is being developed as a potential therapy for GD2-positive tumors.
