    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine how a variety of immune-modulating therapies (i.e., interferon alfa [IFN-α]
           in patients with untreated acute or chronic hepatitis C, anti-tumor necrosis factor in
           patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn disease), and anticytotoxic
           T-lymphocyte antigen immunoglobulin in patients with metastatic melanoma) affect the
           tissue expression of indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), a major immune-regulatory
           mechanism.

        -  To determine whether administration of pegylated INF-α in patients with untreated acute
           and chronic hepatitis C causes systemic changes in the IDO pathway, as indicated by
           lowered serum tryptophan (TRP) and elevated serum kynurenine (KYN).

        -  To determine whether administration of ticilimumab (i.e., anti-CTLA4 human monoclonal
           antibody CP-675,206) in patients with metastatic melanoma inhibits activation of the IDO
           pathway as indicated by normal serum TRP and normal serum KYN.

        -  To determine whether administration of infliximab in patients with Crohn disease
           inhibits activation of the IDO pathway, as indicated by normal serum TRP and normal
           serum KYN.

      OUTLINE: Serum samples are collected from patients with hepatitis C and metastatic melanoma
      at baseline and at 3 to 4 weeks after treatment is initiated. Previously collected samples
      from patients with Crohn disease are also assessed at these time points. Samples are analyzed
      for tryptophan and kynurenine levels via high-performance liquid chromatography.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients with untreated acute or chronic Hepatitis C, 15
      patients with metastatic melanoma, and 20 patients with Crohn disease will be accrued for
      this study.
