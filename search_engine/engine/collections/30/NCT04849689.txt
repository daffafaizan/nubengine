      Investigators will investigate the muscle mass preservation of participants on our 12-year
      lasting ongoing, community-based (free-living), WFPB lifestyle program during the weight/fat
      loss of participants.

      The primary outcome is the BF %, and FFM % change from initial values to FU values (for whole
      sample and by gender) and to estimate the proportion of participants who did not increase FFM
      or FFM % within this change.

      Secondary outcome include correlation between age, gender, BMI and body composition values,
      and PhA. Based on our experiences we believe that some participants that follow our WFPB
      lifestyle program may initially "afraid" to eat, according to the instructions, each meal to
      satiety (ad libitum). The reason lies in the typical weight loss recommendation in
      Western-type lifestyle that advise "eating less". Therefore, the proportion of participants
      who will not increase muscle mass (FFM or FFM %) as hypothesis, we set arbitrary that was
      less than 20%.

      The body composition measures will include body height (BH; measured via standardized medical
      approved professional personal floor scale with stand (Kern, MPE 250K100HM, Kern & Sohn,
      Balingen, Germany), body mass (BM), BF mass and BF %, FFM and FFM %, bone mineral mass (BMM),
      visceral fat (VF), total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water
      (ICW), the ratio, whole body phase angle (PhA), all via medically approved and calibrated
      bioelectrical impedance Tanita 780 S MA (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and the use of
      corresponding protocols (e.g., for BMI).
