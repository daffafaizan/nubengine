      that the greater older adult metabolic rates are related to the structural properties of
      their lower leg. The leg tendons of older adults are more compliant than that of young
      adults. Accordingly, older adult leg tendons stretch more as under a given loaded, during
      walking and running, causing their muscles to operate at shorter lengths and higher
      activations than that of young adults; using shorter muscles lengths and more muscle
      activation offers less economical force production. Thus, the investigators seek to alter the
      passive stiffness acting about the ankle, using an ankle exoskeleton in-parallel to the
      ankle, thereby enabling muscles to operate at relatively longer lengths. Generally, muscles
      produce force more economically when they are at operating lengths greater than that
      exhibited during normal walking. By adding an exoskeleton in-parallel to the ankle, the
      investigators hypothesize that older adults will walk with longer plantar flexor muscle
      lengths, thereby lessening their muscle activation, and consequently, reducing whole-body
      metabolic rate during walking.

      In this study, the investigators will have young and older adults perform isolated calf
      muscle contractions while the investigators capture the behavior of their leg muscles and
      tendons using a non-invasive ultrasound probe that sits flush to the participant's skin. The
      investigators will also have participants walk on a treadmill with the ankle exoskeleton set
      at multiple stiffness values. During these trials, the investigators will take many
      physiological and biomechanical measurements to assess why the optimal ankle exoskeleton
      profile minimizes the metabolic cost of walking in young and older adults.
