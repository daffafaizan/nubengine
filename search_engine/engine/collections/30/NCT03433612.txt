      reference point before performing a neuraxial block relies on the correct clinical estimation
      of the intercristal line. The classic intercristal line technique uses an imaginary line that
      intersects the iliac crests to determine a safe puncture level to access. In pregnant women,
      the classic technique fails to identify the safe puncture level 40 % of the time.

      The newly proposed Sacral Anatomical Interspace Landmark (SAIL) technique consists of using
      the sacral bone to determine a safe puncture level to access.

      Lumbar ultrasound will determine the accuracy of each clinical technique in identifying the
      L4-L5 interspace (target).
