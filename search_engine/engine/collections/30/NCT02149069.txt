    
      This pathway is called Blood Management Program (BMP).

      The implementation of this process should improve transfusion therapy in the peri-operative
      period in order to:

        -  correct the transfusional approach to surgical patients

        -  optimize the management of transfusional resources (red blood cells, plasma, platelets)

        -  optimize the management of plasma derivatives, drugs and techniques designed to limit
           the use of homologous blood
