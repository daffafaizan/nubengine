      glaucoma screening clinic at the RD&E hospital. In addition to standard care (SITA-Fast) each
      person who agrees to take part in the trial will undertake one extra visual field test
      (SITA-Standard). By comparing the results of the two types of visual field test the
      investigators aim to provide information on which of the two tests is more specific for
      glaucoma and which test is better tolerated by patients. The investigators anticipate that
      this study will generate sufficient data to support a grant application for a longitudinal
      study to examine the relative merits of different visual field tests in patients with
      glaucoma and those suspected of developing the disease.
