    
      Two sessions will be recorded, one in PSV, one with NAVA, delivered in a random order after
      being sure the infant is calm and comfortable, according to his parents and/or the nurse in
      charge.

      Criteria for initiating invasive ventilation and to start PSV will follow the usual practice
      guidelines of the unit.

      Ventilation parameters in PS will be adjusted by the clinician in charge of the patient, as
      usual based on clinical observation. Investigators will not interfere with ventilator
      settings. Ventilation will be applied via an endotracheal tube, uncuffed for the majority (if
      infant < 5 years), according to commonly applied guidelines in this unit.

      One 15 minutes session will be recorded, after being sure the infant is calm and comfortable
      according to the parents and/or the nurse in charge. Then the clinician in charge of the
      patient will modify the ETS, first decreasing it of 10% below the initial set value, and will
      be recorded the following 5 minutes after stabilization and secondly increasing it of 10%
      above the initial set value, and will be recorded the following 5 minutes after
      stabilization.

      NAVA will be set to deliver initially the same peak pressure (comparable level of assist)
      than during the initial PS period. Same PEEP will be delivered in both modes. This is
      possible with a pre-visualization window, allowing adjustments before switching to the NAVA
      mode. Nava ventilation will be recorded during 20 minutes.

      The 2 sessions, Pressure support and Nava, will be recorded consecutively.
