    
      This study is a randomized, open-label, positive control, multicenter, phase â…¢ study to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection with
      Chidamide in patients with relapsed/refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma (PTCL). The
      eligible patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups in a 1:1
      ratio. The patients in experimental group will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome
      Injection (20 mg/m2) once every 28 days for a maximum of 6-8 cycles. Patients in the control
      group will be treated with Chidamide (30 mg) twice per week with 3-day intervals until
      disease progression. Patients in the control group who had confirmed disease progression will
      have the option to switch to the liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride treatment. Patients
      will receive treatment until the completion of 6-8 cycles of treatment (this applies only to
      the experiment group), disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, loss to follow-up,
      withdrawal (patient's decision or investigator's decision), whichever comes first. All
      patients will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease
      progression/recurrence, initiation of new antitumor therapy, or being lost to follow-up.
