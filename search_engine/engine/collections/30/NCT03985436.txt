      to deliver a single session behavioral medicine for pain intervention for the spine surgery
      patient entitled "TREK (Transform, Restore, Empower, Knowledge) for Surgical Success" (TREK
      for SS). The intervention is based off of the above noted evidence based 2 hour pain
      psychology class that has been used in the chronic pain population and is also currently
      being tested in other surgical populations. Use of this established and evidenced based
      treatment for the proposed project enhances the treatment fidelity. The proposed project
      addresses questions in the literature such as the benefits of this class in an in-person or
      online format and its adaptability and effectiveness in the spine surgery population.

      The primary objective of the proposed project is to determine the feasibility of a single
      session digital behavioral medicine for pain intervention (TREK for SS) offered the
      perioperative period of lumbar spine surgery as measured by patient satisfaction and
      intervention acceptability ratings and retention rates. In this study the perioperative
      period is defined as a 8 week window straddling the surgery date. A secondary objective of
      the study is to gather preliminary data to support the efficacy of TREK for SS as measured by
      relevant post surgical outcomes compared to a group of historical controls who received usual
      care. Should this pilot study demonstrate effectiveness in lumbar spine surgery patients,
      there is the potential to study larger groups of patients and to integrate the class into the
      standard of care as a cost-effective intervention for the spine surgery population.
      Additionally, findings from this pilot study could substantiate the need for training in the
      class protocol across disciplines so that barriers to receiving pain psychology intervention
      can be minimized.
