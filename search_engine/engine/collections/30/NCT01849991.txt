      infants with colic. Patients will be randomized to receive either L. reuteri at one dose
      orally for a total of 42 doses. The doses will be 5x108 (5 drops) during a satisfactory
      assessment of safety and tolerability. The time on study treatment is 6 months, and the
      target sample size is 45 healthy infants.

      Secondly, the investigators aim to gather evidence supporting hypothesis of safety and
      tolerability of Lactobacillus reuteri by administering a physical examination and testing of
      complete blood count, liver tests, and serum electrolytes over a forty-two day period.
