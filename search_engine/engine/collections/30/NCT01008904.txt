      Primary

        -  To determine if magnesium oxide supplement will decrease the frequency and severity of
           hot flashes by 50% in menopausal women with cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the effect of magnesium oxide on overall quality of life.

        -  To evaluate the toxicities of magnesium oxide when administered at commonly used
           supplement doses.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral magnesium oxide once daily in weeks 2-5. Patients whose hot
      flashes are not satisfactorily controlled after 2 weeks of treatment may receive magnesium
      oxide twice daily in weeks 4 and 5.

      Patients complete a daily hot flash diary for 5 weeks beginning 1 week before treatment.
      Patients also complete quality-of-life, symptom, and self-assessment questionnaires at
      baseline, once weekly during treatment, and at the completion of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.
