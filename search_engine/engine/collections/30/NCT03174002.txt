      (ICU) are at risk of life-threatening hypoxia, and thus oxygen is administered. However, the
      evidence on the optimal level of oxygenation is of low quantity and quality with no firm
      evidence for benefit or harm. Importantly, liberal use of supplementary oxygen may increase
      the number of serious adverse events including death. The aim of the HOT-ICU trial is to
      assess the benefits and harms of two targets of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood
      (PaO2) in guiding the oxygen administration in acutely ill adults with hypoxaemic respiratory
      failure at ICU admission.
