      chevron osteotomy technique for correction of hallux valgus deformity in comparison to the
      open distal chevron technique. Patients undergoing a distal chevron osteotomy for correction
      of a hallux valgus deformity are assigned to one of the two groups. Survey is taken
      preoperatively, after 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Assessment of the clinical
      outcome measures in terms of the range of motion (ROM), Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) of pain,
      the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) forefoot Score and a patient
      satisfaction score and a Life Quality score (SF 12) as well as the evaluation of the Charlson
      Comorbidity score is performed. It is hypothesized, that clinical outcome with the minimally
      invasive distal chevron osteotomy is superior to the open technique.
