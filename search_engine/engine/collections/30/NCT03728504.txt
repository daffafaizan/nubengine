      randomized (1:1:1) to receive ASN002 at 40 mg, 80 mg, or placebo once daily for 16 weeks
      (Part A). Then, in Part B, subjects who were assigned to placebo in the first part of the
      study will receive the highest dose of ASN002 (80 mg) for the rest of the treatment period
      (up to Week 32). The subjects who were assigned ASN002 in the first part of the study will
      continue on the same assigned treatment dose during the second part of the study (Week 16 to
      Week 32). The total treatment period of 32 weeks will be followed by a 4 week follow-up
      period.This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASN002
      through blood sampling and three or four biopsies from subjects who consent.
