      accompanied by interscalene brachial plexus block causes Horner's syndrome presenting with
      miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis. The extent of Horner's syndrome can be represented by the
      difference in pupil diameter between bilateral eyes. Cardiac autonomic nervous activity
      affected by stellate ganglion block can be measured by calculation of heart rate variability
      parameters.
