    
      This is a 22-week study of the tolerability, dosing, and efficacy of duloxetine in
      chronically depressed outpatients. Participants can have Dysthymic Disorder (Dysthymia), or
      Depression, Not Otherwise Specified (Depression NOS).

      The first 10 weeks (Acute Phase) are double blind, placebo-controlled, and the second 12
      weeks (Continuation Phase) is open-label and all subjects will receive active medication.

      Tests of cytokine functioning will be performed and analyzed for treatment and placebo
      effects.

      In addition, a subset of patients will be enrolled into an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      sub-study, in which a variety of brain imaging techniques (including anatomical MRI,
      functional MRI (fMRI), MR Spectroscopy, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging) will be performed at
      baseline and week 10. Duloxetine responders will have a third MRI performed at week 22.
