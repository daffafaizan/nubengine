    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and randomized
      (study medication assigned by chance) study in treatment-naive human immunodeficiency virus
      type 1 (HIV-1)-infected participants (participants who had not been treated with a
      therapeutic HIV vaccine within 1 year prior to enrollment and who had never been treated with
      an antiretroviral [ARV] medication indicated for the treatment of HIV-infection or ARVs for
      treatment of hepatitis B infection with anti-HIV activity prior to screening). In this study
      approximately 32 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive 4 different
      dose regimens co-administered with ritonavir (8 participants in each dosing regimen). The
      trial will consist of a screening period (maximum 6 weeks), a treatment period with TMC310911
      (2 weeks), and a follow-up period (4 weeks). Safety evaluation will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations and
      electrocardiograms.
