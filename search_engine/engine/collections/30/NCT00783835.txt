    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (when
      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), single arm
      study of multiple doses of long-acting methylphenidate in participants with ADHD. The study
      will consist of 2 phases; a screening phase and a treatment phase. The duration of
      participation in the study for an individual participant will be up to 12 weeks. Participants
      will be given 18 milligram (mg) of long-acting methylphenidate daily in the morning and
      titrated up (slow increase in drug dosage guided by participant's responses) to 36 mg per day
      (mg/day) on Day 8. Depending on response, tolerability and clinician's judgment, the dose
      could be escalated to the next dose level of 54 mg/day on Day 28 to a maximum of 72 mg/day on
      Day 56, until each participant achieved optimal dose. Participant's safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
