    
      This is a phase I/II, prospective, randomized case controlled study in patients with Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) that seeks to investigate whether the combination of intrapancreatic
      Autologous Stem Cell infusion (ASC) and Hyperbaric Oxygen treatment (HBO) can improve
      glycemic control and pancreatic function in T2DM patients compared to controls receiving
      standard medical treatment (SMT) with metformin and insulin alone.

      New therapies that lead to stopping ß-cell damage and possible ß-cell regeneration may
      decrease the incidence and progression of T2DM chronic complications and together with
      achievable life style changes may improve general health and quality of life of T2DM
      patients. Preliminary data from a pilot study involving 25 subjects with T2DM that underwent
      a combined treatment using ASC+HBO showed a significant progressive and consistent reduction
      in plasma glucose and HbA1c with an increase in C-peptide in conjunction with a decrease in
      the number and dose of oral agents and/or insulin. These encouraging preliminary results
      require confirmation in a controlled, randomized prospective trial.
