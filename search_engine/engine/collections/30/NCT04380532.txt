      patients is produced. The goal of this trial is test safety and immunogenicity of
      once-per-day day administered orally to volunteers for 15 days. Baseline and post-treatment
      standard safety parameters will be compared. Blood samples from volunteers will be monitored
      and immunogenicity lab assays will be undertaken to characterize immune response.
