      often used, neuromuscular blocking agents may sometimes have consequence in form of residual
      neuromuscular block.

      Tha aim of the study is to compare influence of rocuronium during general anesthesia on
      muscle strength recovery measured by hand grip dynamometer. Measuremwnt of hand grip strength
      is perforrmed before and after general anesthesia. This research should contribute to better
      choice of anesthesia technique and better quality of patient recovery, as studies so far have
      not been detaily carried out.

      Hypothesis of the research is that anesthesia without use of neuromuscular blocking agents
      may enable better recovery of muscle strength in immediate postoperative period.
