      emergencies. They are associated with swelling and intense pain. Internal sphincter
      hypertonicity plays a role in the aetiology of the pain. This study evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of an intersphincteric injection of botulinum toxin for pain relief in patients
      with thrombosed external haemorrhoids. Methods: Thirty patients with thrombosed external
      haemorrhoids who refused surgical operation were randomized into two groups. Patients
      received an intrasphincteric injection of either 0·6 ml saline or 0·6 ml of a solution
      containing 30 units botulinum toxin. Anorectal manometry was performed before treatment and 5
      days afterwards.Results: After 5 days of treatment, the maximum resting pressure fell in both
      groups, but was significantly lower in the botulinum toxin group (P = 0·004). Pain intensity
      was significantly reduced within 24 h of botulinum toxin treatment (P < 0·001), but only
      after 1 week in the placebo group (P = 0·019). Conclusion: A single injection of botulinum
      toxin into the anal sphincter seems to be effective in rapidly controlling the pain
      associated with thrombosed external haemorrhoids, and could represent an effective
      conservative treatment for this •condition.
