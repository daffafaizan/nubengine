      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of trametinib and
      trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102) in patients with chemotherapy-resistant
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the safety of the combination of trametinib and TAS-102 across all investigated
      dose levels.

      II. Describe the clinical activity including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of the combination in an expansion cohort using
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on
      days 1-5 and 8-12 and trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then bi-annually
      thereafter.
