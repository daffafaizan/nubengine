    
      Subjects are randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to NBP607-QIV versus Agrippal S1. To assess the
      immunogenicity, antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition(HI) assay from
      sera obtained at pre-vaccination and 28 days post-vaccination. To assess the safety,
      solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited adverse events for 28
      days post-vaccination are assessed and reported. The serious adverse events are collected
      during 6 months post-vaccination.
