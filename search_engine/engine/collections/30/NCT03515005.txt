      and poor populations. Health providers generally lack the skills and resources to address
      social contextual factors (i.e. health and community services, social networks, social
      stressors, physical environment, and economic resources) that influence management of
      hypertension. Instead, providers tend to focus on adjusting antihypertensive medication
      prescriptions and exhorting patients to exercise and eat better. The investigators propose to
      determine the impact of using trained lay health advisors to help patients address social
      contextual factors that influence the management of hypertension. Helping patients address
      these barriers may lead not only to improved blood pressure but also to increased survival,
      reduced organ damage, and decreased health care costs. This project may also serve as a model
      of healthcare delivery innovation that could be used to address other health disparity
      conditions.
