      general population and even inactive people. Tendon pathology presenting clinically is most
      commonly seen in the chronic state and the exact pathogenesis of this disease has not been
      clarified scientifically.

      The first part of the study aims to establish the difference between asymptomatic and
      symptomatic Achilles tendons by correlating elastography measurements (axial and sagittal
      mean velocity and relative anisotropic coefficient) with more standard clinically based
      outcome measures. Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) will be used with a small group of patients
      affected by moderate-to-severe, chronic (>6 months of symptoms) midsubstance Achilles
      tendinopathy in comparison to asymptomatic patients.

      After establishing a range of normal to severe pathologic elastography measurements the
      researchers will conduct a 12-month clinical trial to determine whether percutaneous needling
      with PRP injection improves disease-specific clinical outcomes. PRP injection is commonly
      used in clinical practice to treat chronic tendinopathy. The pathophysiology is believed to
      be mediated through a variety of growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor,
      transforming growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor, that promote a healing response.
      One of the main advantages is that PRP is autologous and is prepared at the time of treatment
      (point of care). It has an excellent safety profile with almost no side effects. SWE imaging
      will then be used to assess degree of tendon healing following tenotomy-PRP injection.
