      To compare the impact of cognitive -behavioral therapy to that of properly structured psycho
      education on the 'illness burden' and functional outcome of bipolar disorder, in combination
      with pharmacotherapy.

      Interventions:

      Subjects will be randomized to either a "control" treatment group cosisting of 6 sessions of
      group psycho-education (topics include illness recognition, treatment approaches, and
      monitoring and coping strategies; based on manual by Bauer & McBride, 2002: Life Goals Phase
      I) or they will be randomized to the "experimental" treatment group: 20 sessions of
      individual Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Bipolar Disorder (topics include limited
      psychoeducation, activity scheduling/behavioural interventions, cognitive techniques,
      including thought monitoring and challenges to dysfunctional assumptions and other coping
      techniques; based on manual by Lam et al., 1999: Cognitive Therapy for Bipolar Disorder)
