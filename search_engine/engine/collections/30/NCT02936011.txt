      the feasibility and safety of treating chronic total occlusions using dissection and re-entry
      techniques in combination with everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (Absorb
      BVS).

      Primary aims of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate a low rate of Target Vessel Failure (stent thrombosis, restenosis or late
           closure) at 12 and 24 months after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVS

        -  To demonstrate a high degree of endothelial stent strut coverage at 12 and 24 moths
           after CTO PCI and stenting with the Absorb BVSThe primary outcome measure is
