      ovarian ageing in an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) model. The study will examine whether the
      use of DHEA could improve clinical pregnancy rates following IVF treatment in women predicted
      to have aged ovaries by increasing oocyte quantity (ovarian response to gonadotrophins) and/
      or by improving oocyte quality. The oocyte quality will be assessed by morphological and
      molecular markers.

      This study will provide a mechanistic framework for translational research on mechanisms of
      ovarian ageing and drug interventions to slow down the ovarian ageing process and subsequent
      adverse physical and psychological consequences. Further, the data that will be produced from
      this research will have the potential to influence clinical practice in fertility clinics
      worldwide.
