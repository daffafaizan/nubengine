      Two infant populations with high (50 % and more) reported carriage of Sp were identified and
      will be approached for this study:

        1. Infants aged 6-30 months presenting with acute otitis media (according to specific
           clinical and otoscopic criteria) at their first line general physician or paediatrician
           and who have not recently received antibiotics and have no severe underlying disease
           (AOM infants).

        2. Healthy infants aged 6-30 months attending a day-care center and not recently having
           received antibiotics (DCC infants).

      Investigator(s), study sites

      75-87 paediatricians and general practitioners (GPs), and approximately 75 DCC throughout the
      whole of Belgium. Paediatricians in first line hospitals are allowed to participate.

      The Primary objective

      is to detect significant prevalence change of Sp serotypes 19A or 6A carriage over the
      observation period (three years, 2016-2018) in each of both study populations (AOM or DCC
      infants).

      Number of subjects

      In the first year (2016), 700 and from the second year ( 2016-2017) onward 900, patients with
      AOM (between the ages of 6 and 30 months) will be included every year. The same number of
      healthy infants attending DCC will be included each year. Sample size was calculated to allow
      comparison between children recruited in the first winter season, who have received PCV13 for
      all or the majority of their pneumococcal vaccinations, and the children in the following
      seasons, who will have received PCV10 for the majority or all of their pneumococcal
      vaccinations. Some over-recruitment will be done during the first winter (2016) of infants
      vaccinated in the region that has not yet changed from PCV13 to PCV10, since these infants
      will have received PCV13 for their 12 months booster too. The proposed sample size allows to
      detect changes as low as 3 % for 19A and 6A combined, and 4 % for each of them separately
      with 80 % power, in each of the AOM and day-care infant groups.

      Period of observation

      Since Sp carriage as well as AOM are most prevalent in and around the winter season,
      recruitment will be scheduled focusing on this period. In 2016, recruitment of infants
      presenting with AOM is foreseen from January till end of May, but can be extended to June if
      necessary to achieve the target number. Thereafter, infants with AOM will be recruited every
      year from October till end of May (starting October 2016). For healthy infants attending DCC
      recruitment is planned to start in March 2016, and thereafter every season from October 1st
      till May 31st. The current protocol covers the first observation period, from 2016 to 2018
      covering 3 winter seasons.
