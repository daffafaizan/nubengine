    
      Primary objectives are as follows:

        1. To provide access to treatment with investigational convalescent plasma to inpatients
           with documented COIVD-19 infection

        2. To measure NAb titers in an aliquot of the CP administered, to measure the volume of CP
           administered, and determine whether there is a correlation between the NAb dose (in NAb
           units/kg body weight, where a unit is the reciprocal of the endpoint NAb titer in the CP
           multiplied by the volume in ml) and change or lack of change when comparing
           pre-treatment and day one NAb titers.

      Secondary, exploratory objectives are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the safety of convalescent plasma (CP) administration in hospitalized
           COVID-19 patients

        2. To evaluate viral shedding of SARSCoV-2 in nasopharyngeal or nasal samples before and on
           days 3, 7, and 14 after CP transfusion

        3. To perform genomic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 from patients before and after treatment
           with CP transfusion

        4. Determine cumulative incidence of disease severity (transfer to ICU, type of respiratory
           support, LOS, and mortality)
