    
      This 12-week study is a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of
      N=66 recreationally, but normal to moderately overweight/obese male subjects to be recruited
      at a single investigational center in Northeast Ohio (i.e. The Center for Applied Health
      Sciences).

      Subjects will attend 4 study visits. At Visit 1, subjects will be screened for participation
      (i.e., medical history, physical exam, routine blood work, background baseline diet). At
      Visits 2 (day 0 - Baseline Testing), and 4 (week 12), measurements of various hemodynamic,
      hematologic & biochemical biomarkers of safety (Total testosterone, CBC, and comprehensive
      metabolic panel) will be made. At Visits 2, 3, and 4, the following efficacy measures will be
      obtained: Body Composition assessment via DEXA, Upper and Lower Body Performance testing on a
      Smith Machine and a TENDO unit utilizing the bench press and squat exercises, and anchored
      100mm VAS scales (for various psychometric indices). In addition, a comprehensive side effect
      profile/ adverse event monitoring will take place throughout the 12-week study duration.
