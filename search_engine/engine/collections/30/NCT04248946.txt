      options, and they often show little to no progress over time. Here, the investigators will
      assess whether transcranial direct current stimulation can improve patients' responsiveness.
      The investigators will use a protocol designed to target specific brain networks that have
      been shown to play a key role in explaining the lack of voluntary responses in PDOC. The
      study will focus on characterising the mechanisms of action of tDCS and the bases for
      potential individual differences in responsiveness to the stimulation across participants.
      This feasibility study is the first step towards developing personalised tDCS interventions
      to restore external responsiveness in PDOC patients. Its results will inform the design of a
      future trial fully powered for characterising neural, behavioural, and clinical effects of
      tDCS in PDOC as well as the mechanisms underlying individual differences in responsiveness.
