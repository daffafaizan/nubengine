      hormone will impact body composition, quality of life, and energy balance in PWS adults, and
      if there is a loss of effects after cessation of treatment for at least 12 months. Specific
      outcomes to be evaluated are as follows:

      â€¢ Increased IGF-1 as a function of human growth hormone dosage compared with baseline.

        1. Improvement of indicators or risk factors for co-morbid diseases [diabetes (by measuring
           insulin and glucose levels), cardiovascular disease (by measuring lipids and fatty
           acids), and pulmonary function] in participants.

        2. Improvement in quality of life measures as indicated by ratings on established behavior
           checklists in participants.

        3. Changes in body composition (decreased fat, increased lean body mass and bone density)
           as determined by DEXA in participants.

        4. Increased energy expenditure as determined by whole-room calorimeter measures (8 hour
           energy expenditure, RMR, TEF, mechanical work); diet records, physical activity monitors
           and strength measures.
