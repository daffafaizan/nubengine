      donors into HCV uninfected recipients at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Heart and lung
      transplant participants will be stratified into two different study arms depending on whether
      the donor of the thoracic organ was HCV nucleic acid amplifications technology (NAT) positive
      or negative. In the NAT positive arm, the recipients will receive a course of direct acting
      antivirals (DAA) to begin on the day of transplant, or at the earliest time point
      post-transplant. If the donor was HCV antibody (Ab) positive and NAT negative, the recipients
      will receive close monitoring with serial HCV viral loads (VL) and will only begin treatment
      with DAA if they develop HCV viremia.
