        -  Allogenic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative option for
           some patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and hematological cancers.

        -  HCT for PID looks to restore defects in cells of hematopoietic origin allowing for
           eradication of protracted or recurrent viral infections.

        -  The curative potential of allogenic HCT for hematologic malignancies is mediated by the
           allogeneic immune system through a graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect.

        -  Characterization of the immunologic landscape in patients with successful eradication of
           viral infections and hematologic malignancies following allogenic HCT requires further
           investigation.

      Objectives:

      -To collect and bank blood, apheresis products, tumor, body fluids, and other biospecimens
      from patients with allogenic HCT and perform immunological landscape studies.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients age greater than or equal to 8 years of age and have undergone or are planning to
      undergo HCT.

      Design:

        -  Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled.

        -  Patients may undergo sampling of blood, apheresis products, tumor, effusions, ascites,
           urine, bone marrow, skin, mucosa, saliva, stool, sputum, spinal fluid, or other tissues
           or fluids for banking and laboratory studies.

        -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.
