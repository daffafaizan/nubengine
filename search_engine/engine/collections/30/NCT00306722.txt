    
      This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, dose-controlled study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of AQUAVAN 6.5 mg/kg compared to a minimally effective dose of AQUAVAN
      2.0 mg/kg, both following pretreatment with an analgesic, fentanyl in patients who are
      undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.

      Following completion of preprocedure assessments, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      2 treatment groups at a 2:3 (AQUAVAN initial dose 1 [2.0 mg/kg]:AQUAVAN initial dose 2 [6.5
      mg/kg] allocation ratio on the day of the scheduled procedure. Randomization will be
      stratified by site.

      A person skilled in airway management (such as a respiratory therapist, a study nurse, or a
      clinician) and authorized by the facility in which the colonoscopy is performed must be
      immediately available during the conduct of the study. All patients will be placed on
      supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (4 L/min), and an ECG monitor, pulse oximeter, and
      blood pressure monitor will be attached prior to administration of study medication. All
      patients will receive analgesic pretreatment (fentanyl citrate injection for pain; lidocaine
      for topical anesthetic followed by the administration of study medication. Assessments will
      be made to evaluate the patients for levels of sedation, clinical benefit of sedation, and
      adverse events. Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis.
