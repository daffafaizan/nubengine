      parallel group study in patients with near end stage renal failure who require creation of an
      arteriovenous fistula for future haemodialysis. Enrolment will be over a period of 12 months.
      The blinded phase will be for 3 months. The study design is summarized in Appendix 1. The
      study consists of a screening phase, a randomization phase and a treatment phase.

      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups:

        -  Group 1 Losartan (50mg daily blinded) and 25 mg of atenolol

        -  Group 2 Placebo (blinded) and 25 mg of atenolol

      Patients: Patients must comply with specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The number of
      patients used will be sufficient to show a 15% difference in the left ventricular mass (LVM)
      between the two groups

      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the between group difference in LVM from baseline to
      1 month.

      Statistical Considerations: The analysis will be based upon an 'ANCOVA'-type linear
      regression model that includes baseline LVM and treatment group as explanatory variables, and
      final LVM as the outcome variable.
