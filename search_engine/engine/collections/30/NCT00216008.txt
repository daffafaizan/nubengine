      response rate, three- and five-year survival rates) of a three-phase multi-modality approach
      to adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. This study also aims
      retrospectively to determine if a specific tumor gene array profile would predict for
      pathologic complete response. Study schema is as follows. Patients are first staged, next
      they receive induction Docetaxel and Cisplatin on days 1 and 22, patients are then restaged,
      next they will undergo radiation therapy combined with Cisplatin and Docetaxel for
      approximately days 42 thorough 84, patients are again restaged, and finally surgery at
      approximately days 100 to 150.
