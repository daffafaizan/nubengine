      effectiveness of iSTAR, a community-based social network intervention that combines trained
      church-based Health Advisors and clinic-based staff and uses motivational interview skills
      and clinic- quality improvement approaches (Intervention Group; IG) versus a clinic-based
      approach (Control group; CG) on linkage, engagement, retention and viral suppression among
      HIV-infected women and children. Eighteen health facilities in identified local government
      areas in Benue state, north-central Nigeria will be randomly assigned to either the IG (N=9
      health facilities) or the CG (N=9 health facilities). A total of 10,000 pregnant women will
      be screened and 400 HIV-infected participants will be enrolled over a 24-month period. The
      primary outcome will be the difference in the rate of linkage and engagement between the
      groups. The secondary outcome will be the difference in rate of retention and viral
      suppression among participants. Additionally, we will conduct network, mediation/moderation
      analysis to examine the roles of intermediate variables such as health team cohesion,
      turnovers, attitudes, leadership and dynamic adaptation on iSTAR implementation and
      sustainment.
