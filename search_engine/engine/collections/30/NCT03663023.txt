      extent of adhesions has been assigned to the magnitude of previous surgery. In a county
      hospital, with a catchment population of 120 000 inhabitants, records of operations performed
      for bowel obstruction over a period of 70 months were retrieved. Codes for bowel obstruction
      according to an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) will include: Intestinal
      adhesion with obstruction, Other and unspecified intestinal obstruction, Intestinal
      obstruction and Peritoneal adhesions. Amount of adhesions will be calculated in relation to
      previous surgery.
