      either receive or not to receive antibiotics post-operative. All subjects did not receive
      intra-operative antibiotics. Routine follow-up included having the stent removed one week
      post-op and a return visit at 3 months. The research nurse made follow-up phone calls to the
      family or the (PCP) one week after the stent was removed and at one month post-op to see how
      things were going with the child and again after teh 3 month post surgical visit, if the
      subject did not return after multiple rescheduling attempts.
