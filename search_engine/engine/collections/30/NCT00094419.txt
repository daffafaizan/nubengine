      Americans compared to Caucasians. Surveys indicate that middle- and upper-income Caucasians
      use more CAM than African Americans, but the therapies utilized are different. This study
      will determine how well people with persistent asthma adhere to their treatment and whether
      the type and frequency of use of CAM affects treatment adherence.

      Participants will begin this study by taking part in an interview about adherence to their
      current inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) regimen and their personal CAM use. After completing
      the interview, participant adherence to their ICS regimen will be monitored for 6 weeks.
      Depending on the type of ICS participants are taking, monitoring will be conducted either by
      participant self-reporting or electronic monitors that record the time and date of medication
      inhalation. Participant adherence will also be assessed at study completion.
