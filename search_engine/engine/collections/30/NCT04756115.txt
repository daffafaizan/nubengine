      PAD, this study establishes the correlation between pre-operative pro-inflammatory biomarkers
      represented by NLR, LMR and PLR with short-term mortality and major amputations at 6-months.
      Likewise, the association between the pre-operative PNI with short-term mortality and major
      amputation at 6-months revealing the impact of nutritional status.

      - Data Collection: Demographic and clinical data. The initial surgical technique. The
      peri-operative outcomes Mortality and major amputation. The hemogram and biochemistry
      analysis were recorded preoperatively, at 48-hours after admission The inflammatory state was
      measured by the ratios of neutrophil/lymphocyte (NLR), lymphocyte/monocyte (LMR) and
      platelet/lymphocyte (PLR).

      The nutritional status was estimated by the PNI = (serum albumin g/dL x 10) + (lymphocytes/Î¼L
      + 0.005).

      - Statistical Analysis: significant values p<0.05. Descriptive analysis was presented as mean
      values and respective standard deviations.

      The chi-squared test and Student t-test were used for variables that followed a normal
      distribution.

      A non-parametric test was performed for the rest of variables (Mann-Whitney U). Spearman and
      Pearson correlations coefficients were calculated to determine the association between
      biomarkers and the hospital length-of-stay.

      For the multivariate analysis a logistic regression was performed. A receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to establish a cut-off point with the
      corresponding area under the curve (AUC), 95% confidence interval (95%CI), sensitivity (S)
      and specificity (E) for short-term mortality and major amputation at six months.
