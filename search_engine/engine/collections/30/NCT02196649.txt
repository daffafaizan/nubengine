      of prophylactic endoscopic clips. There has thus far been no prospective study to confirm
      this concept. The ideal way to prove the hypothesis is to conduct a randomised controlled
      trial to evaluated the use of prophylactic clip placement on the EMR resection defect, for
      the purpose of preventing delayed bleeding in colonic wide field EMR (lesions>20mm). Given
      the significantly increased rate of bleeding in the proximal colon, clip placement in this
      location may have the greatest benefit. If it is proven that such a prophylactic technique is
      effective and safe, it may lead to significantly decreased patient morbidity and health care
      resources associated with the management delayed bleeding.
