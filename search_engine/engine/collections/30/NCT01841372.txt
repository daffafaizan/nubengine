      will be on a diet developed by researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC).
      Subsequent to 6 months, participants who lost 5% weight will begin the weight maintenance
      phase of the study (0-12 months). Thus the total duration of the study is 18 months.

      Approximately 68% of U.S. adults are classified as overweight or obese (BMI >25).
      Behaviorally based weight loss programs, typically delivered by face-to-face clinics, produce
      clinically significant reductions in body weight over 3-6 months. However, approximately 50%
      of those who lose weight regain more than 45-75% of the weight lost within 12-30 months.
      Face-to-face clinics present many barriers and burdens to individuals including scheduling
      and logistical and financial burdens.

      Virtual Reality (VR) environments allow participants to create virtual representations of
      themselves called "avatars". An existing VR called "Second Life" will be used for
      participants randomized to VR. Participants avatars attend group meetings and use headsets
      for voice communication to interact with each other.

      Those not randomized to VR will participate in traditional face-to-face group weight loss
      intervention. The study will examine many different factors to determine if those
      participants in the Second Life group experience improved weight maintenance.
