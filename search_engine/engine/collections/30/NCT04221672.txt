      liver cirrhosis. Our previous study found that bolus injection of 1 mg terlipressin
      immediately after hepatectomy decreased portal vein pressure, and post-operative continuous
      use of terlipressin decreased the amount of abdominal drain. In this multicenter randomized
      controlled study, we aim to evaluate the effects of terlipressin in the patients who
      underwent liver resection complicated by portal vein hypertension. The primary outcome is the
      total abdominal drain on postoperative day (POD) 1 to 3. The secondary outcomes are: (1) the
      incidence of post-hepatectomy liver failure; (2) post-operative acute kidney injury; (3) the
      side effects of terlipressin.
