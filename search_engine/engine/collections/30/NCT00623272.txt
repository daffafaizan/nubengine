      myocardial infarction because it determines the prognosis and the therapeutic management
      (indication of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators). Three-dimensional echocardiography
      (3DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are accurate and reproducible techniques to
      quantify left ventricular volumes and LVEF. However, all the large randomized trials which
      evaluated the role of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) on survival in
      primary prevention were based on LVEF values obtained by older techniques like bi-dimensional
      echocardiography (2DE), angiography or radionuclide scanning. From now, no study has compared
      the measurements of left ventricular volumes and LVEF obtained by further current techniques
      after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) particularly after 1 month when ICD could be
      indicated.
