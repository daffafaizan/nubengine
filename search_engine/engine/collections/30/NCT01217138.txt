      were invited to the study. Two identical epinephrine autoinjector trainers (Epipen trainerÂ®)
      were used, one of which was modified by changing gray safety cap to red and placing a yellow
      arrow pointing to the black injection tip. Written and visual instruction sheet for each
      trainer was provided. Participants were asked to demonstrate the use of Epipen trainer either
      with the original or the modified one. They were scored and timed for demonstration. Primary
      study parameter was the rate of participants correctly demonstrating the use of epinephrine
      autoinjector. Secondary study parameters were the mean total score, mean time required to
      administer autoinjector and unintentional self injection of autoinjector into thumb.
