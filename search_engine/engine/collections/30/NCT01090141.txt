      study. Volunteers will be admitted for an overnight stay. Half will be female and half male.
      Twelve volunteers will have a body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m2, 12 will have a BMI
      25-40 kg/m2, and 12 will have a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2. Volunteers will have height and
      weight measured after they have consented to participate. Exactly half the volunteers in each
      category will received a single dose of intravenous micafungin of 100 mg, while the other
      half will receive 300 mg as determined by a coin flip. The volunteers will have blood drawn
      via an intravenous catheter just prior to the dose, and then at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24h
      after the drug dose. The intravenous catheter is then removed after the 24h blood draw, and
      the volunteer discharged from the study. Compensation will be provided to the participants
      for their time.
