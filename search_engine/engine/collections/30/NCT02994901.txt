      (group 3) will be recruited through Flyers.

      The investigators aim to isolate and cryopreserve peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
      from whole blood to perform functional assays on mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ROS.
      Furthermore, the investigators will investigate the association between biomarkers and
      frailty, quality of life, functional performance, fatigue and risk of depression.

      The investigators hypothesize that this profiling approach will allow the evaluation of the
      progression of age-dependent sarcopenia and uncover novel therapeutic targets.
