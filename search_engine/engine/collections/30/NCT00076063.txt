      live attenuated virus or live virus vector vaccines. Recombinant canarypox vaccines have an
      excellent safety record and have induced HIV neutralizing antibodies and CTLs in early
      clinical trials. This study will evaluate the use of HIV lipopeptides (LIPO-5) alone and in
      combination with a canarypox-based HIV vaccine [ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452)] to further increase CTL
      activity.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of five groups. Participants in
      Groups A and B will receive four injections over 6 months. Participants in Group A will
      receive four injections of either LIPO-5 or a placebo. Participants in Group B will receive
      four injections of either the ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) or a placebo. Participants in Groups C, D,
      and E will receive six injections over 6 months. Participants in these groups will receive
      either ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) and LIPO-5 or a placebo. Participants who receive the vaccine
      combination will receive four injections of the same dose of ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) and two
      injections of LIPO-5. The dose of LIPO-5 will be different for participants in Groups C, D,
      and E.

      Participants will have 11 study visits over 18 months; the total duration of the study will
      be 30 months. The length of visits will vary and may last up to 3 hours. Study visits will
      include a medical interview, brief physical exam, and blood and urine tests. Participants
      will be tested for HIV before entering the study and at least five times during the study.
      All vaccine and placebo injections will be given in the upper arm muscle.
