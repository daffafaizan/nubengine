      them are diagnosed with Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP). In order to identify the optimal
      treatment plan for individual patients with CUP, the primary tumor site must be identified.
      Patients undergo a wide range of costly, time-consuming, and inefficient tests to identify
      the primary site of origin, often to no avail.

      In this era of targeted therapies, the accurate diagnosis of the primary tumor can be
      crucial. miRviewâ„¢ mets is a new molecular diagnostic tool that identifies the
      tissue-of-origin of metastatic tumors, with 90% sensitivity.
