      physical and psychological well-being of children with cancer. Such adverse effects may start
      from diagnosis and continue for months or even years after the completion of therapy. Cancer
      and its treatments may also have long-term effects on the psychological well-being of
      children with cancer, such as decreased self-esteem, increased anxiety and depression that
      can adversely affect their quality of life.

      Numerous studies indicated that resilience effectively prevents the development of mental
      health problems and is associated with positive mental health outcomes in children and
      adolescents, such as reduced levels of anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive symptoms.
      Assessing resilience in children with cancer is therefore crucial for a thorough
      understanding of their responses to stress and adversity, which is an essential prerequisite
      for the design of an appropriate psychological intervention to enhance their resilience and
      foster the development of their coping mechanisms and positive mental well-being.

      This study aims to translate the original English version of Resilience Scale for Children
      (RS10) into traditional Chinese. It will then test the psychometric properties of the newly
      translated RS10. In addition, the factorial structure of RS10 will be examined using
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
