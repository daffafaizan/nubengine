      effective in reducing cerebral desaturation, there is no comprehensive data with regard to
      the dose-effect relationship of EtCO2 on rSO2 in the BCP under general anesthesia.
      Pharmacodynamic modeling can be useful in describing this relationship in which concurrent
      mean arterial pressure changes and disease state can be considered as covariates. Therefore,
      we investigated the relationship between the EtCO2 and rSO2 and identified the covariates in
      the pharmacodynamic relationship between EtCO2 and rSO2.
