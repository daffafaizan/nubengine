      In a between subjects, randomized design, 20 stable preterm infants born between 30-35 weeks
      gestational age will be studied. Infants will be randomized to one of two interventions which
      will take place during blood collections that are required for clinical management. For the
      standard care condition, infants will remain in their isolettes and will be positioned in
      prone and given a pacifier to suck on throughout the blood collection. For the holding
      condition, infants will be held skin-to-skin by their mothers and given breast milk using a
