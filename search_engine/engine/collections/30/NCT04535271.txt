    
      This is an open label phase 2 study using metronomic doses of trabectedin, gemcitabine and
      dacarbazine given intravenously.

      A total of 80 patients will receive trabectedin 0.5 mg/m2 as 24 hour continuous intravenous
      infusion (CIV) on D1 and D8, gemcitabine 250 mg/m2 i.v. on D1 and D8, and dacarbazine 250
      mg/m2 i.v. on D1 and D8 (see product information; www.accessdata.fda.gov). Treatment cycles
      are given every 3 weeks. Patients in this study may continue treatment until significant
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs up to one year of therapy. Patients who
      withdraw or do not complete the first 2 treatment cycles and first follow up CT scan/MRI will
      be replaced.
