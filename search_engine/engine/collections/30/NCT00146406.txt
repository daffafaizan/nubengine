    
      In the current study we plan to implement interventions at four social context levels, that
      is, with parents, providers or in other medical institutions, schools and community venues,
      to improve communication between adolescents and adults, facilitate increased access and
      utilization of health care services, and appropriate supervision of adolescents outside of
      school hours. As such the goals of the specific level interventions are as follows.

      Among parents: (1) to enhance communication and relationship satisfaction; (2) increase
      parents participation in the healthcare of their adolescents; and (3) to enhance appropriate
      monitoring and supervision of adolescents.

      Among school-based health care providers: (1) to increase access to and utilization of
      services by adolescents; and (2) to increase STD screening of adolescents.

      In middle schools: (1) to increase access and utilization to supervised after-school
      activities, either at school or in the community; (2) to address quality and fidelity of
      health education curriculum provision and teacher training; (3) to increase parental
      participation in school-related activities.

      In high schools: (1) to increase access and utilization to supervised after-school
      activities, either at school or in the community; (3) to address quality and fidelity of
      health education curriculum provision and teacher training; (4) to increase parental
      participation in school-related activities; (5) to increase awareness and utilization of
      school-based condom availability programs.

      In community venues: (1) increase adolescents utilization of community-based clinical
      services; (2) to increase adolescent utilization of non-clinic-based screening; and (3) to
      increase utilization of community-based supervised activities for youth.

      Activities will address these goals with the ultimate purpose of reducing adolescent risk for
      STDs, including HIV, and teen pregnancy through (1) increased age at first intercourse, (2)
      return to abstinence among sexually active adolescents, (3) decreased rates of unprotected
      sex among adolescents, (4) and increased screening and treatment of STD-infected adolescents.
