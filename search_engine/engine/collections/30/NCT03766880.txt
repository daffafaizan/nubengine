      esophageal varices and overt clinical decompensations in cirrhosis. However, hepatic venous
      pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement, the gold standard for defining CSPH (HVPGâ‰¥ 10mmHg) is
      invasive and therefore not suitable for routine clinical practice.

      This is a multi-center diagnostic trial conducted at high-volume liver centres (Zhongda
      Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University; Affiliated Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang
      University; Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University; Beijing 302
      Hospital; Xingtai People's Hospital; Shunde Hospital, Southern Medical University; The First
      Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University;
      The First Hospital of Lanzhou University; Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University;
      Ankara University School of Medicine) designed to determine the accuracy of MR-based models
      (investigational technology) for noninvasive detection of a CSPH in patients with cirrhosis.
      Transjugular HVPG measurement by means of catheterization of a hepatic vein with a balloon
      catheter is the gold-standard method to assess the presence of CSPH.
