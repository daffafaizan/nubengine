    
      Background: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a serious, sight-threatening ocular disease,
      occurring mainly in children. Prolonged use of ophthalmic corticosteroids is usually required
      in severe cases which could lead to serious complications such as glaucoma and cataract.
      Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are among newer treatments for VKC.

      Objective: To compare the efficacy of 0.1% tacrolimus (FK-506) ophthalmic ointment with 2%
      cyclosporine eye drops in the treatment of VKC.

      Methods: Twenty-four patients with VKC were recruited. After a 2 week-washout period, they
      were randomized into 2 groups in a double-blinded, parallel fashion. The first group received
      0.1% FK-506 eye ointment with placebo eye drops and the second group received 2% cyclosporine
      eye drops with placebo ointment for 8 weeks. Thereafter, all patients received an
      open-treatment with 0.1% FK-506 eye ointment for another 4 weeks. Subjective ocular symptoms
      and side effects were scored by patients at the entry, and at the end of the 1st, 4th, 8th
      and 12th weeks. Objective ocular signs were evaluated by an ophthalmologist (PK) at all
      follow up visits.
