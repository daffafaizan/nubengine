      standard therapy wane. Subcutaneous apomorphine rescues 'off' periods, but patient
      self-injection and adverse cutaneous effects are sometimes problematic.

      Methods: We assessed safety, tolerability and efficacy of inhaled dry powder apomorphine
      (VR040) in a clinic-based Phase II study. Of 48 patients recruited at 9 sites, 47 were
      randomized 2:1 inhaled apomorphine:placebo. Respirable doses (drug predicted to reach the
      lung) ascending through 1.5mg, 2.3mg, 3.0mg, and 4.0mg until efficacy was achieved, were
      administered to patients in a practically defined 'off' state. The primary endpoint was the
      response in unified Parkinson's disease rating scale Part 3 (UPDRS 3), at the highest dose
      received by the patient. Secondary endpoints included time to 'on', the proportion of
      patients converting from 'off' to 'on', and pharmacokinetics.
