      heart suddenly stops beating and there is no blood flow to the body. If cardiac arrest is not
      treated immediately, it causes sudden death. In the U.S. alone, over 300,000 people per year
      have OHCA, and less than 1 out of 10 survive. Therefore, it is important to study new ways of
      treating cardiac arrest patients in order to improve survival.

      The current standard practice for treating OHCA is to perform CPR and Advanced Cardiovascular
      Life Support (ACLS) at the scene until either the heart is restarted or resuscitation efforts
      are considered hopeless and discontinued. This practice is supported by the fact that all
      currently proven CPR therapies can be delivered by paramedics in the field.

      However, promising new strategies have emerged that are more feasible to initiate in the
      hospital. One such strategy is extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). ECPR
      requires placement of catheters in large blood vessels and connected to a machine to take
      over the work of the heart and lungs.

      This purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and potential benefit of expedited
      transport with ongoing mechanical CPR for patients with refractory OHCA patients to an
      Emergency Department capable of initiating ECPR.

      FDA approved this study as a staged feasibility study to enroll 15 participants and submit
      data prior to enrolling the second 15 participants. After enrolling 15 participants, the PI
      chose not to pursue an amendment to enroll additional participants due to slow accrual and
      research restrictions related to COVID.
