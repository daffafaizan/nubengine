      fitness center members. Because they are the population under investigation, recruitment will
      take place via the fitness center facilities. This population is under investigation because
      much of this population is sedentary and does not exercise at recommended levels, despite
      access to physical fitness facilities. This research will investigate methods to encourage
      physical activity in this population.
