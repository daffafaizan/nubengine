      analgesia (PSA) from time of medication delivery to recovery for children in the ED provided
      by Fentofol and Ketofol.

      Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that Fentofol will have a shorter duration of sedation time as
      compared to Ketofol.

      Justification: PSA for children is a common occurrence in the ED and has been performed using
      Ketamine or Propofol. Propofol offers several advantages over Ketamine, including shorter
      recovery times, and low rates of nausea and vomiting. Propofol is a potent sedative-hypnotic
      that does not provide analgesia, hence another agent is commonly used in combination for
      painful procedures. Propofol has been used in combination with Ketamine (Ketofol) and with
      Fentanyl (Fentofol) to improve the quality of sedation for painful procedures such as
      fracture reduction. Ketofol has been shown in a double blind randomized controlled trial to
      be at least equivalent, or even superior to Ketamine in children who are undergoing PSA, with
      shorter duration of sedation, increased provider and patient satisfaction, and reduced
      frequency of nausea/vomiting events. A combination of 1 to 2 microgram/kg Fentanyl and 1
      mg/kg Propofol has been shown to substantially reduce recovery time as compared to 0.05 mg/kg
      Midazolam and 1 to 2 mg/kg Ketamine, and provided adequate levels of analgesia during PSA. As
      a result, both Ketofol and Fentofol are considered standard treatments for PSA in the ED.
      However, there is currently no pediatric literature available comparing Ketofol and Fentofol
      for PSA in the ED setting and the results of this study will potentially identify which of
      the two sedation agents is superior.
