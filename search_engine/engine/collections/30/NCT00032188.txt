      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma
      treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and bryostatin 1.

      II. Compare the toxicity of 3 different doses of bryostatin 1 given in combination with a
      fixed dose of IL-2 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      dose levels of bryostatin 1.

      ARM I: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18. For
      the second and subsequent courses of IL-2, patients also receive lowest dose bryostatin 1 IV
      over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and middle dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and highest dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with stable or responding disease may receive 3 additional courses of therapy. An
      additional cohort of patients receives treatment as above at a higher dose to evaluate
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-65 patients (8-16 per bryostatin 1 dose level) will be
      accrued for this study within 14-27 months.
