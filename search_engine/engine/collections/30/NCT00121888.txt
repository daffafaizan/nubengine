    
      Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is common in the general population with the National
      Comorbidity Survey reporting a lifetime prevalence of about 8% in the United States (Kessler,
      et al 1995). PTSD is associated with marked symptomatic distress as well as significant
      impairment, dysfunction and reduction in overall quality of life (Kessler, 2000). Both
      pharmacotherapeutic interventions, including serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
      and psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) have demonstrated
      efficacy for PTSD (Davidson, 2001; Foa, 2000) However, although these interventions can be
      helpful, many patients remain symptomatic despite initial treatment. There is little data
      available to guide practice regarding the efficacy of "next step" strategies for patients
      remaining symptomatic despite treatment.

      In this study the researchers will examine the relative efficacy of the addition of the SSRI,
      paroxetine-CR, compared to placebo for patients remaining symptomatic despite a brief and
      intensive course of CBT.

      This is a two phase, 14-16 week research study in which participants who remain symptomatic
      at the end of one phase (4-6 weeks) enter into the next phase. In phase I, all participants
      receive prolonged exposure (PE) therapy. Participants who continue to have significant
      distress because of posttraumatic stress disorder after 8 sessions of therapy will enter
      Phase II. In Phase II subjects will receive 5 more sessions of PE therapy and be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like a flip of a coin) to receive paroxetine-cr (Paxil-CR) or placebo
      (contains no active medication). Participants receive this combined treatment over the next
      10 weeks.
