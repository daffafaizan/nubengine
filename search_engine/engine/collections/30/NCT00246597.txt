      cognitive-enhancing effect of this hormone. The objective of this study was to quantify and
      compare the incidence of chemotherapy-related impairment of cognitive and executive function
      in breast cancer patients randomized to receive PROCRIT versus placebo while receiving
      adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without a Taxane and to evaluate the effect
      of PROCRITÂ® on the incidence of asthenia (severe fatigue), quality of life (QoL), and mood.
      Patients received study medication injections (40,000 units) under their skin once every week
      for 12 to 24 weeks of chemotherapy. Doses were adjusted depending on the patients' hemoglobin
      level up to a maximum of 60,000 units.
