      in past studies. However, whether strength training or aerobic training could bring better
      benefits has not been confirmed in the past. This study designed to recruit 30 patients with
      mild dementia in the first year. Every patient will receive strength training using
      dumbbells, butterfly machine and vertical leg press machine for four weeks. Outcome measures
      including self care ability, cognitive function, MCP-1, BDNF and IGF-1 levels, and the degree
      of depression will be recorded before and after the training. In the second year, the
      investigators also designed to recruit 31 patients with mild dementia. These participants
      will instead receive aerobic training using stationary bicycle for four weeks. The same
      outcome measures will be tested as in the first year. Via the results of this study, whether
      strength training or aerobic training could bring better benefits in dementia patient can
      thus be elucidated.
