      when they are diagnosed. The average survival rate after five years has increased from 4% in
      the 1970s to around 14% currently.

      Surgery to remove the tumor or treatment with radiotherapy alone has led to disappointing
      results for patients. Chemotherapy has some activity in patients with advanced disease,
      although responses are usually short. New strategies are trying to combine these three
      treatment approaches to improve survival for these patients.

      This study will test the combination of cetuximab and bevacizumab in patients with locally
      advanced esophageal cancer. This is a group of patients with usually poor outcomes from
      treatment with surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Scientifically, this study will
      help assess the value in combining these two different types of drug.
