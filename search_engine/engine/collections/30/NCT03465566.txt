      Emotion recognition is a first step for the development of the capacity to judge the
      thoughts, intentions, and desires of others. In infants, the capacity to identify,
      distinguish, and interpret emotions is limited, but these processes are developing rapidly
      and innately during the first years of life, on the same neural bases as those described in
      adulthood. Children with BECTS show altered social behavior. In fact, deficit in social
      cognition could derive from brain dysfunction in the frontotemporal regions primarily
      affected in BECTS, since these regions are also viewed as playing an important role in social
      cognition and development of social skills.

      The investigators hypothesized that children with BECTS might have altered social cognitive
      skills and underlying neural networks.
