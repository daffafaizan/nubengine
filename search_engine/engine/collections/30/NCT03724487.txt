      skills, patient-provider communication, and social support in an effort to improve blood
      pressure control.

      The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized control trial (RCT) using a community
      participatory research approach and mixed methods to evaluate the efficacy of TBI
      intervention with community support (Coachman) compared to enhance usual care (ECU) among 60
      African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension.

      The investigators aim to:

        1. Identify key content, design, and resources from a community of stakeholders, including
           determining facilitators and barriers of hypertension self-management among African
           Americans that will inform the development of COACHMAN using a mixed methods approach
           methods.

        2. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of COACHMAN to improve BP control.

        3. Compare the difference in BP control between Technology-based intervention (TBI) and
           Enhanced usual care (EUC).
