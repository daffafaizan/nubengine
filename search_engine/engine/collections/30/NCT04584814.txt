      vital signs of the newborn (NB) and if there is a relationship according to the frequency per
      minute given by the scare respirator and the patient's respiratory rate.

      The "scare respirator" has been used many times to prevent central apnea in the newborn. This
      involves using a mechanical ventilator, but instead of connecting it to the patient's trachea
      to inflate his lungs, the air flow is connected to a surgical glove that inflates and
      deflates, with the optimal respiratory rate that the patient should have. This will be placed
      on the back to stimulate it tactically giving the necessary impulse of inspiration so that
      the patient alone can acquire the movement.

      The importance of the development of this study is that it has been seen that the "scare
      respirator" could avoid central apneas, but no studies have been done on the change in
      respiratory rate that occurs with the device or if it bothers the NB or alters its
      wakefulness sleep pattern.

      It is intended to evaluate 20 NBs, 10 term children and 10 premature infants, during 3
      observation periods. Heart rate (HR), Respiratory rate (RR) and saturation, pain scale and
      aEEG sleep wake pattern will be evaluated; first a rest period between feeds as baseline,
      then with a scare respirator at 20 cycles per minute and finally at 40 cycles per minute. The
      differences of qualitative and quantitative variables will be assessed with ad-hoc
      statistical tests.
