      helps improve walking speed during dual-task performance without increasing the fall risk in
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Compared with conventional physical therapy, there
      are studies that dual-task training significantly improved walking speed and stride in PD
      patients. In addition, a systematic review study has been reported that it helps to improve
      balance and cognitive function when dual-task training is performed for patients with
      neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease.

      Virtual reality is expected to promote functional recovery in patients with neurological
      disorders in terms of providing an enriched environment, goal-directed tasks and repetition,
      and inducing interest and motivation. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effect of
      applying cognitively challenging exergames using fully immersive virtual reality in patients
      with PD.
