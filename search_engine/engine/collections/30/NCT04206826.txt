    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerance of an adhesive film containing
      prebiotics on the improvement of signs and symptoms related to dry mouth by comparing it to a
      placebo film.

      The primary endpoint is the assessment of tolerability assessed using a visual analogue scale
      (VAS) from 0 to 100 at the end of the 1-month period of both treatment periods (D30 and D90).
      In this study, the efficacy and tolerance of the adhesive film containing prebiotics will be
      analyzed.

      Each participant in this study will receive two galenic forms of the medical device whose
      allocation order was previously defined by a randomization list.
