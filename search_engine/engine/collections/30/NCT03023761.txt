      were selected. A single visit Endodontic retreatment was done. After biomechanical
      preparation, Low Level Laser was irradiated to the buccal and lingual mucosa overlying the
      apices of the target tooth in the experimental group. In the control group patients received
      placebo laser to eliminate the probable psychological effects of laser. Laser irradiation was
      done with a single dose of 808 nm wavelength (Whitening Lase II- Laser DMC, Samsung, Korea)
      with 100 mw power, and dose of 70 J/cm2 for 80 seconds. Pain severity was recorded before the
      treatment, immediately after the treatment and 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the treatment
      by visual analogue scale (VAS). The pain scores were statistically analyzed by chi-square
      test between two groups. The effects of different variables on the post-operative pain
      experience were also studied by means of Logistic regression.
