    
      This is a Phase 1 dose escalation, open label, multicenter study, evaluating the safety,
      tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ZN-d5 in
      subjects with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). NHL
      subjects will continue to dose escalate until either the MTD or the RP2D is identified.

      Subjects with AML will start enrolling into the trial once a safe dose is identified in
      subjects with NHL.
