      This study will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to identify genetic variation in genes
      that control iron utilization in order to shed light on the genetic basis of population
      differences in iron status and disease susceptibility with a long-term goal of informing
      population-specific dietary iron intake recommendations to minimize the risk of chronic
      diseases. To evaluate iron utilization, we will employ an in vivo, functional approach using
      an oral stable iron isotope method. Each participant will have genetic ancestry and
      genotyping evaluated using the Illumina Global Diversity Array-8. Study participants (n=504,
      aged 18-50 y) will consume 57Fe (as ferrous sulfate) in the fasted state and will then ingest
      a standardized breakfast and lunch meal. Two weeks after iron dosing, a blood sample will be
      collected from each participant and the amount of 57Fe incorporated into red blood cells will
      be measured using magnetic sector thermal ionization mass spectrometry. This project will
      fundamentally advance our understanding of ethnic differences in nutrient metabolism and iron
      status. It will also provide information to assist with the long-term goal of reducing the
      public health burden of Fe-related diseases.
