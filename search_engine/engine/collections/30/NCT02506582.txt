      fermented soybean powder mixture supplementation on blood glucose. A randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 60 subjects with impaired fasting
      glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The
      subjects were randomly assigned to either a group ingesting 40 g jerusalem artichoke and
      fermented soybean powder mixture supplementation daily or a placebo group for 12-week. We
      assessed fasting and postprandial levels of glucose.
