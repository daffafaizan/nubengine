      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with locally advanced or metastatic collecting
           duct renal cell cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-22 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.5 years.
