    
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic disease associated with upregulation of
      hypoxia inducible-factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and functional iron deficiency. The
      investigators are proposing a prospective, single-arm, open-label intervention to determine
      whether oral iron supplementation in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension reduces
      markers of HIF activation and improve clinical parameters of disease. After the baseline
      visit, patients will be given ferrous sulfate tablets to take orally for 3 months. Outcome
      data will be collected at the baseline visit and at the end of the 3-month study period.
