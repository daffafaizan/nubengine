    
      This is a single-center, sham-controlled, dose-escalation study where cathodal tDCS is
      delivered to threatened but not yet irreversibly damaged (penumbral) tissue in patients with
      large vessel occlusion who are undergoing recanalization procedure. Patients will be
      randomized in a 3:1 design, to cathodal versus sham (control) stimulation, at each six
      designed dose tiers. The dose tiers will be increasing in both intensity and duration of the
      stimulation. All patients will be receiving the first dose (stimulation cycle) after the
      recanalization procedure and patients at dose tiers 5-6 will also be receiving stimulation
      cycles before the recanalization procedure begins.

      The occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage will determine the pace of the
      escalation through the dose tiers.
