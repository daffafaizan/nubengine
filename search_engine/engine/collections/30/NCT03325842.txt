      ASKp assessment scale, in a representative sample of individuals with PCI.

      ASK p will be administered on a sample of individuals belonging to the population of children
      and / or adolescents with diplegia and hemiplegia as a consequence of PCI. We will perform
      comprehensive descriptive analysis of the data collected as well as the measurement of the
      degree of reliability of the Italian version of the scale. The aim is to obtain an estimate
      of ASKp reliability obtained through transcultural validation.

      Additionally, we will submit the ASKp on a control group of typical development children in
      order to test its ability to discriminate between different skill levels.
