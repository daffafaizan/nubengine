      insulin treatment were feasible and led to less serious diabetic complications. 102 patients
      with type 1 diabetes mellitus were randomized (October 1982 to March 1984) to intensified
      conventional treatment (ICT; n=48) or standard treatment (ST; n=54). The randomized SDIS
      study lasted for 7.5 years, whereas 96 patients were fully evaluated. Thereafter patients
      were assigned to their regular clinical visits.

      In the present interventional study we wanted to study all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
      outcomes (i.e. myocardial infarction and stroke), and renal failure in the SDIS cohort until
      december 31 2011.
