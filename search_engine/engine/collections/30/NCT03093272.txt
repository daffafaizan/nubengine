      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      Apalutamide is considered an investigational product, which is believed to reduce the growth
      of prostate cancer cells. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      apalutamide as a treatment for any disease, but it is being studied in prostate cancer.
      Docetaxel is an approved therapy for this type of cancer. The FDA has not approved the
      combination of the two drugs in any use.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the combination of two drugs,
      docetaxel with apalutamide. The investigators will keep track of participants'
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), scans, and overall health to determine how well this drug
      combination works at treating this type of cancer.
