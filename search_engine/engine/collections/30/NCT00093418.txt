      I. To test whether any or all of four different regimens of R115777 (tipifarnib) is
      sufficiently effective therapy for previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in
      patients of age 70 or older to warrant Phase III investigation. Additionally, to allow
      increased access for patients to an agent that appears promising in this patient population.

      II. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of these regimens in this group of
      patients.

      III. To investigate in a preliminary manner the relationship of cytogenetics with response to
      R115777 (tipifarnib) and assess whether karyotype represents a potential prognostic factor
      among older AML patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy and are treated with
      R1157777.

      IV. To collect specimens for future correlations (e.g. RAS and downstream targets) to be
      identified at a later date.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. ARM II: Patients receive
      oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. ARM III: Patients receive tipifarnib as in
      arm I, but at a lower dose. ARM IV: Patients receive tipifarnib as in arm II, but at a lower
      dose.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients who achieve a complete remission (CR) receive up to 3 additional
      courses beyond CR. Patients in CR who develop recurrent disease after the completion of
      therapy are eligible to receive tipifarnib again.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      for 3 years.
