      culprit lesions in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) including ST-segment elevation
      (STE-) as well as Non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE-) acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients
      scheduled for this registry, must have one angiographic clear detectable ACS-causing culprit
      lesion with a reference diameter and a lesion length, which closely match the nominal
      Magmaris reference diameter and length.

      Primary endpoint will be the procedural angiographical success at the end of PCI, defined as
      successful Magmaris implantation at the "culprit lesion site" with less than 30% final
      stenosis (by visual estimation) and distal TIMI 3 flow. Secondary endpoints will include
      clinical and angiographic parameters as well as parameters gained through OCT-imaging.
