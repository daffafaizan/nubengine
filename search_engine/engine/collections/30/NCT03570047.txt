      AF (NVAF) patients. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is the first oral anticoagulant
      approved for the treatment for prevention of thromboembolism and it had long been the only
      oral anticoagulant until the first non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs).
      However, its safety and effectiveness remains unknown in real-world clinical practice in
      Japan. This study will evaluate the risk of stroke/SE as well as the risk of bleeding in the
      real world settings in Japan in patients with NVAF who initiated any of OACs (apixaban,
      dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin)
