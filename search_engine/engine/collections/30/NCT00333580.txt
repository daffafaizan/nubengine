      from Veterans. The purpose of this collaborative study is to take advantage of qualitative
      and quantitative expertise from the Gainesville, Florida, Rehabilitation Outcomes Research
      Center (RORC) with state-of-the-art gait intervention research being conducted at the
      Gainesville, Brain Rehabilitation Research Center (BRRC) and Cleveland, Functional Electrical
      Stimulation Center (FESC). Three interventions have received considerable attention for their
      demonstrated promise in improving gait and mobility in individuals with spinal cord injury
      and stroke; 1) manually assisted locomotor training (MLT), 2) robotic assisted locomotor
      training (RLT)and 3) functional electrical stimulation assisted gait training (FES-GT). These
      interventions will be the basis for improving existing outcome measures and developing new
      outcome measures. The process of developing and evaluating valid outcome measures requires
      four phases of development. This study encompasses Phases I and II. Phase I (Year 1 of
      grant)will involve completing qualitative research studies to identify constructs reflecting
      the impact of MLT, RLT and FES-GT on Veterans. Data will be systematically collected using
      ethnographic field observations and in depth, semi-structured interviews. Phase II (Year 2)
      will involve using the identified constructs to develop item banks for Veterans-centered
      outcome measures.
