    
      The activation of different signaling pathways (Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt) in response to growth
      factors/hormones (growth hormone, insulin) in fibroblasts and/or in adipocytes from patients
      with NS or LS will be compared to those of healthy subjects.

      These data will be correlated to clinical, hormonal, and biochemical characteristics of
      patients
