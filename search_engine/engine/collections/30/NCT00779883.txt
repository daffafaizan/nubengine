    
      Memgen's first TNF family derived product, ISF35, is a gene that encodes a recombinant
      protein molecule that binds and activates human CD40+ B lymphocytes that are found on a vast
      majority of malignant leukemias and lymphomas.

      In this clinical trial, ISF35 will be introduced into the patients' CLL cells ex vivo using a
      replication-defective adenovirus Ad5 encoding the ISF35 cDNA transgene. After this ex vivo
      manipulation, the modified leukemia cells will be extensively washed and the amount of
      remaining free virus is measured before the cells are reinfused into the patient. Following
      ex vivo transduction, the CLL cells expressing ISF35 activate a therapeutic immune response
      directed against the target leukemia cells.

      This ascending-dose trial will be divided into three dosing cohorts to determine the
      existence of a maximum tolerated dose.

      Patients will be followed for 12 months after ISF35 administration or until initiation of
      another treatment.
