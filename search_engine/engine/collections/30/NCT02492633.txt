      smoking ban at all 52 of its properties. A multi-component, "enhanced" intervention designed
      to promote, strengthen, and maintain a smoke-free policy across public housing developments
      will be implemented prior to commencement of the smoke-free policy. The enhanced intervention
      will be tested against a standard intervention of educational materials and information on
      cessation options. This study will be open to residents at 12 Beacon Communities properties
      at which a Resident Service Coordinator (RSC) is located.

      The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced
      intervention vs. standard intervention to support a comprehensive smoke-free policy, in a
      multi-site, privately managed affordable housing context. A further objective is to develop a
      toolkit of strategies for the large-scale implementation and maintenance of a smoke-free
      policy in multi-unit affordable housing developments. The toolkit will be the first to be
      developed directly from an extensive two-stage qualitative analysis and will apply the
      lessons learned in this study to provide a sustainable resource for property managers seeking
      to implement smoke-free policies.
