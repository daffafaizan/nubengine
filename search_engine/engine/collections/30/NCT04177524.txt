    
      This 3-group randomized controlled trial aims to (1) evaluate the frequency of smartphone use
      among young drivers and their parents/caregivers while driving; and (2) determine if the
      LifeSaver mobile app reduces the rate of smartphone use while driving. Eligible participants
      will be licensed teenage drivers between the ages of 16 and 18 years, and a parent/caregiver.
      The app will be downloaded and installed on both parent/caregivers' and teens' phones to
      monitor phone use while in a vehicle for 8 weeks.
