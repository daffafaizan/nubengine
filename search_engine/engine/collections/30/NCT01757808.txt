      going from the right side of the heart to the lungs is higher than normal. The increased
      blood pressure in the lungs places a strain on the heart. This strain causes the heart to
      pump less blood into the lungs, causing physical symptoms of shortness of breath and
      tiredness. The added strain to the heart can cause physical symptoms of swelling in the feet
      and abdomen. These symptoms can get worse over time due to the decreased pumping ability of
      the heart.

      Drug Administration (FDA) to treat chronic angina (chest pain). However, since it has not
      been approved for use in PAH its use in this study is considered experimental.
