      neuromuscular blockade in the pediatric patient following the intraoperative use of NMBA's.
      If there is significant residual blockade present, it may be that these effects will lead to
      postoperative respiratory complications including hypoxemia, atelectasis, and prolonged
      oxygen requirement resulting in a prolonged stay in the post-anesthesia care unit.
