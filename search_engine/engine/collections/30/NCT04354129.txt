      development and/or function of the immune system, resulting in increased frequency of
      infection. Treatment of these disorders using Cutaquig® (a subcutaneous immunoglobulin
      infusion (SCIG)) was licensed in Canada in 2018 and has proven to be effective in preventing
      significant infection. Other brands of SCIG can be given by the participant using a syringe
      (called rapid manual push method), which shows the same efficacy as administration by a
      programmable pump. The rapid manual push method has the potential to improve quality of life,
      reduce infusion time, and reduce the cost of administration. This study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and patient satisfaction of Cutaquig® by the rapid manual push method
      in participants with PID or SID. It will also compare the efficacy of Cutaquig with prior
      SCIG treatment, if applicable, in participants with PID or SID.
