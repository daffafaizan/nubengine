      ophthalmoscopy has been established as a non-invasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of
      retinal and macular diseases. Long-wavelength near-infrared autofluorescence (excitation: 787
      nm, LW-AF) is a new, innovative alternative to the classic autofluorescence imaging using 488
      nm blue excitation light. Excitation of the fluorophores at the ocular fundus using a longer
      wavelength has several advantages. However, with the current imaging technique the
      autofluorescence signal and thus image quality is considerably lower compared to conventional
      short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF). This may be the main reason for the currently
      limited application and scarce scientific publications on this technique.

      Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the performance of an optimized setup of
      long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging in clinical routine applications. For this purpose,
      additional laser sources will be integrated into a scanning laser ophthalmoscope and the
      performance with regards to image quality will be investigated systematically using different
      excitation wavelengths and filter combinations in healthy controls.

      In a next step, the signal intensity will be quantified using an integrated fluorescent
      reference. First, factors affecting measurements will be identified, followed by generation
      of a normative database. Subjects with various retinal diseases will then be investigated and
      compared to the normative database.

      Finally, the diagnostic performance of long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging to detect
      retinal degenerative diseases will be investigated and compared to conventional imaging
      techniques.
