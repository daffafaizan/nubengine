        2. Modified aspheric lens are more in line with human optical properties than the
           traditional aspheric lens.

        3. To obverse the effect of this type lens in the same as traditional aspheric intraocular
           lens at the same time, whether can further improve the effects of operation.

        4. After one day, one week, one month, three month follow-up，Key observation on the flare,
           the optical quality, contrast sensitivity and other parameters.Study the postoperative
           inflammatory reaction with test group lens，and the impact on the visual quality.
