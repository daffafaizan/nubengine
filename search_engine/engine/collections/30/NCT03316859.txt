    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of
      adding one 25mg dose of naloxegol to the cardiac surgery pre-op regimen. There will be 140
      subjects per study group. The patient and treating physician/nurse will be blinded as to
      which group the subject is assigned. On the day of surgery, subjects in both groups will
      complete a questionnaire to assess compliance with prescribed pre-operative regimen. Subjects
      in both groups will receive post-operative bowel regimen in the cardiovascular intensive care
      unit (CVICU) according to current standard of care, including procedures for rescue
      medications for constipation prevention and induction of a bowel movement.
