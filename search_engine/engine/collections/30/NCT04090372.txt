      performed each year in France. Better outcomes require a restoration of limb lengths and
      anatomy. Post-operative discrepancy is the main cause of complaints and financial
      compensation in the US after THA. As such, the investigators aim to use preoperative digital
      planning using TraumaCad to optimize the restoration of the center of rotation of the hips.
      Preoperative planning are usually performed using anteroposterior standard radiographs, which
      are scaled to an inaccurate scale. The TraumaCad system (BrainlabÂ®) allows the adjustment of
      the scales to each patient and the virtual positioning of the implants in order to simulate
      the intervention for the restitution of the geometrical parameters of the hip.
