    
      The care in obstructive lung disease study (CAROL) is a cluster-randomized controlled trial
      with randomization on the practice level. Thirty practices will be randomly assigned to
      equally sized intervention group or control group.

      Each General Practioner (GP) of a practice will approach consecutively and regardless the
      reason for the current encounter, COPD patients diagnosed by spirometric evaluation (FEV1/
      FVC < 0.70), aged 45 years older, with a smoking history of = 10 pack-years (PY). GPs in the
      intervention group will receive "QualiCCare" education, which addresses knowledge,
      decision-making and behavioural aspects as well as delivery of care according to COPD quality
      indicators and evidence based key elements. In the control group no educational intervention
      will be applied and COPD patients will be treated as usual. The study period is one year.

      The primary outcome measure is an aggregated score of relevant clinical processes defining
      elements in the care of patients with COPD: smoking cessation counseling, influenza
      vaccination, motivation for physical activity, appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient education
      and collaborative care.
