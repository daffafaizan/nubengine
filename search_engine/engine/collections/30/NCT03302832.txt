      pain and reduced physical abilities related to knee pain, most commonly osteoarthritis.
      Common physical impairments associated with post-operative TKA rehabilitation include:
      reduced knee range of motion (ROM), reduced strength, reduced participation in activities of
      daily living, and pain. TKA surgery is routinely paired with physical therapy (PT)
      interventions post-operatively in order to facilitate recovery for patients electing to
      undergo this intervention. The Total Range Exerciser (T-REX) is a medical device aimed at
      reducing the need for post-operative physical therapy services while promoting outcomes.

      A successful outcome after total knee arthroplasty requires symptom relief and restoration of
      physical function. Measurement of pain and function can be achieved through patient-reported
      outcomes measures and objective functional testing. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis
      Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient-reported outcomes measure intended to capture the
      individual patient's perception of progress throughout the rehabilitative process. Objective
      measurements of physical function are necessary to quantify the magnitude of physical
      impairment associated with the patient's perceived status. Physical function can be measured
      through standardized assessment of knee ROM, strength, and ambulation. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of standard physical therapy compared to reduced
      frequency physical therapy supplemented with the (T-REX) after in total knee arthroplasty in
      subjective and objective measurements of physical function.
