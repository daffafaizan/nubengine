      pathological complete response rates of 10-20% in spite of the addition of new cytotoxic
      agents and/ or molecular targeted therapies. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and radiation
      produces effective sensitization but further improvements require assessment of other
      sensitizers to increase the pathological complete response rates. Gemcitabine has been used
      in combination with radiation for several GI cancers but few studies have examined its role
      in rectal cancer. This study will examine a combination of Gemcitabine and radiation as
      neo-adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal cancer to increase the pathological complete response
      (pCR) rate from the investigators traditional 6% to > 40 %.
