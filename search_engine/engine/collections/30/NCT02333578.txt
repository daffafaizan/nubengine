      will be provided as ECPSDU each comprising 90 - 110mL of plasma from two individual
      ABO-compatible donors. Two ECPSDU will be administered as immediately sequential infusions.
      Subjects may receive up to three doses of ECP not less than 48 hours apart. ECP will be
      provided as Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24) as described in Section
      6.1. Pre-treatment and frequent post-treatment blood specimens for assay of anti-EBOV
      antibody and EBOV viral load by RT-PCR will be obtained from subjects. The pharmacodynamic
      effect of ECP anti-EBOV, including neutralization titers, on viral load will be examined in
      the ECP Group. Changes of individual and treatment group clinical and laboratory parameters
      with time will be described. Between-group and within-group will examine interactions of
      clinical parameters, outcome, ECP total dose, EBOV viral load, and anti-EBOV (IgG ELISAs for
      Zaire GP residues 1-649 and irradiated Zaire virus, and anti-EBOV PRNT). The MEWS will be
      assessed as a prognostic tool in the Screened Control Group. Efficacy of ECP will be assessed
      primarily by comparison of survival to hospital discharge between the ECP Group and the
      Screened Control Group.
