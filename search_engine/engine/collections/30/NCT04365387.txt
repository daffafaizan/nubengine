    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group study in
      adult and adolescent subjects (â‰¥ 12 to 54 years) with moderate-to-severe AD. Eligible
      subjects must have a documented history of inadequate response to topical AD medication(s).
      Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 30 mg nemolizumab (with a
      60 mg loading dose) or placebo, stratified by baseline disease severity (IGA = 3, moderate;
      IGA = 4, severe). The study consists of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 16-week treatment
      period, and an 8-week follow-up period (12 weeks after the last study drug injection).
