    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single
      center Phase 1 study to investigate the relative bioavailability, PK, safety, and
      tolerability of different sc dosing regimens of mipomersen in healthy volunteers. The
      bioavailability of 2 test regimens (Cohorts A and B) will be assessed relative to that of the
      reference treatment regimen (Cohort C). Approximately 84 subjects will be randomized equally
      to 1 of the 3 treatment regimens and then further randomized in a 3:1 ratio to mipomersen vs.
      placebo:

      Cohort A/Test Treatment Regimen 1: up to 28 subjects will receive a 30 mg sc dose of study
      drug or matching volume of placebo daily for 3 weeks (21 doses; 630 mg total) Cohort B/Test
      Treatment Regimen 2: up to 28 subjects will receive a 70 mg sc dose of study drug or matching
      volume of placebo 3 times a week for 3 weeks (9 doses; 630 mg total) Cohort C/Reference
      Treatment Regimen: up to 28 subjects will receive a 200 mg sc dose of study drug or matching
      volume of placebo once a week for 3 weeks (3 doses; 600 mg total) Each subject will
      participate in a â‰¤ 6-week screening period, a 3-week treatment period, and a 12-week safety
      follow-up period.
