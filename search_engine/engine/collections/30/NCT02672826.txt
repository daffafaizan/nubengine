      surgery in which the estrogenic status as well as adipose tissue mass profile will be
      evaluated. The phenotype (inflammatory and angiogenic activation and senescent state) of
      native endothelial cells will be determined "in situ" by immunohistochemical and flow
      cytometry approaches and on isolated endothelial cells by Reverse transcriptase-Q Polymerase
      Chain Reaction and Western blot. In vitro approaches will be performed 1) to establish a
      causal relationship between endothelial senescence and activation state, 2) to define the
      impact of the adipose tissue microenvironment on the endothelial cell activation and
      senescence and 3) to study the potential protective effect of estrogens on endothelial
      senescence.
