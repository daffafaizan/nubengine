      4-crossover periods separated by a 2 weeks washout, and 4-Treatments. Part I consisted of
      Treatments A (VAL 160 mg alone), B (HCT 12.5 mg alone), C (VAL 160 mg + HCT 12.5 mg) and D
      (VAL / HCT 160 mg/12.5mg) and Part II consisted of Treatments E (VAL 320 mg alone), F (HCT 25
      mg alone), G (VAL 320 mg + HCT 25 mg) and H (VAL / HCT 320 mg/25 mg). Blood samples were
      collected up to 48 hours postdose and plasma was analyzed for VAL and HCT concentrations
      using HPLC. The pharmacokinetic properties of each drug after co-administration of VAL and
      HCT were compared with those of each drug administered alone.
