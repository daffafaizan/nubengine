      indwelling ureteral stents commonly cause significant pain and discomfort due to irritation
      to the urinary system. Many studies have looked at methods to reduce these uncomfortable
      symptoms ranging from altering stent designs to pharmacologic therapies attempting to
      alleviate stent-discomfort. However, stent-related discomfort continues to be an issue and is
      often the cause of their removal earlier than planned. While the efficacy of certain alpha
      blockers and anticholinergics in treating stent-related symptoms have been studied, the data
      for the use of hyoscyamine in this setting is lacking. A literature search yielded no studies
      evaluating the use of hyoscyamine in this setting to date. The investigators hypothesize that
      hyoscyamine (brand name Levsin) is equivalent to tamsulosin in treating lower urinary tract
      symptoms in patients with indwelling double-J ureteral stents due to its anticholinergic
      properties. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients in the hyoscyamine arm
      will not require additional pain medications (e.g. Pyridium, narcotics) to help control
      stent-related discomfort compared to the tamsulosin arm.
