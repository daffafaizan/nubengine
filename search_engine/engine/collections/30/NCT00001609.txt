      animal models have the promise to elucidate the relationships between lens crystallin and
      hereditary cataract, little is known about the causes of congenital cataracts in humans. Even
      the classification of different types of cataracts is cumbersome and imperfect. A better
      understanding of cataractogenesis will come through an understanding of the molecular
      components of the lens of the eye and the ways in which lesions of these components are
      manifested structurally and functionally as opacity of the lens. It is well known that
      cataracts exhibit marked genetic heterogeneity. In mice and humans, hereditary cataracts have
      been shown to result from lesions at many distinct loci and those cataracts corresponding to
      one locus can be morphologically heterogeneous, implying that environmental factors may
      modify the phenotype of the cataract which a molecular lesion causes. Nonetheless, molecular
      biological characterization of cataracts in the mouse and guinea pig has suggested that
      alterations in lens crystallins can cause hereditary cataracts making them reasonable
      candidate genes for causing hereditary cataracts in humans. In addition, it is apparent that
      hereditary lesions which mimic or contribute additively to environmental stresses known to
      cause cataracts might be candidate genes for causing hereditary cataracts. This knowledge
      increases the feasibility of genetic linkage studies and provides a rationale basis on which
      to begin the molecular analysis of naturally occurring hereditary cataracts. Therefore, it is
      the purpose of this protocol to concentrate upon hereditary cataracts.
