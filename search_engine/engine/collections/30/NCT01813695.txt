    
      Purpose: To determine the feasibility of preemptive (preoperative) cytochrome P450 isoenzyme
      (CYP2D6) testing and the variability of clinical measures (postoperative) in children whose
      opioid selection and dosing is influenced by preemptive CYP2D6 testing compared to children
      whose pain management does not include CYP2D6 preemptive testing. Results from this pilot
      study will inform a future study investigating the utility of preemptive pharmacogenomic
      testing in children at risk for requiring inpatient acute pain management with opioids.
