      Determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of sorafenib in the treatment of patients
      with advanced thyroid cancer (metastatic or recurrent) in a 24 months follow up period.

      Analysis plan The analysis plan includes the description of clinical and epidemiological
      characteristics of recruited patients at the end of the first year and the before and after
      comparison from clinical response according to RECIST criteria. At the end of the first and
      second follow-up years, analyses will be performed. In each of these, the response of
      patients by outcomes of interest measured at specific monitoring times will be evaluated.

      Parametric and non-parametric descriptive statistics will be used as necessary; the
      comparison of some variables between baseline measurements and follow-up predetermined
      cut-offs will be performed while taking into account the lack of independence between
      observations. Analysis of qualitative variables will be performed using McNemar's Test and
      the analysis of quantitative variables using the Paired Student's t-Test or Wilcoxon Test
      depending on the normality of the distribution

      Descriptive statistics will be used for time until events, survival curve and
      progression-free time median will be stated. Correlation studies between some indicators,
      clinical variables, and observed outcomes using parametric and non-parametric coefficients
      will be performed. Interobserver agreement will be evaluated for the reading of diagnostic
      images using a Kappa coefficient.
