      LA-ICSI by zona pellucida thinning (LAT-ICSI) with conventional ICSI in order to effectively
      assess whether this approach can be applied routinely to improve ICSI outcome.

      One arm study divided into three interventions; Conventional ICSI (control group) was
      compared with LAD-ICSI (Study group 1) and LAT- ICSI (study group 2) in sibling oocytes.

      The rates of maturation, fertilization, Devision, Blastulation and good quality blastulation
      rates were assessed in the three groups

      Cases were randomly selected for embryo transfer from the three groups,Then chemical
      pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates were compared between the three groups.
