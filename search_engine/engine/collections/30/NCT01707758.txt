      cancer biomarkers in blood. The aim is testing and optimization of nanoparticle sensors,
      based on cyanine dyes that are chemically linked to Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles via
      protease-selective consensus (cleavage) sequences. The focus is on the quantitative
      determination of active cancer-specific proteases in blood via simple fluorescence
      measurements. The matrix metalloproteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and
      cathepsins, are up-regulated in the vast majority of progressing cancers and can, therefore,
      serve as markers for cell survival/tumor progression, angiogenesis, and tissue
      remodeling/invasion
