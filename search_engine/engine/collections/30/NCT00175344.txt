      cancer surgery (breast conserving surgery or mastectomy) and who meet the eligibility
      criteria specified will be offered study participation. After obtaining informed consent,
      subjects will be randomized between two cohorts: scar massage (intervention group) versus no
      scar massage (control group). The primary outcome is scar-related pain (scored using the
      McGill Pain Questionnaire Short Form). The secondary outcomes are: upper body range of
      motion, physical parameters of the scar (pliability, scar height, vascularity and
      pigmentation scored using the Vancouver Scar Scale), lymphedema (evaluated by arm
      circumference measurements) and quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy (FACT)-B breast cancer-specific instrument).

      A sample size of 143 patients per arm was estimated to detect a 30% difference in the primary
      outcome of postoperative scar-related pain between the intervention and the control groups
      with 80% statistical power.
