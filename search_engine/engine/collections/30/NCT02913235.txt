      regular oral hygiene procedures for a period of 10 days. Clinical registrations and
      collection of microbiological samples (supragingival and saliva) will be performed at
      baseline and 4, 7 and 10 days after discontinuation of regular oral hygiene, and will be
      repeated 14 days after regular oral hygiene has been resumed.
