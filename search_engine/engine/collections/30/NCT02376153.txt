      risk of prosthesis-related surgical site infection in a multi-center clinical trial. The ABS
      shields surgical incisions intra-operatively by creating a field of high-purity air
      surrounding an incision that prevents airborne microorganisms from entering the incision.

      This research will evaluate ABS performance in a prospective, randomized, blinded
      multi-center trial. The surgical procedures studied will include total hip arthroplasty,
      trauma-related acetabula reconstruction, posterior instrumented spine fusion, and prosthetic
      vascular graft procedures. Patients will be enrolled during the first two years of the study,
      and CDC guidelines require a one year follow-up period to monitor patients for potential
      prosthesis-related infections.
