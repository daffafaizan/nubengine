      knee osteoarthritis of the medial condyle. The study's hypothesis is that personalized shape
      and fit of patient-specific knee replacement prosthesis will provide a greater stability and
      a more natural knee motion in addition to a faster recovery when compared to traditional knee
      replacement systems. This study is designed to provide a five-years follow-up clinical data
      on safety and effectiveness of the device.
