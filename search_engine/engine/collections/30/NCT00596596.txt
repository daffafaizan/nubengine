      II, dose comparison trial, in which 313 subjects, with a history of chronic idiopathic
      constipation were enrolled. The trial was conducted in three phases:

        1. a 4-week drug-free run-in phase,

        2. a 4-week double-blind (DB) phase during which subjects were treated with R093877 (0.5
           mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, or 4 mg capsule) or matching placebo once daily, prior to breakfast,

        3. a 4-week drug-free run-out phase (RO).

      To qualify for the run-in phase (Visit 1, Week 1) subjects had to have experienced, for at
      least 3 months, 2 or less spontaneous, bowel movements (SBM)/week with the occurrence of
      lumpy (scyballae) and/or hard stools, a sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least a
      quarter of their stools, or straining during defecation at least a quarter of the time.
