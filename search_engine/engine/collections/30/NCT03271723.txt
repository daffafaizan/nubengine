      1982. Data is being collected with a focus on maintaining fidelity to the tools and
      instruments used in the previous cohorts with minimal adaptations when necessary. All
      children born in Pelotas during 2015 were included in the cohort, and the cohort has been
      followed four times, at birth, 3, 12 and 24 months (ongoing). In addition, an antenatal study
      identified and interviewed 73.8% of the mothers that subsequently delivered children that are
      now part of the cohort. The 4275 children included in the cohort are part of extensive
      assessments that include information on antenatal health and care, pregnancy health,
      gestational age, physical activity, sleep, health behaviours, socio-demographic
      characteristics, perinatal conditions, child anthropometry, delivery information, child
      mortality and morbidity, nutrition, growth, breastfeeding, neuro-cognitive development,
      access to health services, medicine use by both mother and child and genetic material. The
      cohort also nests 2 randomized clinical trials and a series of sub-studies. The data is
      starting to be analyzed and, among other findings, confirm the already alarming trends in
      surgical deliveries, amounting to 65.2% of all deliveries in 2015.
