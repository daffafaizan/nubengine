      I. To determine if bortezomib when given as maintenance therapy for six months post-remission
      can improve the progression-free survival (PFS) rate by 50% (or 4.5 months) in first
      remission patients with high-risk AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival (OS) after maintenance therapy with bortezomib in first
      remission AML patients.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) administration of bortezomib
      given as maintenance therapy to first remission AML patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bortezomib SC on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Treatment repeats every 35 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, and then annually for 3 years.
