      constructive interference pattern that increases the therapeutic effects in the irradiated
      tissue. Patients diagnosed of shoulder pain from different musculoskeletal disorders will
      received conventional or interferential laser therapy. This is a comparative, randomized and
      double - blind clinical study. Two identical equipments of near infrared laser therapy will
      be used. Number of sessions: 15. Frequency of the sessions: daily. Irradiation technique:
      manual, contact and punctual.Pain will be evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and
      during analytical shoulder movements (abduction, adduction, internal rotation, external
      rotation, flexion, extension) and by means of a pain and disability index (SPADI).
      Evaluations will take place at pre and post treatment.
