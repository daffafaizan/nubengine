    
      This active surveillance study is intended to evaluate the survivorship and long-term safety
      and effectiveness of the Stelkast Surpass Acetabular System. Neither the patient nor the
      surgeon are blinded to treatment. The study will compare the Surpass' survivorship to the
      survivorship observed in a historical control group established by a meta-analysis. The
      evaluation will be conducted for a period of ten years. These evaluations will be recorded
      through onsite visits and/or mailings sent to physicians requesting deidentified
      patient-level data for subjects implanted with the Surpass system.
