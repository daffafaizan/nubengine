      evidence-based tobacco use treatment within existing health systems locally and globally. The
      objective of this proposal is to fill the current research-to-practice gap by conducting a
      randomized controlled trial that compares the effectiveness and cost of two practical and
      highly replicable strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of
      tobacco use in public health clinics and community based settings in Vietnam. The proposed
      implementation strategies draw on evidence-based approaches and the WHO's recently released
      guidelines for implementing Article 14 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).
      The FCTC is an evidence-based treaty that was developed by the WHO in response to the
      globalization of the tobacco epidemic Article 14specifies the need to integrate clinical best
      practices for treating tobacco use and dependence into routine preventive care. The proposed
      implementation strategies also build on the growing literature that supports the
      effectiveness of integrating community health workers as members of the health care team to
      improve access to preventive services.
