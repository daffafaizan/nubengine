    
      Critically ill patients with PCR-confirmed influenza criteria) are eligible for inclusion in
      this study and will be randomized to or the posaconazole prophylaxis group or the SOC group.

      If a patient is randomized to the posaconazole prophylaxis group, posaconazole (Noxafil, MSD)
      will be started intravenously from day 1 of randomization (2*300mg( milligram) /d on day 1,
      followed by 1*300mg/d from day 2 for 7 days) In both patient groups (prophylaxis and SOC)
      oseltamivir (non-IMP) will be started at the discretion of the treating physician from the
      first day of ICU admission as 2*150 mg/day for 10 days. If oseltamivir had already been
      started up before ICU admission, oseltamivir treatment will be continued up to a total of 10
      days.

      Within 48 hours after influenza diagnosis a bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage)
      and a serum galactomannan will be performed as part of routine ICU care in this type of
      patients. If an IAA-infection is suspected based on the result of this BAL ((A) Aspergillus
      cultured from BAL, or (B) a galactomannan (GM)the patient will be withdrawn from the study
      and antifungal treatment will be started.

      addendum: Extensive PK sampling (UZ Leuven and Radboud): full PK curve on day 2 and day 5
      (predose, 1.5; 2,3,4,6,8,10,12,18,24 h post infusion).

      on non PK days, until day 7, predose sample. PK in BAL fluid only in patients with mechanical
      ventilation and when medically indicated.

      Limited PK sampling: on day 2 and day 5: 1.5-3h, 4-8 h;8-12h; 12-24h post dose. on non PK
      days: PK pre dose.
