      for 24 hours at each session, overnight respiratory pattern and oxygen saturation will be
      monitored in both groups. The exposure monitoring will include both particle mass of PM2.5
      along with detailed assessment to determine that portion of the particulate exposure from
      outdoor vs. indoor sources.
