      objective of evaluating the efficacy of three doses of ORV 116E, 10^5.0 FFU, against severe
      rotavirus gastroenteritis, in comparison with a placebo in India. The clinical trial is not a
      global trial. Three administrations of ORV 116E will be co-administered with childhood
      vaccines (which will include vaccines against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Haemophilus
      influenzae B and Hepatitis B and OPV) at 6 to 7 weeks, greater than or equal to 10 weeks and
      greater than or equal to 14 weeks of age. 6800 subjects will be enrolled in three sites -
      Delhi, Pune (Maharashtra) and Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and followed up till the age of 2 years
      (24 months + up to 14 days). Multiple trial sites are included to ensure greater demographic
      distribution to obtain evidence of cross immunity and quicker recruitment of the necessary
      number of subjects. The subjects to be included from these sites would be representative of
      the population of India.

      The protocol has been reviewed by the institutional review boards of the Society for Applied
      Studies (New Delhi), KEM Hospital Research Centre (Pune), Christian Medical College
      (Vellore). Ethics clearance has also been obtained from the Department of Biotechnology,
      Government of India and Western Institutional Review Board.
