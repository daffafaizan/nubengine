      of atherosclerotic plaque is associated with acute coronary syndromes including myocardial
      infarction, but culprit lesions are difficult to identify beforehand. Animal models of
      atherosclerosis have proven limited. In vivo plaque characterization might be useful both in
      plaque prognostication and in understanding human vascular biology. One imaging modality,
      high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been shown feasible for plaque
      visualization and characterization, but still has important limitations. In this pilot study
      we hope to apply a new MRI modality using coils (antennae) that are inside the artery being
      studied, to achieve superior imaging.

      This pilot study will examine whether intravascular arterial wall MRI can visualize the
      arterial wall with a higher spatial resolution than currently available techniques of
      intravascular ultrasound or conventional magnetic resonance imaging using surface receiver
      coils. In particular, we hope to image in high resolution, for the first time, the outer
      arterial wall (adventitia), which is not readily visualized. MRI using intravascular coils
      may also enable the study of blood flow and contrast accumulation within arterial walls,
      potentially key markers of plaque angiogenesis and vulnerability.
