      effects of a restrictive minimum carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet) in patients with Lafora
      Disease. Untreated Lafora Disease is rapidly progressive to death over about 10 years. In an
      open label, proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of the ketogenic diet will be
      assessed through the use of validated clinical scales, as well as surrogate
      neurophysiological and biochemical measures. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent
      clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
