      noninvasive mechanical ventilation on pulmonary functions after craniotomy in 60 patients.
      Patients were randomized into a control group (G-K, n:20), an IS group (G-IS, n:20) and a
      CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) group (G-CPAP, n:20).

      The investigators included male or female, between 18 and 60 years old, American Society of
      Anesthesiologists score 1, 2 patients in this study. The investigator excluded patients with
      significant cardiopulmonary disease like myocardial infarction, obstructive or restrictive
      pulmonary disease, liver or kidney failure, chest wall deformities, postoperative lack of
      cooperation from this study. In postoperatively, control group will take 4lt/min oxygen with
      Plasti-med oxygen therapy mask for 6 hours, IS group will carry out Plasti-med TRIFLO 5 min
      per hour for 6 hours, CPAP group will carry out 10 cmH2O noninvasive continuous positive
      airway pressure with BIPAP VISION 5 min per hour for 6 hours. Lung functions and arterial
      blood gas analysis will be recorded preoperative baseline, postoperative 1st, 6th and 24th
      hours.
