        1. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for aquiring aPL in a cohort of aPL-negative
           pediatric SLE subjects.

        2. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for developing a first APS-associated
           complication among SLE subjects with detectable aPL.

        3. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for developing a second APS-associated event
           among subjects with a history of an APS-associated event.

        4. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for developing SLE among subjects with a
           history of an APS-associated event in the absence of SLE.

        5. Identify laboratory and clinical predictors for the events described in aims
           1-4.Research Design and Methods:

      This is a prospective cohort study to determine the risk of developing aPL or APS-related
      symptoms in a young group of SLE and APS subjects. Patients will be followed over a ten year
      period and will undergo annual serologic and clinical evaluations to identify disease
      progression.
