      fluid marker of sentinel subarachnoid hemorrhage: a preliminary report in pigs, we're going
      to test the hypothesis in the cerebrospinal fluid of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage
      patients. We'll collect the serial cerebrospinal fluid in 15-20 spontaneous subarachnoid
      hemorrhage patients to see the time sequence of changes in bilirubin levels.
