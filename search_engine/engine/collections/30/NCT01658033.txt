      adjuvant and in first-line metastatic settings.For the patients who do not respond or relapse
      early after the administration of a taxane or anthracycline regimen,it is clearly needed to
      explore new combinations and schedules of drugs.Oxaliplatin has shown very promising activity
      in MBC either in monotherapy or in combination with 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) with or without
      leucovorin (LV). Avastin is a target therapy with proven efficacy in the treatment of MBC.
      Avastin plus FOLFOX regimen showed synergetic effet and been used as the standard trial in
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Based on the above reason, we initiate this phase II
      study to evaluate efficacy and safety of avastin plus modified FOLFOX6 regimen in HER-2
      negative metastatic breast cancer patients.
