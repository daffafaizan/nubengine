    
      Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who are scheduled to receive a standard treatment
      course of adalimumab (loading dose of 80 mg and thereafter 40 mg s.c. biweekly) are exposed
      to UVB-311nm phototherapy on a randomized body half (left or right; head exempt) 3 x per week
      for six weeks and/or until complete response (defined as reduction in PASI to < 3). PASI
      score, patient visual analogue score (VAS) for therapeutic response, and patient VAS for
      severity of skin lesions is assessed weekly; and at follow-up visits at month 3, 6, and 12.
      Paired Wilcoxon testing for differences in PASI and patient VAS scores is done; Fischer exact
      test is applied to determine differences in complete remission, PASI reduction > 90%, > 75%
      and/or 50% between body sites.
