      colorectal cancer (CRC) patients for interdisciplinary studies of CRC prognosis and outcomes
      with sites at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle (Washington, USA), H. Lee
      Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa (Florida, USA), the University Hospital
      Heidelberg (Germany), the Huntsman Cancer Institute (Utah, USA), the Cedars-Senai Medical
      Center (California, USA), University of Washington St. Louis (Missouri, USA), and University
      of Tennessee (Tennessee, USA). Additional information is provided in the study design paper,
      that has been published in 2019 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30523039/).

      Aims: The ColoCare Study investigates clinical outcomes, including disease-free and overall
      survival, predictors of cancer recurrence, survival, health-related quality-of-life and
      treatment toxicities. In addition, cross-sectional analyses of biomarkers and/or health
      behaviors are undertaken.

      Patients are recruited at baseline (time of first diagnosis) and followed for up to 5 years
      at regular timepoints (3m, 6m, 12m, 24m, 36m, 48m, 60m). The cohort includes a comprehensive
      collection of specimens and data.
