    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in obese
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

      Rivaroxaban as an oral anticoagulant could be an attractive option for thromboprophylaxis
      compared to subcutaneous standard treatment after bariatric surgery. Especially in high-risk
      patients where an extended duration of thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge is
      recommended, an oral therapy would be desirable.

      The objectives are to assess the safety and feasibility of VTE prophylaxis and lung embolism
      with Rivaroxaban 10mg as an oral anticoagulant. Especially in high-risk patients where an
      extended duration of thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge is recommended, an oral
      therapy would be desirable.

      After bariatric surgery patients receive the study medication Xarelto 10mg QD for 7, resp. 28
      days.

      In a subgroup of study patients (patients from the University Hospital Inselspital, Bern)
      PK/PD parameters are assessed following the last intake of rivaroxaban at day 28.
