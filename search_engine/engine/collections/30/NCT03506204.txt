      recovery of pelvic floor muscle.Evaluation of pelvic floor function is performed at 6 weeks,
      3 months, 12 months after delivery. The modified Oxford Grading Scale and Levator ani testing
      are used to quantify PFM strength through vaginal palpation. Pelvic floor muscles strength,
      endurance, repetition,vaginal contraction pressure and the knack test are evaluated using a
      neuromuscular stimulation therapy system of PHENIX (Company: Vivaltis -Electronic Concept
