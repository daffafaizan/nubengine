      significantly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but its mechanism underlying
      this association remains obscure. We introduce the human samples of liver to clarify the
      relationship between the expression of plin5 and the development of sequence polymorphism in
      patatin-like phospholipid domain containing protein 3 variant-associated nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease, analyze the lipid metabolism and lipotoxicity of hepatocytes to elucidate the
      mechanisms of plin5 in the development of sequence polymorphism in patatin-like phospholipid
      domain containing protein 3 variant-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Our study
      will contribute to the mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and its prevention and
      therapy.
