      gastric contents into the indicator through a nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG), causing a
      color change on the indicator. The color change represents various pH levels. Most Newborn
      Intensive Care Units require that NG/OG placement be confirmed after initial insertion and
      prior to any use. The purpose of this study is to validate the accuracy of pH measurement of
      gastric fluid by comparing the reading from the RightSpot Infant pH Indicator to a standard
      clinically approved pH monitor, and to determine what percentage of time the RightSpot Infant
      pH Indicator could have been used to determine the proper placement of the NG/OG tube prior
      to use. The gastric pH measurements will be analyzed to determine the normative pH values for
      neonates.
