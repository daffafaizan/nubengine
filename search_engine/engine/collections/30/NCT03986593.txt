      metastasize to bone. About 3% of patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas develop
      secondary bone lesions, while adrenal and neuroendocrine tumors have 10% and 13% bone
      metastases rates, respectively. Spinal metastases are associated to a worst prognosis. The
      progressive systemic disease, the post-operative complications, and the pre-operative
      neurologic impairment were associated to a worst global survival rate in the thyroid cancer.
      Additionally, extensive spinal instrumentation of metastatic thyroid carcinoma was associated
      to greater complication rates. Interventional radiology offers promising techniques for the
      minimally invasive approach of bone metastases. Image-guided percutaneous radiofrequency
      ablation and cryoablation techniques have been studied in clinical trials and are considered
      effective options in pain palliation of patients with bone metastatic disease. These
      techniques may be associated with conventional treatment, as well as radiation therapy and
      percutaneous embolization, avoiding major surgical interventions and its complications.
