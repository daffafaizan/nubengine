      I. To evaluate response rate of the combination of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab in EGFR
      mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate safety, tolerability, and survival for patients receiving pembrolizumab and
      ramucirumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To characterize predictive immunologic biomarkers of response in tissue and peripheral
      blood of patients receiving ramucirumab and pembrolizumab combination therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ramucirumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and pembrolizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
