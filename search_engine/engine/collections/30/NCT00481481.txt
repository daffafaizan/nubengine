    
      Multicenter, single-arm, open phase IIIb, conversion study where a Cyclosporine A-based
      immunosuppressive regimen is replaced by the administration of tacrolimus modified release
      formulation, MR4, once daily (morning dosing only) in stable renal transplant subjects. The
      initial recommended dose of MR4 is 0.1 mg/kg/day.

      Twenty-four weeks of treatment on MR4-based immunosuppressive regimen is considered to be an
      appropriate study duration in order to assess the response in subjects suffering from one or
      more known cyclosporine side effects, hypertrichosis/hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia,
      hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension.

      Stable, adult kidney transplant recipients (â‰¥ 12 months post transplant) who are currently
      treated with cyclosporine and who meet the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria will be enrolled.
