      Primary objective:

        -  To identify the type (Influenza A or B) and the subtype of Influenza A of the isolates
           from children with febrile respiratory complaints who attend the pediatric clinic of the
           First Affiliated Hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong,
           China.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To investigate the genetic composition of all segments of isolated strains using
           standard molecular techniques.

        -  To make available the new strains of influenza viruses isolated from such children for
           the formulation of influenza vaccines.
