    
      This will be a pilot study performed as a randomized controlled prospective study of patients
      admitted to the general medical floors at MetroHealth Medical Center (MHMC). This study will
      be an add-on investigation to an original funded study: "Evaluation of Screening Tools for
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in Hospitalized Medical Patients: A Validation Study" (the
      STOMP study).

      In the STOMP study, patients admitted Sunday through Thursday (day or night) to MHMC who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and are willing to participate in the study will complete the
      STOMP study by undergoing an in-hospital PSG (within 48 hours of admission to the medical
      floor). Those who's PSG shows clinically significant OSA (an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5)
      will be approached for participation in this study. It is anticipated that at least 50
      patients from the STOMP study will be eligible for randomization into this study.
      Participants will be randomized into an auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (ACPAP) (ResMed S9) arm or a standard therapy arm (control - no specific therapy for OSA
      other than possibly supplemental nocturnal oxygen if deemed necessary by the clinicians
      caring for the patient). Those randomized to ACPAP will continue this therapy until they
      undergo a repeat diagnostic sleep study (PSG) and then, if indicated, a titration PSG as an
      outpatient. Those in the standard therapy arm will receive no specific treatment for their
      OSA until they undergo a a repeat diagnostic study and then, if indicated, a full night
      titration PSG as an outpatient. Once the titration PSG has taken place, subjects will be
      changed to fixed CPAP and followed for an additional 6-8 weeks to assess compliance with
      therapy.
