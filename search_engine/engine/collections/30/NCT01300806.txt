        1. To assess the feasibility of conducting SBIRT using (1) a patient self-administered
           intervention embedded in a web-based Personal Health Record (PHR) compared to (2) a
           provider-administered SBIRT intervention guided by the Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
           during clinic appointments.

        2. To examine the acceptability of web-based PHRs to conduct and communicate SBIRT compared
           to EMR-activated SBIRT conducted by clinic staff, from the perspective of the patient
           and the provider.

        3. To assess the impact of SBIRT on risky drug and alcohol use in an HIV/AIDS population
           and subsequent effects on sexual risk behaviors and antiretroviral therapy (ART)
           adherence.
