      There are four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4); each can cause
      dengue infection. Infection with dengue viruses can range from mild illness to
      life-threatening disease. TetraVax-DV TV005 (also referred to as TV005) is a live attenuated
      recombinant tetravalent dengue virus vaccine developed to protect against all four dengue
      virus serotypes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      TV005 in adults 50 to 70 years of age with no history of previous flavivirus infection.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a subcutaneous injection of either TV005 or
      placebo at study entry (Day 0). After receiving the injection, participants will record their
      temperature 3 times a day through Day 16. Additional study visits will occur on Days 4, 6, 8,
      10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 180. Visits will include a physical examination and blood
      collection.
