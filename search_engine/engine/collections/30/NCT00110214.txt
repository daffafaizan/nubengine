      I. To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel and prednisone increases overall
      survival compared to docetaxel and prednisone alone in patients with HRPC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival of these two regimens in patients with HRPC.

      II. To compare the two regimens on the proportion of patients who experience a 50%
      post-therapy PSA decline from baseline.

      III. To compare the two regimens with respect to the proportion of patients who experience
      grade 3 or higher toxicities.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to predicted 24-month survival probability (< 10% vs 10-29.9% vs ≥
      30%), age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), and prior history of arterial events (i.e., cardiac
      ischemia/infarction, CNS cerebrovascular ischemia, peripheral arterial ischemia, or CNS
      hemorrhage) (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Patients also receive oral prednisone once daily on days 1-21.

      ARM II: Patients receive docetaxel and prednisone as in arm I. Patients also receive
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
