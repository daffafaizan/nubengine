      large-sized blood vessels in the body. It usually only occurs in older adults. The most
      common symptoms of GCA include headache, pain in the shoulders and hips (polymyalgia
      rheumatica), pain in the jaw (jaw claudication), fever, and blurred vision. Organ-specific
      markers of injury or damage as well as direct markers of vascular damage and inflammation are
      currently used by clinicians to assess GCA disease progression; however, these markers are
      not very useful in guiding treatment. There are also blood tests that clinicians use to
      monitor GCA activity, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein
      (CRP), but these tests lack specificity and sensitivity. Most treatments available now for
      GCA are toxic, therefore if other markers indicating disease activity can be found, it may
      lead to the development of less toxic treatments. This study will use new scientific methods
      to identify new biomarkers that can be used to monitor disease activity in GCA patients.
      These biomarkers may be used to help direct clinical care for GCA patients and assist in
      future drug development.

      Study visits will occur monthly for the first year, then every 3 months thereafter for the
      remainder of the study. Blood and urine collection will occur at every visit. A physical exam
      and medical and medication history will occur every 3 months; also, participants will be
      asked to complete several questionnaires to assess disease activity, health status, and
      tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Participants may have additional study visits if a disease
      flare or disease-related complications occur during the study.
