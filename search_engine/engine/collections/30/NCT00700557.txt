      antibiotic therapy ou until six to eight weeks after the end of the treatment. The occurence
      of AAD is about 5% to 25% of the patients using antibiotics and cause watery diarrhea, fever
      and vomit, mainly on pseudomembranous colitis. Several studies had demonstrated the use of
      probiotics as therapeutic or preventive form of AAD with or without the presence of C.
      difficile. About the tolerance of the probiotics,there werenÂ´t observed deleterious effects
      on health with the consumption of 106 - 107 UFC of Lactobacillus spp and Bifidobacterium spp
      during a period of one year. The realization of this study can demonstrate the efficacy of
      Lactobacillus casei e Bifidobacterium breve at the treatment of AAD.
