      suffering from end stage osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. However, due to the high demand and
      scarce medical resources, the waiting time for surgery is astoundingly lengthy. Controversies
      are shown on numerous studies on whether physical functionality and mental status decline or
      remain stable over the waiting period. This study aims to evaluate the progression on
      patients suffering from end stage OA whilst being on the waiting list for TKR.
