      chemoradiation and, after the radiation is completed, during 6 cycles of temozolomide.

      Standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involves surgery followed by radiation
      combined with temozolomide (a chemotherapy). After radiation, patients receive cycles of
      temozolomide (adjuvant chemotherapy)

      Participants will:

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate three times a week during
           chemoradiation

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate twice a week during adjuvant
           chemotherapy (after radiation)

      This is a phase 1 study will evaluate the side effects of adding this drug to the standard
      therapy. The dose given to a participant will be determined by how well other participants
      have tolerated the drug.
