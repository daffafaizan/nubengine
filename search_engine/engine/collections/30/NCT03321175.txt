      other surgical procedure, it is sometimes accompanied by surgical complications. Wound
      complications are encountered in approximately 5% of women that undergo CS and include
      haematomas, seromas and infection. To evaluate the effects and benefits of subcutaneous
      irrigation during cesarean section we decide to conduct this randomized study.
