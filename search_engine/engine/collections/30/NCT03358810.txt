      PhagenyxÂ® Catheter placed prior to randomization, and will receive either an active treatment
      of Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES) or a sham treatment performed by a health care
      professional (HCP) that is un-blinded to treatment assignment. All other speech pathology
      standard dysphagia care will be provided by a speech language pathologist (SLP) that is
      blinded to treatment assignment. Administration of all protocol-specific assessments will be
      conducted by personnel blinded to treatment assignment.

      The study will follow an adaptive group sequential design with unblinded sample size
      re-assessment. To ensure 180 evaluable patients with 7-day data and assuming a 20% dropout
      rate, 225 patients will be enrolled initially. An interim analysis for futility will occur
      after the first 60 patients complete their 7-day visits and another interim analysis will be
      performed for efficacy and futility after 120 patients complete their 7-day visits. The total
      sample size may be increased up to 338 patients after the second interim analysis to ensure
      up to 270 evaluable patients. Up to 15 investigational centers across the US and possibly
      Europe will participate in this study. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately
      24 months and patient participation will last for approximately 11 weeks. Patients will be
      assessed at the following intervals: baseline, 48 hours, 7 days, 14 days or at discharge,
      whichever is first, and 11 weeks after completion of the study treatments.
