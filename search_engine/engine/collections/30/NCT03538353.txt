      communication about pain among patients, caregivers, and health care providers (HCPs). The
      proposed study addresses the long-term goal by conducting a project that investigates the
      validation and contradiction of patients' preexisting pain beliefs during pain education.
      Completion of the proposed project will advance the literature on validation and
      contradiction in patients with chronic pain by (1) focusing on a pain education resource
      instead of dyadic communication, (2) modifying a measure of validation and contradiction for
      relevance to an education resource, (3) exploring erroneous perceptions of validation and
      contradiction, (4) examining the impact of validation and contradiction on pain beliefs, and
      (5) obtaining patients' recommendations for a popular pain education film. The information
      gained will be used to improve pain education resources to increase their beneficial effects
      on pain and disability.
