      waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C infection and will be
      treated for hepatitis C at the same time. Hepatitis C treatment will include Grazoprevir
      (GZR) 100 mg/Elbasvir (EBR) 50 mg administered on-call to the operating room for the renal
      transplant procedure and continued for 12 weeks post-renal transplant. The donor hepatitis C
      genotype will be tested. If the donor has genotype 1a without resistance or genotype 1b
      treatment will remain GZR/EBR for 12 weeks. If the donor has genotype 1a with resistance
      variants, then Ribavirin will be added and treatment will be given for 16 weeks starting from
      the date ribavirin was added. If the donor has hepatitis C genotype 2 or 3, Sofosbuvir will
      be added and treatment will be for 12 weeks from the date Sofosbuvir was added.
