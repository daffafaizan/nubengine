      surgery. But they often cause severe side-effects and are usually used for treating
      moderate-sever and sight-threatening GO. Wait and see will be the first choice for the
      patient with mild GO.

      Subantimicrobial dose (SD) doxycycline displays a strong anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory function, which is independent of its antibiotic properties. Data from
      clinical trials demonstrated that SD doxycycline was effective in moderating inflammation in
      a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, rosacea
      and periodontitis.

      We propose to test the effect of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline for mild GO.
