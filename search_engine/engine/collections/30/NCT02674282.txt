      career of professional soccer players. Surgical ACL reconstruction is often required to treat
      the resulting knee instability. Although ACL reconstruction is considered a successful
      procedure in restoring knee stability, literature shows that only 55% of the participants
      return to competitive sports participation after surgery. Soccer players need technical,
      tactical and physical skills to succeed, such as good knee function and aerobic capacity. Our
      purpose is to evaluate maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) in ACL-injured professional soccer
      players and after a six-month period of post-operative rehabilitation, compared to a control
      group of healthy professional soccer players.
