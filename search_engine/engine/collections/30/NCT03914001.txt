      enhanced (DCE) imaging and DWI, was proven to be efficient tool in differentiating benign and
      malignant bladder lesion. morphological characterization of malignant bladder lesion
      (mapping/size/morphology/stalk), T stage differentiation and histological grade
      discrimination.

      The application of mpMRI in NMIBC with its added value as non invasive tool for initial
      staging and after primary resection could be a new helpful method for better diagnosis, risk
      categorization, refining the indications of second resection and proper determination of
      adjuvant treatment.
