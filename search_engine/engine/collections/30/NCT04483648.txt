      proprioception allows being aware of positions of the body parts in the space. Muscles,
      tendons, joint capsules are source of proprioception.

      Possible damage to these structures due to inflammation may cause diminished proprioception
      sense. Decreased proprioception was shown for cervical region in axial spondyloarthritis
      patients in a recent study.

      Different exercise programs may help increasing proprioception. Therefore, the aim of the
      present study is investigate the effects of cervical stabilization exercises on cervical
      proprioception accuracy.
