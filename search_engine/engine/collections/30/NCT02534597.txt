    
      Whole Child International (WCI) is a U.S.-based non-governmental organization. Its focus is
      on improving the caregiving environments for vulnerable children by effecting changes within
      child care centers and orphanages.

      This evaluation will assess the impact of an educational training and technical assistance
      program offered by WCI in collaboration with the El Salvadoran government. The program
      consists of a series of educational trainings (for local government officials, directors of
      childcare and residential centers, and center caregivers) and technical assistance including
      infrastructural changes within centers.

      To evaluate this intervention, a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial will be used to
      assign participating centers to one of seven treatment arms that will receive different
      components of the intervention. A community comparison cohort will also be enrolled to
      identify selection effects as well as local norms and standards. The central research
      question is, "Does providing training for institution providers and caregivers improve child
      outcomes?"

      Ethnographic research will also explore local cultural norms regarding child caregiving, and
      seek to understand how the intervention is received within communities.
