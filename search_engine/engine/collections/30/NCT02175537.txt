      Management in Qatar," is a two-arm randomized controlled trial of a 7-week condensed
      intervention to evaluate the efficacy of the microclinic social induction model on
      propagating lifestyle changes and in improving glycemic and metabolic control in Doha, Qatar.

      The microclinic social induction model leverages different levels of social and familial
      relationships to positively influence behaviors relating to diabetes and other metabolic
      conditions through small treatment units called 'microclinic groups,' consisting of 2-8 peers
      and family members of the same social network. The intervention model brings microclinic
      groups to a larger classroom network (~25 people/class) where each class shares access to a
      culturally salient diabetes educational curriculum and group support to promote health
      behavior changes such as improvement in diet, exercise, medication adherence, and blood
      pressure management to then influence better glycemic and metabolic control.
