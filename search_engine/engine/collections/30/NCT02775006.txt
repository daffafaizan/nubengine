    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of docetaxel monotherapy and the
      combination of docetaxel intercalated erlotinib in patients with relapsed EGFR wild type, ALK
      negative non squamous cell carcinoma.

      As pemetrexed is standard first line treatment, the combination of erlotinib docetaxel in
      non-squamous NSCLC should be investigated as second line treatment. Also the question has to
      be answered whether the combination outperforms monotherapy treatments.

      After stratification for ECOG-performance status (0-1), response to prior treatment (CR, PR,
      SD versus PD), treatment free interval after platinum based therapy (<6 months versus >6
      months) and maintenance, patients will be centrally randomized to receive either docetaxel
      (arm A) or docetaxel plus erlotinib (arm B).
