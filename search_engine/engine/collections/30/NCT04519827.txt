    
      A prospective, multi-centre double blind randomised placebo-controlled study to demonstrate
      the safety and tolerance of a new rice-based hydrolysate in children with diagnosed Cow's
      Milk Allergy (CMA). The test product being a new milk substitute hydrolysed rice-based
      formula with new ingredient. The results will satisfy the safety requirement when tolerated
      by 90% of children with proven CMA, with a confidence of 95%. New, and previously diagnosed
      children with confirmed CMA who meet the inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate
      in the study. Those included in the intervention phase will have IgE testing and an oral food
      challenge (OFC) to test and placebo products, in a randomised double-blind design. Children
      with a negative reaction to both test and placebo products will receive the test product for
      a period of 7 days (open challenge).
