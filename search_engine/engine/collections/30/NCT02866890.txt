      chloride introduce in 2005. It is used for maintaining the airway during spontaneous and
      controlled ventilation during general anesthesia . It has been advocated for prehospital
      emergency airway management and serves as a useful tool during failed intubations The LTS-D
      has recently undergone considerable changes in design based on clinical studies and
      investigators feedback. The new LTS-D is available to adult and pediatric sizes.For childrens
      the devices is presented in the size 3 for patients of < 155 cm (> 30 Kg.), the size 2.5 for
      patients 125-150cm. (20-30 Kg.), the size 2 for patients of 12-25 Kg, the size 1 for patients
      of 5-12 Kg and the size 0 for patients < 5 Kg.

      As these changes may influence the performance of the LTS-D relative to the old LTS-D version
      the investigator decided to check the new LTS-D in the pediatric version.

      The investigator hypothesized that the LTS-D perform clinically well during general
      anesthesia with controlled ventilation.
