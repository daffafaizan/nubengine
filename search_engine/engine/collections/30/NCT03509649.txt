      thoughts/ beliefs/ opinions on cervical spine (neck) manipulation. Current evidence suggests
      that patients who have a positive expectation about neck manipulation are more likely to
      report benefit from it, and we wish to determine if the perceived experience level of the
      therapist and the words they use to describe neck manipulation will affect the patient's
      perception.
