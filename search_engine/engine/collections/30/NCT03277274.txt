    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. This study will evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of single intravenous doses of TAK-954 in participants with varying degrees
      of hepatic function.

      The study will enroll approximately up to 32 participants. Participants will be enrolled in
      one of the 4 treatment groups based on their degree of hepatic impairment which will be
      determined based on Child-Pugh Score as follow:

        -  Group 1 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Mild Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class A)

        -  Group 2 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class B)

        -  Group 3 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Severe Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class C)

        -  Group 4 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Healthy Participants

      The Child-Pugh classification will assess the severity of 5 hepatic parameters (total serum
      bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites and encephalopathy grade) on a scale of 1
      (none) to 3 (moderate). Total hepatic impairment score ranges from 5 (mild) to 15 (severe)
      where higher score indicates more severity.

      All participants will receive a single dose of TAK-954 0.2 mg on Day 1.

      This study may have a full study design, where Group 1 to Group 4 will enroll approximately 8
      participants in each group or a reduced study design, where no participants will be enrolled
      in Group 1 and approximately 8 participants will be enrolled in Group 2 to Group 4.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Czech Republic and Slovakia. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 7 weeks. Participants will remain confined to the
      clinic for 4 days, with 2 further out-patient visits, and will make a final visit to the
      clinic 10-14 days after receiving their last dose of TAK-954 for a follow-up assessment.
