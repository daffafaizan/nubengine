      interesting to know that whether weekly GLP-1RA can improve glycemic variability in diabetic
      patients. The present study aims to assess the effect of dulaglutide on glycemic variability
      using continuous glucose monitor(CGM) (Libra, Abbott) in type 2 diabetic patients with 4
      weeks.
