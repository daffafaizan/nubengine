    
      Retrospective chart review of MDMC patients from 4/1/2017 to 8/31/19 with newly diagnosed
      mural thrombus.

      3.1. Study Methods

        -  Patients will be allocated into two groups: those who were prescribed DOACs upon
           discharge and those who were prescribed warfarin upon discharge

        -  Subgroup analyses will occur to evaluate the difference in efficacy and safety endpoints
           for patients into four categories including: those predisposed to mural thrombus by
           baseline risk factors (AFIB vs. ACS), location of the mural thrombus (atrial,
           ventricular, aortic), DOAC by agent (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran), and DOAC by
           scheduled dosing indication (AFIB vs. VTE).
