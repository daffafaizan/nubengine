      I. To determine the dose of MDX-010 (ipilimumab) that can safely be administered to patients
      with persistent or progressive malignancy following allo-HCT.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of different doses of MDX-010 administered as a single
      dose to patients with persistent or progressive malignancy following allo-HCT.

      III. By assessment of aims 1 and 2, to determine the best dosing regimen for further study of
      CTLA-4 blockade in conjunction with escalating dose donor-leukocyte infusions (DLI) in
      patients with evidence of residual or progressive malignancy following allo-HCT.

      IV. To assess if there is preliminary evidence of efficacy following the administration of
      MDX-010 in this population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ipilimumab until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients with persistent or progressive disease at 60 days after ipilimumab administration
      and no evidence of graft-versus-host disease receive donor lymphocyte infusions every 60 days
      for a total of 3 infusions.

      Patients are followed at 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.
