    
      Objective: to test whether Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to monitor
      cognitive brain function and detect markers for differentiation of Autism Spectrum Disorders
      (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

      Study population: Children with ASD, ADHD, and typically developing children, all between 4
      and 8 years of age.

      Design: The study will investigate NIRS signal changes while children with ASD, ADHD, and
      typically developing children perform well-known functional tasks.

      Outcome Measures: Graded changes in blood flow and oxygen, measured with NIRS, in response to
      different functional tasks.
