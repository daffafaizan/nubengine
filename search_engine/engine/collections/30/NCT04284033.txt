      Subjects will be asked to wear both types of sets twice for up to 7 days, alternating wear of
      set type over 4 weeks. The order of infusion set wear will be randomized with the first set
      wear. The investigators aim to see whether there is a benefit to using an extended wear
      infusion set.
