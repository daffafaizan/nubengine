      apnea-hypopnea syndrome in patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP).

      Patients hospitalized with CAP (Group A)will be studied with respiratory polygraphy during
      the sleep and a second respiratory polygraphy will be conducted in home after the curation of
      the pneumonia (one month). During the admission, etiological study including blood cultures,
      serology, urinary antigens for legionella and S, pneumoniae, sputum cultures and other
      invasive techniques as bronchoscopy when appropriate will be obtained. Questionnaires related
      with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome will be obtained consisting in Epworth test, symptoms
      questionnaires and FOSQ test.

      Group B are patients with other infections as urinary, bone, pelvic infections excluding
      upper or lower respiratory infections. Respiratory polygraphy will be performed in this group
      as in the group A obtaining the same questionnaires.

      We compare the variables of respiratory polygraphy, questionnaires scores, percentage of
      patients with an AHI > 12 between both groups and we compare the variables obtained in the
      respiratory polygraphy performed in hospital and at home in the group A to evaluate if the
      condition of an altered AHI was previous to the CAP episode. We will obtain the prevalence of
      sleep apnea-hypopnea patients in both groups and we compare factor risks (COPD, diabetes
      mellitus, bronchial asthma, etc) between A and B. Finally multivariable analysis is conducted
      to evaluate the contribution of the AHI to CAP, as other recognize factor risk.

      Both groups are paired by age, sex and body mass index
