      confirm the sensitivity of the Clearview HIV 1/2 tests in the described pediatric population.
      Only HIV-1 will be included in the study.

      The Clearview HIV tests can be used as a safe and effective screening method to aid in the
      diagnosis of infection with HIV 1/2 in the pediatric population aged between 12 and 17 years.

      The secondary objectives of this study include demonstrating that:

      - The Clearview HIV tests detect HIV-1 antibodies in a variety of sample matrices: capillary
      (fingertip) whole blood, venous whole blood, plasma and serum.
