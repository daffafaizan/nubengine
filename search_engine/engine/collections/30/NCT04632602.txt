      during COVID-19 acute respiratory failure and potentially to avoid in some case tracheal
      intubation and invasive ventilation. Potential mechanism is improvement of ventilation:
      perfusion mismatch through redistribution of ventilation to the dorsal part of the lungs
      where perfusion is prominent. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive
      functional lung imaging of distribution of ventilation. Therefore, we aim to assess EIT on
      lung ventilation inhomogeneity during supine and prone position in COVID-19 patients.
