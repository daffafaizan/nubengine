      surgical approaches aimed to prevent recurrent patellar instability and result in improvement
      in function. One surgical approach will be medial retinacular plication with multiple
      stitches while the other surgical approach will include medial patellofemoral ligament
      reconstruction using a hamstring tendon graft. Prior to surgery, and then during follow-up
      after surgery as well as at the completion of minimum two years follow-up after surgery,
      patients will be asked to complete subjective functional questionaires that will rate their
      knee function, and to undergo detailed physical examination and objective functional tests
      that will quantify the success of surgery. The outcomes of the surgical treatment options
      will be compared to determine whether medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction results
      in superior function and patient subjective satisfaction compared to medial retinacular
      plication only.
