      randomly allocated to receive either active or sham laser device to self treat at home. The
      patient's wound will be evaluated every 2 weeks. Adverse events will be documented. The study
      hypothesis is that B-Cure laser treatments as an adjunct therapy to standard treatment,
      applied, at home, by the patient or personal care-giver, can accelerate diabetic foot ulcers
      healing compared to standard treatment alone.
