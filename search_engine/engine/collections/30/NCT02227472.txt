      participants with SCD will be evaluated once with laboratory measures of cognitive and
      pre-academic skills and parent questionnaires. Medical history will be evaluated for purposes
      of characterizing the health status and disease severity of patients and determining how
      medical factors are related to school readiness and working memory in SCD population. The
      study expects to accrue up to 99 participants with SCD.

      Demographically-matched control children will be selected from a database of participants
      enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study of neurocognitive development in children born in
      Shelby County, Tennessee. The control group will be randomly selected from an existing study
      group and will not be enrolled on the MEMREAD protocol. Control group participants will be
      excluded if they have any sensory or motor impairment that would preclude valid testing
      (e.g., blindness, paresis), or if they have received treatment with non-stimulant
      psychotropic medication. A de-identified data file that includes the following results for up
      to 168 demographically-matched healthy control participants (approximately 1:2 ratio of SCD
      to healthy control) will be provided for control comparison purposes:

        -  Health Evaluation (CV4)

        -  Stanford binet - Fifth Edition (CV4)

        -  Bracken Basic Concepts Scale - Third Edition (CV4)

        -  The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) (CV4)

        -  The Scales of Independent Behavior - Revised, Early Development Form (SIB-R) (CV4)

        -  Demographics (CV4)

        -  Additional Covariates (if any) including gestational age at birth, developmental delays,
           major medical illnesses, surgery history, neurological event history, pre-kindergarten
           attendance, and daycare attendance
