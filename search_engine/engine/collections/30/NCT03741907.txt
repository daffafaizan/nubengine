      CS continues to rise, despite initiatives to counter this trend. Cesarean sections have a
      higher morbidity rate than vaginal deliveries, with a substantial care and cost measurable by
      the mean hospital stay, the use of analgesics, and the potential for complications .
      Crucially, the birth of a new baby is an unique incentive to return quickly to "normal"
      function. Improving the cesarean section techniques is therefore of considerable importance
      in modern obstetrics.

      One of the most widely used cesarean section techniques is the MLC method developed by
      Michael Stark et al. This approach is indicated as the optimal technique in view of its
      characteristic of reducing lower pelvic discomfort and pain, thus improving quality of life
      However, this intraperitoneal C-section interfere at least with future fertility desire.

      The French Ambulatory Cesarean Section (FAUCS) technique has been employed by 10
      practitioners in France for approximately 20 years. In a retrospective study over 3000 cases
      this innovative approach seems to provide a shorter recovery time with a Hospital discharge
      the day after surgery . Investigators introduced this technique in "Mongi Slim" university
      hospital in January 2018. In this study, investigators compare the FAUCS and the MLC
      techniques in termes of mother and child outcomes
