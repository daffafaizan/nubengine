      (NSCLC), of which SCLC accounts for about 15%-20%.Because of the high degree of malignancy of
      SCLC, patients often lose the opportunity of surgical treatment due to metastasis at the time
      of admission. Traditional cytotoxic drugs can improve the prognosis of patients and life
      treatment, but the survival benefit is very limited.

      Vascular targeted therapy is an important treatment strategy for metastatic lung
      cancer.Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has
      significant inhibitory activity against angiogenesis related kinases such as VEGFR1/2/3,
      FGFR1/2/3, and other tumor related kinases such as PDGFR /, C-Kit, Ret, etc. (e.g., Met,
      FGFR1/2/3). An exploratory phase II study explored the efficacy of third-line single-drug
      therapy for ED-SCLC and found significant improvement in prognosis.

      Based on the above status and research results, the purpose of this study was to explore the
      efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with etoposide/carboplatin in
      first-line treatment of extensive small-cell lung cancer.
