      escalating dose cohorts (n = 2/cohort for 2 dose levels followed by n = 3/cohort for 4 dose
      levels). TIMP-GLIA will be administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1. A
      staggered dosing strategy will be used in Part A. Subjects will undergo medical observation
      in the clinic for at least 48 hours after dosing and participate in outpatient follow-up
      visits. Adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) and laboratory data
      (serum chemistry, coagulation, hematology and urinalysis, cytokines) will be assessed by a
      Safety Committee before the next cohort will be dosed at a higher dose level.

      After completion of Part A and confirmation by the Safety Committee to proceed, eligible
      subjects (n=3) will receive two IV infusions of TIMP-GLIA, 7 days apart, on Day 1 and on Day
      8. Each subject in Part B will be observed in clinic for 48 hours after each dose and undergo
      similar testing and follow-up visits as in Part A.

      The safety and pharmacokinetic profile of TIMP-GLIA will be characterized.
