    
      This is a hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation, mixed methods study that involves conducting
      a longitudinal randomized controlled trial in which high-risk, heavy drinking MSM (N = 500)
      will be recruited online from several high-incidence US cities: Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami,
      New Orleans, Washington DC/Baltimore. Participants will be sent HIV and STI self-testing kits
      at baseline, 6 mo., and 12 mo. Along with their test kits, they will be randomized to receive
      access to either: (1) a 24-hour helpline providing free standard post-test counseling and
      referral, or (2) the 24-hour helpline plus the Game Plan app. Test kits will provide testing
      and results for HIV, Syphilis, and genital, rectal, and pharyngeal Gonorrhea and Chlamydia,
      as well as phosphatidylethanol (PEth). Participants will also be asked to complete an online
      follow-up survey every three months that assess drinking, sexual behavior, and use of
      prevention methods over the 12-month study period. At 12 mo., 30 participants and 12 HST
      stakeholders will be recruited to participate in qualitative interviews to issues relevant to
      implementing Game Plan alongside HIV testing programs. Specifically, this study aims to: (1)
      test whether using a brief, MI-inspired, web-based intervention (Game Plan) after HST reduces
      (a) binge drinking, (b) the average number of drinks per drinking day over 12 months among
      heavy-drinking and high-risk, HIV-negative MSM, compared to providing access to a 24h
      helpline providing risk-reduction counseling alone, (2) test whether using Game Plan results
      in lower rates of (a) bacterial STIs, (b) high-risk CAS, and (c) higher rates of PrEP uptake
      over 12 months, and (3) to assess Game Plan's potential for implementation into self-testing
      programs by examining indicators of adoption, engagement, appropriateness and satisfaction
      among MSM assigned to have access to the site. Investigators will use site metrics and
      responses, survey data, and in-depth qualitative interview data from users and virtual focus
      groups with stakeholders to help address key implementation questions.
