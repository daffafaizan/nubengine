      symptoms (e.g. pain, swelling and reduced function). Leukocytes, upon activation during
      inflammatory states, generate radical oxygen species (ROS) which primarily are intended for
      host defence against invading pathogens. Certain NSAID can modify the generation of ROS from
      stimulated neutrophils ranging form increased production to reduced production. Preliminary
      experiments in our laboratory have shown that different NSAIDs have opposing effects on the
      ability of leukocytes (granulocytes and monocytes) to produce ROS upon a standardized
      stimulus, i.e. phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Paracetamol has a marked inhibitory effect
      and ibuprofen has a facilitating effect on ROS production. An inhibitory effect of
      paracetamol was also seen when examining platelet activation markers, whereas acetylsalicylic
      acid showed a clear enhancing effect in this respect. We want to examine if intake of
      paracetamol or ibuprofen in vivo have similar effects on leukocyte ROS production and
      platelet activation, respectively.
