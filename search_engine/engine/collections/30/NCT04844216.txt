    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled versus active treatment,
      within-subjects study with blinded subjects and evaluators assessing the efficay and safety
      of STYLAGE® L Lidocaine in the treatment of nasolabial folds. Fifty healthy subjects between
      the age of 30 and 65, with moderate to severe nasolabial folds attaining either grade 3 on
      both sides or grade 4 on both sides on the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) for
      nasolabial folds as assessed in live, who have given their informed consent and met all
      eligibility criteria, will be enrolled. Subjects will randomly receive dermal injections
      consisting in a maximum of 2 mL of STYLAGE® L Lidocaine on one nasolabial fold and a maximum
      of 2 mL of an active comparator on the other nasolabial fold. A touch-up consisting in the
      dermal injection of maximum 1 mL of product per nasolabial fold is possible if required one
      month after. Subjects will be followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months timepoints. Variation
      in severity score of nasolabial folds will be assessed in live and on photographs by
      independent blinded evaluators using the validated 5-point Wrinkles Severity Rating Scale
      (WSRS). Global aesthetic improvement will be assessed using the Global Aesthetic Improvement
      Scale (GAIS). Variation in nasolabial fold depth will be assessed using Dermatop®. Subject
      satisfaction, pain at injection site and safety will also be assessed.
