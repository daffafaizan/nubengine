    
      Patients scheduled for operation on suspected endometriosis in two study hospitals
      specialized in the surgical treatment of endometriosis between January 2005 - December 2007
      (Päijät-Häme Central Hospital) and January 2008 - December 2008 (Helsinki University
      Hospital) were enrolled to the study. The diagnosis of endometriosis was histologically
      verified for all patients. Background data was collected from patients' age, body mass index,
      previous deliveries, previous endometriosis surgery, and current hormonal treatment for
      endometriosis.

      From the beginning of January 2006 patients also completed preoperative questionnaires
      considering visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain symptoms (dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia,
      pain with urination and defecation, chronic pelvic pain, pain with ovulation), functional
      bowel and urinary symptoms, and 15D Quality of Life questionnaire, McCoy sexual functioning
      questionnaire, EHP-5 Short Form Endometriosis Profile questionnaire. Same questionnaires will
      also be completed six months, one year, two years, four years, and six years after the
      endometriosis operation. Follow-up questionnaires also contain questions concerning
      complications related to surgery, endometriosis recurrence, pregnancies, and infertility
      treatments.
