      lavage, can reduce the severity of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Nasal lavage consists
      of running salt water in one nostril and out the other to get rid of germs. Saline nasal
      irrigation with Betadine or baking soda will be evaluated.

      Participants will be asked to do several things during this study: watch a one minute video
      on YouTube, use a nasal irrigation device twice a day for 14 days, complete a one-time
      detailed survey and keep a research diary about their usage and symptoms using an on-line
      application called Qualtrics, agree to be texted reminders, be called on the phone if they
      fail to complete the daily diary two days in a row, agree to be called four times, and
      provide contact information for a secondary person who can be contacted if the primary
      participant is unavailable.

      Participation in this study does not involve any significant risks. However, some people may
      find using nasal irrigation causes them some discomfort.

      While there are no known benefits to participating in the study participants may see a
      reduction in their symptoms more quickly than if they didn't participate in the study.
