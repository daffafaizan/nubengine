      will be sprayed onto the cheek mucosal tissue. Onset and duration of local anesthesia will be
      evaluated over a one hour period using pin prick and QST heat stimulation. Subjects will
      receive both treatments in a cross-over design with each session separated by 5-7 days. A
      total of 76 subjects (normal volunteers) will be evaluated.
