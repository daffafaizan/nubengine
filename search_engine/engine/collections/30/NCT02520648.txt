      recruited and voluntarily participated in the study. Excluded subjects with musculoskeletal
      injuries such as spine or balance disorders, those which were recovering from an injury of
      the locomotor or neurological system, or those who had sequelae from any trauma suffered in
      the past six months that could affect the results of the study.

      Study design:

      The conducted study was an experimental, longitudinal and prospective, controlled, randomized
      and single-blind design (subjects and therapists didn't know the objectives of the treatment
      nor how many treatments were offered, evaluators were unaware of the treatments applied).
      There were 3 groups: a) neuro-lymphatic treatment; b) vertebral articulatory treatment; c)
      proximal costal articulatory treatment.
