    
      This is a intermediate-size Expanded Access Protocol (EAP). Patients who were receiving
      DKN-01 in a parent study at the time of completion of the parent study, and are, in the
      opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor, suitable candidates for continued study drug
      treatment are eligible for participation in the current EAP. In this EAP, all patients will
      receive DKN-01 at the same dose and schedule as at the time of completion of the parent
      study. Furthermore, patients who received DKN-01 in combination in the parent study will
      continue to receive the same combination agent at the same dose and schedule in the EAP.
