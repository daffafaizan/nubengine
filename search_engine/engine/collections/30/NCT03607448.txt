    
      Up to 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study at a total of 6 clinical research sites in
      the United States. Subjects will wear a total of two (2) sensors, one on the back of each
      upper arm. Each Sensor will have a paired Reader that will be given to the subject. All
      Readers will be masked during the study (i.e. subjects will not be able to view glucose
      results obtained from the Sensor on the Reader screen). Subjects will be asked to perform at
      least 8 capillary Blood Glucose (BG) tests per day using the primary Reader. Interstitial
      glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the corresponding Readers immediately
      following each BG test. Subjects will be instructed to report any problems with the device.
      Subjects will make six (6) scheduled visits to the clinical study site, including the
      Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1). Subjects will have three (3) in-clinic visits during
      which intravenous blood draws and YSI reference testing will occur.
