    
      This overarching project aims are to refine, implement, and evaluate a multi-faceted
      intervention composed of the Patient-SatisfActive® model, developed by Drs. Ronen Rozenblum
      and David Bates at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and a web-based Patient-Centered Toolkit
      (PCTK), developed by Drs. Dykes and Dalal, on quality, safety, and cost outcomes in the
      intensive care and oncology units at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The specific aims of the
      project are as follows:

        -  Aim 1: To refine and implement the Patient-SatisfActive® model to promote respect,
           dignity, and satisfaction of patients, care partners and staff on intensive care and
           oncology units.

        -  Aim 2: To refine and implement a web-based, Patient-Centered Toolkit (PCTK), comprised
           of an electronic bedside communication center (eBCC) and a patient-centered microblog,
           to promote tailored patient and care-partner education, communication, collaboration,
           and engagement.

        -  Aim 3: To evaluate the relative impact of this intervention compared to usual care on
           patient reported outcome measures, adverse events (harms), post-discharge healthcare
           utilization, concordance in understanding the care plan, and satisfaction among care
           team members (patients/care partners, profession providers).

        -  Aim 4: To identify the barriers and facilitators of implementing this intervention to
           support dissemination.
