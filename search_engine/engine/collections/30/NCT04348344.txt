    
      First of all, the investigators need to obtain detailed history records, including cardio
      pulmonary vascular history, related complications, treatment history and other high-risk
      factors. After careful review, the investigators need to determine whether the patient is
      suitable to participate in the pulmonary rehabilitation plan. The investigators need to pay
      special attention to diseases that may affect the patient's performance, including special
      cardiovascular diseases, skeletal muscle and nervous system.

      Functional evaluation: pulmonary function test, exercise cardiopulmonary function evaluation
      (6-minute walking test), grip strength test, psychological state evaluation ( Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (phq-9)), nutrition
      screening and evaluation and others (general examination such as height, weight, BMI, waist
      and hip circumference, WHR, blood pressure, heart rate and blood biochemical examination;
      quality of life evaluation; other related individual evaluation Estimation includes smoking
      and sleep).

        1. Acute exacerbation:

           The exercise prescription of "hospitalization + home rehabilitation" was adopted, which
           mainly combined aerobic endurance training, intermittent strength training and
           inspiratory muscle training, as follows:

           Aerobic exercise: 4 times / week, 30min / time, fast walking or power cycling Strength
           training: unarmed or instrument, 4 times / week, 3 groups / time, 10-12 times / group
           Breath training: ① breath Trainer: once a day, 20-30min a time

           ② Abdominal breathing training: 1-2 times / day, 10min / time

        2. Stable patients:

      Using the "home-based rehabilitation" exercise prescription, taking home exercise as the main
      form, using the sports bracelet and special respiratory rehabilitation app software, the home
      management system integrating home rehabilitation training, detection and feedback is mainly
      adopted, which is a combination of aerobic endurance training, intermittent strength training
      and inspiratory muscle training, as follows:

      Aerobic exercise: 2-3 times / week, 30min / time, walk quickly Strength training: elastic
      band, 2-3 times / week, 3 groups / time, 10-12 times / group Breathing training: ① breathing
      exercise apparatus, 1-2 times / day, 10min / time

      ② Abdominal breathing training, 1-2 times / day, 10min / time
