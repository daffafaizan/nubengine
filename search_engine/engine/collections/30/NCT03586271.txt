      near and far vision simultaneous. However, these multifocal lenses have the disadvantages,
      including lower contrast sensitivity(CS) and visual discomfort, such as halos, glares and
      starburst, et al. Therefore, careful patient selection is crucial to achieve good
      postoperative results. The purpose of this study was to compare the visual outcomes and
      subjective visual quality between bifocal intraocular Lens(ReSTOR +2.5/+ 3.0D and Diff-aay)
      and trifocal intraocular Lens(AT Lisa tri 839MP). This prospective, nonrandomized,
      consecutive, comparative study included the assessment of 60 patients implanted with
      multifocal intraocular lens. visual acuity was tested in all cases. Ophthalmological
      evaluation included the measurement of uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected
      distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA), and uncorrected
      intermediate visual acuity (UIVA), the analysis of contrast sensitivity (CS), visual defocus
      curve, spectacle independence, patient satisfaction, residual sphere, spherical equivalent
      (SE), cylinder and complications.
