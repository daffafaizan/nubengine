      safety, solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited adverse events
      for 28 days post-vaccination are assessed and reported. To assess the immunogenicity,
      antibody levels are evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition(HI) assay from sera obtained at
      pre-vaccination and 21 days post-vaccination.
