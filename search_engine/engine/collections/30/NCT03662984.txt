      can improve myocardial insulin sensitivity in subjects with IGM. As secondary objectives we
      want to investigate whether ciprofibrate treatment also improves diastolic and myocardial
      mitochondrial function and decreases intracardiomyocellular lipid content. Futhermore, since
      ciprofibrate could also affect cardiac metabolism indirectly, we want to investigate the
      effect of ciprofibrate on skeletal and hepatic glucose uptake, hepatic lipid storage and
      composition.

      Study design: In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, the effects of ciprofibrate
      supplementation on myocardial insulin sensitivity will be compared to placebo in humans with
      IGM.

      Study population: Twelve male, overweight (BMI > 27 kg/m2), insulin-resistant subjects, aged
      between 40 and 70 years, without cardiac disease, will participate in this study.

      Intervention: Subjects will be asked to take one pill of ciprofibrate 100mg, or placebo, once
      daily (at dinner), for 35 days.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study endpoint is the difference in myocardial
      insulin sensitivity (measurement of glucose uptake using radio-active labeled 18F-FDG tracer
      in PET-MRI) after ciprofibrate administration compared to the placebo trial.
