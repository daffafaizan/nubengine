      and placebo in asthma. This trial will answer the following questions: 1) Is there a true
      placebo response in asthma that is not due to non-specific factors? 2) Can the placebo effect
      in asthma be augmented by interventions that increase expectancy of benefit? 3) Can
      interventions that increase expectancy augment the effect of active treatment? 4) Are placebo
      effects additive or interactive with treatment effects?
