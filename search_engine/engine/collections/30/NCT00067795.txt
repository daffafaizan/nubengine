      some individuals with chronic HIV infection to maintain low level viremia (less than 3000
      copies/ml). The fundamental measurement of this response is the steady state level of viremia
      in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. However, using this clinical endpoint in vaccine and
      drug trials is time-consuming. Several laboratory assays of HIV T cell function have been
      developed to measure the key characteristics of an efficient immune response. This study will
      evaluate these assays in two distinct patient populations.

      Two patient cohorts will be followed in this study. Cohort A will enroll patients who are
      stable on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). These patients will have been on the
      same HAART regimen for at least 9 months prior to study entry. Cohort B will enroll patients
      with chronic HIV infection and efficient immune control. These patients will have not been on
      any antiretroviral drugs for at least 6 months and will have viral loads less than 3,000
      copies/ml. Participants in both cohorts will have blood drawn at study entry and Weeks 12 and
      24. Blood samples will be used for CD4/CD8 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, and immunologic
      assays.
