      patient's choice can improve the ease of fundoscopic exam as defined by improved success of
      visualizing the optic disk and the reduction in time needed to perform the exam. The
      investigators will also examine the physician's and caregiver's perception on whether the
      video was effective in improving the ease of the exam. The purpose of the video is to capture
      the visual attention of the patient thereby allowing the physician to swiftly perform the
      fundoscopic exam. The literature has suggested that young patients are most uncooperative,
      therefore the investigators will focus our study on younger patients 1-8 years old.
