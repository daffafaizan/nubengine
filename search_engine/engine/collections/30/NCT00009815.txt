      dose fluorouracil-uracil plus leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced solid tumors. II.
      Determine possible side effects and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of etoposide. Patients receive oral etoposide daily
      on days 1-10 and oral fluorouracil-uracil plus oral leucovorin calcium twice a day on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of etoposide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 months and then periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
