    
      -  Participants will receive bevacizumab intravenously every 2 weeks. They will also
           receive trastuzumab and vinorelbine intravenously once a week. Therefore, treatments
           will alternate between receiving all three drugs (1st week, third week, fifth week,
           etc.) and receiving only trastuzumab and vinorelbine (2nd week, fourth week, sixth week,
           etc.) A treatment cycle lasts four weeks.

        -  During all treatment cycles a physical exam will be performed and the participant will
           be asked general health and specific questions about any problems they are experiencing.

        -  X-ray, CT scans, and/or MRI scans will be performed every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles) in
           order to assess the effect of the study treatment on the participants cancer. These
           tests are considered standard of care in patients receiving chemotherapy.

        -  Once a week blood counts will be performed and at least every 4 weeks, chemistry and
           other tests to measure any additional effect of the study drug and disease status will
           be checked. These tests are also considered standard of care for patients receiving
           chemotherapy.

        -  At the beginning of the study and at the 4- and 8-week time point, additional blood will
           be drawn in order to conduct research blood tests to measure the presence of cancer
           cells in the blood.

        -  A urine test and MUGA scan or echocardiogram will be done every 8 weeks while the
           participant in on the study.

        -  Participants can remain on the research study as long as the study treatment appears to
           be working and they are not experiencing unacceptable side effects.
