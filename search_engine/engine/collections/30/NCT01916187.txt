      in animals and may also be doing so in adults, but we are not sure if it can also slow tumour
      growth in children and offer better results than standard treatment. Laboratory studies
      suggest imetelstat may increase the activity of 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is used to treat
      neuroblastoma, although this is not yet proven in patients.
