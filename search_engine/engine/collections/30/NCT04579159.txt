      in combination with a PPG-wearable in detecting AA will be assessed and the number of cases
      found. The design aims to provide simple, low-threshold access to this screening technology
      targeting at-risk populations. This study will not cause any restrictions on the usual care
      of the study participants. Access to the screening will be provided close to home and free of
      charge. The app will also be used to validate and enhance the clinical information about the
      participants captured during the study. This information will be used to define and refine
      target groups with highest screening efficiency and, in the long-term, outcome benefits. The
      study will describe the prevalence of AA in an unselected population that can be reached by a
      low-threshold screening procedure. The study will also generate important information on the
      different possible screening environments in different countries (e.g. pharmacies, GP
      practices, etc). Structures of work-up and continuous patient management in screen-positive
      individuals will be described and may help to design screening pathways in the main trial. By
      verifying the wearable-diagnoses by ECG in all screen-positive and a random selection of
      screen-negative participants, the diagnostic accuracy of the wearable in combination of cloud
      based analytic service can be estimated. Cost effectiveness assessment will evaluate the cost
      of low-threshold remote screening per patient identified and help guide to target high risk
      groups with optimal screening yield in the future. The collected data will provide the sound
      basis for the design and conduct of a large outcome trial.
