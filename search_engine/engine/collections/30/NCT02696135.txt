      was given. The investigator will collect the baseline clinical characteristics of the
      patients at enrollment, including comprehensive physical examination, laboratory testing of
      blood and urine, electrocardiography, 24-hr Holter, echocardiography, MRI and other
      examinations if necessary. The specimens retained include blood for all patients and
      myocardium for patients receive surgery of myocardial myectomy. Multi-omics screening,
      including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, will be performed
      to identified novel disease genes, signal pathway or processes, genetic risk factors and
      potential therapy targets of HCM. Furthermore, besides examining the accuracy of SCD risk
      prediction of the 2011 ACCF/AHA and 2014 ESC guidelines, we will identify novel risk factors
      associated with the clinical outcomes and construct predictive models suitable for Chinese
      patients with HCM.
