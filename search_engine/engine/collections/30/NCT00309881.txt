    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of the rate and quality of remission, of chemotherapy
           comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, prednisone, and
           rituximab (CHOP-R) in patients with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia
           (CLL) (closed to accrual as of 10/2006), CLL with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or
           Richter transformation.

        -  Determine the incidence of infection in patients on CHOP-R regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease (chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (closed to accrual as of 10/2006) vs CLL with
      autoimmune hemolytic anemia vs Richter transformation).

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine IV on day
      1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 1 of the second
      course and each subsequent course. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 (for patients
      with CLL) or 8 (for patients with Richter's transformation) courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.
