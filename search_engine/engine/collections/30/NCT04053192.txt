      for dilatation of serve aortic stenosis. With this minimally invasive intervention an
      increase of the aortic valve area (AVA) and cardiac ejection fraction (EF), decrease of
      transvalvular gradients and ultimately a symptom relief should be achieved. The required
      effect is temporary and a definitive treatment should be aspired in suitable patients.
      Therefor Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is available.

      Following the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology for the management of valvular
      heart disease from 2017, the aortic stenosis can be divided into different subtypes by using
      haemodynamic parameters: High-gradient AS (HG-AS), Low-Flow-Low-Gradient AS (LFLG-AS) and
      paradoxical Low-Flow-Low-Gradient (pLFLG-AS). Patients with LFLG-AS are suspected to have a
      poorer prognosis when treated curative as well as when treated palliative medicamentous,
      because these patients show coronary and myocardial restrictions more frequently in addition
      to the valvular disease.

      The aim of the study is to compare safety and effectiveness of balloon aortic valvuloplasty
      as a bridging therapy and transcatheter aortic valve replacement as a definitive treatment in
      HG-AS, LFLG-AS and pLFLG-AS patients to verify whether the subtypes of aortic stenosis profit
      equally from these interventions.
