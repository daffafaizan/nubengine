    
      Primary Objective To estimate the proportion of patients with pathological downstaging to
      <pT2 after neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine and
      cisplatin in patients with MIBC

      Hypothesis: The rate of pathologic downstaging to <pT2 will improve compared to historical
      controls

      Secondary Objectives To estimate the proportion of patients with pT0 after neoadjuvant
      therapy with pembrolizumab when administered in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in
      patients with MIBC

      Hypothesis: The rate of pathologic downstaging to pT0 will improve compared to historical
      controls

      To estimate event free survival (EFS) Hypothesis: EFS will be improved compared to historical
      controls

      To estimate overall survival (OS) Hypothesis: OS will be improved compared to historical
      controls

      To estimate the proportion of patients who are alive at 3 years (OS at 3 years) Hypothesis:
      OS at 3 years will be improved compared to historical controls

      To characterize the toxicity profile for the combination of pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and
      cisplatin Hypothesis: Pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin will be a safe combination
      with acceptable toxicity rates

      Exploratory Objectives To explore the association of biological markers including PD-L1
      expression and immune gene expression signatures with pathological downstaging to <pT2, pT0,
      EFS, and OS

      To explore associations between BASE47 "basal," "claudin-low," and "luminal" subtypes of MIBC
      and pathological downstaging to <pT2, pT0, EFS, and OS

      To characterize the change in phenotype of TILs, including delineation of effector and
      regulatory T cells, before and after neoadjuvant treatment

      To define T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire profiles that are
      associated with pathological downstaging to <pT2, pT0, EFS, and OS

      First the participant will receive all 3 study drugs (Pembrolizumab/Keytruda, gemcitabine and
      cisplatin) on the first day of a 3 week "cycle". The participant will then receive cisplatin
      and gemcitabine on the 8th day of the cycle.

      The participant will receive the study drugs for 4 cycles for a total of 12 weeks.

      Participants are followed for 5 years.
