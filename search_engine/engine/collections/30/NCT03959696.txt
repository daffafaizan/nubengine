      about whether to continue or stop colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The study will randomly
      assign about 50 primary care clinicians from 5 different sites to one of two different arms.
      In the Intervention arm, clinician participants will complete a training course and will also
      be notified of patients aged 76-85 with an upcoming visit who are due for a discussion about
      CRC screening. In the Comparator arm, clinician participants will be notified of their
      patients in the target age group with an upcoming visit who are due for a discussion about
      CRC screening. The study staff will collect surveys from about 500 eligible patients of
      participating physicians shortly after their visit to determine the impact of the
      intervention on patient-reported measures including the amount of shared decision making,
      knowledge, and preferences for cancer screening. Study staff will follow patients to track
      colorectal cancer screening tests in the 12 months following the visit and will survey
      patients again at 12 months to examine any barriers to follow through with their preferred
      approach. The study will also assess physician's ability to demonstrate shared decision
      making skills for cancer screening decisions in simulated patient interactions. Caregivers,
      if identified by a patient participant, will also complete a short survey evaluating the
      visit.
