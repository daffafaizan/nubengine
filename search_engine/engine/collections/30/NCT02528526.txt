      burden and increased survival in five different animal solid tumor models both applied as
      monotherapy and increased beneficial effects when followed by standard chemotherapy. The
      unique ability of the IMP counteract hypoxic tumor behaviour along with its non-toxic side
      effects tested both in animals and healthy volunteers is of outmost interest to explore in
      patients with solid tumors.

      The study seeks primarily to determine the safety and tolerability of OXY111A in patients
      with primary and secondary hepato-pancreato-biliary and gastrointestinal neoplasia as
      measured by exploring the MTD in a conservative 3+3 dose escalation schedule. The window for
      DLT assessment is from first dose of study drug until first dose of standard of care
      chemotherapy or 10 days following completion of last dose of study drug (whichever is shorter
      in duration). Additionally, we will assess efficacy of OXY111A on decreasing tumor volume,
      metabolic activity, as well as circulatory tumor and angiogenic markers.
