      is surgical repair or replacement their valves. The most commonly used tool to quantify the
      severity mitral and aortic regurgitation is echocardiography. Studies have shown that
      echocardiography may have significant limitations in quantifying regurgitant volume. MRI has
      recently been shown to easily and reproducibly quantify regurgitation. To better understand
      how to accurately quantify severity of regurgitation the investigators propose this study
      with the following aims: 1) compare MRI to echocardiography in the evaluation of regurgitant
      volume in patients with aortic or mitral regurgitation and 2) to assess which technique is
      better at predicting the response of the left ventricle to valve surgery.
