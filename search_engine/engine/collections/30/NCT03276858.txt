    
      The single-dose phase initiates with ascending doses of an oral solution followed by a 3-way
      crossover food effect and bioavailability (capsule formulation) cohort. Serum IGF-1 levels
      and GHRH-analog stimulated GH levels will be assessed as pharmacodynamics measures.

      The first multiple-dose (7 days dosing) cohort will be initiated after the PK and safety data
      are available from the single-dose phase. Subsequent multiple-dose cohorts will have 10 days
      of dosing. Serum IGF-1 level and GH levels will be assessed as pharmacodynamics measures.

      The last cohort in the study is midazolam drug-drug interaction study. The dose will be
      selected based on review of all pharmacokinetic and safety data for the single-dose and
      multiple-dose cohorts completed. On Day 1, 8 subjects will receive a single oral 2 mg dose of
      midazolam. Starting on Day 3 through Day 8, subjects will receive daily doses of CRN00808. On
      Day 9, subjects will be administered CRN00808 and 2 mg midazolam together.
