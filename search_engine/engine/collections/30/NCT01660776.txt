    
      Secondary purposes are :

        -  To confirm the presence of plasma soluble form of PD-L1 in others malignancies

        -  To study surface expression of PD-L1 on circulating tumour cells with multiparameter fow
           cytometry and VeridexÂ® technology in DLBCL and metastatic breast cancer patients

        -  To study surface expression of PD-L1 on circulating endothelial cells in DLBCL, Hodgkin
           lymphoma and metastatic breast cancer patients (subpart ended in late 2012)

        -  To study surface expression of PD-L1 on different types of leukocytes (monocytes, B and
           T lymphocytes)

        -  To separate circulating tumour cells expressing PD-L1 by immunomagnetic or Cell-sorting
           method

        -  To develop ELISPOT technique to study the release of soluble PD-L1 in culture
           supernatants of selected cells (subpart ended mid 2013)

        -  to evaluate the correlation between the expression of PD-L1 in the plasma and *) the
           expression of PD-L1 in the tumor, **) the expression of PD-L1 and other molecules in the
           bronchoalveolar liquid (whenever available from routine) in non-small cell lung cancer

        -  to evaluate the response to treatment according to plasma PD-L1 expression in non-small
           cell lung cancer

        -  to evaluate the susceptibility to develop a disease according to the single nucleotide
           polymorphisms of the PD-L1 gene in DLBCL and non-small cell lung cancer

        -  Constitution of the different cohorts and collection of samples Main cohort : de novo
           DLBCL at diagnosis Secondary cohorts: Hodgkin's lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, non
           small cell lung cancer Control cohorts : healthy volunteers (blood donors), patients
           with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)

        -  Quantification of plasma soluble PD-L1 in the different cohorts
