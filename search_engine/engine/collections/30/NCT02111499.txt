      betamethasone dipropionate, as well as monotherapy with bexarotene, will be investigated
      regarding their efficacy, tolerability and safety in patients with mild to moderate plaque
      psoriasis and will be compared with the vehicle and an active comparator.

      Since a side effect of the application of corticosteroids is skin atrophy, additionally three
      non-lesional test areas (not affected by psoriasis) on the volar forearm will be treated with
      the active reference product, one of the fixed combinations and the vehicle. Skin atrophy
      will be investigated by visual assessment and ultrasound at these test areas
