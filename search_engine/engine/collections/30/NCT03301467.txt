    
      C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is characterized by evidence of alternative complement activation
      based on C3 deposition in the glomeruli. There are two forms of the disease: dense deposit
      disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN). There is no approved treatment for patients
      with C3G.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of avacopan (CCX168) in patients with C3G. Patients receive avacopan 30mg or
      matching placebo orally twice-daily. The placebo-controlled treatment period is 26 weeks (182
      days). This will be followed by 26 weeks during which time all patients will receive
      avacopan. Thereafter, all patients will be followed for eight weeks (56 days) without study
      drug treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan compared to
      placebo based on histologic changes in kidney biopsies taken at baseline and after 26 weeks
      of treatment. The primary endpoint will be based on the percent change from baseline in the
      C3G Histologic Index for disease activity.
