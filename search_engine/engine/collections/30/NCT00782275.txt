    
      Avastin, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb), inhibits vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF). VEGF is one of the most potent and specific proangiogenic factors and has been
      identified as a crucial regulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis. Temsirolimus
      specifically inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a highly conserved
      serine/threonine kinase which regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to
      environmental factors. The combination avastin and temsirolimus has already demonstrated
      efficacy in the phase I setting

      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

      The primary endpoint is 4-month PFS. The null and alternative hypotheses are 50% vs. 70%.
      Assuming 2 ineligible patients, the target sample size is 41 patients (39 eligible patients).
      The probability of concluding that the treatment is effective was >0.90 if the true rate is
      at least 70%. The probability of concluding that the treatment is effective was â‰¤ 0.10 if the
      true rate was 50% or less. If 24 or more patients are alive and progression-free at 4 months,
      then this regimen would be considered for further study.
