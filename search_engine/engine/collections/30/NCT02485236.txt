      (intermittent collapse of upper airway while asleep) who refuse Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure use after surgery and are treated with routine postoperative supplemental oxygen
      alone (1 liters per minute) will have more oscillation of oxygen saturation during the night
      (measure by overnight oximetry) than those treated with high nasal flow air insufflator
      (Fisher & Paykel Airvo 2 device) with same amount of oxygen supplement (1 liters per minute).
