      Chicago-area high schools. The RS+ curriculum will be delivered to 9th grade students in the
      target schools and classrooms during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years. The
      curriculum's 12 sessions will be delivered over a period of about 12 weeks during the winter
      quarter, with an average of one session taught per week.The lessons cover topics such as
      personal values, the principals of smart relationships, communication and conflict
      management, and sexual decision making. Using a three-arm randomized controlled trial design,
      this study will test the effectiveness of offering RS+ as part of the regular school
      curriculum on the students' knowledge of healthy relationships, their communication skills,
      and the characteristics of their current relationship. In addition to testing the effects of
      the curriculum, the study will also test the effects of providing enhanced training and
      support to facilitators.
