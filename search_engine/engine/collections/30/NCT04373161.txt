      being discharged to home from an emergency department (ED) or outpatient testing center.
      Patients will be provided a portable fingertip home pulse oximeter that measures peripheral
      oxygen saturation (SpO2). Patients will be instructed to check their resting home oxygen
      saturation three times per day and record these findings. They will be instructed to return
      to the emergency room for sustained oxygen saturation below 92% or if their symptoms are
      worsening and they feel they need medical attention. Patients will be called once daily by
      the research team to collect data in real time. Patients will be monitored for seven days,
      and at the end of the seven day period, they will return the pulse oximeter as well as a
      spreadsheet of their home oximetry readings. The purpose is to see if home pulse oximetry
      identifies disease progression and need for hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.
      Additionally, there will be analysis of trends in home oximetry readings wand predictors of
      morbidity and mortality.
