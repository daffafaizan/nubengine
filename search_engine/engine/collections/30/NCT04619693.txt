    
      This is a prospective multicenter cohort of patients treated with the usual standard of care
      including systemic corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone 6 mg / day.

      INCLUSION (D0): The patients are examined on the day of their hospital admission. After an
      initial eligibility check and if interest is expressed by the patient, a specific inclusion
      visit is carried out.

      FOLLOW-UP: Patients are clinically evaluated at least twice a day (Clinical examination,
      SpO2, vital signs) during hospitalization. Chest computed tomography and SARS-CoV-2 serology
      are performed on D0. Viral load is evaluated by the polymerase chain reaction which allowed
      the diagnosis of covid-19 in the 48 hours preceding D0 and on D7. The evaluation of
      conventional biomarkers of interest (blood count, hepatic assessment (ASAT, ALAT), serum
      creatinine, albuminemia, CRP, D-Dimers, LDH, Ferritin) are carried out on D0 (before the 1st
      dose of corticosteroids), D2 , J4 and J7. The evaluation of biomarkers of interest evaluated
      by mass spectrometry is carried out on D0 and D7 +/- 2 days.

      A follow-up call on D28 is carried out (telephone call, collection of vital status and
      hospitalizations).
