      could reduce the initial viral burden and subsequent decline in immune functions, and could
      prolong not only the time to development of AIDS but also the time to initiation of chronic
      antiretroviral therapy.

      Patients are randomized to receive either zidovudine or placebo daily for 24 weeks. Patients
      are followed until development of an AIDS-related opportunistic infection or malignancy.
      After week 24, patients meeting standard prescribing criteria may start FDA-approved anti-HIV
      therapies. After study week 48, patients may co-enroll on another clinical trial to receive
      experimental therapy.
