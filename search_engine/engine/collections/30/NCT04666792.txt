      integrate PrEP provision within a combination HIV prevention package in 12 family planning
      clinics in Kisumu, Kenya- a region with an HIV prevalence of up to 28% among young women. The
      project will optimize and sustain PrEP delivery with existing family planning staff,
      supported through training and ongoing technical assistance. The investigators will
      rigorously evaluate program reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and
      impact using validated implementation science frameworks and how clinics build new efficient
      delivery systems.
