      interventions (SMI and HEI) to improve BP control.

      Veterans with uncontrolled hypertension (n=533) will be randomized equally to 3 groups: 1)
      The SMI will use the Transtheoretical model (TTM) as the unifying framework. Veterans will
      receive TTM stage-matched counseling for exercise, diet, and medications via monthly
      counseling sessions. A social worker (SW) will assess each participant's behavior and deliver
      the appropriate tailored SMI based on their stage of change, decisional balance,
      self-efficacy and the skills model questions. 2) The HEI group receives monthly telephone
      calls by a SW during which they will receive education about hypertension management. 3) The
      UC group participates in all the in-person visits but does not receive monthly calls.

      There will be an initial 6-month active intervention phase followed by a 6 month monitoring
      phase to assess sustainability. All participants will visit the VAMC's at baseline and at 3,
      6, and 12 months. Outcomes of interest include BP; adherence (to diet, exercise and
      medications); quality of life; satisfaction; acceptability; cost and cost-effectiveness.
      Patients will be blinded to which of the intervention arms (SMI or HEI) they are in, SW's
      will be blinded to patient's BP and staff measuring outcomes will be blinded to study
      assignment. The study will be analyzed using longitudinal data analysis methods using an
      intention to treat strategy.
