      (IF) aimed at reducing insulin resistance (IR) in insulin resistant breast cancer survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate an effect size of the effectiveness of the METFIT Program in reducing IR in
      insulin resistant breast cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo METFIT program for 16 sessions over 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 40 days.
