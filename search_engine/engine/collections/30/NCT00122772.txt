      with and without HDR brachytherapy (2 fractions of 9 Gy versus 4 fractions of 7 Gy) with and
      without weekly Cisplatin (40 mg/sqm) The overall objective was to test the clinical outcome
      and toxicity of a resource-sparing schedule of radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy
      treatment for cervix cancer, to detect molecular markers that will predict tumor
      control/resistance and to establish whether E6 and E7 viral proteins predict cellular
      radiosensitivity in oxic and hypoxic conditions in vitro and tumor control/resistance in
      vivo. A new component of the CRP was added, for which the objective is to optimize the data
      capture, provide more details of normal tissue outcomes following cancer treatments in
      developing countries and validate this approach using patients participating in the ongoing
      CRP. This will be achieved by exploring data capture using the questionnaire template on a
      computer in face-to-face interviews ("active" data collection) and comparing it with standard
      data collection obtained from the clinical notes ("passive" data collection) during the still
      ongoing CRP E3.30.24. The method of data collection will be chosen at random for each case
      stratified by centre. The reason for using an ongoing CRP is that it will test the usefulness
      of the new method and validate it in a multicentre study. During the performance of the new
      CRP, the same institutions as for E3.30.24 will be engaged.
