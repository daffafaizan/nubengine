      I. To identify neighborhoods with disproportionately high rates of advanced prostate cancer
      and describe patient- and neighborhood-level risk factors associated with the high-risk
      neighborhoods.

      II. To develop, using a mixed methods approach, a targeted educational intervention about
      prostate cancer for men who live in high risk neighborhoods.

      III. To test the impact of the targeted intervention on levels of knowledge, anxiety, and
      informed decision making about prostate cancer (PCa) screening.

      IV. To observe the rates of PCa screening in the intervention and control groups.
