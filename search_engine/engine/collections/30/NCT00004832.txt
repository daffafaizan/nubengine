      randomized to receive 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP) or placebo orally 3 times daily for 5 days,
      after which treatment is discontinued and patients are observed for at least 24 hours. At the
      end of the blinded study, patients may then elect to take open label DAP orally 3 times daily
      for 6 months; those who do so are monitored for clinical effects and side effects for at
      least 6 months.
