    
      The study is a phase I, single center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized,
      ascending single doses study in healthy male and female volunteers.

      The design consists of a double blind comparison of the test compound versus placebo in which
      the dose is increased in successive treatment periods.

      Dose was escalated in order to achieve enough safety information on an interval of doses
      possibly encompassing both the effective dose and the maximum tolerated dose (defined as the
      highest dose devoid of any clinical signs/symptoms).

      The study has been terminated after Part A (single ascending doses) so the methodology was
      revised accordingly.
