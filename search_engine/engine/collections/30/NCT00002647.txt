        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of benzoporphyrin monoacid ring A in patients with
           refractory brain tumors undergoing cavitary photoillumination photodynamic therapy.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on neurotoxicity, clinical state, imaging changes,
           and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to tumor location
      (posterior fossa tumors vs all other brain tumors).

      Patients receive benzoporphyrin monoacid ring A (BPD-MA) IV preoperatively. Approximately 3
      hours after BPD-MA administration, patients undergo craniotomy with photoillumination of the
      tumor. Patients with tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter also undergo gross tumor resection.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BPD-MA until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose immediately preceding that at which 2 of
      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Three additional patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 4 and 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
