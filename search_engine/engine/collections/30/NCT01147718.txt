      digoxin when coadministered with albiglutide in healthy adult subjects. Subjects will receive
      a single dose of digoxin on Day 1 followed by 5 weekly subcutaneously injected doses of
      albiglutide and a second single dose of digoxin on Day 38. To determine the plasma
      pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin after drug administration alone and after multiple
      doses of albiglutide, blood samples will be collected after each dose of digoxin.
