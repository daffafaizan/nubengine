    
      Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC1031 is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, multi-center study. Qualified
      subjects, who have KRAS WT colorectal cancer will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either:

      Arm 1: Imprime PGG and cetuximab or Arm 2: Cetuximab

      Approximately 795 subjects will be randomized into the study. Dosing will occur in 6-week
      cycles. Imprime PGG will be dosed at 4 mg/kg and will be administered weekly in each cycle
      (Weeks 1-6/Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36) preceding the administration of cetuximab (Arm 1
      only). The initial cetuximab dose (both arms) will be 400 mg/m2 on Cycle 1/Day 1 and
      subsequent doses will be 250 mg/m2 administered weekly in each cycle (Weeks 1-6/Days 1, 8,
      15, 22, 29, and 36).

      Subjects will be dosed until progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or discontinuation of
      study drug for other reasons; e.g., safety. Following completion of the treatment period of
      the study, subjects will be monitored for survival until death or loss to follow-up. Tumor
      measurements and determination of tumor responses will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1.
      Safety, PK, quality of life, and biomarker parameters will also be assessed.
