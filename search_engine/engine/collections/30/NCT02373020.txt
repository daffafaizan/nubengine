      cancer as well as from the colon of the healthy controls. Culture, genotyping and virulence
      of EPEC were done using (nutrient broth culture, and PCR). Strains biochemically identified
      as E. coli were selected from the surface of a MacConkey's plate and were serogrouped by
      slide agglutination tests
