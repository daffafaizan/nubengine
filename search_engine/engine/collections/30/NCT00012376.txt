      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of continuous intravenous infusion bryostatin-1
      when given in combination with GM-CSF.

      II. To describe and quantify the frequency of toxicity of the combination of continuous
      intravenous infusion bryostatin-1 and subcutaneously administered GM-CSF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on the
      differentiation and cell cycle distribution of myeloid cells in vivo.

      II. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on T lymphocyte
      populations.

      III. To assess the pharmacokinetics of continuous infusion bryostatin-1.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bryostatin 1.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease stabilization or improvement may
      continue treatment for up to 12 courses.

      Cohorts of 2 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 30% of patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
