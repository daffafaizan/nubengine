      hepatitis B infection who were less than 28 weeks pregnant and not treated with nucleos(t)ide
      analogues during pregnancy. The investigators recommended those pregnant women with HBV DNA >
      2*10^6 IU/ml to receive nucleos(t)ide analogues from 28 weeks of pregnancy to delivery.
      Patients who agreed the antiviral treatment would assigned to the treatment group and those
      who declined it were assigned to the control group with high HBV DNA level. Meanwhile, those
      pregnant women with HBV DNA < 2*10^6 IU/ml was assigned as the control group with low HBV DNA
      level. All infants would be instructed to receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B virus
      immunoglobulin within 24 hours after birth, defined as the standard immunoprophylaxis
      strategy and encouraged to receive immunoprophylaxis within 2 hours after birth, defined as
      the aggressive immunoprophylaxis strategy. Umbilical cord blood were collected to determine
      the HBV serological markers and HBV DNA level. Children were followed every three to four
      years until December 2018.
