      conventional antipsychotics haloperidol or zuclopentixol in the treatment of an acute manic
      or mixed episode of bipolar disorder. Efficacy is defined as time to remission, as measured
      by the total scores of the Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), MADRS-S, and Clinical Global
      Impression - Bipolar (CGI-BP). Time from baseline to remission is defined as the primary
      efficacy measure. Remission is defined as a Y-MRS score <=12 AND a MADRS-S score <=12 AND
      CGI-BP = 1 or 2.

      Secondary efficacy assessments will include time from baseline to

        -  Response, as defined as a reduction of Y-MRS score greater than or equal to 50% compared
           to baseline

        -  Relapse of mania, as defined as a Y-MRS score >= 16 AND CGI-BP >2 after having met the
           criteria for remission

        -  Switch into depression, as defined as a MADRS-S score >=17 AND fulfilled criteria for
           Major Depression as self-assessed by DSRS.
