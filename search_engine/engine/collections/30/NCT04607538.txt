      years old with patellar instability* (PI). Special focus will be on Trochlear Dysplasia (TD),
      a condition where the femoral trochlea has a dysplastic shape and lacks the lateral support
      of the patella. The diagnosis will be set by MRI of the knees and is in this study defined as
      the presence of one of the following: Crossing sign on a true lateral x-ray, lateral
      trochlear inclination angle < 11 degrees or a trochlear depth < 3 mm.

      The hypothesis is that abnormal values in the following measures will be associated with
      increased risk of patellar dislocation and worse patient reported outcome: Caton-Deschamps
      index, Lateral Trochlear Inclination, Trochlear Facet Asymmetry, Trochlear Depth, Tuberostias
      Tibia - Trochlear Groove distance, Patello-trochlear index and Tuberositas Tibia - Posterior
      Cruciate Ligament distance.

      Furthermore, we expect pivoting sports to be a behavioral risk factor.

      The primary endpoint is measured by the number of patellar dislocations or near-dislocation
      the patient experiences (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

      The secondary endpoint is the patient reported outcome measures.

      *Definition: Patellar instability (PI) is the overall term encompassing both 1) recurrent
      patella dislocations and 2) recurrent episodes of a clear sensation of the kneecap riding on
      the outer border/aspect of the knee before popping back in track. The episodes must be a
      severe complaint for the patient. PI usually follows after a first time patellar dislocation.
