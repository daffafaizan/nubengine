      analgesia could lower their side effects (rate of motor block, nausea and emesis during
      labor, maternal hypotension, maternal fever) and improve the duration of the second part of
      the labor, and the new-born adaptation to child-birth and during the first 24 hours. The use
      of instruments for assisted vaginal delivery and the needs to perform emergency cesarean
      could also be impacted.

      The efficacy of the dexamethasone will be assessed by the hourly Ropivacaine consumption
      (milligrams/hour) measured from randomization time to the end of epidural analgesia.
