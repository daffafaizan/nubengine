      described in an attempt to avoid the blind passage of the trochars through the groin & the
      adductor muscles and consequently reducing the incidence & severity of postoperative leg
      pain. The obvious advantages would be shorter hospital stay, early recovery, early resumption
      of day to day activities & earlier return to work. A number of small prospective audits and
      case-series have been presented in international conferences reporting on the safety &
      outcomes for these procedures. However all these studies were for preliminary reports for
      proof of concept and therefore the studies populations were 15-70 women with short term
      follow-up of 2-3 month9-11.These studies have shown low perioperative complication rates:
      bladder injury 0-1%, vaginal erosion 1-3% & one study showing 1.3% pain at 6 weeks follow-up.
      The patient reported success rates were 77-93% at 2-3 month follow-up9-12.

      Objectives:

        1. Establish the feasibility of the "Single incision sub-urethral tapes" to be done under
           local anaesthesia.

        2. The feasibility of randomisation to the standard surgical treatment TVT-O / TVT.

        3. To compare the surgical approach in this relatively new procedure against the standard
           procedures as regard: Peri-operative complication rates, Postoperative pain, Time to
           discharge from the hospital,

        4. To compare the outcomes as regard: Patient-reported cure rates, Patient satisfaction,
           Impact on Quality of life (QoL) and sexual function at 3 month & 1 -year follow-up. The
           objective cure rates will be assessed at 3 month follow-up.

      Design:

      A pilot prospective randomised study within participating urogynaecology units of the
      "Scottish Pelvic Floor Network".
