      with serious mental illness to test the hypothesis that intervention participants will have
      higher rates of smoking abstinence at 18 months than participants in the treatment as usual
      arm. The intervention includes group and individual smoking cessation and weight management
      counseling tailored by a participant's readiness to quit, pharmacotherapy with either
      varenicline or buproprion plus nicotine replacement therapy prescribed in the community
      clinic, exercise, and text messaging supporting health behavior change.
