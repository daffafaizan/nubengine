    
      In this study, the investigators seek to investigate biological aspects in patients with
      colorectal cancer liver metastasis undergoing treatment with Selective Internal Radiation
      Therapy, by translational analysis of biological samples.

      SIRT will be conducted as per standard procedure at Aarhus University Hospital. Translational
      blood samples will be drawn pre-treatment and during follow up.

      The total cell free DNA level will be quantified in all samples. The samples will be analysed
      for tumour specific mutations such as the KRAS, BRAF and NRAS oncogenes.

      The investigators expect to include up to 30 patients.

      This is a purely observational translational study. Results will be analysed in relation to
      outcome data.

      The study is conducted in collaboration with:

      Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aarhus University Hospital Department of
      Radiology, Aarhus University Hospital Department of Nuclear Medicine, Aarhus University
      Hospital
