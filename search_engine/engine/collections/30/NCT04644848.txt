      lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a standard of care in patients with clinically negative
      axillae. Various methods have been investigated to decrease the false negative rate of SLNB.
      Ultrasonography is an established tool for preoperative axillary staging. The diagnostic
      accuracy of B-mode ultrasonographic criteria and of US-guided FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration
      Cytology) has been described in the literature and its role in preoperative axillary staging
      has been emphasized.

      Ultrasonographic aspiration of suspicious axillary nodes are widely used to identify axillary
      metastases and obviate the need for SLNB. Previous studies retrospectively examined the
      concordance of ultrasonographic identification of suspicious lymph nodes with subsequent SLNB
      results. However, ultrasonographic axillary staging have not been prospectively compared to
      SLNB. In addition, concomitant ultrasonographic and SLNB are thought to increase the overall
      accuracy of axillary staging.

      In this study, the investigators will perform preoperative ultrasonographic axillary
      evaluation and tattooing of suspicious lymph nodes followed by SLNB with methylene blue
      technique. Head-to-head and node-to-node comparison of ultrasonographic and surgical staging
      will be conducted.

      Specific aims

        1. Determination of the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasonic guided tattooing of
           suspicious axillary lymph nodes.

        2. Determination of node-to-node concordance of ultrasonographic tattooing relative to blue
           dye SLNB.
