      pancreatoscopy in patients undergoing partial pancreatic resection for the treatment of
      Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) as it pertains to detection of discontinuous
      (skip) lesions in the remnant pancreas. A secondary study objective is to generate a
      hypothesis for a subsequent randomized controlled trial comparing diagnostic accuracy of
      intra-operative pancreatoscopy and SpyBiteâ„¢ with the diagnostic accuracy of intra-operative
      frozen section in patients undergoing resection
