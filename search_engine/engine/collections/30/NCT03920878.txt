      significant vision loss and disability without medical intervention. Unfortunately, diabetic
      patients, particularly those with diabetic macular edema (DME), experience poorer visual
      outcomes after undergoing cataract surgery compared to non-diabetics. Reasons for this is
      multifactorial but includes an increased risk in the development of post-operative cystoid
      macular edema, and exacerbation of baseline DME. This poses a significant challenge in
      managing concomitant DME and visually-significant cataracts.

      Goals of the study are to evaluate how peri-operative versus intra-operative anti-VEGF
      intravitreous injections affect visual acuity (BCVA) in patients with persistent diabetic
      macular edema who are undergoing cataract surgery; and to evaluate how peri-operative versus
      intra-operative anti-VEGF intravitreous injections affect OCT CSF thickness and total number
      of postoperative injections in patients with diabetic macular edema who are undergoing
      cataract surgery.
