      based treatment to improve vision based on new principles of visual psychophysics.
      NeuroVision NVC Vision Correction Technology is a non-invasive, patient-specific treatment
      based on visual stimulation and facilitation of neural connections responsible for vision.
      The treatment involves a programmed series of interactive visual exercises in front of a
      computer, and does not involve any form of prescription medications, or surgical treatment.

      The technology has been proven in both Israel and Singapore's pilot study to work for myopia
      -1.50D and below.

      This study is a clinical trial for Singapore Ministry of Defence personnel to evaluate the
      efficacy of this treatment beyond the proven myopia range. There will be 2 phases in the
      study; Phase 1 will include low myopes from -0.50D to -1.50D while Phase 2 covers moderate
      myopes from -1.75D to -3.00D. Subjects will be randomised into treatment and placebo group in
      the ratio of 3:1.

      A randomized double masked controlled trial conducted in 2 Phases:

      Phase I will involve 140 study subjects with low myopia randomized in a 3:1 randomization to
      receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment.

      It is assumed that the withdrawal rate will not exceed 20%, so that at least 112 study
      subjects will complete the treatment phase.

      Interim analysis with stopping rule will be conducted after 3/4 of the patients complete the
      treatment phase.

      Phase II will involve 180 study subjects with moderate myopia randomized in a 3:1
      randomization to receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment.

      The 2 phases will be separate RCTs, with recruitment of Phase II subjects subsequent to
      completion of Phase I NVC treatments.
