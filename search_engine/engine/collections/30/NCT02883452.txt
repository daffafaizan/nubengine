      to the intravenous regimen where subcutaneous infliximab injection typically takes less than
      2 minutes. The availability of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab would increase the
      treatment options available to patients, particularly those wishing to self-administer their
      therapy. This Phase 1 randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group study is designed
      to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety between CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in patients
      with active CD and active UC.
