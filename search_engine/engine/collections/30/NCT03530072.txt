           stratify pediatric oncology patients admitted with febrile neutropenia. This will
           provide preliminary data for a larger study which would randomize patients to early
           discharge vs. usual care.

        2. Evaluate the Klaasen and SPOG clinical decision rules with and without the Karius Assay
           to predict patients at low risk for adverse infectious outcomes during admission.
           Adverse infectious outcome will be defined as: positive blood or urine culture,
           radiographic evidence of infection, admission to the intensive care unit or death.

        3. Model potential cost savings of early discharge for patients deemed low risk for an
           adverse infectious outcome.
