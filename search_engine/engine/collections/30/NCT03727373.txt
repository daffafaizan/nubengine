      from the patients' point of view if and how the collection of data with regard to pain,
      caused by illness or treatment, can be optimized using health technology solutions. A health
      technology solution could for example be an app for registering the intensity and
      localization of pain. The aim of this study is to examine, if such a solution would be
      accepted by patients with acute or chronic pain and how a fitting solution should be designed
      to meet the patients' requirements. Existing methods for pain measurement as well as
      possibilities for the development of new methods will be examined and evaluated during the
      interviews.

      To arguable this issue the interviews comprise different topics like:

        -  the patients pain experience in everyday life, e.g. how the patients cope with pain in
           everyday life and how and if this is documented;

        -  experiences with and the thought of regular pain recording;

        -  an evaluation if patients tend to be willing to record their pain using technological
           devices by themselves or rather with support of healthcare professionals.

      It is the aim to use the results of this study for the development of a new and improved
      version of pain registration. The results of the study will be summarized in a report and
      handed over to a startup company. Thereupon the startup company has the possibility to
      develop a technological solution that represents the patients' need at its best.
