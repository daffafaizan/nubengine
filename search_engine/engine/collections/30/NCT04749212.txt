    
      Objectives: To evaluate the incidence and magnitude of perioperative N-terminal pro brain
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin I (Tn I) elevation in patients
      undergoing pulmonary resection and its predictive value for cardiovascular complications.
      Methodology: Prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study in patients >45 years
      undergoing elective thoracic surgery for lung resection. Cardiac biomarkers Tn I and
      NT-proBNP will be measured preoperatively and at postoperative days 1 and 2. Risk score for
      major cardiovascular postoperative complications will be calculated depending of both
      biomarkers perioperative changes.
