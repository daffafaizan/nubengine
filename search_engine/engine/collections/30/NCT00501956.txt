      malnutrition. 7% have a protein catabolic rate less than 0,6 g/kgBW and day.

      The conventional treatment of malnutrition include dietetic counseling, psychologic advice
      and giving additional oral nutrients.In many cases this kind of therapy is uneffective. If
      supplementary enteral nutrition is used, the additional intake of water has to be taken into
      consideration.

      IDPN is a mode of treatment by which disadvantages of enteral nutrition and fluid overload of
      the patients can be avoided.During each dialysis session nutrients can be given and
      additional water simultaneously can be removed by ultrafiltration.

      Some publications have shown that the catabolic state of the patients can be converted into
      an anabolic state. There are only small randomized studies showing the positive effect of
      IDPN.

      In this german multicenter study malnourished hemodialysis patients are randomized into two
      groups. One group is treated with IDPN during each dialysis session for 16 weeks followed by
      12 weeks of follow-up without IDPN. The control-group does not receive IDPN.

      The parameters of metabolism are: Albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, phase angle alpha
      (bioimpedance), proteincatabolic rate (formal urea kinetics), BMI and subjective global
      assessment (SGA score).
