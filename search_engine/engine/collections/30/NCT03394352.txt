      activity may increase the chance of hypoglycemia. The aims of this study is to make better
      bolus decisions by integrating knowledge about daily physical activity (PA) into bolus
      decisions. It is expected to decrease risk of hypoglycemia related to previous PA and provide
      better glucose control. The idea is to first obtain a carbohydrate ratio that is optimized
      around the everyday activity level of the patient and then adjust boluses when the activity
      for the day is different (above or below) than their regular activity level.
