      random assignment will be done to one of two groups by a list generated by a computer
      program, much like flipping a coin. One group of subjects will be assigned to an effective
      muscle stimulation group and the second group will be assigned to a group that will receive
      ineffective stimulation (Control or Sham). Muscle stimulation will be performed with a Niveus
      medical stimulator on both quadriceps muscle groups for 30 minutes, five days per week. The
      stimulator will be individually adjusted in terms of intensity of stimulation to elicit a
      visible or palpable quadriceps muscle contraction. Four contractions per minute will be
      performed for a total of approximately 120 contractions per 30 minute treatment. Isometric
      Muscle strength testing: All subjects will undergo isometric muscle strength testing. Maximal
      isometric twitch strength will be measured by placing the subjects' dominant leg in a frame
      that will hold the knee at 60Â°. A cuff will be placed around the patient's ankle and will be
      connected to an electronic dynamometer with the cable. A magnetic nerve stimulator will be
      used over the body of the quadriceps muscle to stimulate the muscle.
