    
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the combination of
      elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (ERd) as induction therapy and the ability of the
      combination to facilitate the start of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in
      transplant-eligible patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. In addition to induction,
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ERd as consolidation and maintenance therapy in
      these patients will be observed.

      Eligible patients will undergo four 28-day cycles of an induction regimen of elotuzumab,
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. Following completion of 4 cycles of induction therapy, all
      patients will undergo standard mobilization, collection of stem cells, and then ASCT using a
      melphalan conditioning regimen as per institutional guidelines.

      Toxicity evaluation will be interrupted during the stem cell procedure and will resume with
      the onset of consolidation. Adverse events will be collected, however, from the end of
      induction up to mobilization.

      Consolidation therapy will begin 70 to 120 days following ASCT and will consist of four
      28-day cycles of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. All patients that do not
      experience progressive disease will begin maintenance therapy of elotuzumab, lenalidomide,
      and dexamethasone. The duration of maintenance will be 24 months.
