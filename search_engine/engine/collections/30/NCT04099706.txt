      caused by reactivation of a latent VZV-infection in the sensory ganglia.

      Clinically the condition is characterized by a painful, unilateral, vesicular rash. Pain is
      the most prominent symptom in around 90% of patients. In 10% of patients, this pain remains
      and becomes chronic.

      Post-herpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain syndrome that occurs after the dermal manifestation
      disappears. Treatment is complex and mainly topical or systemic. For many patients, this is
      not sufficient and they live with constant pain.

      Autologous fat grafting has shown promise in treating several different painful conditions
      such as post-mastectomy pain syndrome, painful scars, etc. Our previous pilot study
      (NCT03584061) investigating the effect of autologous fat grafting on PHN, showed a marked
      reduction in pain with half of the patients being pain-free after the procedure.

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that autologous fat grafting is more
      effective than a sham operation in treating PHN.
