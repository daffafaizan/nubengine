      fluoropyrimidines, this trial assessing S-1 with Oxaliplatin plus Irinotecan is warranted for
      future investigations (Phase II-III). The primary objectives are to determine the Maximal
      Tolerated Dose (MTD), the Dose Limitant Toxicities (DLTs) and the safety profile of S-1
      combined with fixed doses of Irinotecan (SIRI schedule) and fixed doses of Irinotecan and
      Oxaliplatin (SIRINOX schedule).
