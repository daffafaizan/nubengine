    
      This is a prospective implementation science study that will test 4 different approaches to
      increase colorectal cancer screening in a local primary care setting that provides services
      to individuals who are under-resourced. The interventions will include reminders from primary
      care providers with and without additional information and/or services to help complete
      colorectal cancer screening. A review of electronic medical records will be used to identify
      baseline information assessing risk factors and personal and family CRC history. For arm 3 of
      the study, participants may elect to enroll in our existing health navigation program. If so,
      additional baseline information will be collected, including information on Social
      Determinants of Health (SDOH). For arm 4 of the study, a questionnaire will be used to assess
      knowledge about colorectal cancer screening. The questionnaire will be repeated after the
      intervention (informational video). For all arms of the study, the primary outcome
      (engagement on CRC screening, receipt of CRC screening, results of CRC screening) will be
      collected through EPIC.
