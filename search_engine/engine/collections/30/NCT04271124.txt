      limitation which is not fully reversible.Not only the long-term exposition to noxious
      particles and gases contributes to the development of COPD, but also many others factors such
      as genetics and cigarette smoking. Cigarettes are harmful and contribute to different extra
      pulmonary disorders. Although COPD affects lungs some extrapulmonary manifestations are
      prescribed such as muscle dysfunction, abnormal respiratory muscles and systemic
      inflammation. Indeed, the systemic inflammation[6, 8] is considered as a key process in the
      pathogenesis of COPD. It involves different cells and molecules; high levels of circulating
      of white blood cells, increased plasma c-reactive proteins (CRP), interleukin 6 (Il6) have
      been reported in.those patients.Likewise, systemic inflammation could worsen the
      comorbidities (cardiovascular, osteoporosis..) and may lead to the exercise limitation.
