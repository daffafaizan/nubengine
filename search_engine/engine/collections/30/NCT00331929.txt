    
      Kiryat Tivon is located close to a major industrial zone. The aim of the study is to evaluate
      the health status of children living in K. Tivon.

      The health status will be evaluated while using health questionnaires and spirometry.

      Objective: To evaluate the respiratory health of K. Tivon children with comparatives, with
      respect to local air pollution levels.

      Material and Methods: All the school children from K. Tivon (1800 children) will be included
      in the study, after both parents and the children (above 12 years of age) will sign an
      informed consent form.

      First step: A health questionnaire (based on Hebrew version of ISAAC questionnaire) will be
      filled in by the parents.

      Second step: Spirometry checking of the children.

      In parallel, air pollution levels will be measured and provided by a network of ground
      monitoring stations maintained by the Haifa District Municipality Association for the
      Environment (HDMAE). The station provides half-hourly measurement of mean concentrations of
      gaseous (NOX, SO2, O3) and particular (PM 10) pollutants over the entire investigation
      window. Additional meteorological data are also collected.

      Risk maps: Using a GIS platform, we are developing a multi-layer risk mapping procedure which
      accounts for ambient concentrations of selected pollutants and the heterogenic spatial
      distribution of several demographic and socio-economic indexes in the region.

      The prevalence of pulmonary disease will be evaluated according to the risk maps.
