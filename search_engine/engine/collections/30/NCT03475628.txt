      will be administered according to approved label. Approximately 57 subjects located in Greece
      will be enrolled in the study.

      Patients shall receive treatment until disease progression, physician decision, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (whichever occurs first). Survival status and data
      of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment will be collected post-treatment.

      Primary and secondary variables related to bone disease markers will be evaluated every other
      cycle of therapy. Disease evaluations will occur monthly and consist mainly of measurements
      of myeloma proteins. Other parameters may include bone marrow examinations, skeletal surveys,
      assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and measurements of serum calcium corrected for
      albumin, and Î²2- microglobulin and albumin. Assessment of myeloma response and disease
      progression will be conducted in accordance with the modified IMWG response criteria
