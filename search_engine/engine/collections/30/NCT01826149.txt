      on patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery. The patients will receive infusion
      remifentanil 0.5mcg/kg/min with different target-site propofol concentration namely 1.0ng/ml,
      2.0ng/ml and 3.0ng/ml. Tissue Doppler Imaging by transesophageal echocardiography will be
      done to assess the changes in cardiac function.
