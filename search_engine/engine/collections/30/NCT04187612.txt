      OSA in pregnancy. Obesity is increasingly prevalent This study will evaluate a novel method
      of screening for OSA in the obese pregnant population, thereby treating this condition
      reducing the ill effects to mother and fetus.

      This will be a prospective observational cohort study. Eligible participants will be
      approached for consent during their third-trimester antenatal all-day clinic visit. Body
      water will be measured by connecting electrodes to participants hands, feet and neck whilst
      lying supine for approximately 15 minutes.

      Data on patient demographics, BMI, medical conditions, water body composition and indicators
      of OSA (breathing pattern and oxygen levels during sleep) will be collected, as well as data
      from patients' sleep tests as ordered by their physician.
