      negatively affect wellbeing, including reduced confidence and social isolation. These
      psychosocial outcomes of aphasia are not sufficiently met by healthcare services:
      improvements in language function do not appear to lead to improvements in wellbeing.
      National clinical guidelines for stroke reflect this observation and highlight the need for
      community integration and participation of people with aphasia. This research is about
      singing groups for people with aphasia (SPA) and is intended to address this need by focusing
      on the wellbeing and social participation needs of people with aphasia after stroke.

      The Investigators engagement activities and early development project provided strong impetus
      for the proposed study: people with aphasia repeatedly told the investigators that singing in
      groups may help the participants to reconnect with society, and that this will improve
      wellbeing.

      The investigators have planned a pilot study that will allow an assessment of the extent to
      which the study processes and the singing groups themselves are feasible to run and are
      acceptable to participants. The information from this work will help the investigators to
      decide whether to conduct a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) which would be a fair
      test of whether SPA can improve the lives of individuals with post stroke aphasia.
