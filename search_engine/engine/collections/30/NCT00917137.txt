      TBNA showed the highest sensitivity in the diagnostic bronchoscopic approach to peripheral
      pulmonary lesions, as compared to the other available sampling techniques (transbronchial
      biopsy, brushing, washings). However, the Authors conclude that the data regarding TBNA in
      this setting deserve cautious interpretation because of the limited number of studies and the
      large differences in sample size). We designed the present study to assess the performance
      characteristics of TBNA, alone and in comparison with those of transbronchial biopsy, in the
      diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions.
