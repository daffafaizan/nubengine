      elevated pollution particle levels. Researchers believe that particulate pollutants can
      exacerbate allergy and inflammation and affect asthma and allergy prevalence. In an urban
      setting such as the Los Angeles Basin, particles generated by vehicular traffic are thought
      to be important risk factors. Recently, the Environmental Health Centre of Southern
      California confirmed that there is a strong association between traffic near homes and
      schools and development of asthma. This study will help researchers describe the effects of
      various size pollution particles in causing inflammation in the nose.

      There will be a total of 20 study visits. The study procedures include physical exams,
      symptom score for nose, nose washes and nose challenges with particulate matter. The
      particulates will be given in a random order and include the following: saline (sterile salt
      water), inert carbon particles (Carbon Black), diesel exhaust particles (DEP), small (fine)
      particles or very small (ultrafine) particles. These last two (fine and ultrafine) particles
      are obtained from concentrated normal Los Angeles air. The particulate will be sprayed into
      the nose with a standard nasal spray.
