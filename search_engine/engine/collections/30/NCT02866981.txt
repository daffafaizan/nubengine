    
      Subjects will be given a consultation with physician investigators in the department of one
      of the study investigators, who will introduce the study if the subject is potentially
      eligible.

      Information collected at initial assessment:

        -  Quality of life survey (FACT-Br)

        -  History and Physical exam (to include KPS, disease status on most recent non-CNS
           imaging, chemotherapy history, age).

        -  Measurement of walking pace: patient will walk a pre- measured 6 meters, patient is to
           be instructed to walk at a normal pace. The time required to travel this distance will
           be recorded. For patients that are wheelchair bound or otherwise immobile, the pace will
           be recorded as '0'.

        -  Neurocognitive testing (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)

        -  MRI scan with contrast (must be within 6 weeks)

      Observation and Follow-up Visits:

        -  Patients will be seen at 6 weeks and then every 2 months for follow-up (with physical
           exam) with repeat MRI with contrast at that time

        -  FACT-Br survey to be filled out at each follow-up

        -  Neurocognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)

      Treatment for Progression:

        -  Progression is defined as: Increase in size to > 1 cm (> 2.0 for patients being treated
           with targeted therapy); Interval growth of 0.4 cm in 6-8 weeks; Development of edema or
           increase in edema; Development of symptoms from CNS lesion; Patient preference

        -  Patients that meet criteria for treatment will be treated at discretion of treating
           physician; options can include whole brain radiation, radiosurgery, surgery.

      The study does not provide financial or other compensation to subjects
