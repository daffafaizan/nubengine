    
      The MRI Study is a prospective, multi-center, clinical study designed to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the Accent MRI System in a patient population indicated for implant of a
      pacemaker within and outside of the MRI environment. The study consisted of two phases, a
      Lead Safety Phase which evaluated the safety of the Tendril MRI lead, and an MRI Phase which
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of the Accent MRI pacemaker system in an MRI environment.

      The safety and efficacy of the Accent MRI pacemaker and Tendril MRI lead will be evaluated as
      described below:

      Lead Safety Safety of the Tendril MRI™ lead will be evaluated in terms of freedom from right
      atrial (RA) and right ventricle (RV) lead-related complications at implant to 2 months (acute
      timeframe), and at the 2 through the 12 month visit (chronic timeframe).

      MRI Safety The safety of the Accent MRI™ system will be evaluated in terms of freedom from
      MRI scan related complications in the month following the MRI scan.

      Lead Efficacy Efficacy of the Tendril MRI™ lead will be evaluated in terms of the change in
      atrial and ventricular capture and sensing thresholds before and after the MRI scan.

      MRI Efficacy Efficacy of the Tendril MR lead will be evaluated in terms of the change in
      bipolar atrial and ventricular capture and sensing thresholds before and after the MRI scan.

      Secondary Endpoints Safety Safety of the Accent MRI™ system will be evaluated in terms of
      freedom from system-related complications through the 12 month visit.

      Efficacy Efficacy of the Tendril MRI™ lead will be evaluated in terms of the atrial and
      ventricular capture thresholds at the MRI Visit.
