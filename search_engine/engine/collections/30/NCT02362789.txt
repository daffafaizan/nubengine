      the PASI response will be performed. Patients who achieve a PASI reduction of less than 98
      percent will complete the study at Week 16 and be referred to routine clinical care for
      psoriasis by the investigator. Patients who achieve extensive remission (PASI reduction by
      98-100 percent) at Week 16 will enter the randomized withdrawal phase (blinded) where they
      will be randomized to receive either secukinumab or matching placebo and will complete the
      study at Week 32.
