      called Computer Intervention Authoring Software (CIAS) in the Emergency Department for
      discharge education on proper child car restraint safety. The investigators hypothesize that
      tablet-based, individually-tailored discharge instructions are more effective than current
      standard, one-size-fits-all, printed discharge instructions. This is a randomized,
      controlled, non-blinded trial of a convenience sample of 200 children age 0-21 years old who
      present to the Hasbro Children's Hospital Emergency Department by car and have access to a
      smartphone and/or email. Patients will be randomized to receive either (a) a brief
      tablet-based questionnaire followed by standard, paper discharge instructions or (b) a brief
      tablet-based questionnaire followed by the intervention - CIAS, a computer program that
      allows families to interact with a tablet computer to receive educational information
      customized to the patient. Children 13 years old and above will answer questions themselves
      instead of having their parent/guardian answer for them. Both group will be offered
      information for the Lifespan Injury Prevention Center's Kohl's Car Seat Program. Both groups
      will complete a questionnaire on the usefulness of their discharge education. One week after
      discharge, participants in both groups will receive an automatic text message and/or email
      message with a link to a web-based survey that will assess: knowledge of appropriate car
      restraints and whether the parent/patient engaged in any behavioral changes regarding child
      car restraint. These variables will be compared between the control and intervention groups.
