    
      To achieve the objectives, 40 healthy men and women â‰¥65 years of age will consume 26 g of
      freeze-dried strawberries in the form of a drink-mix daily for 8 wk. Using a randomized
      crossover study design, the effects will be compared to the effects of 8 wk intake of a
      placebo drink-mix (with a 4 wk wash-out period between trials). Cognitive function
      measurements will be performed at baseline and 8 wk. Additionally, at each timepoint,
      flow-mediated vasodilation and blood pressure will be measured followed by collection of
      fasting blood samples to assess glucose, insulin, blood lipids (free fatty acids,
      triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol), inflammatory
      markers (interleukins 6 and 18), and markers of oxidative stress (oxidized LDL-C and
      malondialdehyde).
