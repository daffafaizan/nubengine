      the brain. There is variety of crucial sign and symptoms that can occur during stroke include
      changes in the level of consciousness and impairments of sensation and motor or cognitive
      function loss. It also includes changes in perceptual and language functions. Worldwide, 55
      million people died of stroke in 2002, and approximately 20 percent of these deaths occurred
      in South Asia. Predicting amounts of deaths from stroke will increase to 63 million in 2015
      and 78 million by 2030 with the mass occurring in the poor countries of the world.
      Rehabilitation plays a major role in minimizing activity limitation and participation
      restriction or to decrease extent of impairments. Stroke can cause variety of impairments
      which have greater impact on the patient quality of life. Hemiparesis is the common
      impairment, in which involvement of upper limb is commonly seen.

      mCIMT and BAT techniques both play an important role in the treatment of stroke. In this
      research, both techniques will be use to evaluate which treatment technique is better for
      upper extremity chronic stroke patients. Written informed consent will be taken. Each
      participant will be requested to draw either number one or number two from a box. Number one
      will be allocated to Group A and number two will be allocated to group B. The A group will
      receive mCIMT after applying conservative management and Group B will receive BAT for 5 days
      a week for 8 weeks.
