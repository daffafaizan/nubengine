      prodromal to chronic SZ, may be the most important underlying dysfunction in preventing
      functional, occupational, and social recovery in SZ compared to other symptom domains. Sodium
      butyrate is a short chain fatty acid and binds to the zinc site of histone deacetylases
      (HDAC). The inhibition of HDAC results in histone hyperacetylation. This study aims to
      evaluate its effects on improving symptoms and functioning in SZ, and the relationship of the
      drug's clinical effects to epigenetic and inflammation related biochemical changes.

      The proposed study will be a double blind study of the effects of sodium butyrate on
      cognitive function and symptoms in chronic SZ patients showing continued cognitive
      deficits.The primary specific aims of the proposal will be to test the the MATRICS (MCCB)
      battery,delayed recall performance, and performance on real world functional tasks as
      assessed by the USCD Performance- Based Skills Assessment Battery (UPSA). In addition, we
      will also investigate whether sodium butyrate may improve other aspects of cognition.

      We will also explore whether improvement in cognition is related to change in HDAC activity
      in peripheral blood cells and changes in inflammatory makers in the blood, and assess whether
      there is any improvement in psychopathology as measured by PANSS scale.
