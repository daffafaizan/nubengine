    
      The ACCURATE study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial
      designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the Spinal Modulation Axium Neurostimulator
      System as an aid in the management of chronic, intractable pain of the lower limbs, including
      unilateral or bilateral pain associated with one of the following conditions: Complex
      Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) or Peripheral Causalgia (also referred to as CRPS Type II).

      Enrolled subjects were diagnoses with CRPS or peripheral causalgia; experienced pain for at
      least six months; and failed to achieve adequate pain relief from at least two prior
      pharmacologic treatments.

      All subjects had a temporary trial neurostimulator (TNS). If the subject was a treatment
      success at the end of TNS they were scheduled for the fully implantable neurostimulator (INS)
      implant procedure. If not, subjects were exited from the study.
