      investigators laboratory (from 1992 and forward) in studies of adipose tissue function if
      they are interested to participate in a new study.

      Previously obtained results from examinations of adipose tissue, anthropometric measurements
      and blood samples will be used as baseline. In addition, saved blood samples and samples from
      old fat biopsies can be re-investigated in some cases.

      The new investigation includes a questionnaire that the subjects can answer by mail or email.
      In addition, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure determination will be performed
      at a primary health care center and blood samples will be collected for analysis of fasting
      glucose, HbA1C and lipids.

      Information regarding all previously investigated subjects will also be collected from
      several Swedish national patient registries such as the Patient Register, Prescribed Drug
      register and Cause-of Death register.
