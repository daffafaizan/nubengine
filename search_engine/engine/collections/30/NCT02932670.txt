      patients (ED90) required for single-injection US-guided costoclavicular ICB. Determination of
      the minimum effective volume of LA is important because it prevents the administration of an
      unnecessarily large (and potentially toxic) dose. Furthermore, when multiple blocks need to
      be performed at the same time in the same patient, knowledge of the minimum effective volume
      allows to the operator to preserve efficacy without sacrificing safety for each block.
