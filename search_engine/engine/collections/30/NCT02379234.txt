      training (ie "conventional", the control arm, or "conventional + high-fidelity simulation",
      the intervention arm). Randomization was stratified according to nurse's experience with
      dialysis (i.e. defined as novice, standard or expert).

      Then, all CVVH sessions performed in the ICU, were randomized to be supervised by nurses of
      one of the two arms only. The nurse in charge of the patient could thus be changed, depending
      on his/her group (note that the usual ratio is 1 nurse for 2.5 patients). Investigators use a
      minimization algorithm for this randomization, that take into account the presence of shock,
      counter-indication for heparin use, patient's agitation, site of dialysis catheter insertion
      (ie. Internal jugular or femoral) and previous early ending of the session. Prescription of
      CVVH was standardized (ie. Objective of 35 ml/kg/h of ultrafiltrate, with 1/3 in predilution
      and 2/3 post-dilution), and used unfractionated heparin.

      All CVVH parameters (i.e. pressures, flow, alarmsâ€¦) were recorded continuously, using a
      computer. In addition, hemodynamic parameters and biological parameters were prospectively
      recorded every 3 hours.

      Prescription of CVVH ending should be timely written by the doctors. Nurses were asked to
      clearly record the time of CVVH session ending. An ending appearing less than 4 hours before
      the scheduled arrest of the session is considered as a "prematurely ending". Total and
      effective duration of each session were also recorded , as well as the total volume of
      ultrafiltrate.
