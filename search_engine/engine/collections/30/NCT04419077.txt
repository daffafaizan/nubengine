      after a virtual reality exposure using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) before
      patients undergo an oncological procedure (invasive act or chemotherapy (C1D1).

      The investigator's REV study aims to recruit 66 patients among three cohorts (22 patients per
      cohort) in 12 months.

        -  Breast cancer cohort (patient receiving an adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide)

        -  Head or neck cancer cohort (patient treated by concomitant radiochemotherapy)

        -  Cancer patient for which an invasive act inducing anxiety is planned (lumbar puncture,
           ascites puncture, thoracocentesis, myelogram, bone marrow biopsy, urinary
           catheterization, ..)

      The REV study aims to impact Lyon's hospital patients' quality of life and well-being by
      decreasing their anxiety level during oncological treatments thanks to innovative supportive
      cares.
