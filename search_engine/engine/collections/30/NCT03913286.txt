      powered brace worn on the arm so that the patient can "power steer" his or her own arm. The
      ultimate goal is to create a fully implantable medical device that will restore movement in
      all parts of the body affected by a stroke. Independent movement will have functional
      benefits (e.g., being able to lift a fork to eat) and health benefits (e.g., decreasing the
      frequency of skin infections and preventing the formation of painful joint contractures).
