      of neuroretinitis. Since then optic nerve sheath fenestration has become well established
      procedure for treatment of papilledema in medically uncontrolled patients of idiopathic
      intracranial hypertension. Indications for ONSF in cancer patients are not well established,
      but a few case reports have shown success of ONSF in patients with perineural metastasis of
      breast cancer, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema due to a brain tumor,
      leukemia and optic nerve sheath meningioma. This study is conducted to establish the role of
      optic nerve sheath Fenestration in leukemic patients mainly those suffering from acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.
