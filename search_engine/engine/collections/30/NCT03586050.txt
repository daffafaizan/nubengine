    
      This prospective, single-arm single center study will provide clinical data for the Neuwave
      Medical Microwave Ablation System and accessories.

      Individuals who undergo microwave ablation of liver tumors who meet study entry criteria,
      will be enrolled.

      The enrollment for the study will continue until 30 eligible subjects complete the 3-month
      visit after ablation for the primary effectiveness and safety analysis.

      The subjects will be followed for approximately up to 36 months after the ablation procedure
      for safety, oncologic and ablation outcomes.
