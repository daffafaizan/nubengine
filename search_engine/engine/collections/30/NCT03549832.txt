      failure either non-responder or relapse to HCV treatment with Sofosbuvir/ Daclatasvir.
      retreat those patients is challenging. So, we aimed to Study the efficacy and safety of
      Sofosbuvir /Simeprevir/ Daclatasvir/Ribavirin versus Sofosbuvir /ombitasvir/
      paritaprevir/ritonavir/ribavirin in the management of hepatitis C patients who failed to
      prior Sofosbuvir/ Daclatasvir regimens in a multicenter open-labeled randomized trial.
