      diet containing 30% ketone ester (by kcals) results in greater fecal content and energy loss.
      While the investigators are unsure of the exact macronutrient content of the energy loss, the
      hypothesis is that the energy excretion is attributed to lower fat absorption. In the context
      of this study, it's hypothesized that ketone salts and ketone esters (both available
      commercially and used for a variety of health-related claims) will reduce the absorption of
      dietary fats leading to lower circulating triglyceride concentrations if consumed prior to a
      high-fat mixed meal. If the hypothesis is correct, ketones supplementation could become a
      valuable strategy to reduce the rise in circulating triglycerides often present in obesity.
      Triglyceride concentrations in the blood following a meal have been linked to development of
      cardiovascular disease.
