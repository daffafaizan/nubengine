      resulting from autoimmune attack on the hair follicles and usually presents with patchy hair
      loss. One third of these patients will experience spontaneous remissions within the first
      year. However many patients will develop waxing and waning disease with some progressing to
      alopecia totalis (total scalp hair loss) or alopecia universalis (loss of all body hair).
      This population that suffers from a disfiguring disease represents a significant unmet
      medical need. Alopecia totalis/universalis seldom, if ever, remits spontaneously or with
      current treatment and is classified by the FDA as an Orphan Indication.

      There is no FDA approved drug for alopecia areata. A recent Cochrane report concluded that
      there was no evidence based support for any intervention in this disease. Standard of care
      remains observation for mild disease and lesional/oral steroids for more advanced cases.

      Abatacept is a soluble human fusion protein that selectively modulates the costimulatory
      signal required for full T-cell activation. It is approved for the treatment of moderately to
      severely active rheumatoid arthritis. It is also approved for the treatment of moderately to
      severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years of age or
      older. Abatacept is a lyophilized powder administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion.
      Dosage, as in rheumatoid arthritis, is weight based and is fixed throughout the course of
      treatment. Abatacept or placebo will be administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion at
      baseline, weeks 2, 4, and every 4 weeks for 5 cycles (weeks 8, 12, 16, 20) for a total
      treatment period of 6 months. There will be a 6 month observational period following the
      treatment period.
