      increased-dose intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for treatment of Meningiomas will be
      more effective than the current treatment.

      The intensity modulated part of IMPT allows for even better concentration of the radiation
      dose to the desired target and less dose to the surrounding normal tissues than even
      traditional passive scattering proton therapy can do. Proton beams can be regulated to stop
      within or shortly beyond treatment targets. Therefore there is little exposure of the normal
      tissue to radiation.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved IMPT as a treatment for any
      disease.
