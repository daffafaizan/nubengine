      psychosocial well-being, modern health care in the United States is characterized by an
      increasingly patient-centered model of care that places a premium on the holistic treatment
      of the patient as a physical, psychosocial, and spiritual whole. Hospital chaplains play a
      vital role in delivering emotional and spiritual care to a broad range of both religious and
      non-religious patients for a wide variety of stressors, and extensive research indicates that
      spiritual consults impact patient outcomes and satisfaction. However, there is remarkably
      little research on the "active ingredients" of chaplaincy spiritual care, and a subsequent
      lack of standardization and best-practice guidelines informing chaplain training and chaplain
      spiritual consulting. CBCT Â® (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) is a secularized
      compassion meditation program adapted from the Tibetan Buddhist mind training (lojong)
      tradition, and it may be an ideal addendum to both chaplain training programs and to the
      spiritual care consults provided by Emory University hospital chaplains to approximately
      100,000 patients each year. This is a pilot study to explore the feasibility and impact of
      incorporating CBCT into the educational curriculum for chaplain residents. To this end, the
      researchers will (1) examine the impact of CBCT on burnout, compassion, and empathic accuracy
      among chaplains in training, (2) explore whether the impact persists through the end of the
      resident training, (3) evaluate the timing of the training within the existing curriculum to
      maximize its impact, (4) evaluate whether CBCT-informed interventions improve patient
      outcomes, and (5) explore chaplain and patient mediators of the impact of spiritual care
      consults on patient outcomes. Data acquired in this pilot study will be used to estimate
      efficacy and to inform a randomized controlled trial.
