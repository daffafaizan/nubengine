      remains unclear. Although kwashiorkor is found only where diets are low in quality protein,
      comparisons of total dietary protein of individual children with and without kwashiorkor has
      been inconclusive. This study aims to compare amino acid profiles of the diets, not just
      total protein.

      Evidence has shown that children with kwashiorkor consistently have very low circulating
      levels of sulfur amino acids (cysteine and methionine). Typical staple foods in regions with
      endemic kwashiorkor are generally poor in sulfur amino acids and the signs characterizing
      kwashiorkor can plausibly be explained by a shortage of sulfur amino acids.

      In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, certain populations have chronically higher
      prevalence of kwashiorkor than neighboring populations with similar livelihoods, religion,
      environment, language and ethnicity. This study will compare these two populations to
      understand what differences between them may explain the difference in prevalence.
