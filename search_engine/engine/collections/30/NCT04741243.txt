      low back pain were excluded from the study. They were randomly assigned into two equal groups
      (A& B). Group (A) consisted of twenty subjects, with an average age 29.2±1.9Yrs, and BMI
      27.28±2.1kg/m2 who received Extracorporeal shock waves. Group (B) consisted of twenty
      patients, with an average age 28.58±2.2Yrs, and BMI 28.92±0.7kg/m2 who received sham
      technique. A hot pack was used for 15 minutes for both groups (A&B) before the treatment.
