      Transurethral Resection of Prostate(TURP) or Holmium Laser Ennucleation of Prostate(HoLEP)
      are mostly ole age people. Most old age patient has several underlying disease. So patients
      can develop high mortality and morbidity. Most surgeries for Prostate Resection are taken
      under Spinal anesthesia. Adequate block level for Prostate Resection is T10. But sometimes,
      old age patients can develop severe hypotension and vital unstability due to unintentional
      high sensory and motor blocks. These complications are due to the decreased cerebrospinal
      fluid volume with increase of age. So we started this study to know the adequate drug
      concentration for Spinal anesthesia taken for Prostate Resection surgery.
