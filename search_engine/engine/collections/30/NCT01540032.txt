    
      Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is clinically diagnosed in patients who suffer
      from allergy to aspirin, asthma, nasal polyps, and chronic sinusitis. Patients with AERD are
      often resistant to medical management of nasal polyps, and require multiple endoscopic sinus
      surgeries to manage recurrences of nasal polyps. Control of AERD can be obtained through
      aspirin desensitization, which consists of taking aspirin every day. However, there are
      substantial risks and adverse side effects to taking moderate amounts of aspirin daily.
      Furthermore, patients experience progressively worsening nasal and respiratory disease even
      with complete avoidance of aspirin and other NSAIDs.

      The active and major component in aspirin/NSAIDs is salicylate, which is also found naturally
      in some foods. Diet modification is a cost-effective intervention that has the potential to
      provide long-term remission of AERD. Our study will evaluate whether a low salicylate diet,
      which is a more cost effective and benign intervention with minimal risks, will improve
      nasal, sinus or respiratory symptoms, such as congestion, sinusitis, smell, or asthma.
