        -  Determine the objective response rate in elderly women with stage IV breast cancer
           treated with oral vinorelbine.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess individual variation in responses (toxicity and/or activity), pharmacokinetic
           parameters, and/or biologic correlates due to genetic differences in enzymes involved in
           the transport, metabolism, and/or mechanism of action of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vinorelbine once weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then after completion of the second course.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.
