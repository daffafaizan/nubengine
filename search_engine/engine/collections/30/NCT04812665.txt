    
      This feasibility study builds upon mental health and technology acceptance theoretical
      frameworks. It seeks to examine potentials of a novel mobile Health (mHealth) solution based
      on emotional and behavioral change techniques, to provide emotional and self-management
      tailored support to caregivers of children undergoing Growth Hormone treatment (GHt).

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To gather qualitative information enabling to better understand individualized
           experiences of caregiving children undergoing GHt and perceived barriers/facilitators
           for adoption of the mHealth solution.

        -  To assess positive mood states of caregivers of GHt patients as an indicator of
           emotional wellbeing related to the use of the mHealth solution.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To explore whether the mHealth solution applied to caregivers of children undergoing GHt
      might affect:

        -  Broader emotion-related parameters: Distress (emotional disturbance), self-efficacy
           (perceived own capability of managing stress), and general psychological wellbeing of
           caregivers.

        -  Perceived Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children (evaluated from the
           caregivers' perspective).

        -  Behavioral parameters: Usability / engagement with the mHealth solution and children's
           adherence to treatment measured by Easypod-Connect.
