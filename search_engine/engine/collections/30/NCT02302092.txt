    
      The drug being tested in this study is called Flomoxef. Flomoxef is being tested in people
      with a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) including a kidney infection. This study
      compares Flomoxef to Cefepime, another antibiotic.

      The study enrolled 13 patients.

      Participants are randomly assigned by a computer generated number to one of two treatment
      groups:

        -  Flomoxef - intravenous infusion 2g twice daily (every 12 hours); or

        -  Cefepime - intravenous infusion 1g twice daily (every 12 hours).

      This multi-center trial is conducted at 4 sites in the Russian Federation. The overall time
      to participate in this study is 30+/-3 days. Participants make six visits to the clinic.

      Study was prematurely terminated due to administrative and strategic reasons.
