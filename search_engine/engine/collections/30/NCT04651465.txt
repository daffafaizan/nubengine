      kindergartens to evaluate the N-TIK program as a universal and selective prevention program.
      The study will use a cluster randomized controlled design and comparing an intervention with
      a wait-list control sample. Baseline measurement (Time 1) are gathered from parents, children
      and teachers and include measurement of parenting, parent functioning, child emotion
      competence, child behavior and child kindergarten adjustment. Following baseline assessment
      families is allocated into Intervention or Wait-list conditions. Intervention parents attend
      a 6-session group parenting program where they learn to emotion coach their children and
      regulate their own emotions. These groups are facilitated by selected research team
      facilitators. Post-program, Intervention parents complete program evaluation measures (Time
      2) to provide program feedback. At 12-month follow-up (Time 3) baseline assessments are
      repeated for Intervention and Wait-list participants with preschool teachers reporting on
      children's adjustment. Wait-list parents are then offered the N-TIK program delivered by
      community practitioners who have been trained by the project team in the intervention and
      have previously co-facilitated groups alongside the research group facilitators. This ensures
      the program can be used beyond just the research study building sustainability of the
      preventive intervention in the municipalities
