      trial; a step-wise therapeutic approach in IgAN patients with persistent proteinuria who have
      preserved eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. During 3-6 months before the enrollment, all patients
      will receive maximal supportive care including the use of RAS blockers, blood pressure
      control with a target of <130/80 mmHg, and protein restriction diet. If proteinuria does not
      decrease < 1.0 g/g creatinine, patients will be randomly assigned to continue supportive
      care, or to receive corticosteroids. At 3 months after randomization, patients in the
      corticosteroid arm who have persistent proteinuria of ≥ 1.0 g/g creatinine, or fast decline
      in eGFR ≥ 15% from the baseline value, will additionally receive cyclosphosphamide during the
      following 3 months. Patients who have substantial decreased amount of proteinuria < 1.0 g/g
      creatinine at 3 months will continue protocol-based corticosteroids during the same period.
      At 6 months after randomization, patients who receive add-on cyclophosphamide will switch to
      azathioprine as a maintenance therapy and those who receive corticosteroids alone will
      discontinue the treatment and will be followed up during 24 months thereafter. At least 87
      subjects (a total of 174) would be required for each group to detect 13.5% difference in
      response rates between the two groups based on previous studies if type I error rate is 5%
      and type II error is 20% given 20% of drop-out rate during the study period.
