      and thrombus formation after angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular disease,
      coronary artery by-pass surgery and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in
      patients. While low-dose aspirin is effective in these cases, its use sometimes causes
      gastric and duodenal ulcers which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, and in worse cases
      may lead to death.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of lansoprazole versus gefarnate in
      patients with a history of gastric or duodenal ulcers receiving daily low dose aspirin
      therapy.
