    
      This is a randomized, double blinded, prospective study. Subjects will be evaluated and
      randomized to either the device or sham treatment group if they qualify for the study. A
      comparison of glycemic control between the two groups will be assessed as the primary outcome
      measurement as well as the safety profile of the device.
