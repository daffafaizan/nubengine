      acetaminophen in a model of nociception by electrical stimulation using the PainMatcher in
      healthy volunteers. Our study try to determinate if a such antagonism exist in clinical
      conditions : 66 patients with an Apfel-score II undergoing thyroidectomy were randomized in 3
      equal groups. Each group received an antiemetic (ondansetron, droperidol or dexamethasone) at
      the begining of the intervention and paracetamol at the end of the intervention for the
      postoperative analgesia. During 2 hours in the postoperative unit, we raised : the electrical
      pain's threshold with the PainMatcher, the numeric pain intensity scale and the presence of
      nausea or vomiting. For each patients we determined the cytochrome P450 2D6 activity that
      should have been able to explain a diminution of ondansetron's efficiency. Paracetamol blood
      levels were also raised in the postoperative unit.
