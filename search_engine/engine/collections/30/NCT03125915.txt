      drug use, and sexual risk behavior, the study team created two adjunct intervention
      components:

      Communication skills training videos: The team produced a brief (20-minute) communication
      skills training video. The video includes 4 scenes in which a gay couple is depicted
      discussing HIV risk, sexual agreements, or drug use. The scene is viewed twice. The first
      viewing includes common communication errors. The second viewing portrays the use of more
      effective interpersonal communication and a more adaptive outcome.

      Substance use agreement module: The team developed a structured activity to assist couples in
      clarifying their understanding and goals around substance use. The module includes the
      completion of a calendar detailing recent substance use and structured debriefing questions.

      Phase II: A randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of novel intervention components will be conducted. The trial involves
      70 couples (n = 140 individuals). Half of the couples are randomized to complete the drug
      calendar (the other half do not). Half of the couples are randomized to view communication
      skills training videos, the other half do not. The result is four intervention conditions:

        1. CHTC as usual

        2. CHTC + communication skills training videos

        3. CHTC + substance use module

        4. CHTC + communication skills training videos + substance use calendar

      Participants complete a baseline assessment (either online or in person) prior to their
      intervention session. All intervention sessions are completed with both members of the couple
      together. Follow-up assessments are completed individually online at 1, 3, and 6 months
      post-intervention.
