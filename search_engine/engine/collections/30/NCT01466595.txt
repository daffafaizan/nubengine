      weeks of treatment with rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, decreases markers of immune
      activation and levels of translocated gut microbial products in HIV-1 infected subjects
      virally suppressed on ART with CD4+ T-cells < 350 cells/mm^3. Rifaximin were admistered to
      subjects for 3 weeks. Follow-up continued to week 12. The total sample size was 73 subjects.
      Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio (rifaximin: no study treatment), using permuted
      blocks, without institutional balancing.

      Subjects were seen through week 12 for clinical and laboratory evaluations, including plasma
      HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ T-cell count, and safety laboratories. Subjects had 2 baseline visits -- at
      pre-entry and entry. Study visits were scheduled at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. CD4+ T-cell counts
      and HIV-1 RNA were measured at all weeks; measures of activations, gut-homing markers, and
      soluble biomarkers were also performed at all weeks.
