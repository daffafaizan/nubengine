      is a drug that changes levels of certain brain chemicals that may also be useful in helping
      people to stop using methamphetamine. Our goal is to determine the safety and effects of
      varenicline (1 and 2 mg, daily, vs. a placebo) when it is used before experimental
      administration of methamphetamine, on a number of physical and psychological measures;
      specifically blood pressure, heart rate, and how you feel after taking methamphetamine. The
      secondary purpose is to determine the effects of treatment with varenicline (1 and 2 mg
      daily), compared to treatment with placebo, on the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine by
      measuring methamphetamine self-administration in methamphetamine-dependent human volunteers.
