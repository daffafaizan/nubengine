      different bread types. Blood samples will be collected over 4,5 hours after ingestion of test
      meals containing around 145 g of each bread type, equivalent to 50 g available carbohydrate
      and 3 dl + 2 dl water on four different days in randomized order. Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      will be used for determination of subjective satiety feeling and a subsequent meal will be
      served to estimate prospective food consumption.
