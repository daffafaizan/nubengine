    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and safety of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody anti-B1
      in patients with relapsed or refractory, low grade or transformed low grade B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: On day 1, patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody anti-B1 (MOAB anti-B1) IV
      over 1 hour followed by a tracer dose of iodine I 131 MOAB anti-B1 IV over 30 minutes to
      determine biodistribution and a therapeutic dose of iodine I 131 MOAB anti-B1. Patients
      receive unlabeled MOAB anti-B1 IV over 1 hour followed by a therapeutic dose of iodine I 131
      MOAB anti-B1 IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Patients are followed at weeks 13 and 25 and then
      every 6 months for up to 2 years.
