      Chicago (RIC), Center for Pain Studies (446 E Ontario St. Suite 1011, Chicago, IL 60611).
      Your part in this study will last for 8 weeks and will involve 3 visits to the Rehabilitation
      Institute of Chicago and anywhere from weekly phone calls to phone calls every other day.

      If you are in this study, you will be placed in one of two study groups: one group will
      receive the study drug and one will receive a placebo. You will be assigned a study group by
      chance using a process similar to the flip of a coin. This process is called randomization.
      Neither you nor the study staff will select the group you will be in. A placebo looks like
      the study drug but is an inactive substance that has no medication. Researchers use a placebo
      to see if the study drug works better or is safer than not taking anything. You will have a
      66% chance of getting the study drug. You will receive placebo at some point during the study
      but you will not know whether you are receiving placebo or study drug during the entire
      study. However, if you have a medical emergency, the investigators can get this information.
