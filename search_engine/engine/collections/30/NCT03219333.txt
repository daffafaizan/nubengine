      intravenously to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who
      previously received a CPI and either previously received platinum-containing chemotherapy
      (Cohort 1) or are platinum-naïve and cisplatin-ineligible (Cohort 2). Patients who received
      platinum in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting and did not progress within 12 months of
      completion will be considered platinum-naïve. Approximately 100 patients are expected to be
      enrolled in each cohort. The primary goal of the study is to determine the confirmed ORR of
      enfortumab vedotin.
