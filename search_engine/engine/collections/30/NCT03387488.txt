      Video- assisted pericardioscopic surgery for implanting epimyocardial pacemaker leads

      Abridged Operation Protocol:

      10 mm skin incision below the xiphoid process, blunt preparation towards the pericardial sac,
      insertion of the endoscope-carrying trocar, opening of the pericardium with endoscopic
      forceps, standardised inspection of the pericardial cavity, insertion of the bipolar
      StingrayÂ® electrode via the endoscope working channel into pericardial space, implantation of
      the electrode into designated epimyocardial site under endoscopic vision, pacing measurements
      sensing, impedance, pacing threshold, interventricular delay (in CRT), panoramic fluoroscopy
      for future controls, retraction of the endoscope/trocar, subcutaneous tunnelling and
      connection of the respective electrode to:

        -  existing, infraclavicular CRT device, suture in layers, wound dressing

        -  a single- or dual-chamber pacemaker device implanted epigastrically, suture in layers,
           wound dressing
