    
      This is an 8 Week phase Ib, monocentric, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled,
      parallel groups, study with a 24 Week follow-up period to evaluate the safety and potential
      efficacy of a 180 Î¼g/ml recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) eye drops solution
      versus vehicle in 60 study participants with chronic primary open angle glaucoma.

      Participants may qualify with either progressive optic neuropathy despite maximal current
      therapy (i.e. IOP reduction), or with stabilized IOP but diminished vision (central or
      peripheral).

      Participants with a qualifying eye will be randomized 2:1 to topical recombinant human nerve
      growth factor (rhNGF) therapy or vehicle placebo control. Examinations for safety and
      efficacy will occur one week following initiation of therapy, and at 4, 8, 12 and 32 weeks.

      All participants in either arm will be followed clinically at 4 weeks after cessation of
      therapy.
