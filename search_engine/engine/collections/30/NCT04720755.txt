      treatments, patients will complete validated questionnaires to assess erectile function. In
      addition, patients will undergo induction of artificial erection in clinic with assessment of
      penile blood flow using penile Doppler. Intracavernosal pressure measurements will be
      obtained. A corporal aspirate will be drawn and examined for levels of neuronal nitric oxide
      synthase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, brain-derived neurotropic factor and vascular
      endothelial growth factor. Patients will then receive twice-weekly Li-ESWT treatments of
      0.2mJ/mm^2 over 3 treatment sites along the dorsal penile shaft, 1500 shocks per treatment
      (500 shocks per treatment site), for a total of 3000 shocks per week, for 6 weeks of
      treatment (totally 18,000 shocks). Following Li-ESWT treatments, patients will complete the
      same validated questionnaires, penile Doppler studies, corporal aspirates and measurement of
      intracavernosal pressures immediately following the final Li-ESWT treatment, 4-6 weeks
      following completion of treatment, and again at 3 and 6 months following completion of
      treatment.
