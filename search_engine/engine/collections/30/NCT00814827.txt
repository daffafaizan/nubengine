      immunodeficiencies. We have recently identified a population of Asian women with
      autoantibodies to interferon gamma (IFN?), all of whom were diagnosed by virtue of
      nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Similar patient populations have been reported from
      Thailand, and we have found similar autoantibodies in anonymous serum samples from there. In
      addition, many of the Thai patients who have disseminated or lymphatic nontuberculous
      infections have had other opportunistic infections (OI), such as salmonella, penicilliosis,
      and histoplasmosis. However, they have normal lymphocyte counts and are human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative. Therefore, the identification of autoantibodies to a
      critical cytokine, the occurrence of opportunistic infections, and the lack of other common
      explanations suggests that this is an important population to study. We propose to enroll
      patients in a natural history study of non-HIV opportunistic infections to explore the
      presence of autoantibodies to cytokines, and to examine potential immunogenetic factors
      influencing the development of this disease. Plasma, cells, and DNA samples will be obtained
      and stored for use in this study. This study will accrue up to 265 patients over 5 years as
      per the protocol with follow up for 15 years on each patient, sample size justification and
      the groups described in the protocol.
