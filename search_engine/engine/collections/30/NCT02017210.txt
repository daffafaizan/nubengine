      complicated by the metabolic syndrome have been described. These so called "metabolically
      healthy obese" may have reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause
      mortality compared with individuals with obesity who present with components of the metabolic
      syndrome.

      Longitudinal studies with diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk endpoints reported that
      individuals with obesity who are metabolically healthy (MHO) held an intermediate health
      status, such that they were still worse off than the healthy normal-weight individuals. While
      there have been studies evaluating the stability of the MHO phenotype over time, no study has
      reported the durability of insulin-sensitivity per se, as measured by the gold-standard
      hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. In the present study, we aimed to trace the change in
      insulin resistance/sensitivity, and to uncover predictors of insulin resistance in older age.
      The secondary aims were to trace the change in body composition, fat distribution and
      metabolic markers over time in a well-phenotyped cohort studied approximately 5-6 years
      apart.
