      designed to compare the safety and efficacy of adalimumab and MTX with placebo and MTX in
      subjects with early RA. Subjects were randomized to receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week
      (eow) or placebo subcutaneous injections in combination with orally administered MTX for 26
      weeks (Period 1). All subjects in all arms received open-label MTX weekly throughout the
      study (both Period 1 and Period 2).

      At Weeks 22 and 26, subjects were assessed for achievement of low disease activity, defined
      as a DAS28 score below 3.2. DAS28 is a measure of RA disease activity calculated using the
      number of tender and swollen joints (out of a total of 28), C-reactive protein level (CRP, a
      blood marker of inflammation), and the patient's global assessment of disease activity
      (indicated by marking a 10 cm line between very good and very bad). Subjects who achieved low
      disease activity at Week 22 and 26 in the adalimumab arm at the end of Period 1 were
      randomized to receive MTX monotherapy (placebo and MTX) or combination therapy (adalimumab
      and MTX) in a 1:1 ratio for the duration of Period 2 (52 weeks, i.e., to Week 78 of the
      study). Subjects achieving low disease activity at Week 22 and 26 in the placebo arm (MTX
      monotherapy) at the end of Period 1 continued to receive MTX monotherapy (and placebo
      injections in a blinded fashion) for the duration of Period 2. Subjects failing to achieve
      low disease activity at Week 22 and 26 at the end of Period 1 received open-label combination
      therapy during Period 2 regardless of treatment assignment in Period 1.
