    
      The LEADS study is a non-randomized, natural history, non-treatment study. Enrolled
      participants must be 40 - 64 (inclusive) years of age, with MCI due to AD or probable AD
      dementia (cognitively impaired participants) or have no significant memory impairment
      (cognitively normal [CN] participants).

      Approximately 600 participants with cognitive impairment (400 with early onset Alzheimer's
      Disease [EOAD] and 200 with early onset non-Alzheimer's Disease [EOnonAD]) and 100 CN
      participants will be enrolled at approximately 20 sites in the United States. Cognitively
      impaired participants will take part in the study for 48+ months; CN participants will take
      part in the study for 24+ months.

      Participants will undergo longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessments, computerized
      cognitive tests, biomarker and genetic tests, PET (FDG, amyloid and tau) and MRI brain scans,
      and optional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection. Participants will be invited to consider
      autopsy brain donation

      The primary objectives of the LEADS study are to:

        -  collect longitudinal assessments and biomarker data in individuals with early onset
           cognitive impairment (EOAD / EOnonAD) and cognitively normal (CN) controls;

        -  to compare baseline and longitudinal cognitive and functional characteristics, between
           EOAD and CN, and EOAD and Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) from the Alzheimer's
           Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); and

        -  to study the associations of longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessments with
           multimodal imaging and biofluid markers that capture different elements of the AD
           pathophysiological cascade
