      blockade is unknown.

      Method: phase IV adaptative trial using Dixon's up-and-down method for modeling
      remifentanil's dose-response curve for adequate intubation conditions as defined by previous
      studies. Remifentanil doses starting from 2mg/kg will be infused before intubation. When a
      success occurs next patient's dose will be decreased by 0.25mg/kg/h. When a success does not
      occur the next patient's dose will be increased by 0.25mg/kg/h. Intubation will be considered
      adequate if patient does not cough, does not move, if vocal cords are open, if larigocsocpic
      Cormack grade I or II.
