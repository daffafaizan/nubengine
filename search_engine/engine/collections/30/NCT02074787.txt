      injury in order to determine the necessary treatment and likely clinical outcome. Adjuncts to
      this process aim to inform the clinician of structural damage to the sub dermal vasculature.
      The current gold standard investigation is laser doppler imaging (LDI) of dermal blood flow.
      However, due to time and resource constraints, this technique is often only applied to dermal
      burns of indeterminate thickness. Thermography and the SIAscope potential offer quicker,
      quantitative analysis with equipment currently in routine medical use in other clinical
      disciplines.

      To validate its use against the current gold standard (LDI)burns of variable thicknesses will
      need to be assessed and compared with clinical outcome. Consequently, in this study, patients
      with superficial burns that would not usually require LDI will be included for comparison.
      All patients will be reassured that thermography, the SIAscope and LDI are non-invasive,
      non-harmful, quick and will not affect their burn management in any way. Images will be
      labelled by an anonymised study number and stored in on secure hospital servers according to
      the Trust's information governance policy.
