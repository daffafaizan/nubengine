    
      This is a multicenter study to evaluate if the effectiveness of desvenlafaxine succinate
      sustained-release tablet (50 mg/day) used for 8 weeks is not inferior to duloxetine
      hydrochloride enteric-coated capsule (60 mg/day) in adult patients with major depressive
      disorder. A total of 400 subjects will be randomly allocated to experimental arm
      (desvenlafaxine succinate sustained-release tablet) and active comparator arm (duloxetine
      hydrochloride enteric-coated capsule) in a 1:1 ratio.
