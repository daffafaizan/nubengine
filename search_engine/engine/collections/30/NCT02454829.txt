    
      Between 1997 and december 2013, 546 girls and women underwent ovarian cortex cryopreservation
      in the investigators' institution for fertility preservation. The main indications were the
      need for a gonadotoxic treatment, repeated ovarian surgery and a genetic risk for premature
      ovarian failure . These women will be sent a questionnaire concerning their ovarian function
      since the procedure and a questionnaire about their satisfaction concerning the procedure.
      Six different questionnaires will be used adapted to the patient's initial indication for
      cryopreservation and the patient's age at the time of cryopreservation. Complementary data
      will be obtained by medical file analysis and by contacting the patient's family doctor or
      gynecologist.

      Data will be correlated with received gonadotoxic treatment and surgical interventions.

      The purpose of the study is to improve the indications and patient selection for ovarian
      cortex cryopreservation.
