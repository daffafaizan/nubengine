      (EGFR-TKIs) such as erlotinib, gefitinib and icotinib as the first line treatment for
      advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in combination with
      thoracic radiotherapy as the first line treatment for stage IV NSCLC with active EGFR
      mutation remains unknown. In this single-arm phase II trial, we chose the subjects with stage
      IV harboring active EGFR mutation,who were treated by EGFR-TKIs combined with radiation
      therapy. The primary endpoint is 1-year rate of progression-free survival and the second
      endpoints are overall survival (OS), objective response rate and toxic and side effect. By
      evaluating them, we expect to find out the evidence that the combination therapy can benefit
      the short-term and long-term survival of the patients. Meanwhile, via the stratification
      analysis of tumor biomarker and immune index, we obtain the evidences for the benefits of
      comprehensive and individual treatment for advanced NSCLC.
