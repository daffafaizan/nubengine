    
      This study is a multicentered, observational study of the patients with COPD who were
      enrolled in 45 tertiary and university-affiliated hospitals from December 2012 to now.

      The initial evaluation for all patients includes pulmonary function tests (PFT), 6-min walk
      distance (6MWD), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea
      scale, and the COPD-specific version of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C),
      exacerbations in the previous 12 months, smoking status, patient-reported education level,
      medications and comorbidities.

      Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are performed every 6 months and CAT, mMRC and SGRQ-C are
      evaluated every 6 months and 6 min walt test is performed every years during the whole period
      of study.

      All of the data were reported using case-report forms (CRFs) which are completed by
      physicians or trained nurses, and the patients are to be evaluated at regular 6-month
      intervals after the initial examination.
