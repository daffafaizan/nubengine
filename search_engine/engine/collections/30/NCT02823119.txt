      conventional office hysteroscopy or mini-hysteroscopy were mixed. Several studies revealed
      that mini-hysteroscopy significantly reduced the procedure related pain and other studies
      revealed that the use of mini-hysteroscope was not associated with significant reduction in
      the procedure related pain. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hysteroscope
      diameter on the pain experienced by nulliparous patients undergoing diagnostic office
      hysteroscopy.
