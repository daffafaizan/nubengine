      a self-questionnaire looking for a history of pre-eclampsia in women who gave birth at Brest
      University Hospital before year 2015.

      First, women with pre-eclampsia (cases) and women with no hypertensive disorders (controls)
      during pregnancy were identified with the Medical Registry Database (MRD) of Brest University
      maternity ward.

      All pre-eclampsia diagnoses were reviewed by 2 experts in order to confirm the accuracy of
      the diagnosis.

      250 cases and 250 controls were finally selected after consultation of their medical file and
      were pre-included in the study.

      Then, the 500 women will be contacted by phone or e-mail in order to inform them about the
      study and to offer them the possibility to participate in the study.

      The women who will agree to participate in the study will fill in an online
      self-questionnaire on pre-eclampsia.

      Their responses will then be compared to the diagnosis retained after consultation of their
      medical file.

      Sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire will then be evaluated.
