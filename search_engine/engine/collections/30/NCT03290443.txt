    
      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 4 as follows:

        -  Group 1: Approximately 6 to 8 male and female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 1.

        -  Group 2: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male and female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 2. Subjects in Group 2 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 1 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 30 pounds).

        -  Group 3: Approximately 6 to 8 male and female subjects with severe hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 3.

        -  Group 4: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male and female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 4. Subjects in Group 4 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 3 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 30 pounds). This study
           employs a staged design as follows.

        -  At least 4 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory
           safety and tolerability for up to 8 days after dosing, before subjects with severe
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.

        -  Two subjects with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and
           tolerability for up to 8 days after dosing, before the remaining subjects with severe
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.
