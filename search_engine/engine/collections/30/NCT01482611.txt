    
      This is a Phase I, single-center, first-in-human, double-blind (neither the participant nor
      the investigator/medical staff knows whether placebo or JNJ-47910382 is given at a certain
      moment), randomized (treatment with placebo or JNJ-47910382 is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled trial in 18 healthy Caucasian and 16 healthy Japanese participants to
      investigate the safety, tolerability and plasma pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of
      JNJ-47910382. This trial consists of 3 Parts: 1. a single dose escalation part in healthy
      male and female Caucasians, 2. a single dose study investigating the effect of fasting in
      healthy male and female Caucasians and 3. a single dose escalation part in healthy male
      Japanese participants. Part 1 holds 6 sessions, each testing another dose of JNJ-47910382.
      Part 2 holds 1 session testing one dose and Part 3 holds 3 sessions, each testing another
      dose of JNJ-47910382. The doses pre-defined for the Caucasian cohort in Part 1 are 10 mg, 30
      mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg, given in Session I till and including Session VI,
      respectively. These doses may be adjusted based on results obtained from previous sessions,
      but will not exceed 600 mg, the predefined maximal tolerated dose or a dose that yields a
      JNJ-47910382 plasma levels that approaches the predefined maximum mean exposure. The foreseen
      maximum dose is 600 mg.The doses for the Japanese cohort, given in Session VIII till and
      including Session X, respectively, and the dose for the fasting-session (Session VII) will be
      defined during the conduct of the study, based on the safety, tolerability and PK profiles
      obtained in the previously completed sessions. The Caucasian cohort is divided over 2 panels
      (Panel 1 and 2) of 9 participants, and to each Panel, 3 different doses are assigned,
      respecting a washout period of at least 10 days. The Japanese cohort is divided over 2 panels
      (Panel 3 and 4) of 8 participants and to Panel 3, 2 different doses are assigned, respecting
      a washout period of at least 10 days, and to Panel 4 only 1 dose of JNJ-47910382 is assigned.
      Either Panel 1 or 2 will be selected for the fasting-study Session, depending on the dose
      that has been selected for this fasting-study. Both, JNJ-47910382 and the placebo are liquids
      and will be administered in the mouth of the participants via an oral dispenser. The decision
      to escalate to the next dose in Part 1 and 3 will be taken with caution. After each session,
      the safety and tolerability (till and including 96h post dose) and the PK (till and including
      24h post dose) results will be evaluated by the sponsor and principle investigator - in a
      blinded fashion. Only in case the previous dose is shown to be generally safe and tolerable
      and the maximum tolerated dose and the maximal mean plasma JNJ-47910382 levels have not been
      reached and the PK profile is satisfactory, the next session can start, using a selected and
      agreed dose. Safety evaluations between sessions include adverse events, vital signs (blood
      pressure and heart rate), electrocardiogram (ECG) (evaluation of the activity of the heart at
      certain time points), heart telemetry (continuous evaluation of the activity of the heart,
      for 12 hours), physical examination and clinical laboratory tests. Throughout the trial, in
      each session, the plasma PK profiles of JNJ-47910382 will be determined up to 96 hours after
      dosing. Also the amount of JNJ-47910382 recovered in the urine will be determined over 72
      hours after intake of study medication in Session IV and in the Japanese Session with the
      same dose (either Session VIII, IX or X). A blood sample dedicated for the analysis of
      specific genes involved in the PK (metabolism) and transport of JNJ-47910382 will be
      collected from each participant, preferentially on Day-2 of one of the sessions. Also safety
      and tolerability of JNJ-47910382 will be determined throughout the trial. In each session a
      triplicate ECG is taken, vital signs are recorded, urinalysis is performed and biochemical
      and blood parameters are assessed on Days 1, 2 and 4. On Day3, vital signs are recorded and a
      triplicate ECG taken. On Day-1, a triplicate ECG is taken. Heart telemetric recordings are
      performed on Day-1 and Day1 for 12 hours. Physical examination occurs on Day-1 and Day5.
