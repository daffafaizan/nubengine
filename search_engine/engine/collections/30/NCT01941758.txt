      I. To estimate the immunogenicity of high-dose influenza vaccination in patients with central
      nervous system tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the geometric mean titer (GMT) in patients after administration of high-dose
      influenza vaccination compared to previously determined geometric mean titer (GMT) among 38
      patients receiving the standard yearly influenza vaccination.

      II. To assess the seroconversion rates (i.e. four-fold rise in titer) compared to previously
      determined seroconversion following administration of the standard yearly influenza
      vaccination.

      III. To assess the seroprotection rates (i.e. post-vaccination titer >= 1:40) compared to
      previously determined seroconversion and seroprotection following administration of the
      standard yearly influenza vaccination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between serologic markers of immune function and response to
      high-dose vaccination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine on day 1.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 28 days and/or 3 months.
