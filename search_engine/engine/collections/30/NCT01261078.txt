      with bupivacaine 8 mg were compared with those with bupivacaine 8 mg with 25 mcg of
      epinephrine, bupivacaine 8 mg with 50 mcg of epinephrine, and those with bupivacaine 8 mg
      with 100 mcg of epinephrine. The investigators compared the characteristics of spinal
      anesthesia including the quality and complication of spinal anesthesia. The researchers
      investigated whether intrathecal dose of epinephrine can reduce bupivacaine requirement and
      this effect is dependent on the dose of epinephrine.
