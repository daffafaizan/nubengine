      with proven WHO-classification Zika infection. These subjects will be followed up for a
      maximum of 12 months to observe the presence, viral load and infectivity of Zika virus (ZIKV)
      in semen over time.

      Knowledge of the possible presence, infectivity and persistence of ZIKV in semen will provide
      evidence-based data for

        1. estimating of the risk of sexual transmission of ZIKV in the general population

        2. antenatal guidelines for the prevention of sexual transmission of ZIKV to the fetus

        3. advising couples on the length of time that pregnancy should be avoided in women wishing
           to conceive after their partner's ZIKV infection

        4. strategies to prevent transmission of ZIKV infection through assisted reproductive
           treatment (ART)

        5. advice on gamete cryopreservation

        6. optimising investigations for diagnosis of ZIKV in males.
