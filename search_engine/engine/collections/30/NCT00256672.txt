    
      This is a randomized control trial to determine the effectiveness of high dose bracing (≥ 23
      hours per day) and low dose bracing (≤ 12 hours per day) in skeletally immature children with
      Spinal Cord Injury. Subjects will be randomized into either a prophylactic high dose-bracing
      group (≥ 23 hours per day) or low dose-bracing group (≤ 12 hours per day). Subjects will be
      stratified by age (younger than age 10 and older than age 10), and curve severity (< 20
      degrees and 20-40 degrees) using a matching random blocks design.
