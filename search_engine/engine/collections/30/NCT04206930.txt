      thinking. Frequently found in people with an alcohol use disorder, a true mental handicap,
      alexithymia has been clearly identified as a relapse factor in addictive problems related to
      alcohol. The ALEXART study intends to study the evolution of alexithymia in people with an
      alcohol use disorder hosted in an Addictology Day Hospital unit through the use of an
      approach non-drug that is art therapy. Our hypothesis is that art therapy can help patients
      with alcohol use disorders to develop a better understanding of their own behaviors, to name
      their emotions and feelings, and to improve their communication with others and thereby be
      able to choose to change their behavior.
