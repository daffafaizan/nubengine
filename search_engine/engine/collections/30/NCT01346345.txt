      The purpose of this research study is to examine the aesthetics (the appearance of the
      implanted tooth and gums) as well as the soft tissue loss over a three-year period. This
      study involves replacing a missing small front tooth with a dental implant, abutment, and
      crown. A titanium dental implant acts as the replacement for a tooth root. An abutment is
      made of titanium which is either gold or silver in color and cannot be seen; but may affect
      the way the gum looks. An abutment is the component that attaches the crown to the implant
      post. A crown (which acts as the tooth replacement) is made of metal and/or porcelain and
      attaches over the abutment.

      The dental implant and the abutments used in this study have been approved by Health Canada
      and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of replacing the small teeth in
      the front of the mouth.

      The abutment is made in two colors (either gold or silver) and you cannot choose. For each
      subject this is decided by chance. You will have an equal chance of getting a gold or
      silver-colored attachment. You will know which color the abutment will be once you have
      consented to be in the study and registered. You will know the color of the abutment before
      the implant is placed. The abutment is covered by the crown.

      You will be in this study for about three years. There will be approximately 60 subjects who
      will participate in this study in different centres, in Canada and the USA.
