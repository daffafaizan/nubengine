      subjects: active treatment and 13 subjects: positive control).

      Adults and children (ages 12 and over) will receive either a marketed or not yet marketed
      investigational product for the treatment of eczema. Subjects will be asked to stop use of
      prescription and all eczema treatments 2 days before the start of the study and during the
      study. Subjects will apply study product as indicated for 7 days to affected areas.

      Subjects will record treatment use in a daily diary and complete questionnaires. A
      dermatologist will examine and score the eczema and symptoms. Skin moisture levels will also
      be tested.
