      of dementia are important issues in the aging society. In recent years, studies have shown
      that Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) exercise can improve cognitive functions in healthy middle-aged and
      older adults, but not studies have investigated the neural mechanisms. Therefore, the
      purposes of this research project are: (1) to investigate the effects of TCC exercise
      intervention on improving cognitive functions and motor functions in healthy middle-aged and
      older adults; (2) to investigate the effects of TCC intervention on improving the integrity
      of frontostriatal fiber tracts, and areas and intensity of brain activation while performing
      a switching task in healthy middle-aged and older adults.

      Methods: This project used the assessor-blind and randomized control clinical trial design. A
      total of 60 healthy middle-aged and older adults will be recruited, randomly allocated to two
      groups: experimental and control groups. Experimental group will receive a 60-minute exercise
      program, three times per week for 12 weeks. Control group will receive a telephone
      consultation once every two weeks for 12 weeks. All participants will receive clinical
      neuropsychological tests, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery tests, motor
      function tests, diffusion spectrum MR imaging, and functional MRI experiments before
      intervention, and at the end of intervention to realize the changes of cognitive function,
      motor function, integrity of neural tracts, and intensity and regions of functional
      activation while doing switching task of executive function in order to understand the
      cognitive effects and the neural mechanisms of TCC.
