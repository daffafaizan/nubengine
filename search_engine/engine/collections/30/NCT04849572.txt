      duration and sleep quality in an Appalachian community. To accomplish these aims, the
      investigators will assess changes in sleep duration by the Oura ring and the PSQI and Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Secondary aims are to determine whether sleep hygiene education
      decreases heart rate variability measured by the Oura ring and improves alertness as assessed
      by psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT). Potential participants will be recruited via
      brochures, poster displays and on-line media to participate in the study. Those eligible will
      be asked to complete a questionnaire to record baseline demographics. The data collected will
      be demographic information, presence of chronic medical conditions, validated sleep
      questionnaires, PVT results and Oura ring (https://ouraring.com/) output. A total of 100
      subjects (50 per group) will be randomized to each treatment group, stratified by gender. The
      first group will receive the intervention and be enrolled into the trial after the run-in
      period and the baseline data collection, and the second group will receive the intervention
      at 6 weeks after trial start. Each subject (in both groups) will have pre- and
      post-intervention data in this study. Therefore, the "real" control in this study is the
      subject himself/herself (after taking the difference), which will minimize any confounding
      factors/effect; If the investigators assume that more education duration will result in more
      benefit, the investigators have a chance to assess a dose-response curve ("dosage" =
      education duration). The investigators will fit a mixed-effects model with duration as a
      fixed effect, adjusting for potential confounding variables if any.
