      angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery and a
      patent outflow artery to the foot. After successful protocol-defined pre-dilatation, subjects
      that are determined not to require stenting based on defined angiographic criteria are
      randomized 2:1 to treatment with either MD02-LDCB (test arm) or standard PTA catheter
      (control arm) using similar techniques. Subjects that do not meet post-predilatation lesion
      criteria are excluded (and treated per standard practice) and followed for safety for 30
      days. Randomized subjects will have ultrasound follow-up through 2 years and are consented
      for up to 2 years clinical follow-up.
