      disability. Intracranial hypertension (ICH) is a critical risk factor of bad outcomes after
      TBI.

      Continuous infusion of hyperosmolar therapy has been proposed for the prevention or the
      treatment of ICH. Whether an early administration of continuous hyperosmolar therapy improves
      long term outcomes is uncertain. The aim of the current study is to assess the efficiency and
      the safety of continuous hyperosmolar therapy in TBI patients.

      Methods The COBI (Continuous hyperosmolar therapy in traumatic brain-injured patients) trial
      is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, two-arms study with blinded
      adjudication of primary outcome. Three hundred and seventy patients hospitalized in Intensive
      Care Unit with a traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale â‰¤ 12 and abnormal brain CT-scan)
      are randomized in the first 24 hours following trauma to standard care or continuous
      hyperosmolar therapy (NaCl 20%) plus standard care. Continuous hyperosmolar therapy is
      maintained for at least 48 hours in the treatment group and continued for as long as is
      necessary to prevent intracranial hypertension. The primary outcome is the score on the
      Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at 6 months. The treatment effect is estimated with
      ordinal logistic regression adjusted for pre-specified prognostic factors and expressed as a
      common odds ratio.

      Discussion The COBI trial is the first randomized controlled trial powered to investigate
      whether continuous hyperosmolar therapy in TBI patients improve long term recovery.
