      criteria are met and they agree to participate. The participant will take RAD001 (Everolimus)
      10mg by mouth once a day. During the first cycle, they will have blood work done once a week
      (4 weeks). On cycles thereafter they will have blood work on days 7 and 21. Once a month, the
      patient will have a chest x-ray. Every 8 weeks the patient will have a CT scan of the chest,
      abdomen and pelvis. If clinically indicated, additional tests will be done.
