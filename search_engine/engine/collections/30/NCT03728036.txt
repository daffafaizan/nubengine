      Pre-clinical research has pointed towards a time window of enhanced responsiveness to therapy
      early after stroke. For example, training has led to substantial recovery if initiated 5 or
      14, but not 30 days post-stroke in a rodent model (Biernaski 2004). It is suggested that this
      early period is characterized by heightened levels of plasticity and that training can
      exploit this leading to improved outcome. The typically observed non-linear recovery pattern
      in stroke survivors (Kwakkel 2004) might suggest that similar mechanisms are induced in the
      human brain, however clinical research on this is disappointingly sparse.

      In two closely inter-related phases, we aim to examine the biomechanical changes related to
      walking recovery in general (Phase I) and the specific effects of robot-assisted training
      (Phase II). By that, we aim to detect a time window in stroke survivors which resembles the
      same characteristics as observed in animal models. To initiate gait training at an early
      stage, when patients usually present severe weakness and balance deficits, a mobile
      exoskeleton is used which is developed to provide intensive walking practice.

      OBJECTIVES:

      (I.a) Is there a distinct time window of behavioral restitution (i.e., returning towards
      pre-stroke movement patterns) underlying early walking recovery?

      (I.b) Are improvements in standing and walking throughout the first 6 months post-stroke
      explained by behavioral restitution or learning to use compensation strategies?
