      Children's & Women's Hospital as well as St.Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, B.C., Canada. If
      deemed eligible for the study (meeting a diagnosis of postpartum depression with or without
      comorbid anxiety disorder) and the potential participant agrees to participate, consent will
      be signed. The participant will return on a bi-weekly basis for study visits, where mood and
      anxiety will be monitored, in addition to blood pressure and weight. Starting dose of
      Desvenlafaxine is 50mg, and this can be titrated to 100mg/per day if needed. Questionnaires
      will assess depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, panic disorder,
      obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.
