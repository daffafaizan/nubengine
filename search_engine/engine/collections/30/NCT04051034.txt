      following experimental treatments:

        1. 4 g omega 3 daily for 12 weeks combined with 6 weeks of heat therapy

        2. Placebo pill daily for 12 weeks with 6 weeks of heat therapy (HT)

      non-obese healthy will only serve as controls and enroll in placebo and neutral control
      therapy conditions.

      HT will entail 14 consecutive days of 1.5 hours passive heating (increase internal
      temperature 1.2Â°C above baseline), followed by 4 weeks of HT, 3 days per week.
