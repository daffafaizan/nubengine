      bilioenteric reconstruction. However bilioenteric anastomosis is associated with long term
      complications including intrahepatic bile ducts infection, specific complications related to
      the Roux en Y jejunal loop and eliminate the endoscopic access to intrahepatic bile ducts.
      The investigators had recently developed a new surgical technique to reconstruct the veins
      with the parietal peritoneum with excellent results. Accordingly the investigators decided to
      develop a new surgical technique in order to reconstruct the bile duct defects with the
      vascularized round ligament.
