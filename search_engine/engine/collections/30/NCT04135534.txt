      operative pain for different surgeries, claiming that less nausea and vomiting with the same
      analgesic effect when comparing with morphine.

      However, several studies concerning post pain management usually used nalbuphine 0.15-0.3
      mg/kg for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. If the analgesic effect of nalbuphine is similar with
      morphine, less nalbuphine injection could reduce the side effects of opioid.

      The investigators will randomize patients into three groups of different initial nalbuphine
      dose for post laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgical pain, and set patient control analgesia
      machine with nalbuphine for further pain management. If the pain or side effects of opioid
      were intolerable, the investigators will change pain medications into NSAIDs or other
      adequate medications to comfort the patient.

      The primary outcome were numerical rating pain score and consumption of nalbuphine. The
      secondary outcomes were nausea, vomiting, pruritus and satisfactory score, and if any other
      medications use.
