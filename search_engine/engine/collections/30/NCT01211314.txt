    
      This is a single centre observational uncontrolled prospective study, Hypertensive patients
      that are either treatment naïve or uncontrolled on current therapy [one or two drugs] and
      meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be assigned to Vasodip-Combo 20 as unique
      drug treatment. The treatment will then be continued for additional 4 weeks. Office blood
      pressure will be performed by the physician at each visit. 24 h. ambulatory blood pressure
      measurements [ABPM] and blood samples for electrolytes, creatinine and urea will be taken at
      base line visit and at at week 4.

      Efficacy will be defined in terms of therapeutic goals expressed as target blood pressures
      according to World Health Organization and European society of Hypertension [ for office
      blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure measurements] criteria:

      Office Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg and Systolic blood pressure ≤ 140
      mmHg for non-diabetics or Diastolic Blood Pressure ≤ 80 mmHg and Systolic Blood Pressure ≤
      130 mmHg for diabetics, respectively.

      24 h Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurements: 224 Hour: Diastolic Blood Pressure≤ 80 mmHg and
      Systolic Blood Pressure ≤ 130 mmHg, Awake time: Diastolic Blood Pressure ≤ 85 mmHg,Systolic
      Blood Pressure ≤ 135 mmHg Asleep Time: Diastolic Blood Pressure ≤70 mmHg, Systolic Blood
      Pressure ≤ 70 mmHg.

      Effectiveness and Safety will also be evaluated taking into consideration patient compliance

      Safety assessments:

      Safety will be assessed by means of (S)Adverse effects reporting.
