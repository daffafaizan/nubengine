    
      This study is designed to examine the effectiveness of isometric handgrip therapy in patients
      diagnosed with prehypertension or hypertension who are not at target BP and who have not
      taken antihypertensive medication for more than 30 days before study entry. The
      investigational plan examines blood pressure (BP) changes in up to 230 patients randomized to
      either the Zona Plus device (i.e., the device proposed for marketing), or to a Placebo "sham"
      device (which is intentionally calibrated for a "weaker grip" device).
