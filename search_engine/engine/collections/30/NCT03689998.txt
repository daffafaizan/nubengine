      occurring naturally in plants, microbes and animals. The circulating level of the melatonin
      hormone in animals shows interesting variations, by entertainment of variable biological
      functions in a daily cycle "circadian rhythm". Melatonin called hormone of night is secreted
      by the pineal gland, and its plasma levels concentration are 50 folds higher in night in
      comparison to daytime. A variety of peripheral cells play a role in production of melatonin
      such as epithelial cells, bone marrow cells, and lymphocytes. Though melatonin is a hormone,
      it does not act on a specific organ, it has several functions; stimulation of the synthesis
      of type I collagen fibers, regulation of the body temperature, sexual development,
      antioxidant scavenging and detoxifying free radicals thus inhibiting the process of bone
      resorption through interfering with the function of osteoclasts.
