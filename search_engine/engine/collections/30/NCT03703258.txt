      prevent high-risk drinking and PTSD in women who have experienced sexual assault (SA) in the
      past 10 weeks. In the pilot trial phase of this study, intervention feasibility will be
      tested in an open trial with N = 40 women with past-10-week SA histories, active drinking,
      and elevated distress. Participants will complete surveys at baseline, termination, and
      3-month follow-up. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention (N = 20) or
      assessment-only control (N = 20). We hypothesize that (H1) most participants will respond
      positively on items assessing satisfaction with the intervention, (H2) participants will
      report above-average usability on a standardized measure, (H3) completion rates for daily
      activities will be similar to previous web-based interventions, (H4) participants will show
      significant learning as evidenced by increases in correct responses to knowledge questions
      from baseline to post, and (H5) participants in the intervention condition will evidence less
      high-risk drinking and PTSD at 3-month follow-up than participants in the assessment-only
      condition.
