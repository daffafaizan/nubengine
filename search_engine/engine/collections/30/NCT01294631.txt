      staff will know the names and doses of assigned study treatments. All volunteers will receive
      the same treatment. Canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitor) is currently
      under development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a drug indicated for the treatment of patients with
      mild to moderate hypertension. During Period 1, volunteers will take canagliflozin 300 mg
      once daily for 7 days (Days 1 to 7) and during Period 2, volunteers will take HCTZ 25 mg once
      daily for 28 days (Days 1 to 28), and then starting on Day 29, will take canagliflozin 300 mg
      once daily and HCTZ 25 mg once daily for 7 days (Days 29 to 35). Period 1 and Period 2 will
      be separated by a minimum of 14 days.
