      current approaches have not adequately reduced chronic disease morbidity. Nutrigenomics has
      great potential, however, it is complicated to implement. There is a need for products,
      derived from nutrigenomics, which are easily understood, accessible and utilized. The primary
      objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a non-practitioner assisted
      direct-to-consumer (DTC) self-driven approach to nutrigenomics versus a personalized
      practitioner-led method. The secondary aims are to use this data combined with participant
      feedback to generate more effective nutrigenomics-based products.

      Methods:

      This 4-month study used a mixed-methods design that included: 1) a phase 1 randomized control
      trial that examined the effectiveness of a multi-faceted, nutrition-based gene test
      (components assessed included the major nutrients, food tolerances, food taste and
      preferences, and vitamins) in changing health behaviours; followed by 2) qualitative
      investigation that explored participants' experiences. The study recruited 57 healthy males
      and females (35-55 years) randomized as a 2:1 ratio where 38 received the intervention
      (gene-test results plus personalized nutrition report) and 19 were assigned to the control
      group (gene-test results report emailed). Both groups received follow-up emails with
      nutrition-related tips and reminders. The primary outcomes of interest measures included
      changes in diet (nutrients, healthy eating index), self-efficacy, quality of life and
      anthropometrics (BMI, waist:hip) measured at baseline, post-intervention (3 and 6 weeks), and
      the final visit. After the study has been completed, participants in the control group will
      also receive their personalized nutrition report.
