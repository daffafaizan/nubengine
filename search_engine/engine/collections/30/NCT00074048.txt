      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with cladribine-resistant hairy cell leukemia
           treated with BL22 immunotoxin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response duration in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate BL22 blood levels and toxicity of this drug with the development of
           neutralizing antibodies in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive BL22 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 followed by
      rest.

      Patients are then evaluated at 8 weeks. Patients achieving complete hematologic remission are
      followed. All other patients continue to receive BL22 immunotoxin as above on days 1, 3, and
      5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to a total of 16 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving CR without minimal residual disease
      (MRD) receive 2 courses beyond CR. Patients achieving CR with MRD receive 4 courses beyond
      CR.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
