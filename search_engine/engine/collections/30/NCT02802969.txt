      skull base chordoma and mobile spine, surgery is often incomplete. On the contrary, surgery
      of the sacral region (for which the block excision is often possible) brings a better
      therapeutic outcome. Radiotherapy with high-dose supplement improves the outcomes for all
      these lesions.

      Intratumoral hypoxia is a primary factor of radioresistance, it's known since long by
      radiation oncologists. [18F]FAZA gives an image of the hypoxic volume target. Investigators
      propose to increase the radioactive dose in the hypoxic volume target but in order to
      succeed, radiation oncologists have to precisely identify this hypoxic volume. Radiation
      oncologists would increase of 10% the radioactive dose that will allow us to improve local
      control at 3 years of 15% without any additional side effect.
