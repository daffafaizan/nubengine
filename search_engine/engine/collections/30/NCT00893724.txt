      reacting with oxygen to form toxins that damage both somatic and mitochondrial DNA. The
      potential for protecting the DNA and promoting repair by using nutritional supplements will
      be tested by augmenting standard treatments for DME and NAMD with such supplements. The
      patients will be randomized to treatment group and placebo group and followed up for a year
      in a double masked fashion. Anatomic and visual outcomes, as well as side effects will be
      assessed and analyzed. If the results are promising, this pilot study can be used to design
      alternative (cheaper, better and longer lasting) treatments for DME, NAMD and perhaps other
      chronic illnesses.
