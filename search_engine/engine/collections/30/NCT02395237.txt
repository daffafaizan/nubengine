    
      An open-label, randomized, two-treatment crossover bioequivalence study comparing two batches
      of the same fixed dose combinations Amaryl® M IR 2/1000 (glimepiride/metformin hydrochloride
      immediate release combination tablet) in fed conditions in healthy male and/or female
      subjects.

      Primary Objective To assess, after single oral administration under fed conditions, the
      bioequivalence between the two batches of the same glimepiride/metformin hydrochloride (HCl)
      2 mg/1000 mg fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets (immediate release combination tablet
      Amaryl® M IR 2/1000) manufactured in India and in Turkey.

      Secondary Objective(s) To assess the safety (including hypoglycemic events) of the two FDC
      (Amaryl® M IR 2/1000) tablets.

      Up to 50 healthy subjects are to be enrolled to have 46 subjects available for the final
      pharmacokinetic evaluation.

      Study treatment:

      In each period A single dose of glimepiride/metformin HCl 2mg/1000 mg FDC (manufactured in
      India) Or single dose of glimepiride/metformin HCl 2mg/1000 mg FDC (manufactured in Turkey)
      will be administered after breakfast.

      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)

      Primary Endpoint:

      Glimepiride and metformin: Cmax and AUClast

      Secondary Endpoint(s):

      Glimepiride and metformin: AUC0-inf, tlag, tmax and t1/2z Safety

      DURATION OF STUDY (per patient) Screening : up to 15 days Treatments periods: 4 days each
      including treatment day Wash-out period: 4 to 7 days Follow-up: 4 to 7 days Total study
      duration: 37 days
