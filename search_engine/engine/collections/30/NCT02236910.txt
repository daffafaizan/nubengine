      other cancers that can be utilized for molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting. The most
      important is somatostatin. Somatostatin receptors are useful tools in the diagnosis and
      treatment of NET tumours because the somatostatin analogue octreotate can be radiolabeled
      with lutetium-177 for imaging and therapy.

      In selected populations of patients, radioisotope therapy in expert hands has been shown to
      be a safe and effective palliative therapy with stable disease, progression free survival
      benefit, symptom control and improvements in quality of life. Lutetium-177 (DOTA0, Tyr3)
      octreotate has been used in a significant number of clinical studies shown to be safe and
      effective as a therapeutic agent in patients with NET tumours. The investigators intend to
      further confirm these benefits with lutetium-177 octreotate, which could form the basis for a
      national registry study leading to registration of this therapeutic intervention.
