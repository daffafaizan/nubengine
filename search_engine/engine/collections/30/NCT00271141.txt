      in Parkinson's disease we plan to monitor the metabolism a a new molecule (LTG) in the blood
      samples of Parkinson's disease patients and compare them to controls. We shall use 10 cc of
      venous blood and analyze serum, white blood cells and platelets. We shall not extract nor use
      DNA.The main purpose is to develop a marker for Parkinson's disease in venous blood.
