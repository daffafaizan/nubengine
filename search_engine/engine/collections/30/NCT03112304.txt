      trained) or Wave 2 (newly MATCH trained) and using a clinical monitoring system (TRAC) to
      measure youth outcomes over time. Participating therapists receive weekly MATCH consultation
      provided by the Judge Baker Children's Center/Harvard University research team or by Maine
      clinic supervisors who are MATCH Associate Consultants. The investigators are also developing
      and testing new low-cost measures of MATCH treatment and consultation fidelity to explore the
      feasibility of more sustainable measures of MATCH adherence. Study data will be used to
      answer questions about the sustainability of MATCH in the public sector.
