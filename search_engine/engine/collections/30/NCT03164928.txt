      Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Denosumab in Pediatric Subjects With
      Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis

      Study Phase: 3 Indication: Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of denosumab on lumbar spine bone mineral density
      (BMD) Z-score as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at 12 months in children
      5 to 17 years of age with Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis (GiOP).

      Secondary Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of denosumab in children 5 to 17 years of age
      with GiOP with respect to:

        -  Change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score as assessed by DXA from baseline to 6, 18, 24, and 36
           months

        -  Change in proximal femur BMD Z-score as assessed by DXA from baseline to 6, 12, 18, 24,
           and 36 months

        -  Incidence of X-ray confirmed long-bone fractures and new and worsening vertebral
           fractures from pretreatment to posttreatment at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Incidence of improving vertebral fractures from pretreatment to posttreatment at 12, 24,
           and 36 months (overall, among subjects with clinical fracture reduction, and among
           subjects with clinical fracture increase)

        -  Incidence of pretreatment compared with posttreatment vertebral and nonvertebral
           fractures at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in Childhood Health Questionnaire - Parent Form-50 (CHQ-PF-50) Physical Summary
           Score at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in CHQ-PF-50 Psychological Summary Score at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) Disability Index Score at 12,
           24, and 36 months

        -  Change in Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) at 12, 24, and 36 months

        -  Change in growth velocity, determined by calculating age-adjusted Z-scores for height,
           weight, and body mass index (BMI), at 24 and 36 months

        -  Serum concentration of denosumab at 1 and 10 days, and 6, 12, and 18 months (additional
           serum denosumab pharmacokinetics [PK] samples to be collected at day 30 and month 3 in a
           PK/bone turnover marker [BTM] substudy of up to 100 subjects) Hypotheses: The hypothesis
           of this study is that the change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD Z-score following 12
           months of denosumab treatment in children 5 to 17 years of age with GiOP will be greater
           than placebo.
