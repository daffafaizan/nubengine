    
      This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, non-comparative early access program
      designed to provide telaprevir to patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1, who
      have a documented diagnosis of liver fibrosis and compensated liver disease (Child Pugh Grade
      A), and are expected to benefit from telaprevir-based therapy. Patients will be excluded if
      they are eligible for enrollment into an ongoing clinical study of telaprevir. Enrollment of
      patients into this study will continue until telaprevir becomes available for reimbursement
      in the country in which a patient resides or until September 2013, whichever occurs first,
      unless otherwise indicated per local regulations. During the first 12 weeks of the study, all
      patients will receive telaprevir administered orally with food every 8 hours in combination
      with peginterferon-alfa/ribavirin [PEG-IFN-alfa/RBV]). Patients will then be treated with
      Peg-IFN-alfa/RBV alone for an additional 12 or 36 weeks, based on how they respond to
      treatment (assessed by levels of hepatitis C viral RNA in the plasma, which reflects the
      number of virus particles in the bloodstream) and/or by type of patient (patients with severe
      fibrosis who had not received prior treatment or had previously relapsed during treatment,
      patients with prior partial or null response [who had only partially or had not responded to
      previous treatment], patients who had viral breakthrough [recurrence of viral copies during
      antiviral treatment], or patients with cirrhosis). For all patients, rules will be applied to
      ensure that telaprevir or Peg-IFN-alfa/RBV are stopped if subjects have viral breakthrough or
      treatment failure. All patients should have a follow up visit (including measurement of
      hepatitis C viral RNA levels in the bloodstream) 24 weeks after the last administered dose of
      any treatment. Dose modifications of telaprevir are prohibited and once telaprevir treatment
      is discontinued it may not be reinitiated in this study.
