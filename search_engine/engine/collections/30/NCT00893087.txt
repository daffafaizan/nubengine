      patients own breathing pattern. Asynchrony during ventilatory care may increase the risk for
      complications, make the weaning more difficult and may affect the survival rates.

      In this study we will compare two currently used methods pressure- and flow-triggering with a
      neurally adjusted ventilatory assist in synchronization of the ventilator support with
      patients own efforts.
