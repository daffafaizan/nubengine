      in about one third of patients after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Affected
      patients have chronic leg pain and swelling, and sometimes develop skin ulcers. At present,
      there is little to offer for the treatment of this condition. Prevention of PTS is the key to
      reducing its burden on patients and society. Elastic compression stockings (ECS) for two
      years following DVT could be helpful in preventing or delaying onset of PTS at three years,
      however data supporting this is limited.
