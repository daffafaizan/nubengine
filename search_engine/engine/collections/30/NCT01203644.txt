    
      SKY0402 was administered in a dose escalating/de-escalating fashion, with a low starting dose
      in Cohort 1 that was to be increased or decreased in subsequent cohorts based on safety and
      analgesic effects. The decision to proceed to the next cohort (i.e., increase or decrease the
      dose) was made by a Cohort Data Review Committee following a review of the data from the
      previous cohort. Subjects were randomized to receive either SKY0402 or bupivacaine HCl at a
      ratio of 1:1 in Cohort 1 and at a ratio of 3:1 in subsequent cohorts. The dose of bupivacaine
      HCl (100 mg) remained constant for all cohorts.
