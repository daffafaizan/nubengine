    
      Aortic replacement combined with coronary bypass surgery has an impact on the risk profile
      for the direct postoperative course and also on the long-time survival perspective.

      The advantage of rapid deployment aortic valve prostheses, like the Edward Intuity Elite
      Valve that is used in this registry, is the greater ease of implantation, because only a few
      sutures are necessary to secure the device compared to a conventional prosthesis, where more
      then ten sutures are needed. In procedures where the aortic valve replacement (AVR) is
      combined with a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), the use of a rapid deployment valve can
      shorten the duration of cardiac ischemia and the overall intervention duration, which
      possibly has an influence on clinical results.
