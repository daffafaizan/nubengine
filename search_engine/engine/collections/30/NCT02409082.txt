      worse prognosis following an acute hip fracture. This has been demonstrated in retrospective
      studies. In this study we admit all patients with a hip fracture planned tro receive a spinal
      anesthesia. Our golden standard of anesthesia in this patient cohort. Preoperatively Clinical
      Dementia Score is assessed after study inclosure. At the performance of the spinal dosage is
      standardized. Prior to giving this 5 ml of CSF is collected and blood is collected. Blood is
      then collected at intervals up until day 3 postoperatively. We plan to analyze beta-amyloid
      and tau in CSF and plasma to verify AD diagnosis in patients with acute hip fracture.
      Mortality is assessed at 30 days, 3 months and 1 year. Morbidity is assessed at, 3 months and
      >1 year. Neuromarkers specifically addressing the inflammatory component are to be analyzed
      and correlated to outcome together with AD markers, as above.
