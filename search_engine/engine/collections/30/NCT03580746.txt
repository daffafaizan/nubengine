      the investigators use the Ponseti method with manipulation and immobilization of the foot. In
      this study the invistigators should like to demonstrate the better outcome in clinical
      results and in gait analysis of patients treated with the Ponseti method, compared to the
      'older' methods of taping and posteromedial release. Trial objectives With this study the
      investigators would like to investigate whether clinical results and gait analysis in
      patients treated with Ponseti has better results compared to patients treated with the older
      methods.
