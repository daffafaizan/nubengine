      The first part is an observational study, reviewing routinely obtained clinical information
      (such as echocardiograms) to assess whether patients with pulmonary hypertension have
      electrical or mechanical dysynchrony. If so, we will proceed to the second part of the study
      which will assess whether temporarily pacing the right ventricle, during a clinically
      indicated catheterization can acutely improve hemodynamics. We will also gather control data
      for phase 1 from clinically indicated echos and ECG's in patients with ASD's (RV volume load)
      and in patients who are evaluated for an innocent murmur ( Nl heart). We hope to learn
      whether patients with pulmonary hypertension, and compromised right ventricles have
      electrical and mechanical dysnchrony. If this is true, it is theoretically possible that
      resynchronization (pacing) of the right ventricle could improve hemodynamics, symptoms and
      long term outcomes.
