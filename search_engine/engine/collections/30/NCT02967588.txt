        -  All stages of the intervention will take place during hospitalization.

        -  Firstly, patients will complete a questionnaire based on the Beliefs about Medication
           Questionnaire-Specific (BMQ-S) (Horne & Weinmen, 1999).

        -  Patients responses to this questionnaire will form the basis of Session 1 where beliefs
           about medicines will be discussed. The aim is to identify any negative or erroneous
           beliefs patients have that may prevent them from taking their medicines after they leave
           the hospital.

        -  Session 2 will focus on developing specific action plans for taking medication at home.
           Patients will be asked to formulate an if-then plan ('If it is time X in place Y and I
           am doing Z, then I will take my pill dose'. The aim is to make taking their medicines as
           much a part of their daily routine as possible.

        -  Prior to discharge, patients will complete the beliefs questionnaire again to see if
           there has been any shift in their beliefs about medications.

        -  Patients will also be asked to provide detailed feedback about the study. The
           investigators want to know whether the intervention setting (i.e. hospital-based),
           timing (i.e. straight after an ACS), content (i.e. targeting both intentional and
           unintentional non-adherence) and interventionist (i.e. PhD candidate) seem to be
           acceptable to patients.

        -  Feedback will be gathered after completion of the intervention and also during a follow
           up phone call 2-3 weeks after discharge.
