      Senegal, a population representative of rural impoverished Africa. Villages will be
      randomized to TIV or a beneficial control vaccine-inactivated polio vaccine-and children 6
      months to 10 years of age will be targeted for vaccination. Four hundred children will be
      further enrolled into an immunogenicity and safety substudy which will measure their immune
      response to vaccination and assess in detail reactions and adverse events to the vaccines in
      these populations. For evaluation of effectiveness, passive and active surveillance will be
      conducted to identify laboratory-confirmed influenza among enrolled children and in the
      population in which they live. Such surveillance will also allow a determination of the rates
      of influenza and a description of the clinical characteristics of the disease in an African
      population. With such epidemiologic data, national and global public health officials will
      have better data for developing future influenza control strategies for either seasonal or
      pandemic influenza.
