      decade. Recently, a combination of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)
      was reported to have significant efficacy in advanced pancreatic cancer. Preclinical data
      suggests synergy between irinotecan and 5FU as well as between oxaliplatin and 5FU. Results
      of a phase II trial in advanced disease were reported in 2005 demonstrating a 26% confirmed
      response rate and median overall survival of 10.2 months. A follow-up phase III trial
      comparing FOLFIRINOX with gemcitabine for patients <75 years of age with advanced pancreatic
      cancer was presented at ASCO 2010 revealing improvement in PFS (6.4 vs 3.3 months, p=<.0001)
      and improved disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) (70.2% vs 50.9%, p=.0003). The most notable
      result was an impressive improvement in median overall survival with FOLFIRINOX compared to
      gemcitabine (11.1vs 6.8 months, p-value = <.0001, HR=.57). The main toxicity was grade 3/4
      neutropenia (45.7% vs 18.7%, p=.0001) and increased risk of febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs
      0.6%, p=.009)31.
