      Manometry studies involve placing catheters in the nose and are often poorly tolerated by
      children. Also, placement of the catheter requires sedation or anesthesia, the manometry test
      lasts several hours and involves ingestion of a meal which many children find difficult when
      having a catheter in their nose. The reason we are conducting this study is because we would
      like to find a new, less invasive, equally informative test for understanding
      gastrointestinal motility.

      The SmartPill GI Monitoring System uses a capsule, about the size of a large vitamin or
      PillCam capsule, which is swallowed and passed through the stool. While in the GI tract, the
      capsule measures the acidity (pH) and pressures, and these measurements are used to determine
      how long it takes for food to leave the stomach. Pressure and pH information are sent by the
      capsule to a receiver that the patient will either wear on the belt or keep within 2 feet.
      The receiver stores data collected about the pH, temperature, and pressure inside the GI
      tract. The SmartPill GI Monitoring System has already been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in adults but not in children.
