      surgeons now prefer autografts with the patellar tendon or semitendinosus tendon. The
      functional outcome after ACL reconstruction with the patellar or semitendinosus tendon has
      been a recent area of interest. Soccer is the most popular sport worldwide with more than 260
      million active players, and it is hard to say if patellar tendon or semitendinosus grafts
      have different outcomes.

      The purpose of this study was to specifically evaluate outcomes of bone-patellar tendon-bone
      autograft versus hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction in soccer players. The hypothesis of
      this study was that hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction would provide no statistically
      significant differences in patient-reported outcome scores, postoperative level of sports
      function, and harvest-site morbidity when compared with patellar tendon autograft .The
      Cincinnati Knee Rating System (CKRS) was chosen as the primary outcome. As secondary outcome,
      reruptures.

      Between march 2016 and march 2017, 60 soccer players will be operated. The investigators
      consider as soccer players those who play more than 4 times a week. Once included in the
      study, they will be randomized in two groups: "hamstring group" and "patellar tendon group".

      The final clinical evaluation with two years. For both groups, the technique is the same, the
      fixation of the grafts with metal interference screws. Femoral tunnel will be drilled with
      outside-in technique. The tibial tunnel with conventional 55 degrees guide.

      Both groups of patients will receive the same physical therapy protocol. Data will be
      evaluated with the SPSS software for Windows (version 13.0).
