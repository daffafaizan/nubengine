      - is a relatively new area of research. Previous work suggests that subjects require an
      average of between two and three testing sessions of approximately an hour each before they
      can reliably detect NEFA, and the average number of visits to get the lowest threshold is
      six. Streamlining this process is of great interest to researchers who wish to test many
      people as quickly as possible. Other taste qualities, including umami and sweet, have shown
      improvement in detection sensitivity in subjects that have undergone ten second exposures to
      these taste qualities for 10 days upon subsequent re-testing. We seek to determine if the
      same improvements can be seen with fat taste.
