      ventilation (no need for synchronization, high efficiency in CO2 removal, less
      volume/barotrauma) and nasal CPAP (non-invasive interface, oxygenation improvement by the
      increase in functional residual capacity through alveolar recruitment). NHFOV should allow to
      increase mean airway pressure (Paw) avoiding gas trapping and hypercarbia, thanks to the
      superimposed high frequency oscillations. Therefore, NHFOV is more likely to be beneficial
      for those neonates requiring high distending pressure to open up their lungs, such as babies
      at high risk of extubation failure due to severity of their lung disease. This may also be
      the case of extremely preterm, BPD-developing neonates who have increased airway resistances,
      while they are subjected to a deranged alveolarization and lung growth. Neonates presenting
      with respiratory acidosis may also benefit from NHFOV. Several animal and bench studies
      investigated the physiology and peculiarities of NHFOV and these data should be used to
      conduct a physiology-guided trial in order to avoid errors done in the early trials about
      invasive high frequency ventilation.

      This study will be the first large trial aiming to compare CPAP vs NIPPV vs NHFOV in preterm
      neonates after surfactant replacement and during their entire NICU stay, to reduce the total
      need of invasive ventilation. Since there is a lack of formal data regarding NHFOV safety,
      some safety outcomes will also be considered.Specific subgroup analysis will be conducted for
      pre-specified groups of patients who may most likely benefit from NHFOV, according to the
      above-described physiological characteristics.
