      involves the application of two or more treatments in one single-subject [Portney and
      Watkins, 2000; Barlow and Hersen, 1984]. It is used to compare the effects of two or more
      treatments. Consenting patients will be randomized by computer generated permuted block
      randomization of 5 to receive different mobilization treatments. Allocation concealment will
      be ensured and the study biostatistician will keep the assignment scheme. In group one, an
      A-B-A-C (A: mid-range mobilization, B: end-range mobilization, C: mobilization with movement)
      multiple-treatment design will be used. In group two, an A-C-A-B multiple-treatment design
      will be used. The two groups used here are intended to counterbalance the order effects of
      treatments. There will be three weeks of each phase. The differences in outcomes across the
      four phases of the study will be examined. An independent trained outcome assessor, blinded
      to treatment allocation, will evaluate the participates at baseline and at 3-week intervals
      for 12 weeks.
