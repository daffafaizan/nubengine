    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of the use of an evidence-based
      decision support system (EBMeDS) in daily Belgian family medicine and to study the
      effectiveness of EBMeDS use on improving diabetes care.

      Specific research questions are:

        -  Does family physicians use the EBMeDS system in daily practice?

        -  Does the use of the EBMeDS system by family physicians leads to an improvement in
           diabetes control compared to the control group?
