    
      -  Participants are washed ot from all glaucoma medication for 6 weeks

        -  one eye per participant is investigated (study eye)

        -  24-h intraocular pressure (IOP) curve is obtained with Goldmann tonometry and Sensimed
           contact lens sensor tonometry twice, in 14 days

        -  for Sensimed contact lens curves median values (in arbitrary units), for Goldmann
           applanation tonometry, mean and SD values are used to characterize the curves, for
           comparisions % changes are used for the corresponding time periods

        -  treatment (travoprost 0.005% 1/day) is given to all eyes for 3 months 24-h Goldmann and
           Sensimed IOP curves are repeated

        -  IOP curves are determined in arbitrary units and mmHg, respectively, and compared for
           reproducibility (untreated phase) and relative (%)change (untreated curve vs. under
           treatment curve) with both methods, respectively
