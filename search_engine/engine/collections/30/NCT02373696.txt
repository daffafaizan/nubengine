      pain during activities of daily living. Demographic factors, psychophysical factors
      (mechanical temporal summation, diffuse noxious inhibitory control, state trait anxiety
      inventory) and genetic screening are used to predict the association with persistent post
      surgical pain. Phone survey follow up is performed to investigate the incidence of persistent
      post surgical pain and functional limitations due to pain experienced.
