      safety, and pharmacokinetics of capecitabine (Xeloda®) rapidly disintegrating tablets and
      concomitant radiation therapy in children and adolescent patients with newly diagnosed
      brainstem glioma. There were 2 phases to the study: A 9-week radiation phase, followed by a
      2-week rest period, and a 9-week post-radiation phase. In the radiation phase, capecitabine
      650 mg/m^2 was administered orally twice daily for 9 weeks. Concomitantly, patients received
      radiation therapy (180 cGy fractions) 5 days a week for a total target dose of 56 Gy. During
      the 9-week post-radiation phase of the study, capecitabine 1250 mg/m^2 was administered
      orally twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. This cycle of 14 days
      treatment followed by 7 days rest was repeated 2 additional times. The dose could be adjusted
      according to toxicity and body surface area.

      The single-arm phase 1 study NO18517 (NCT00532948) assessed the maximum tolerated dose and
      dose-limiting toxicities of capecitabine (Xeloda®) administered concurrently with radiation
      therapy in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic brain stem gliomas and high grade
      gliomas. Patients in the phase 1 study NO18517 who were diagnosed with intrinsic brainstem
      glioma and who were treated at the established maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine 650
      mg/m^2/dose twice a day were included in the analyses of the phase 2 study NO21125.

      The efficacy and safety results of study NO21125 are reported below.
