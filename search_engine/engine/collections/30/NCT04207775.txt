    
      The objectives of this study are to assess molecular testing, treatment patterns, and
      associated clinical outcomes among patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have
      progressed from first-line EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. This study is
      descriptive in nature and does not attempt to test any specific a priori hypotheses.
