      in female patients with stress incontinence.

      Information and evidence needs to be translated into nursing practice and applied to clinical
      decision-making in stress incontinence cases. Evidence-based study models such as the Star
      model provide guidance on using evidence to develop clinical guidelines and care protocols.
      The Star model is designed to improve patient outcomes by creating a bridge between research
      and clinical practice. There is currently no published stress incontinence care protocol
      based on the Star model. Although there is one published study of a care protocol for urinary
      incontinence, this protocol was not drawn up on the basis of an evidence-based model.

      Women that matched the sample criteria were recruited into the study. After their consent was
      obtained, the women were randomized into an intervention and a control group. The women in
      the intervention group were provided care according to stress incontinence care protocol. The
      control group received no intervention during the eight-week intervention period.
