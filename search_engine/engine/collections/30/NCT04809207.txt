    
      This study aims to test the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a tailored
      intervention known as the CF Wellness Program (CFWP) to treat clinically elevated fatigue in
      adults with CF. This is a pre-post pilot intervention study of the CF-Wellness Program. This
      study is needed because fatigue negatively affects health-related quality of life and has
      been identified by those with CF as a symptom that needs to be addressed. The study will
      include approximately 40 participants and the intervention will last approximately 13 weeks.
