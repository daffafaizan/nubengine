      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BMS-247550 when given in combination with
      carboplatin in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and safety of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine,
      preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      V. Correlate the protein expression of survivin with the expression of other apoptotic
      regulators, the apoptotic index, and response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-247550.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 followed by carboplatin IV
      over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR)
      receive 2 additional courses after achieving CR or up to a total of 6 courses. The first two
      cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).The third and fourth
      cohorts of 10 patients each receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the MTD is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3 of 10 patients
      experience DLT. Once the MTD is determined for the third and fourth cohorts, 15 additional
      patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed for 30 days.
