      with epirubicin plus paclitaxel versus cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil in
      women with stage IIA, IIB, or III breast cancer. II. Compare quality of life in these women
      with these treatment regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms within 35 days of surgery. Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin IV followed by
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Arm II:
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, epirubicin IV, and fluorouracil IV on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are postmenopausal, or premenopausal and
      hormone receptor positive, receive tamoxifen orally once a day for 5 years starting on day 1.
      Patients receive radiotherapy to residual breast after 4 courses of chemotherapy. Quality of
      life is assessed. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years.
