    
      Mardird sonographic enthesis index (MASEI) was one of the most wide used scoring systems for
      peripheral enthesitis and the only one based on OMERACT definition of enthesopathy by EULAR.
      The primary purpose is to assess the MASEI to discover the value of US in diagnosis and
      prognosis. The second prupose is to assess different maintaining treatment programme in SpA
      patients with improvement of MASEI. The trial will include 96 patients with stable NSAIDs
      therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of Yisaipu®. Then at the
      second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA, ASDAS<2.1) at 24th week will
      be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu® group, half-dose of Yisaipu®
      group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 24 weeks. Patients who complete
      the 48-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the blind stage would finish the
      study.
