      to moderate training intensity has so far been studied. Higher aerobic intensity based on
      individual measurements of maximum oxygen uptake is more efficient in increasing oxygen
      uptake, and might prove more effective in lowering blood pressure. Group training, on the
      other hand is not individualised, but less personnel required and may prove more cost
      effective. Endurance training is shown to improve both systolic and diastolic left
      ventricular function, as well as endothelial function. Both can be measured non-invasively by
      ultrasound.

      The study is an open, randomised study with four arms, comparing:

        -  High aerobic intensity interval training

        -  Moderate aerobic intensity training

        -  Group training

        -  Controls receiving standard advice on lifestyle and training

      Training effect is measured by Max. Oxygen uptake, blood pressure by continuous 24 hour
      ambulatory measurement, Left ventricular function by echo Doppler and endothelial function by
      flow mediated vasodilation by ultrasound.

      The effect of exercise on blood pressure is dependent on continued training. All patients
      will be followed up after one year.
