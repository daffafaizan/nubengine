      receptor IL-1) and inhibits pro inflammation cytokines ( TNF-α and IL-1β). It also works as
      anti edema by correcting the disrupted blood brain barrier during infection process.
      Dexamethasone is considered to be chosen in this clinical trial due to the long half life
      among steroids, the strongest glucocorticoid effect comparing other steroids, and easy
      prepared and used on daily practice.

      There are limited data from using adjunctive steroid for treatment of HIV-associated with
      cerebral toxoplasmosis. Previous study in France published in 2012 showed steroid did not
      give any significant improvement for patients' neurological outcome and did not worsen
      patients' condition such as getting nosocomial infection. Meanwhile comparing previous study
      by Arens et. al in 2007, there was an increasing mortality rate on adjunctive steroid used in
      cerebral toxoplasmosis patients.

      As result of limited data, our trial is looked forward to answer about the efficacy of
      dexamethasone treatment in reducing mortality rate of cerebral toxoplasmosis patients.
