      blood flow is present, leading to irreversible neuronal damage at an early stage. Around the
      boundary of the ischemic core, there is a region called ischemic penumbra in which functional
      recovery is possible after recirculation of blood flow within several hours after the onset,
      even though the blood flow is markedly decreased. Prevention of nerve cell death in the
      ischemic penumbra by neuroprotective therapy should greatly improve outcome and prognosis of
      acute ischemic stroke.
