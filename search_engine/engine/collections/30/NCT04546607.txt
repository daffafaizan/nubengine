      or radiotherapy including palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy meeting the eligibility
      criteria will be consented and pre-screened for fatigue using Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI).
      Subjects will be administered a BFI questionnaire prior to the commencement of their
      chemotherapy (preferably 1st chemotherapy cycle) or radiotherapy treatment.

      Patients will be assessed again using the BFI questionnaire on day 1 of their next
      chemotherapy cycle or the following week of radiotherapy. Patients will not be considered for
      study enrolment if the fatigue severity does not increase by at least one score from the
      previous assessment during the pre-screening. Those with newly developed fatigue or worsening
      of their fatigue score (i.e. from moderate to severe, mild to moderate, or mild to severe)
      will be consented for study enrolment. The subject who signed informed consent, pre-screened
      and is subsequently eligible for study enrolment/randomization will be enrolled into either
      Nuvastatic TM or Placebo group
