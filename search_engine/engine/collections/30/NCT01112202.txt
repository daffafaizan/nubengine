      coagulation parameters in plasma samples of 70 patients after hip or knee replacement surgery
      treated with Dabigatran 150-220 mg/d. Plasma samples are obtained by blood collection before,
      after 2 hours and after 12-14 hours after Dabigatran dosing in steady state (on 3rd - 5th
      day).
