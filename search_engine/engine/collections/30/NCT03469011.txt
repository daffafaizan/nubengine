      follicular thyroid cancers will combine a focused blockade of PDGFRÎ± with radioactive iodine.
      This is based on a new model for dedifferentiation in thyroid cancer as recently published by
      Lopez-Campistrous et al., 2016 (Appendix 1). Using this model and extensive preclinical data,
      the investigators hypothesize that the relatively short course of the well-known drug
      imatinib will allow for re-differentiation of thyroid cancers permitting radioactive iodine
      transport thus restoring sensitivity to radioactive iodine. The efficacy of these agents will
      be determined in a trial of 18 patients through a short treatment phase of approximately 3
      months through which the investigators should be able to determine a clinically relevant
      response. The investigators believe this trial is highly clinically relevant and has the
      benefits of using previously well described treatments in a novel pattern that should
      maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. If successful, this trial will translate into a
      new treatment paradigm for metastatic thyroid cancer.
