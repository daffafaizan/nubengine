      allowing for a of full automated test operation. As in ROTEM® delta four different tests can
      be run simultaneously on the four channels of the analyser.

      Whereas the tests in ROTEM® delta are performed manually by pipetting a blood sample and
      liquid system reagents, in ROTEM® sigma the reagents are contained in freeze dried pellet
      form in a cartridge. Test operation is performed by inserting a cartridge and attaching a
      blood sample to the analyser.

      The five available ROTEM® tests INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM, APTEM, and HEPTEM are contained in
      different combinations in two cartridge configurations:

        -  Cartridge type 1 including INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM, APTEM

        -  Cartridge type 2 including INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM, HEPTEM

      Aim of the study is the performance evaluation of the new ROTEM® sigma coagulation analyzer
      in comparison to the current ROTEM® delta thromboelastometry system.

      As a valid method comparison requires test results that cover the whole measurement range of
      the test system it is also necessary to include acute bleeding and emergency patients in the
      study. Only the inclusion of acute bleeding and emergency patients will produce strong
      pathologic test results allowing for a valid evaluation of the test system.
