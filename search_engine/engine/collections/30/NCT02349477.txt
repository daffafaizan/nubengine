      medication, which might help them to reduce or stop their drinking or a placebo ( placebo is
      a capsule that looks the same as the investigational drug, but has no real medication. It is
      a "sugar pill"). This study will recruit and randomize subjects who have expressed an
      interest in receiving treatment for alcohol dependence. Upon enrollment into this study there
      will be 11 outpatient visits. Each visit will last about 1-1.5 hours.
