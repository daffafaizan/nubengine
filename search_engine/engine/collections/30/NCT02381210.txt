      to the pregnant women attending the Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Hospital
      Materno-Infantil Inguar√°n, tertiary level facilities in Bangladesh and Mexico City. Women
      attending the hospital with clinically confirmed cases of preeclampsia and clinically healthy
      women who deliver at term will be eligible for the study. Investigators will enroll about 200
      women at each facility. Investigators will target the following women for enrollment: women
      with clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia (severe, mild or superimposed) (n=100); and
      clinically healthy women who deliver at term (n=100). The purpose of the research is to
      determine the clinical utility of congophilia (affinity for the dye Congo Red) in the
      diagnosis and prediction of preeclampsia. Investigators will determine the diagnostic value
      of this test by testing the urine sample provided to determine the presence or absence of
      proteinuria or congophilia.
