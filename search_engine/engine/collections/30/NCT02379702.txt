      different team. Participants were visited at their addresses and informed about the research
      study and gave written consent. They were invited on an empty stomach for hospital visit on
      the day after. Pre-trained nurses completed the forms of patients during that second visit.
      After 11 years, a questionnaire by telephone survey will be applied to patients who
      participated in the METSAR-II study. The main goal is to determine the changes of metabolic
      syndrome population during that period.
