      the leg to recover more quickly from surgery. Prehabilitation or "surgery school" is done
      before surgery while undergoing other cancer-related treatments. The tumour can be anywhere
      in the leg so exercises must be specially designed for each person. This process is novel and
      therefore has to be tested to see if it is practical and if it helps people recovery more
      quickly. To test this idea, two groups will be formed. One group will have the
      prehabilitation program and the other group will have the same amount of attention from the
      research team who will visit them at the time of the radiotherapy sessions to provide support
      and any information they may need. Assessments of how well participants can do basic
      activities of daily living will be assessed at study entry, just prior to surgery and then at
      2, 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. Other measures of recovery will be distance covered while
      walking for six minutes, quality of the walking, and how quickly participants can walk
      outdoors for 1000 steps, and then 3000, 5000 and 9000. The investigators will ask
      participants which of these outcome measures they think best reflected their recovery and
      why. The investigators will also assess whether people were willing to enter the study and
      complete all the processes required. The results of the study will indicate whether it is a
      good idea to conduct a bigger study that would involve many centres in Canada.
