      take place at Richardson Centre for Functional Food and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) at University
      of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.

      The trial will recruit healthy adult participants. Participants will consent to participate
      in two acute feeding sessions. Participants will be randomized to either control (low
      avenanthramides) then treatment (high avenanthramides) or treatment then control.
      Participants will arrive at the study center fasted between 8 and 10:30 am on the session
      days. They will be provided either the study treatment or control product based on
      randomization sequence for their first study visit. Baseline blood glucose (0 min) will be
      measured in duplicate via finger stick blood sample right before their first bite of the
      treatment product, and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 mins after baseline. The timer will be
      started when they take their first bite. During the second visit participant will consume the
      other treatment based on the randomization (the oatmeal that they didn't receive in their
      first visit and follow exactly the same procedure as the first visit). There will be a
      minimum of 5 days between sessions. Female participants will be scheduled during the luteal
      phase of their menstruation cycle. There will be a maximum of 8 weeks between the two
      sessions, therefore, participants will finish the both sessions within an 8 week period.
