      doctor invited them to seek an appointment for a medication review. Control group patients
      did not receive such a letter, and they were treated as usual (their doctors received a list
      of identifiers of patients on high doses).

      The main outcome variable was the number of active prescriptions of each PPI dose (high
      dose/standard dose/treatment cessation) at 6 months after the intervention.
