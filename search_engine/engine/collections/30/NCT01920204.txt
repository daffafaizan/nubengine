    
      Objective:

      Primary: To study in a pilot phase II trial the efficacy of midostaurin administered at an
      oral dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with indolent or smoldering systemic mastocytosis
      on mediator symptom reduction, documented by the Mastocytosis Symptom Assessment
      Questionnaire, measured at 3 months.

      Secondary:

        1. To study whether symptom improvement persists at 6 months, and whether midostaurin can
           reduce mast cell infiltration in the skin and bone marrow, documented by decrease of
           serum tryptase, decrease of urticaria pigmentosa and decrease of bone marrow mast cells.

        2. To assess safety and tolerability of midostaurin in the above mentioned settings

      Study design: Single arm, open label pilot phase II study.

      Study population: Adult patients (n=20) with histologically documented systemic mastocytosis,
      indolent or smoldering subtype, with severe symptoms, not controlled by histamine 1 and 2
      blockers.

      Intervention: treatment with Midostaurin, twice daily 100 mg orally for 6 months
      continuously.
