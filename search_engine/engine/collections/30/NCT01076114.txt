      of early glaucoma compared to automated visual fields in comparison to subjects without
      evidence of glaucoma or optic nerve disease. We aim to evaluate the structure of the optic
      nerve and compare it to results of visual fields and CFF. The CFF will also be correlated
      with intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements to observe if it may be more closely related
      than visual fields. This may become an additional tool to detect glaucoma in those with
      unreliable visual fields or who are unable to perform a visual field from physical or mental
      limitations.
