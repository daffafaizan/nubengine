      Primary

        -  Describe estrogen levels (estradiol [E2], estrone [E1], and estrone sulphate [E1S]) at
           different time points during the first 4 years of treatment with triptorelin in
           combination with either tamoxifen citrate or exemestane on clinical trial IBCSG-2402 in
           premenopausal women with resected breast cancer.

        -  Assess whether there is a suboptimally estrogen-suppressed subgroup of patients who
           receive exemestane.

      Secondary

        -  Compare estrogen levels (E2, E1, E1S) at different time points during treatment with
           triptorelin in combination with either tamoxifen citrate or exemestane.

        -  Examine potential predictive factors of ineffective estrogen suppression (e.g., age,
           chemotherapy [yes/no], type of chemotherapy received, smoking history, BMI, and evidence
           of menses at study entry).

        -  Investigate the predictive value of optimal estrogen suppression during the first 6 and
           12 months of treatment with regard to long-term estrogen suppression (4-year period).

        -  Compare disease-free survival of suboptimally estrogen-suppressed patients treated with
           exemestane with that of patients with optimal suppression (exploratory analysis).

        -  Examine related endocrine function (FSH and LH) to further elucidate causes of
           suboptimal estrogen suppression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months for
      measurement of estrogen levels (estradiol [E2], estrone [E1], and estrone sulphate [E1S]) by
      gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and measurement of endocrine function (FSH and LH).
