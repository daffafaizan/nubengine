        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of alanosine (SDX-102) with or without
           enzyme-inducible antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) in patients with methylthioadenosine
           phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficient high-grade progressive or recurrent malignant gliomas.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug administered concurrently with EIAEDs in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients
      are stratified according to concurrent anticonvulsant drug use (drugs that induce hepatic
      metabolic enzymes vs drugs that cause modest or no induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes OR
      no anticonvulsant drug).

      Patients receive alanosine (SDX-102) IV continuously for 5 days. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SDX-102 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 week and then every 2 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
