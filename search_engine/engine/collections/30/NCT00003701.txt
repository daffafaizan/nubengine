      postoperative adjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (M-VAC) to those
      treated with combination paclitaxel and carboplatin for muscle invasive bladder cancer at
      particularly high risk of relapse. II. Compare the relative toxicities of postoperative M-VAC
      versus those encountered with postoperative paclitaxel and carboplatin. III. Compare the
      quality of life scores during and following completion of treatment of patients in these two
      treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by N stage (N0 vs N+) and
      performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to receive methotrexate, vinblastine,
      doxorubicin, and cisplatin (arm I) or paclitaxel and carboplatin (arm II). Arm I: Patients
      receive methotrexate IV push on days 1, 15, and 22; vinblastine IV push on days 2, 15, and
      22; doxorubicin IV push on day 2; and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 4 courses. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1
      followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
      courses. Quality of life assessments are completed pretreatment, prior to course 3, 6 weeks
      after the last dose of chemotherapy, and at 6, 12, and 24 months from the end of therapy.
      Patients are followed every 3 months until year 2, every 6 months for years 2-5, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 490 patients accrued into this study within 2.6 years.
