      which is a promising imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness. 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 PET/MRI will
      be applied in patients suspected of glioblastoma multiforme. The uptake of the radioligand
      68Ga-NOTA-AE105 will be compared and correlated with expression of the molecular target: uPAR
      using immunohistochemistry of tumor tissue samples obtained during routine stereotactic
      biopsies or operation. In addition, the semiquantitative uptake (standard uptake values,
      SUVs) of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in tumor tissue will be correlated with overall survival and
      progression free survival
