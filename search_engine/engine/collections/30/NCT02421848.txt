      parameters used for nutritional assessment in clinical practice have limited use in this
      patient population.

      From this perspective, this study proposes to develop predictive equations for body
      composition for electrical bioimpedance (BIA) in cirrhotic patients. Besides being a fast and
      risk free, the BIA offers the additional advantage of low cost compared to other methods that
      assess body composition (BC).

      Will be selected patients male with liver cirrhosis (n = 112) of the Liver Transplant Clinic
      of the Hospital of the Clinicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of SÃ£o Paulo. After signing
      an informed consent, BC will be estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis and by
      reference method (DXA). The data obtained by both methods are statistically treated to obtain
      specific BIA prediction equations for the evaluation of cirrhotic patients.

      This pioneering study is of great clinical importance because malnutrition is a relevant
      factor in the prognosis of liver disease and there is not efficient method in clinical
      practice to properly assess the body composition in this population. Such knowledge, in turn,
      can serve as a new tool for nutritional assistance in treating this disease.
