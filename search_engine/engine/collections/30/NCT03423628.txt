      conducted in the United States and in the United Kingdom, and it consists of three treatment
      arms: Arm A, B, C. This Phase 1 study will assess safety and tolerability of AZD1390 in
      combination with radiation therapy (RT) in brain malignancies. The combination cohorts have
      been designed to assess escalating cumulative doses of AZD1390 in settings with 3 different
      radiation treatment regimens:

        -  Arm A: 35 Gy over 2 weeks with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients
           with recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)

        -  Arms B: 30 Gy over two weeks with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/ partial brain
           radiation therapy (PBRT) in patients with brain metastases. **Arm B has now closed to
           recruitment**

        -  Arm C: 60 Gy over 6 weeks (IMRT) in patients with primary GBM Each arm provides standard
           of care RT for the disease setting indicated with the experimental agent being
           administered in dose escalating cohorts.
