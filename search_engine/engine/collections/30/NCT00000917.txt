      HIV-resistant gene into umbilical cord blood stem cells and transplanting the cells back into
      the patient could lead to the production of cells that resist HIV infection. If a patient's
      cells could be engineered to be resistant to supporting the growth of HIV-1, the cells may
      have improved survival in the presence of HIV-1. To date, an umbilical cord blood bank for
      HIV-positive deliveries has not been established in the United States. This protocol
      establishes a repository of banked umbilical cord blood as a first step toward the potential
      application of gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-infected infants.

      HIV-infected mothers have about 20 ml of blood drawn to test for infectious diseases (e.g.,
      hepatitis). At time of delivery maternal HIV viral load is measured. After delivery, about 60
      ml of blood is collected from the umbilical cord; this blood is labeled and transferred to
      the umbilical cord blood bank for possible use in future gene therapy studies on the infant.
      At birth, infant HIV status and general health are assessed. If the infant is found to be
      HIV-infected, the mother may be approached about the infant's participation in a future gene
      therapy study. If the infant is not HIV-infected, the cord blood is stored for up to four
      years and is then released to the mother, or, with her consent, to the research community.
