      alleviate the impact of follow-up treatment on the body without reducing efficacy.
      Bevacizumab alone or capecitabine combined with bevacizumab as a maintenance treatment have
      been widely used in clinical practice. There are little datas of cetuximab as a maintenance
      treatment ,some studies show that Cetuximab is effective in maintenance treatment, and some
      studies have reported adverse effects of Capecitabine combined with Cetuximab.So it is
      worthwhile to explore more suitable maintenance treatment options. Raltitrexed, a TS enzyme
      inhibitor, is an effective chemotherapy drug for colorectal cancer. We plan to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of Raltitrexed plus Cetuximab in maintenance treatment. Maybe we can
      provide a new choice for RAS wild-type colorectal cancer patients after advanced first-line
      chemotherapy.
