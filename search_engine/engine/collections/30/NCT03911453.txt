      triple negative breast tumors. Patients who are planning to undergo surgery as part of their
      initial treatment will be eligible for this study. They will be treated with single agent
      rucaparib for 3 weeks and then proceed to surgery. Core-biopsies obtained at the time of
      diagnosis and tumor from the surgical resection will be assessed for change in expression of
      PD-L1 by Immunohistochemical assay (IHC).
