      counseling) and either WhatsApp groups or weekly two-way SMS messages. Two months after PrEP
      initiation, tenofovir drug levels will be measured to determine if participants have achieved
      high adherence based on their initial randomization. Women with high adherence (i.e., TFV-DP
      >/=500 fmol/punch from dried blood spots [DBS]) will continue with the adherence support to
      which they were initially randomized. Participants with low adherence (i.e., TFV-DP <500
      fmol/punch from DBS) will continue initial randomization (WhatsApp or two-way SMS) plus be
      randomized to more one of two more intensive adherence support interventions - continued
      monthly visits with adherence and problem-focused counseling at months 3-8 or quarterly
      visits between months 3-9 with feedback about adherence based on drug levels at months 3 and
      6.
