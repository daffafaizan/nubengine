      device that can detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific Antigens that are present on the surface of
      the virus. The KnowNow test is an affordable, user friendly, and point of care device that
      can be mass produced as part of a multipronged strategy to address the global COVID-19
      pandemic.

      A saliva sample is collected from someone with suspected COVID-19 and mixed with a running
      buffer. The mixture is added to the sample pad of the KnowNow test, from where it migrates
      through the lateral flow strip. If COVID-19 Antigens are present, they bind to capture
      proteins on a test line and are made visible by secondary reagents within the device. The
      test result is visually assessed after 15-30 minutes and provides a binary positive (two
      lines) or negative (one line) result. Levels of COVID-19 Antigen differ dependent on disease
      progression. A visible test line (marked T) indicates the presence of COVID-19 Antigen in
      sufficient quantity in the collected sample to be detected. The appearance of the control
      line (marked C) confirms that the test has been performed correctly.
