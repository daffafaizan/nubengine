      run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7820; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 2-arm
      design. Approximately 95 patients with measurable, nonresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, who have failed first-line chemotherapy, will be
      enrolled in the study (approximately 12 to 15 patients in the Phase Ib portion and 80
      patients in the Phase II portion). Patients will only participate in either the Phase Ib or
      the Phase II portion of the study. Patients will receive up to a planned total of 12 cycles
      of study treatment unless there is occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, withdrawal by the Investigator, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever
      occurs first. After 12 cycles, patients who demonstrate clinical benefit may continue single
      agent E7820 for long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated. If
      the treating physician does not feel comfortable discontinuing chemotherapy after 12 cycles,
      further chemotherapy may be considered following discussion with the medical monitor and
      sponsor.
