      25% AgNO3 solution plus 5% NaF varnish and 25% AgNO3 solution plus 5% NaF varnish with fTCP
      when applied semi-annually over 30 months in arresting dentine caries of primary teeth among
      preschool children.

      Methods: The extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 Statement will
      be followed for this 30-month, randomised, double-blinded, equivalence clinical trial.
      Approximately 2,000 kindergarten children will be screened and at least 376 children with
      caries will be recruited. This sample size is sufficient for an appropriate statistical
      analysis. The children will be randomly allocated into 2 groups to treat their caries over a
      30-month period: Group A - biannual application of a 25% AgNO3 solution followed by a 5% NaF
      varnish, and Group B - biannual application of a 25% AgNO3 solution followed by a 5% NaF
      varnish with functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP).Clinical examinations will be
      conducted at 6-month intervals to assess whether the caries are arrested (primary outcome).
      Confounding factors such as oral hygiene habits will be collected through a parental
      questionnaire.

      Possible results and implications: As the first of its kind, this study would help to
      determine whether AgNO3 followed by 5% NaF varnish with and without fTCP are equivalent in
      arresting dentine caries of primary teeth in preschool children when applied semi-annually.
