      contribute to the development of obesity. Ultra-processed foods now represent most of the
      calories consumed in America and their contribution to overall diet has increased in parallel
      with the rise in the prevalence of obesity over the past several decades. While such
      correlations are suggestive, the effect of industrial processing per se, independent of
      dietary macronutrient composition, on ad libitum energy intake has not been carefully
      investigated. Therefore, we will conduct feeding studies in adult men and women to
      investigate the differences in ad libitum energy intake resulting from consuming test diets
      for a pair of 2-week periods in a randomized, crossover design during a single 4-week period.
      The test diets presented to participants will be matched for calories, macronutrient
      composition, sugar, fiber, and sodium, but one diet will be composed of ultraprocessed foods
      whereas the other diet will be unprocessed foods.
