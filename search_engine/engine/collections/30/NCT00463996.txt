      Studies have shown an increase in pos. predictive value by adding contrast i.v. to the
      MR-examination protocol. We compare staging of ovarian cancer by 1.MRI without contrast
      (standard method) to 2.MRI with contrast agent i.v. (new method)in the same patient. Golden
      standard are findings at operation.
