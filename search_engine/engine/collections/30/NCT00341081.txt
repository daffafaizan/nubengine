      behavior imperative to devising strategies to reduce the disease burden. A DNA-based method,
      using highly informative genetic markers of short tandem repeats (STRs) is being proposed as
      a gold standard measure to identify single-use and multi-use syringes. Self-reports of needle
      sharing, which have been the main source of sharing information for research, will be
      compared to the genotypic results to validate the responses on such risk behavior. Genotypic
      information from four autosomal STRs will be used to differentiate DNA from a single versus
      multiple individuals in syringe exudates obtained from injection drug users (IDUs) from the
      Baltimore needle exchange program (BNEP) studied by ALIVE II. Detecting three or more
      distinct alleles at an autosomal STR in the syringe exudates provides evidence that the
      syringe has been shared by at least two individuals. Matching probabilities will be used to
      match the genotypic profile of the individual(s) checking in and returning the syringe to
      allele(s) observed in the syringe exudates, and a mixture discrimination probability will be
      used to measure the likelihood of single vs. multi genome in the syringe samples. Behavioral
      surveillance to document the rapid spread of infectious disease from needle sharing among
      high-risk sub-population such as IDUs are critical for global public health along with the
      development and implementation of timely interventions.
