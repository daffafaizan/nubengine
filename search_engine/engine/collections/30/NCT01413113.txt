      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility of administrating escalating doses
      of 131I (iodine I 131) in combination with concurrent pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride)
      therapy in order to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (RP2D)
      in patients with radioiodine (RAI)-refractory disease with minor RAI-uptake.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of pazopanib in combination with 131I on RAI-avidity, uptake and
      tumor response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1).

      II. To determine the time to tumor progression (TTP) or recurrence (progression will be
      determined by RECIST criteria and by increases in suppressed thyroglobulin levels > 50% as
      compared to tumor imaging and suppressed thyroglobulin levels performed within 1 week of the
      last dose of pazopanib).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of iodine I 131.

      Patients receive iodine I 131 intramuscularly (IM) once daily (QD) 5 days a week in weeks
      5-6. Patients also receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) QD beginning in week 1 and
      continuing for 8 weeks post-radioactive iodine therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
