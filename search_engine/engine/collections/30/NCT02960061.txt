      prognosis and high recurrent rate. Although R0 resection could be achieved in most advanced
      gastric cancer(AGC) patients without metastasis, age-standardized 5-years survival rate was
      no more than 27.4%. Peritoneal metastasis accounts for 50% of the recurrent case and remain
      to be the most fatal recurrence pattern.

      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy ( HIPEC ), has been proved as one of the
      most efficient approach against peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer and recommended
      in the guideline for gastric cancer published by the health committee of china. However, its
      role as prophylactic treatment after curative has never been determined. HIPEC works by
      delivering heat and cytotoxic drug to the cancer cell and is more effective on the tumor with
      small size. As present study suggest that Peritoneal metastasis is related to lymph node
      dissection during surgery while opening lymphatic channels and spreading viable cancer cells
      into the peritoneal cavity, HIPEC might be a reasonable approach to destroy the remaining
      cancer cells after curative surgery. Thus this research aim to explore the efficacy and
      safety of combining HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy) with
      post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy D2 resection.
