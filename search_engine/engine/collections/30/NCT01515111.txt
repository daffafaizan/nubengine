    
      A voluntary, anonymous, self-completed, cross-sectional survey was administered to all
      available internal medicine staff in Guatemalan teaching hospitals.

      The questionnaire included: physician's demographics, work time dedicated to outpatients,
      knowledge of leading causes of death in Guatemala, guidelines used for non-communicable
      disease prevention, simulated cases asking for recommendation(s) on different preventive
      services for asymptomatic adults (i.e. whether they recommended them or not, appropriate
      frequency and starting age, preferred screening method, and availability of the service(s) at
      their hospital). The survey also assessed barriers faced in providing adequate services, and
      opinions on who should implement changes in national health care and in medical education.

      The answers given by the internal medicine staff were compared with the United States
      Preventive Services Task Forces (USPSTF) Recommendations and Guatemalan Ministry of Health
      Guidelines.

      Analysis compared recommendation practices within and between hospitals.
