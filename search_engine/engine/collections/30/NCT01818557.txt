      diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Patients with GDM diagnosed between 20 weeks 0 days and
      32 weeks 0 days of gestation will be recruited. Diagnosis of GDM will be based on Carpenter
      and Coustan criteria for an abnormal 3-hr 100 gram oral glucose tolerance test, as currently
      supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Patients whose
      1-hr, 50 gram oral glucose challenge test exceeds 200 mg/dl will not require a 3-hr oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      listed below, she will be offered participation in the trial and randomized to every day
      blood glucose testing or every other day blood glucose testing for the remainder of her
      pregnancy.

      After the diagnosis of GDM, and before recruitment to the study, all patients will be
      provided counseling and education and will attempt adequate blood glucose control with
      medical nutritional therapy alone for one week. During this period, all patients will test
      their blood glucose values daily. Only after this week is completed will a subject be
      approached for participation.
