      screening. The trial took place in Kopparberg (W), now called Dalarna, and Ostergotland
      counties in Sweden. The trial randomized 77,080 women aged 40-74 years to invitation to
      screening (active study population, ASP) and 55,985 women to no invitation to screening
      (passive study population, PSP). The trial started in 1977 in W-county and in 1978 in
      E-county. Women in age 40-49 years were invited to single-view mammography screening on
      average every 24 months, and women aged 50-74 years on average every 33 months. Approximately
      seven years after randomization a significant 31% decrease in breast cancer mortality was
      observed in the ASP group, whereupon the PSP was invited to screening once and the screening
      phase of the trial ended. The mortality data have been reported every two years during the
      follow-up period and published in peer-reviewed medical journals. The investigators have
      follow-up data to the Dec 31 2015. The 29-year follow-up data has been published in 2012 in
      Radiology. Publication of the long-term data reflects the fact that deaths avoided by early
      detection include some that would have occurred a considerable time later than the screening.
