      presenting with typical or atypical symptoms suggestive of obstructive coronary artery
      disease from 21 US primary care practices from August 2012 to August 2014. Demographics,
      clinical characteristics, and Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) results
      (predefined as low [ASGES <15] or elevated [ASGES >15]) were collected, as were referrals to
      Cardiology or further functional/anatomic cardiac testing after Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene
      Expression score - ASGES) testing. Patients were followed for 1 year post ASGES testing.
