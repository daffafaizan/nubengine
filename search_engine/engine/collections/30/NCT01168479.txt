        -  Primary study objective: To demonstrate the superiority of the ablative microboost dose
           schedule regarding 5-year biochemical no evidence of disease rate compared to the
           current standard of care.

        -  Secondary study objectives: Establish and compare the rates of treatment-related
           toxicity, quality of life and disease-free survival.

      Study design: Single blind prospective randomized controlled phase III trial.

      Study population: Patients with intermediate or high risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
      Intermediate or high risk is defined according to the Ash et al. 2000 criteria as:

        -  One (intermediate-risk) or more (high-risk) factors: T2, or Gleasonscore=7, or iPSA
           10-20 ng/mL

        -  One or more (high-risk) factors: T3, or Gleasonscore >7, or iPSA >20 ng/mL

      Intervention: The standard arm receives the current gold standard, namely 77Gy to the
      prostate in 35 fractions of 2.2 Gy, 5 times per week. In the experimental arm patients
      receive in addition to the current gold standard of 77 Gy to the prostate an integrated boost
      to the macroscopically visible tumour to reach a total dose of 95 Gy in 35 fractions of 2.7
      Gy, 5 times per week.

      Main study endpoint: To decrease the five-year biochemical relapse rate with at least 10%.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      Patients will have to fill in a quality of life questionnaire before and after the
      radiotherapy treatments. The risk associated with the increased dose to the macroscopic
      tumour is an increase of toxicity and a reduction of quality of life.
