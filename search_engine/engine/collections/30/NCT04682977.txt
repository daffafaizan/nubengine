      decline that is associated with aging and chronic disease. The 12-week intervention includes
      a comprehensive assessment of ADL functioning and ten intervention sessions addressing
      disease management, physical activity and executive functioning. This pilot randomized
      control trial will compare whether patients who receive IPROACTIF perform better than usual
      care patients on physical functioning, self-efficacy for chronic disease management, physical
      activity levels, executive functioning, health-related quality of life, and participation in
      life roles and activities.
