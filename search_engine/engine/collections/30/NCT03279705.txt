      suctioning of water. The water had to be suctioned or infused alternatively and increaed the
      insertion time.

      With the new designed endoscopy that integrated a separate water jet channel for infusing
      water, infusing and suctioning of water can be done at the same time. Besides, water jet
      pumping system could provide a powerful jet to help us open the collapse lumen and keep an
      appropriate distance between the mucosa and the lens, thus preventing loss of visualization.
      It will help the colonoscopist to find the way during insertion.
