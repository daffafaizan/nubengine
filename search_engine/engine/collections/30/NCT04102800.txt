    
      A phase IV, open-label, prospective, multi-centre cohort study in patients with severe
      eosinophilic asthma (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] steps 4 and 5 classification of
      asthma severity) who will be treated with benralizumab injections. The study is exploratory
      and will assess deteriorations in asthma control (exacerbations) to characterise the clinical
      severity of each exacerbation and the airway and systemic inflammatory phenotype associated
      with these events. Clinical assessment and management of each exacerbation will be in line
      with standard clinical guidelines. 150 participants will be recruited and receive treatment
      for either 56 or 80 weeks.
