      At the recipient site (recession defect):

      After scaling and root planning. A sulcular incision is made through the gingival margin and
      extends post the mucogingival line leaving the interdental papilla intact.

      At donor site (palate):

      A connective tissue graft is harvested from the palate after administration of local
      anesthesia using a partial thickness flap which will be raised with single incision.

      Then the graft is placed and secured in the recipient site using suture. The flap is
      displaced to be in a coronal position using a suture.

      Tunneling technique with the laterally closed tunnel):

      After local anesthesia, root planing of the exposed root surface will be performed. An
      intrasulcular incisions will be made creating a tunnel extending to the mucogingival line and
      mesial and distal recession defects while keeping the interdental papilla intact as well as
      not perforating the flap.

        -  Donor SCTG Subsequently, a palatal SCTG will be harvested by means of the single
           incision technique with immediate closure of the donor site.

        -  Recipient site; Using either single or mattress sutures, the SCTG will be pulled and
           fixed mesially and distally at the inner aspect of the pouch. The graft will be adapted
           to the CEJ by means of a sling suture. Finally, the margins of the pouch will be pulled
           together over the graft and sutured with interrupted sutures to accomplish tension-free
           complete or partial coverage of the graft as well as the denuded root surface.
