      glucocerebrosidase (GCB). Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside
      accumulates within the macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ
      system dysfunction. Gaucher disease has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes based on the
      presence or absence of neurological symptoms and severity of neurological symptoms. Patients
      with type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological deterioration, and those with
      type 3 Gaucher disease typically display a more sub acute neurological course; type 1 Gaucher
      disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all cases, does not involve the
      central nervous system.

      Velaglucerase alfa is an approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for pediatric and adult
      patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. ERTs have been proven to reduce organomegaly, improve
      hematological parameters and positively impact health-related quality of life; ERTs have not
      been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and as a result have shown limited ability to
      improve the neurological (Central Nervous System; CNS) manifestations associated with Gaucher
      disease.

      This study will provide a basis for exploring the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa
      in patients with type 3 Gaucher disease.
