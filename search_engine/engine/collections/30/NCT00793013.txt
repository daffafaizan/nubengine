      patient survival. While reducing mean airway pressure has reduced barotrauma and improved
      patient survival, it has impaired attempts to improve alveolar recruitment. Alveolar
      recruitment is important as it improves V/Q mismatch, allows reduction in FIO2 earlier, and
      decreases the risk of oxygen toxicity. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a novel
      ventilatory modality that utilizes controlled positive airway pressure to maximize alveolar
      recruitment while minimizing barotrauma. In APRV, tidal ventilation occurs between the
      increase in lung volumes established by the application of CPAP and the relaxation of lung
      tissue following pressure release. Preliminary studies have suggested that APRV recruits
      collapsed alveoli and improves oxygenation through a restoration of pulmonary mechanics, but
      there are no studies indicating the potential overall benefit of APRV in recovery form
      ALI/ADRS.
