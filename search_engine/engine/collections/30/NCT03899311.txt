      adolescents with severe obesity who are not successful with traditional lifestyle behavioral
      interventions or do not want or qualify for weight loss surgery. One such intensive dietary
      option is the protein sparing modified fast (PSMF). The PSMF involves minimal carbohydrate
      intake to induce ketosis, while maintaining adequate or high protein intake to minimize
      catabolism. The PSMF, under medical supervision, can be an effective and safe intervention
      for children and adolescents, yet the PSMF diet is not regularly used in the treatment of
      pediatric severe obesity. This pilot study will employ a prospective cohort study design.
      Thirty children, 11-19 years-old, with severe obesity, who have been prescribed the rPSMF as
      part of their treatment in a tertiary care pediatric weight management clinic (PWMC), will be
      recruited along with their attending parent to participate in the study. The primary aim of
      the study is to evaluate the acceptability of the rPSMF as assessed by adherence,
      satisfaction with the intervention, and participation rate using quantitative and qualitative
      methods. The secondary aim is to investigate the effectiveness of the rPSMF on improving a)
      anthropometric measures (weight, body mass index [BMI] and BMI z-score); b) metabolic
      measures (lipid profile, glycosylated hemoglobin, liver function tests); and c) quality of
      life. Results of this study will provide guidance for the standardization of a pediatric
      rPSMF protocol in a clinic setting, delineate which factors improve or hinder adherence and
      weight loss and provide preliminary data for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
