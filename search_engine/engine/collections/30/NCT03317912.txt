      undergoing open prostate surgery in this randomized placebo-controlled trial.

      Before anesthesia induction, these patients receive an intravenous lidocaine infusion (bolus
      1,5 mg.kg-1 followed by a continuous infusion of 2mg.kg-1.h during 24 hours) or an equal
      volume of placebo. Then the anesthesia is induced with propofol, sufentanil et rocuronium.
      The postoperative analgesia is provided by paracetamol, tramadol and patient-controlled
      analgesia (PCA) with morphine or oral oxycodone. A polysomnography is registred on the
      preoperative night and on the first postoperative night.
