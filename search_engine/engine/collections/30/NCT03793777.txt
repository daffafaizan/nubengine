      Improved attention is desirable for a large group of people because it is linked to improved
      performance. Students and professionals can benefit from improved attention and thus
      performance in academic and other work environments. In addition, cognitive functioning also
      plays an important role in sports. Various cognitive skills, including attention, reaction
      time and motor function, have shown that they can influence sport performance. A completely
      natural supplement with aronia melanocarpa extract could be a promising way to naturally
      improve cognitive performance. The product in this study is aronia melanocarpa which contains
      polyphenols. A limited number of clinical studies have already been carried out to see the
      effect of similar products on cognitive functioning. However, these studies have often been
      done in older study populations or over a longer period of time. In this study, in healthy
      adolescents (ages between the 18-35 and with a BMI between 18.5 and 30), the investigators
      want to test the short term (7 days) effect of aronia melanocarpa extract on cognitive
      functioning. The investigators will also test the effect of supplementation on the
      particpant's mood, vascular function, blood biomarkers, retinal vasculature, and subjective
      cognition.
