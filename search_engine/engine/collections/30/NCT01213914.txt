      patients with mortality reported to be between 80 and 100%.(3-7) Despite recent advances in
      burn care, the unacceptably high mortality rate in this subgroup has not changed over time.
      The pathogenesis of ARF in burns, similar to other critically ill populations, is often
      multi-factorial with one major component being sepsis induced ischemic tubular necrosis.
      Thus, ARF secondary to septic shock is a common and devastating condition in the burn ICU.
