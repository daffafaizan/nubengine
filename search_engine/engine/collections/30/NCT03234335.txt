      patients with normal renal function). Thus, RI remains a major challenge for hematologists,
      including decisions on optimal anti-myeloma therapy, potential dialysis, supportive care and
      quality of life. The combination of a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulator is the
      preferred induction treatment for newly diagnosed transplant-eligible MM patients. After
      induction, high-dose therapy with Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) is the standard of
      care for these patients. However, concerns related to management of comorbidities and
      treatment side effects question about therapeutic options for patients with severe renal
      damage. Of interest, recent studies argued that high-dose therapy followed by ASCT could be a
      feasible and safe method for renal failure MM patients. Yet, these observations on small
      sample size patients groups need to be confirmed with standardized conditions. This study
      proposes to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of this therapeutic strategy in MM patients
      with severe renal impairment.
