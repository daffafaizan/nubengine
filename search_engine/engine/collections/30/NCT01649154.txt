    
      A single-blinded prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary referral
      center. A total of 120 patients who required a thyroidectomy for thyroid benign disease, will
      be randomized to either Harmonic Focus or Ligasure small-Jaw or clamp-and-tie technique
      during thyroidectomy. The operative time (minutes), morbidity rate (%), post-operative blood
      loss (milliliters), hospital stay (days), post-operative hypocalcemia (%), and cost of
      thyroidectomy (euros) were compared between the three groups.
