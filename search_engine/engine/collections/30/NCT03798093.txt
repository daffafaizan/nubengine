      data collection. As part of the data collection, an optional echocardiogram will be performed
      if the parent consents. The consent will have a check box to indicate if they consent to the
      additional test.

      Echocardiographic measurements will be performed on all infants at 12 hours +/-3 hours of age
      by our research sonographers who are blinded to infant randomization. Measurements will be
      taken according to a standard operating procedure to assess systemic blood flow, by superior
      vena cava (SVC) flow (ml/kg/min), right ventricular output (ml/kg/min), left ventricular
      output (LVO) (ml/kg/min), measures of left and right venitricular tissue Doppler and strain
      imaging. These measurements will be performed off line at a later time. Data will be entered
      into REDCap.

      If any structural abnormalities are found, the attending pediatrician will be notified of the
      abnormal echocardiogram. The consent will clearly state that this echo is not for diagnostic
      purposes. Any additional studies including an official complete echocardiogram and or
      cardiology consultation will be left to the discretion of the attending pediatrician, as
      he/she deems necessary
