      too much, patients risk long term complications including diabetes, osteoporosis and
      cardiovascular disease. If, however they are given too little, patients can feel tired,
      unwell and may collapse as there is insufficient steroid hormone to cope with stress.

      Currently there is no single objective marker or outcome that can be measured to ascertain
      whether a patient is receiving optimum glucocorticoid replacement therapy. This study will
      investigate a selection of markers to examine whether they can be used to as indicators to
      gauge the adequacy of therapy. Finding an appropriate marker could unlock better care and
      outcomes for our patients with adrenal insufficiency .
