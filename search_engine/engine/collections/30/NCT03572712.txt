    
      Patients will be evaluated once a year in consultation with a blood gases, and then a
      nocturnal recording at home including a transcutaneous capnography and an oximetry.

      Some data will be registered too : cardiovascular and neurological comorbidities, diabetes
      mellitus, treatment, parameters of the non-invasive ventilation, duration of compliance and
      apnea-hypopnea index (if available).

      The investigators will perform a sequential analysis of nocturnal hypoventilation with first
      blood gases, then nocturnal oxymetry and to finish nocturnal PtcCo2. It will allow us to
      determine if PtcCo2 catch up some nocturnal hypoventilation, undetected by the first two
      exams.

      The investigators plan that the study will last 18 months. The analysis will be descriptive.
      Quantitative variables will be described with mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and
      median. Quantitative variables are presented with number and percentage.
