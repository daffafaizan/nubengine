      PFLVAD PulseCathÂ® iVAC2L on ventricular loading using left ventricular pressure-volume loops,
      in association with systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic parameters obtained from right and
      left catheterization. Additionally, assessments of specific load and flow-dependent humoral
      factors and cardiac enzymes will be made during and after the use of mechanical circulatory
      support. These specific patterns are so far unknown. Knowledge of optimal patterns may help
      in determining the ideal circulatory device platform.
