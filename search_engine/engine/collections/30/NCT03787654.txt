      with urgency and also with effort or physical exertion or on sneezing or coughing. It is
      regarded as urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (UMUI) when sudden sensation of
      voiding accompanied by uncontrolled incontinence domains the symptoms. UMUI can bring shame
      and inconvenience to patients.

      As first-line medicine for urge-predominant urinary incontinence, Solifenacin can reduce
      urgency urinary incontinence episodes in 24 hours. However, the side effects tend to bring
      about poor compliance among patients.

      Acupuncture might be effective in treating UMUI. Previous research indicated that
      electroacupuncture might be noninferior to pelvic floor muscle training plus Solifenacin in
      reducing the urgency incontinence episodes of UMUI women. However, that study didn't focuse
      on UMUI exclusively, thus unable to decide whether electroacupuncture is effective in the
      treatment of UMUI.
