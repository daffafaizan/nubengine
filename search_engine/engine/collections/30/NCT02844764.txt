    
      This is a prospective open-label clinical study of 50 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of autologous cell therapy for pain and inflammation associated with
      Osteoarthritis of the hip. Follow-up will consist of a larger sample including 4,000
      patients.

      Patients will be treated for Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip due to degeneration or chronic
      injury. They will be treated with autologous Stromed obtained by the Adipose Ultrasonic Cell
      Recovery Unit (AUCRU) and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) processed by the RegenLab (RegenKit
      BCT-3) PRP product each as direct injections to the affected joints. Patient outcomes will be
      tracked with laboratory tests for inflammation markers, hip disability and osteoarthritis
      outcome score (HOOS) questionnaires and follow up MRI's at various endpoints to 6 months.
      SF-36 forms (a quality of life measure) and numerical rating scales (NRS) will also be used
      to assess safety and efficacy of treatment, as well as any reduction in patient medication
      and/or delay in pending hip replacement therapy.
