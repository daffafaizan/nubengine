      assigned into two groups (solifenacin or oxybutynin in their usual doses) and will be
      assessed with respect to baseline characteristics and complaints before treatment. After
      initiation of the treatment at first and second months follow-up visits the patients will be
      reassessed with respect to compliance, satisfaction, degree of improvement, reasons for
      dropouts, number and severity of side effects.
