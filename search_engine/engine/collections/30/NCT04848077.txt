      implementing exercise in daily life remains challenging. Moreover, many training programs are
      not very scalable. The investigators take an important step forward by developing and
      studying an innovative and fully decentralized smartphone-based program to increase long-term
      physical activity in people with PD in daily life.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate whether a smartphone app can increase
      physical activity in PD patients for a long period of time (12 months). The secondary aim is
      to test the potential group effect on physical fitness, motor- and non-motor symptoms.
      Thirdly, we aim to investigate whether there is a dose-response relationship between amount
      of physical activity and physical fitness, motor- and non-motor functioning.

      Study design: Double-blind randomized controlled trial.

      Study population: A total of 452 Dutch patients with PD who have no other medical conditions
      that markedly hamper mobility other than PD, no cognitive impairments that make it difficult
      to use a game on the smartphone and possess a suitable smartphone, will be recruited.

      Intervention: Participants will be randomized to a group that will be motivated to increase
      their physical activity level to a small, medium, large or very large degree with respect to
      their own baseline level.
