    
      A randomized, evaluator-blinded, within subject (split face) multicenter clinical study of
      DermaVeil (Injectable poly-l-lactic acid) compared to SCULPTRA in the treatment of nasolabial
      fold wrinkles. Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive DermaVeil and SCULPTRA on
      either the right or left side of the face. The treatment phase will consist of one to three
      visits at 3 week intervals during which eligible subjects will receive bilateral injections
      of study material in the left and right nasolabial fold wrinkles, including visits at weeks 3
      and 6 for touch ups if needed. The follow-up phase will consist of assessments at 1, 3, 6,
      and 12 months after the last treatment, and safety and efficacy evaluations for an additional
      12 months. Standardized photographs will be taken at screening and at all treatment phase and
      follow-up visits. Efficacy evaluations will be made by an on-site blinded evaluator, and of
      the photographs using a validated, standardized photo-numeric scale. The primary efficacy
      comparison between study treatments will be made on the mean change from baseline in the
      Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale of the nasolabial folds (as determined by the on-site blinded
      evaluator) and at the 12 month time point. Study participants will continue to be followed
      for safety and efficacy at months 18 and 24 after their last injection session.
