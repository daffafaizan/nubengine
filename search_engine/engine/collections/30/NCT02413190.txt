      body mass, and 2) blood tests of biomarkers of bone resorption and formation. These
      procedures will be correlated to measures of muscle strength testing and timed function tests
      to determine fracture risk in FSHD individuals considering age, gender, muscle strength and
      FSHD allele size.
