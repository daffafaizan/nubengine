        -  To evaluate the ability to predict and track brain network changes during TMS treatment
           for medication-resistant depression.

        -  To develop quantitative tools that measure the connectivity and excitability of the
           brain using resting and single pulse TMS-EEG.

        -  To determine the feasibility of recording EEG biomarkers in the clinic without
           disrupting clinical care.
