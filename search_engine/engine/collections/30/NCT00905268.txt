      underlying causes of Friedreich's Ataxia through its antioxidant activity and its role as an
      electron carrier in the respiratory chain promoting mitochondrial ATP production.

      The current 12-month placebo-controlled treatment study in 232 patients aims to confirm the
      positive effect of idebenone on neurological function, as for instance observed in the recent
      48-patient, 6-month NICOSIA study in children, using the International Cooperative Ataxia
      Rating Scale (ICARS) and the newly developed Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS).

      In addition, the study aims to confirm the positive effect on cardiomyopathy associated with
      FRDA observed in several small studies. Cardiac anatomy and function will be assessed using
      echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging and cardiac MRI methods in patients with FRDA
      cardiomyopathy. In addition exercise capacity, measured as peak workload, will be assessed in
      patients able to comply with a modified exercise protocol.
