      suffer greatly. Massage is now included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
      guidelines for the treatment of refractory cancer pain (1), and many cancer patients are
      turning to massage and other complementary therapies to help alleviate both their
      psychological and physical symptoms. However, complementary therapies, such as massage, are
      often unaffordable or unavailable to predominantly low-income cancer patients at safety net
      hospitals like Boston Medical Center.

      The vast majority of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy undergo implantation of a
      permanent central venous access device, often referred to as a port implantation or implanted
      port. Although the implanted port carries multiple benefits for ease of treatment, after the
      procedure patients often complain of headaches, muscle stiffness and neck and shoulder pain
      that lasts for several days. Pain medication is the only therapy commonly offered for this
      and is often inadequate (2). Furthermore, since this is often the first surgical procedure
      for cancer patients at the beginning of their treatment, they often have significant levels
      of pre-procedure anxiety (3,4). Safe, efficacious, and cost-effective interventions that can
      reduce the anxiety and pain related to port implantation are needed.

      This pilot study will look at how feasible and effective massage therapy is in reducing
      pre-operative anxiety and post-operative pain among BMC patients already undergoing surgical
      placement of an implanted port.
