    
      This multicenter prospective study will include nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from
      patients who present with flu-like symptoms and have undergone routine testing for influenza
      virus strain types A or B. The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&B Test System qualitative results will
      be compared to a reference method for identification of Influenza A or B to determine the
      clinical sensitivity and specificity of the device.

      The ARROW-FLU Influenza A&B Test system will be performed at CLIA-waived and non-CLIA waived
      clinical sites. Device operators at CLIA-waived sites will be untrained intended users (e.g.
      nurses, physician assistants, medical assistants, etc).

      A subject's participation in this study will consist of a single visit. Following completion
      of the informed consent process and a review of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria to determine
      eligibility, each subject will receive a unique study identification number. After standard
      of care sampling, two (2) nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs will be obtained from each subject
      enrolled in the study. The swabs will be collected from the same nostril and alternated in
      their order of designation for testing (i.e. one for ARROW-FLU Influenza System testing and
      the other for reference testing. Any swab specimens required for standard of care testing
      will be collected prior to the specimens for this investigation. Investigational device
      operators will be blinded to standard of care testing results.
