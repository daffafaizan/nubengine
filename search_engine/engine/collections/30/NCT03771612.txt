      first complete a structured telephone interview in order to assess eligibility.

      The study will begin with a session lasting approximately three hours, in which you will
      complete a blood draw, fill out questionnaires, and complete some tasks. You will then be
      randomly assigned to take either an anti-inflammatory medication (naproxen) or placebo
      (inactive substance) to take twice daily everyday for the following four weeks. You will also
      be contacted by text message to remind you to take your pills, to ask if you have taken your
      pills, and to send you a link to fill out questionnaires once daily. After the four weeks are
      over, you will come back in for a second session lasting approximately three hours to again
      complete a blood draw, fill out questionnaires, and complete some tasks. Two weeks after the
      second session, you will receive an email to fill out questionnaires online. Finally, four
      weeks after your second session, you will receive another email to fill out questionnaires
      online.
