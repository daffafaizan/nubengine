      continue with the next active agent. From a biological perspective, TKI's will most likely
      activate compensatory pathways which, may ultimately lead to the development of resistance.
      Recent studies suggest that resistance to treatment with TKI may be reversible after stopping
      treatment. There is therefore a rationale to alternate treatment to prevent or delay the
      occurrence of resistance.

      Our hypothesis is that alternating active agents in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) may
      reduce side effects, improve tolerability and compliance of treatment and prolong progression
      free survival and overall survival compared to the standard of care.
