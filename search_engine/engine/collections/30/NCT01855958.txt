      (M1) is an effective target for neural brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS). Due to these promising initial results, the plasticity of M1 has
      also been investigated as a potential marker for chronic pain. TMS studies using single or
      paired pulse shown changes in M1 plasticity in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia pain
      compared to healthy subjects. Thus, there is a decrease in the inhibitory activity of chronic
      pain that can take a state as shown uninhibited by measuring TMS indexed intracortical
      inhibition (ICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Based on these experimental data and
      clinical studies have been focused on the effects of neuromodulation techniques in M1
      excitability. The techniques used to stimulate the peripheral nervous system was investigated
      using different approaches. The DIMST is a therapy applied to treat peripheral chronic
      syndromes that may have central components such as myofascial pain. During DIMST, the needles
      are applied to the spinal segment associated with nerve roots dermatome corresponding to the
      pathology. This treatment can also be effective in the treatment of diseases that have major
      peripheral components such as OA. OA is a major cause of suffering and disability in the
      elderly, having an inflammatory component, such as a factor that contributes to the symptoms
      and progression of the disease. There is evidence that OA could lead to sensitization central
      and segmental, but these effects on M1 plasticity and other central components are not
      completely known.

      Therefore, researchers proposed to evaluate the plasticity of M1 in this chronic pain
      condition and also the effect of bottom-up DIMST in pain and cortical excitability.
