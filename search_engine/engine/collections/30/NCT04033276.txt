      reduced the incidence and consequences of T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and have improved
      short-term outcomes, long-term allograft loss attributable to AMR is still responsible for
      substantial medical and socioeconomic burdens in kidney transplant recipients. Numerous
      studies have shown that de novo DSA after KT are associated with AMR, which leads to
      allograft loss. IVIG is a medication that has emerged as a useful tool in modulating
      immunity, treatment of AMR and in desensitization protocol. Treatment with rituximab or
      combination of IVIG/rituximab has sought to further diminish antibody production (de novo
      DSA) in the treatment of AMR. Several studies have been reported, but in the absence of
      control groups or standardization of treatment, their efficacy is difficult to assess.
