      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA) receptor blockade on the
      severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor response complications in
      patients with Parkinson's disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial,
      efficacy will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be
      monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
