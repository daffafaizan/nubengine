        -  To obtain epidemiological information and biological material on a population-based
           series of cancer cases, including malignant melanoma, lymphoma, bladder, kidney,
           esophageal, and pancreatic cancer, and brain tumors.

        -  Identify novel cancer susceptibility genes, by comparison of genotype frequencies in
           cases with the corresponding frequencies in large control series.

        -  To estimate the age and sex-specific risks associated with variants in predisposition
           genes.

        -  To evaluate interactions between polymorphisms in predisposition genes and potential
           lifestyle risk factors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete a detailed epidemiological questionnaire that includes information on
      education, occupation, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, height, weight, reproductive
      history (age at menarche, age at pregnancies, parity, and age at menopause), oral
      contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy use, family history of cancer, and past
      medical history.

      Blood samples are collected from patients. DNA is extracted from these blood samples, from
      samples collected from cancer-free control participants in MREC-SEARCH-CONTROL, and from
      additional controls through the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) study (a
      population-based study of diet and health based in Norfolk, East Anglia). DNA samples are
      analyzed for polymorphisms of low penetrance cancer susceptibility genes.

      In addition to the cancer patients recruited for this study, patients with breast, ovarian,
      endometrial, colorectal, and prostate cancer are recruited for the following related clinical
      trials: MREC-SEARCH-BREAST, MREC-SEARCH-OVARIAN, MREC-SEARCH-ENDOMETRIAL,
      MREC-SEARCH-COLORECTAL, and MREC-SEARCH-PROSTATE.
