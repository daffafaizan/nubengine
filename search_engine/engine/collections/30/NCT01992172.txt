      reported to be safe and effective in numerous clinical trials. Clinical trials have reported
      achievement of Atopic Dermatitis Area Severity Index (ADASI)-75 in 50-70% of patients after
      4-6 weeks of NB-UVB treatment.

      Many drawbacks limit patients compliance, access, and acceptance of traditional NB-UVB
      phototherapy. The strict treatment regimen (2-3 sessions per week for an average of 12 weeks
      or more) performed at a specialized phototherapy clinic combined with high cost and low or no
      reimbursement make compliance and access a major drawback.

      In order to address the drawbacks of phototherapy, we developed a novel topical cream -
      Photocil - that selectively delivers NB-UVB therapy when exposed to sunlight. When used with
      natural sunlight, Photocil provides a convenient alternative to traditional clinic based
      phototherapy; thus, has the potential to dramatically increase patient compliance and
      treatment outcome.
