      intervention aiming to create a more supportive social and physical environment to promote
      lifestyle and behaviour change to prevent type 2 diabetes among families from low and middle
      income countries and from vulnerable groups in high income countries in Europe.

      The Feel4Diabetes-intervention will be developed according to the results of systematic
      literature reviews, narrative reviews and surveys regarding existing research programs,
      legislation and policies as well as infrastructures, facilities and human resources, which
      will be conducted during the first phase of the project. It will be implemented in six
      Eurepean countries, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Hungary and Spain. The
      process, impact, outcome, cost-effectiveness and scalability of the
      Feel4Diabetes-intervention will be evaluated and the results of the study will be
      disseminated via various communication channels.
