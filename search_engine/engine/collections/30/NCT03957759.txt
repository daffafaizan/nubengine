      combination with a pulse oximeter worn at the wrist allows lowlanders with COPD to accurately
      identify whether or not they will experience an altitude-related illness during altitude
      travel. After baseline evaluation at 760 m, patients will travel by bus within 3-5 h to the
      Tuja Ashu high altitude clinic at 3'100 m and stay there for 2 days. During this period,
      participants will perform SSM. They are instructed to report to study personnel if they
      fulfill predefined criteria for impeding altitude-related illness.

      A planned interim analysis will be performed after the first year of the study or after
      completion of study by 80 participants, whichever comes first to allow any necessary
      adaptations of the sample size or terminate the study early for futility or high accuracy of
      the index test.
