      patient-centered care, minimize late effects and promote overall well-being. The purpose of
      this research is to assess the impact of the SurvivorLink system on implementation and
      adherence to cancer care and late effects visits/screening. This research projects proposes
      to develop a standardized process by which to implement SurvivorLink, a personal electronic
      health record and education system, designed to promote survivor care, within pediatric
      cancer clinics. This study will use a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation, clustered
      randomized, waitlist control design to evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on patient health
      behavior and quality of life outcomes and understand its delivery among 20 pediatric cancer
      survivor clinics. The researchers will test the effectiveness of SurvivorLink on 1 year
      follow-up and completed screenings through a clustered randomized waitlist-control trial: ten
      clinics will administer the intervention to study participants and the other ten clinics will
      be a wait-list control group where study participants receive usual care.

      The study will evaluate the impact of SurvivorLink on patient survivor care visit attendance
      and risk-based surveillance tests, caregiver's patient activation, survivor's and caregiver's
      quality of life and self-efficacy to manage a chronic condition. This study is the first
      comprehensive, effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the impact of an electronic
      personal health record (with care plan) and education system for pediatric cancer survivors
      and their caregivers.
