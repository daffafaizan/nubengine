    
      This is a physiological cross-over study. Enrolled patient with different baseline
      respiratory mechanics, for example ARDS patients with low compliance, COPD patient with high
      airway resistance and postoperative patients with almost normal compliance and airway
      resistance. Patients are ventilated with PSV+ Automatic adjustmen of inspiratory triger and
      cycling-off based on waveform, PSV with fixed inspiratory and expiratory and NAVA in two
      different levels of support. The demographic characteristics, diagnosis, formerly medical
      history, Ventilator indications, Ventilator data, other respiratory treatments,
      patient-ventilator interation, work of breathing, Eadi, will be recorded.
