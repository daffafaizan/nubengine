      preferences and to designate another person to help make medical decisions if they were to
      become too sick to make their own decisions. Most patients, even seriously ill older adults,
      do not fill out advance directive forms. Since the mean reading level in the US is at the 8th
      grade level (5th grade for elders) and since most advance directive documents are written
      beyond a 12th grade reading level, many patients may not be able to read, much less complete,
      the standard advance directive forms.

      This study hypothesized that an advance directive form written at a 5th grade reading level
      (AD-Easy) that included culturally appropriate graphics explaining the text, and also
      included questions concerning patients' values, would be preferred over the standard advance
      directive form being used in California (AD-Standard).

      The participant's literacy level and baseline knowledge of advance directive topics were
      assessed. Participants were then stratified by literacy level to be randomized to first
      attempt to read and complete either the AD-Easy or the AD-Standard. Then the participant's
      acceptance of the forms, self-efficacy or confidence with treatment decisions, attitudes
      about the form's utility, and post form review comprehension were assessed. Participants then
      crossed over to review the alternate form and were asked to state which form they preferred
      to take home. Six months later participants were called and asked if they had thought about
      their medical treatment preferences, spoken to their family, friends, or doctor about their
      treatment preferences, or if they filled out the advance directive form.
