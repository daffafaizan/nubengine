      peroxide, nitrogen oxides, eicosanoids, isoprostanes, adenosine, certain cytokines,
      chemokines, and growth factors. Concentrations of these biomarkers are influenced by
      inflammation, oxidative stress, and can be modulated by therapeutic interventions. There is
      evidence that some markers in EBC differ between patients with asthma and controls, and some
      of them can correlate with asthma severity score, lung function. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of allergic disease, disease monitoring and exposure to tobacco smoke on
      airway inflammation measured by markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in children with
      asthma allergic to house dust mite. We will also evaluate the effect of antiasthmatic
      treatment applied out of dust season on the number of exacerbations in "asthma epidemic" in
      September. We will evaluate the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke on antiasthmatic
      treatment.

      Also, we aim to assess correlations between cytokine concentrations in EBC and clinical
      characteristic of the patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as another
      phenotype of asthma. At the first study vist patients with EIB underwent fractional exhaled
      nitric oxide measurement (FeNO) and baseline spirometry, performed exercise treadmill
      challenge (ETC) and EBC samples were obtained at the end of ETC.
