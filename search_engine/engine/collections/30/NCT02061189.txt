    
      This multicenter study is based on a longitudinal assessment of the natural disease
      progression and on the effects of exercise protocol in a swimming pool. This study will
      compare patients to themselves after determining motor skills and the disease natural course
      for 12 months.

      The study will compare different scales (MFM, Hammersmith) to our new innovative scale based
      on non-invasive analysis of motor skills.

      30 patients will be enrolled and tested with MFM, Hammersmith and our non-invasive scale
      every 6 months for a total of 18 to 36 months due to the slow natural progression of the
      disease.

      Among these 30 patients, 10 patients will be selected to perform a 6 months training in a
      swimming pool, from 12 to 18 months or 18 to 24 months or 24 to 30 months after enrollment,
      in defined and reproducible conditions.

      These trained patients will finally be reassessed at 18 and 24 months or 24 and 30 months or
      30 and 36 months to test the therapeutic effect of the training compared to the slope of the
      natural disease progression, and other parameters.

      Only patients who have undergone training in the swimming pool will be reevaluated at 24 or
      30 or 36 months (6 months post-training) to assess long term exercise effects.
