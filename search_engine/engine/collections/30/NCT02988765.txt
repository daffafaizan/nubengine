      the investigators decided to better investigate the role of ultrasound in groin nodes
      evaluation through the study 10 sonographic features of suspicion for nodal involvement:

        -  globular shape (loss of the normal elliptical form)

        -  long/short axis ratio

        -  cortical/medulla ratio

        -  cortical focal bulging or thickening

        -  hilum anomalies

        -  inhomogeneous echostructure

        -  intranodal deposits

        -  extracapsular spread

        -  grouping

        -  vascularization

      The standard of comparison is histopathology.

      The prospectively evaluation of these parameters will be obtained on the enrolled patients.

      The investigators also provided the retrospective review - by specialized staff - of
      ultrasound images collected in archives associated with information relating to the
      cyto/histological procedures (performed in case of suspicious lymph nodes) in patients who
      underwent surgical treatment in the last five years at the study center.
