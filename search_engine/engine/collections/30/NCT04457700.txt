      (HER2) positive, node-positive breast cancer achieve an axillary pathologic complete
      remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). To avoid surgery post-NAC, it is
      paramount to accurately identify patients who achieve pCR in axillary lymph node (ALN). We
      found that patients with normal-appearing lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) based
      radiomics of the axilla after chemotherapy had a lower risk of developing residual nodal
      disease. However, the features of CT-based radiomics for pCR ALN following NAC has not been
      established yet. This study aimed to assess the performance of CT-based radiomics in
      evaluating the response and predicting pCR of metastatic lymph nodes after NAC in breast
      cancer patients.
