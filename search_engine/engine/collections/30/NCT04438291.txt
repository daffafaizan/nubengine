      recruited. Multicomponent interventions will be offered to the intervention schools. To build
      and strengthen the community capacity in health promotion, a team of volunteers will be
      established to raise awareness of HPV, cervical cancer and HPV vaccine.

      Data will be collected at baseline, 1 month and 1 year after intervention. The mixed-effects
      model will be used to compare the differential changes for each of the primary and secondary
      outcomes across time between the two groups.

      The project is expected to instil a more accurate understanding of HPV and HPV vaccination
      and support the decision to undergo vaccination.
