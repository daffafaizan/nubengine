    
      Endpoint: All PD003J treated subjects will be followed up for 4 months. The primary endpoints
      will be safety of unilateral, PD003J subthalamotomy for PD. The endpoint will be determined
      from adverse events recorded during the 4 months period for safety. Secondary endpoints will
      include changes in MDS-UPDRS, levodopa equivalent medication, Global Impression of Change and
      so on.

      Primary endpoint of safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events (AE/AEs) associated with
      PD003J treatment of idiopathic PD at 4 months post treatment. Safety will be evaluated
      individually for each subject who is treated. An analysis of safety will be performed on all
      treated subjects and will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of
      device- and procedure-related complications. In particular, in this study, the incidence of
      severe involuntary movements (one-sided ballism) is confirmed. All AEs will be reported and
      categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated to the
      device, subthalamotomy procedure, and/or Parkinson's disease progression.

      Secondary endpoints: Secondary endpoints will include both comparison of baseline to 1 week
      visit, 2-month visit and baseline to 4-month visit assessments for the following: • MDS-UPDRS
      parts I, II, III, and IV • Levodopa equivalent medication usage (milligrams) • Patient and
      Physician Global Impression of Change • Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire.
