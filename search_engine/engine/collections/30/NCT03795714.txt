      significant epicardial coronary stenosis and discrepancy between angiographic stenosis
      severity and the presence of myocardial ischemia, invasive physiologic indices such as
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) has been a standard
      method to guide decision of revascularization.

      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are an intracoronary
      imaging method able to provide information about lumen area, vessel area, plaque burden, and
      plaque characteristics that can be used for the guidance of revascularization procedure.
      Several previous studies explored the diagnostic performance of intravascular imaging-defined
      quantitative parameters to predict functional significance defined by FFR, however,
      quantitative parameter derived from intravascular imaging showed only moderate diagnostic
      accuracy and the optimal cut-off value of intravascular imaging-derived minimal lumen area
      (MLA) or minimal lumen diameter (MLD) were varied according to the patient population,
      interrogated vessels, and the location of target lesions, suggesting limited clinical
      relevance of judging functional significance of target stenosis using intravascular imaging
      alone. Nevertheless, the adoption rate of FFR-guided decision has been limited due to various
      reasons and intravascular image-guided decision has been still used in substantial proportion
      of the patients.

      Recently, new resting pressure-derived indices including resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) or
      diastolic pressure ratio (dPR) have been introduced as other substitutes for iFR, which does
      not require administration of hyperemic agents, therefore, possess more convenient in daily
      practice. Recent study with the largest sample size demonstrated identical diagnostic
      property and prognostic implication among iFR, RFR, and dPR. As those resting
      pressure-derived indices might have more generalizability for daily practice, it is expected
      to raise the adoption rate of physiologic interrogation. Therefore, understanding the
      association between all the available physiologic indices and intravascular imaging-derived
      quantitative and qualitative parameters might be important in clinical decision for patient
      who underwent invasive coronary angiography.

      In this regard, the investigators sought to evaluate diagnostic accuracy and performance of
      intravascular imaging-derived quantitative parameters to predict functional significance of
      stenosis defined using all the available physiologic indices and further explores the
      association between IVUS and OCT-derived plaque characteristics and invasive physiologic
      indices.
