      session will capture cognitive performance, health history, and relevant social, behavioral,
      and emotional processes. The second session approximately one week later will capture neural
      structure, function, and chemistry. In the first session, participants will undergo screening
      for psychological disorders, neuropsychological testing and pulmonary function assessment at
      the Southern Methodist University (SMU) or UT Southwestern site. They will then participate
      in a second session at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) Advanced
      Imaging Research Center (AIRC) with structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and brain metabolic activity with spectroscopy. Blood
      draws and additional pre- and post-neuroimaging spirometry will also be performed at the
      second session. Potential participants identified by brief phone screen will be invited for
      two assessment sessions 1 week apart. At the first session, they will be consented,
      interviewed about their asthma and/or general health status, and pulmonary function tests
      will be performed. They will then fill in questionnaires and will be screened for
      psychological disorders by standardized psychiatric interview. After that, they will complete
      the neuropsychological test battery. The second session will entail spirometry (to ascertain
      adequate lung function for imaging), the 1 Â½ hour neuroimaging protocol, saliva samples, and
      blood sampling. Spirometry will be repeated at the end of the imaging session. We will also
      offer patients a brief optional session before the imaging session to get acquainted to the
      scanning environment in a mock scanner.
