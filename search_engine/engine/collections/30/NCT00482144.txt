      cryotherapy, intralesional corticosteroids, surgical scar revision, and lasers, among others.
      Previous studies have shown that treatment of scars with the pulsed dye laser (PDL) alone or
      in combination with other modalities (e.g. corticosteroids, 5-Fluoruracil, silicone sheets)
      improves the vascularity, pliability, color, and height of hypertrophic scars and keloids.
      Currently, the PDL has become the laser of choice for the treatment of scars.

      To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature comparing the effects of different
      wavelengths of the PDL for the treatment of scars. The objective of this study was to compare
      the effects of the PDL at 585nm vs 595nm in the treatment of postsurgical linear scars
      starting the day of suture removal.
