      first year after cardiac transplantation under the present immunosuppression regimens. The
      standard for rejection surveillance has been the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). However, EMB is
      invasive, causes morbidity, and is subject to sampling error and inter-observer variability.

      Gene expression profiling (GEP), with its high negative predictive value (NPV) for acute
      cellular rejection (ACR), appears to be well suited to identify low-risk patients who can be
      safely managed without routine invasive endomyocardial biopsy (EMB).

      The Invasive Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression (IMAGE) multicenter study was
      conducted between the years 2005-2009 and studied patients who were >6 months-5 years post
      transplant. The IMAGE study demonstrated that the clinical outcome of heart transplant
      patients managed with AlloMap® was noninferior to patients managed with EMB. The EIMAGE study
      expands the time window under study to include patients who are 2 months (≥ 55 days)
      post-transplant. This earlier time frame of study is the primary difference between the
      EIMAGE study and the IMAGE study.
