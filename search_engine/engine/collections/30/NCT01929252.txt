      analgesia after hysterectomy essential and several techniques are used such as administration
      of opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and wound infiltration of local
      anaesthetics. Different local anaesthetics can be used for the wound infiltration
      techniques.Ifiltration of the surgical wound with bupivacaine following outpatient provides
      pain relief in the postoperative period , allows the early discharge from the outpatient
      surgical units.There has been increased interest in administration of analgesic prior to
      surgical injury. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with
      sedative , anxiolytic, analgesic, sympatholytic and antihypertensive effects.Dexmedetomidine
      has been used intravenously before initiation of anaesthesia and it has shown to provide some
      analgesic effect after surgery but there were some adverse hemodynamic effects. Surgical
      wound administration of dexmedetomidine may be useful to avoid the adverse haemodynamic
      effects of intravenous administration while still providing the postoperative analgesia.
