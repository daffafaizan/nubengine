      Blantyre, Malawi with complicated SAM. Following informed consent, children will be recruited
      once they have completed the initial stabilisation phase of management and enter the
      transition phase to nutritional rehabilitation. They will be randomly allocated to one of 3
      arms, either 1) standard feeds (F-100 and/or ready-to-use therapeutic feeds), 2) a polymeric
      therapeutic formula or 3) an elemental therapeutic formula. The alternative feeds will be
      supplemented with micronutrients to be equivalent in composition to F-100. All children will
      remain admitted to the ward for 2 weeks and receive exclusively the allocated formula. All
      other aspects of the management of SAM will follow current practice based on WHO guidelines.
