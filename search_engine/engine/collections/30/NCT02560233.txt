      modulating neural, endocrine, and subjective reactivity to psychosocial stress. More
      specifically, the investigators pursue the following goals: a) to evaluate whether neural and
      subjective stress-reactivity can be modified by training volitional control over targeted
      brain activity by means of RT-fMRI-NF; b) to evaluate whether neuromodulation by means of
      RT-fMRI-NF can be used as a new way to modulate hormone-release into the periphery; and c) to
      evaluate whether the efficacy of neuromodulation by RT-fMRI-NF can also be reflected on EEG
      data as well as the autonomic nervous system (ANS) measured by heart rate variability (HRV).
