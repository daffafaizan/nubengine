      addictive behaviors, such as overeating. These areas are called 'dopamine type 2 receptors'
      (DRD2/3) and other studies have shown that obese people have less of these. We propose that
      low DRD2/3 availability seen in morbidly obese subjects will change with weight loss
      associated with bariatric surgery.
