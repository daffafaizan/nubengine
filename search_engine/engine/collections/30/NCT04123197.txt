      Despite scientific advances, it is unclear whether the pathophysiology of CHD differs between
      women and men. The study of CHD in women has historically been centered on older women,
      however, women with early onset CHD are informative for the study of early risk factors and
      pathophysiology. Furthermore, young women with a myocardial infarction (MI) have emerged as a
      group in need of special study as this group has higher mortality compared with men of
      similar age despite less severe disease. These disparities remain unexplained and suggest sex
      differences in the pathophysiology, risk factors and prognostic factors of acute MI.

      The psychosocial sphere is a largely neglected area for CHD prevention in women. Social and
      emotional exposures mostly beginning early in life (depression, early life adversities,
      poverty and posttraumatic stress symptoms) are more common in younger women with MI compared
      with men and community controls. In addition to being more prevalent, it is possible that
      emotional stress is a stronger risk factor in young women than other groups. A significant
      challenge, however, is to measure stress in a valid way.

      Building on previous work, the current project will clarify sex differences in pathways of
      risk linking emotional stress to mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSI) and
      cardiovascular outcomes in young post-MI patients. Within 8 months of MI, 300 patients â‰¤60
      years of age (at the time of the MI), 50% women, will be tested in the lab with a stress
      challenge to asses MSI using an established protocol with myocardial perfusion imaging.
      Participants will be monitored at home for 1 week, and then followed for clinical events for
      3 years.
