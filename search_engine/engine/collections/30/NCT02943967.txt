      A (UVA) light increases corneal rigidity and has been described as an effective method for
      stabilizing the cornea in patients with progressive keratoconus. The photochemical reaction
      in this procedure causes the collagen to form additional covalent connections between its
      fibers, which stabilizes the stromal collagen fibers, improving the collagen's structure and
      the cornea rigidity. It is a relatively safe procedure with low rates of complications
      Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) it is a traditional technique for refractive surgery. In
      cases of irregular corneas or re-operation normally the favorite ablation profile chosen is
      the guided surgery, topography guided or wavefront guided, showing better results. This
      technique is also relatively safe procedure with low rates of complications. One of the most
      unwanted complications of this surgery and also rare is corneal ectasia.

      Combining PRK and CXL is already done in patients with keratoconus and suspected keratoconus.

      This combined procedure uses the principle that CXL stiffen the cornea making it possible to
      reduce corneal thickness with PRK without weakening corneal strength. Literature show better
      results, in keratoconus, with simultaneous procedures. Guedj et al performed PRK in
      keratoconus suspects and within 5 years he did not found any corneal ectasia.
