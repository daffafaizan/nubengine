      I. Compare disease-free survival rates of patients randomly assigned to adjuvant
      external-beam radiotherapy vs. no adjuvant therapy following radical prostatectomy and pelvic
      lymphadenectomy for surgical Stage C (T3 N0 M0) adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this adjuvant
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Randomization takes place when the patient is physically able to
      begin treatment, any time within 16 weeks after surgery.

      Arm I: Radiotherapy. Irradiation of the prostatic bed using megavoltage equipment with
      effective photon energies of greater than 4 MV.

      Arm II: No further treatment.
