    
      This is a double-blind (neither physician or participant knows name of the assigned study
      drug), placebo-controlled (substance containing no medication), crossover study in male and
      female volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus. For each volunteer, the study consists of a
      screening phase (up to 45 days), a run-in phase during which volunteers discontinue their
      oral hypoglycemic drugs (28 days), a treatment phase during which volunteers will continue to
      be off their oral hypoglycemic drugs (28 days) and will receive 4 single dose study
      treatments in a randomized (study sequence assigned by chance) sequence, and a follow-up
      phase (10 days). After the follow-up phase volunteers will restart their oral hypoglycemic
      drugs. During the treatment phase there will be at least 7 days between each of the 4
      treatments. The four treatments will be Dose 1 of JNJ-38431055, Dose 2 of JNJ-38431055,
      sitagliptin (Januvia), and placebo. The following safety evaluations will be taken throughout
      the study: Electrocardiogram (an ECG is a painless procedure that gives a picture of the
      electrical activity of the heart), Blood pressure, heart rate, and blood samples for
      laboratory tests. The primary outcome will be incremental glucose after an oral glucose
      tolerance test. Study drug will be administered as single oral doses separated by at least 7
      days. The four treatments will be Dose 1 of JNJ-38431055, Dose 2 of JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin
      (Januvia), and placebo.
