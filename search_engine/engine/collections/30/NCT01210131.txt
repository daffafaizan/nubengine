      with resistance for radiotherapy and approximately 70 % of SCLC are severely hypoxic at
      diagnosis[2].

      We hypothesize that it might be possible to use a selective boost in these patients to tumor
      areas which are still hypoxic at the end of the standard chemo-radiotherapy to a dose of 45
      Gy in 30 fractions in 3 weeks.

      This way all SCLC (small cell lung cancer) patients can receive a safe, but higher dose of
      radiotherapy to the whole tumor volume, while the most resistant areas receive the highest
      possible dose.

      This is a hypothesis generating trial designed to deliver at least the current standard
      treatment to malignant tissue while defining patient selection criteria for future study.
