      phase the IInd for this new vaccine. Additional it will allow to obtain information in
      relation to the immunity crossed between(among) pandemic vaccines and seasonal vaccines.
      Equally it will allow to obtain evidence on the impact of the possible protection of the
      seasonal vaccine that is in use in the routine programs of vaccination in opposition to the
      virus of the influenza To (H1N1sw). Finally this type of study is only(unique) in his design
      since adult population will be evaluated in Mexico.

      This study will allow:

        1. To evaluate and to compare the experimental vaccine against the virus of the pandemic
           influenza To (H1N1) produced by Sanofi with the seasonal trivalent vaccine against the
           influenza.

        2. To determine the possibility of predicting the level of immunological response in level
           terms(ends) of antibodies that the Vaccine pandemic Sanofi produces To (H1N1).

        3. To determine the possibility of predicting the frequency of adverse reactions attributed
           to the Vaccine pandemic Sanofi To (H1N1) evaluated in adult Mexican population. The
           response will be evaluated of seroconversi√≥n (I increase in the titles in four times
           with regard to the level basal), seropositividad (titles(degrees) overhead of 1:40) and
           titles(degrees) to geometric averages. The patients will be analyzed in the group in
           which they were randomized (intention of treatment). The information will be tried using
           the statistical package SPSS, version 10.1.
