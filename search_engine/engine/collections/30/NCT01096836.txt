      health behavior modifications, including better eating habits and regular physical activity
      (including resistance training - RT) as a strategy to control and prevent the problem.
      Traditionally, diets poor in energy and fat (conventional diets - CONV) have been recommended
      to promote losses in body and fat masses; however, there has been recently a growing interest
      in the academic community to investigate the effects of low carbohydrate diet (LCD) on health
      outcomes, since this kind of diet appears to be more effective for reducing body mass as
      compared to CONV. Nevertheless, evidences are scarce regarding the effects of LCD associated
      to RT on body composition, strength performance, blood lipids, endothelium function and other
      markers of health, demanding the development of clinical trials aiming to determine the
      combined health effects of these interventions.
