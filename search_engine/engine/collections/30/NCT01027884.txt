    
      This study was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      efficacy and safety study. DMD patients (ambulatory and non-ambulatory) at age 10-18 years
      were enrolled at sites in Europe and North America. Study subjects were randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either idebenone (900 mg/day) or placebo 3 times a day with meals for 52
      weeks. The primary endpoint was the difference between Catena®/Raxone® and placebo in the
      change from Baseline to week 52 in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF as percent predicted, PEF%p, a
      measure of respiratory muscle strength) as measured by hospital-based spirometry. PEF was
      also measured by the patient at home using the hand-held ASMA-1 device (secondary endpoint).
      Other respiratory endpoints included Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (as percent
      predicted, FEV1%p, an additional measure of respiratory muscle strength) and Forced Vital
      Capacity (as percent predicted, FVC%p, a measure of restrictive lung disease predictive of
      morbidity and mortality in DMD).
