      tract. Virus has been reported to target other mucus tissues, such as the conjunctiva of the
      eye and causes conjunctivitis. A recent study has detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the
      tears of patients affected by COVID-19 with conjunctivitis, using real-time reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This suggests that droplets and body fluids
      of infected people can contaminate the human conjunctival mucosa and it can be a view of
      transmission that it must not be ignored.

      A role of miRNAs has been found in ocular infections such as fungal, bacterial, viral
      infections. It would be interesting to correlate tear fluid miRNA levels to patients clinical
      findings
