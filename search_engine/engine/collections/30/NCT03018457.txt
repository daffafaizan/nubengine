    
      The aim of this study is to check whether the trabecular bone with its microarchitecture
      plays a predictive role in osseointegration of dental implants precisely in its biological
      stability phase or its secondary stability phase.

      If this correlation is established, a larger study must be conducted to identify a profile of
      patients at risk for failure of osseointegration of the dental implant.
