      of the skin, has been possible for decades using live parasites, the production and storage
      of live cultures are difficult. Since inoculation occasionally leads to severe infection,
      most experts now advocate against their use. We have shown excellent protection using a
      "heat-killed" vaccine that combines autoclaved leishmania antigen with recombinant human
      interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) and aluminum hydroxide gel as adjuvants in a rhesus macaque model of
      disease. To assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans, we now propose a
      rhIL-12 dose escalation Phase I/II trial.
