      hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase lining the vascular bed, with subsequent release of FFA for
      transport across the endothelium. Whether the intermittent flux of FFA has the same impact as
      the i.v. lipid infusion will be examined. Decreased endothelial function has been reported
      after a single or long-term dietary high fat load in normal subjects; however, others have
      found no effects on brachial artery vasoreactivity. Our preliminary studies indicate that
      high oral fat loads (60 g) resulted in higher FFA levels and BP changes, and reduced FMD
      compared to low fat load (25 g).
