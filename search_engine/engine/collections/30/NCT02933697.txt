      phase IIIb trial to assess the safety of apixaban versus the vitamin-K antagonist
      phenprocoumon in patients with NVAF and ESKD on hemodialysis treatment. The trial will be
      conducted in about 25-30 sites in Germany.

      The primary goal of this study is to assess the safety of two types of oral anticoagulants in
      patients with ESKD on hemodialysis with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The novel
      FXa inhibitor apixaban (at a reduced dose of 2x 2.5 mg/day) will be compared to the vitamin-K
      antagonist (VKA) phenprocoumon (target range: International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.0-3.0)
      regarding bleeding rates during chronic administration for prevention of stroke or systemic
      embolism.

      The primary hypothesis of the study is that oral anticoagulation with apixaban will improve
      the safety by significantly reducing bleeding rates in patients with ESKD on hemodialysis and
      NVAF compared to the VKA phenprocoumon.

      A pharmacokinetic sub-study will be performed with 28 patients included in the apixaban
      treatment group to evaluate the systemic exposure of apixaban before and after hemodialysis
      session in this special population.
