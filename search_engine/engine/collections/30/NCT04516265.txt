      training and video-based trunk training applied with Theratogs in children with hemiparetic
      type Cerebral Palsy. It is planned to include 45 patients with hemiparetic cerebral palsy
      between the ages of 5-15 and with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level
      I-III. Patients with cerebral palsy will be divided into 3 groups in a randomized controlled
      manner. Each group will continue and follow routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation
      treatments for 8 weeks. Then, structured trunk training will begin. NGT-based trunk training
      (45 minutes) to the first group, video-based trunk training (45 minutes) to the second group,
      and Video-based trunk training (45 minutes) will apply with Theratogs to the third group.
      Treatments will be applied two days a week for 8 weeks.
