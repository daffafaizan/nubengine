      therapy. Saliva has vital functions in maintaining periodontal and oral health. Therefore,
      xerostomia not only impairs quality of life permanently, but may also increase the risk of
      caries and tooth extractions. Nevertheless, despite more than 6 decades of radioiodine
      therapy for thyroid cancer, large studies on long-term oral adverse events are still lacking.
      In the present study, we investigate the influence of high-dose radioiodine therapy on the
      long-term oral health.
