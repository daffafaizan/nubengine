      I. Determine sexual function and penile morphometric outcomes for the post-robotic-assisted
      laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) patients undergoing daily vacuum therapy using one of two
      randomized methods and whether these outcomes differ.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare compliance rates between the two randomized groups using the compliance
      questionnaire and a diary collected from patients at each follow up visit.

      II. Compare overall patient satisfaction with the recovery procedure between the two
      randomized groups utilizing the SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) questionnaire.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive vacuum therapy daily over 10 minutes while holding erection for 2
      minutes after undergoing RALP. Patients complete erection process 5 times.

      GROUP B: Patients receive vacuum therapy daily over 10 minutes while holding erection for 5
      minutes after undergoing RALP. Patients complete erection process 2 times.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
