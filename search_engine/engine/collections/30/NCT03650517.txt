    
      MIRCAST study is an observational, prospective, parallel cohorts, international, multi-center
      to compare robotic assisted and laparoscopic minimally invasive right colectomy, and
      intracorporeal anastomosis versus extracorporeal anastomosis.

      The research is coordinated by Marcos Gómez Ruiz MD PhD from Hospital Universitario Marqués
      de Valdecilla in Santander, Spain; the sponsorship is performed by Fundacion Instituto de
      Investigación Marqués de Valdecilla (IDIVAL). The European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP)
      endorses MIRCAST Study and will run a quality audit/independent monitoring of the study.

      The objectives of study are to compare of the peri-operative complications after robotic
      assisted and laparoscopic minimally invasive right colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis
      versus extracorporeal anastomosis.

      To Identify potential benefits of robotic assisted procedures for right colon resections.
