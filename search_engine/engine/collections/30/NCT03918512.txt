      In a first step, semi-structured in-depth individual interviews were conducted from September
      20, 2016 to January 4, 2017, in 20 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria to collect concepts
      related to LSS-specific activity limitation, participation restriction and patients' views
      about their condition. Thematic content was analysed using investigator triangulation.
      Overall, 57 items were generated by patients. 48 items were related to LSS-specific activity
      limitation and were used to construct the provisional 48-item Cochin L3S questionnaire
      (CL3S-48). Acceptability and understandability of the provisional CL3S-48 questionnaire was
      tested and consolidated in 10 patients with LSS.

      Item reduction and validation of the questionnaire :

      In a second step, 200 eligible patients according to our medical records will be informed by
      email of the purpose of the study, their non-opposition to the collection of data will be
      collected and patients will be invited to complete the following online self-administered
      questionnaires at baseline, 7 days and 3 months:

        -  Demographical and clinical characteristics at baseline

        -  Consolidated version of the CL3S-48 questionnaire

        -  Lumbar pain numeric rating scale (NRS)

        -  Radicular pain NRS

        -  Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) physical function subscale

        -  Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)

        -  Fukushima LSS Scale 25 (FLS-25)

        -  12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)

        -  1 anchoring question about patient acceptable symptom state

        -  1 anchoring question about patient minimal clinically important difference at 3 months.

      In a third step, the number of items will be reduced according to their metrological
      qualities. The psychometric properties of the new scale will be assessed and the scale will
      be consolidated to provide the final questionnaire
