      its microbial-derived metabolites (urolithin) on the gut microbiome and inflammation-related
      biomarkers in a human clinical study. Patients will be enrolled and detailed demographic and
      dietary information, biopsy specimens through colonoscopies, as well as fecal, blood and
      urine samples will be collected. The wide range of gut urolithin levels provides the
      rationale for our proposed studies. Will the specific urolithin phenotypes show a disparate
      range of chemopreventive (anti-inflammatory) response to walnut consumption? The hypothesis
      is that walnut ingestion in "Phenotype A" participants (producing the highest levels of
      urolithin) will be associated with a beneficial anti-inflammatory response as tested in
      colonic mucosa and a higher abundance of bacterial species associated with ellagic acid
      metabolism. Although 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene (rRNA) sequencing allows inexpensive
      bacterial identification at the genus/species level, a whole genome sequencing (mWGS) will be
      employed to achieve finer classification (strain level), and identify other microbes (e.g.,
      viruses, fungi, small eukaryotes). Furthermore, mWGS targets the entire genome of each
      microbe (not just the 16S rRNA gene), allowing for construction of a microbial gene
      catalogue, including a metabolic pathway description for each sample. This will characterize
      the functional potential of the microbial community. Ultimately, the proposed studies will
      inform the application of prebiotic to enhance the formation of urolithin metabolites from
      ellagic acid for the prevention of inflammation-associated Colorectal Cancer, a development
      that would have significant translational implications.
