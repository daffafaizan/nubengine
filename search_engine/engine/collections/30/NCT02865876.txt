      risk factors (immunosuppressive status, ocular trauma, previous ocular surgery, contact lens
      wear, topical corticosteroids use), best-corrected visual acuity (Snellen chart), slit-lamp
      biomicroscopy, tonometry and fundoscopy. In addition, anterior segment optical coherence
      tomography imaging (Visante, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA), corneal scrapes,
      culture and clinical photographs at day 1, day 7, month 1 and 3 will be analyzed.

      Each participant will be assigned to one of four groups after randomization. Group 1: Initial
      ulcer on treatment with antibiotic plus sham (n = 66), these partcipants will receive only
      topical moxifloxacin 0,5% (Vigamoxi, Alcon, Texas, USA) and sham CXL; Group 2: Initial ulcer
      on treatment with antibiotic plus cross-linking (CXL) (n = 66) receive moxifloxacin plus CXL
      (riboflavin 0.1% during 10 minutes and irradiation 30 mW/cm2 during 3 minutes using
      accelerated CXL); Group 3: Refractory corneal ulcer on treatment with antibiotic plus sham
      (n=66), receive only topical antibiotic plus sham CXL; Group 4: Refractory corneal ulcer on
      treatment with antibiotic plus CXL will receive their standard medications plus CXL.

      Statistical analysis will be divided into four phases: 1) Analysis of compliance, 2)
      Intention to treat, 3) Losses to follow-up and 4) Variable-response (healing) using Stata/MP
      12.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).
