    
      Up to 154 patients will be recruited in the TACTI-003 (Two ACTive Immunotherapies) Phase II
      study which will take place across several countries in Australia, Europe and United States
      of America in up to 35 experienced clinical sites. It will evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of eftilagimod alpha in combination with pembrolizumab against pembrolizumab alone in 1st
      line metastatic or recurrent HNSCC with PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥1) tumors, and determine the
      efficacy and safety of efti plus pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 negative tumors.
      Subjects in cohort A (CPS ≥1) will be randomized 1:1 to receive either "P+E": efti plus
      pembrolizumab or "P only": pembrolizumab alone. Subjects in cohort B (CPS <1) will receive a
      combination of efti and pembrolizumab "P+E". Efti will be administered for up to 24 months
      using a 30 mg s.c. dosing every 2 or 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab will be administered for up to 24
      months using a 400mg i.v. (30 min) dosing every 6 weeks.
