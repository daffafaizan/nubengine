      airway disease. Treatment dosimetry will be up to 4, 5-second spray cycles. Subjects will
      have initial cryospray treatment at Day 0. Subjects will undergo repeat bronchoscopy in the
      first three to seven days after the initial treatment, to check for mucosal sloughing and to
      reassess luminal patency of the airway. Subjects may undergo up to one bronchoscopy per week
      with CSA therapy for a total of four (4) treatments in the first month. If they present with
      symptoms thereafter, then a repeat bronchoscopy will be performed; if luminal obstruction is
      noted, then the subject will begin the treatment protocol again. If disease exists
      bilaterally, only one side will be sprayed initially.
