      that will investigate whether differences can be found in selected outcomes related to wound
      care, using Versatile One (EZCare)versus KCI VAC negative pressure/vacuum systems. Only
      wounds which currently meet criteria for such device use,and for which a physician's order
      has been written for the device, will be included in this study.
