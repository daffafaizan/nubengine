      protein intake to 0.8 g per kilogram/day of their ideal body weight. Loss of 5% of their body
      weight are considered to achieve the weight-loss goal. The intervention included 6 bi-weekly,
      30-minute individual dietary counseling sessions over 12-weeks. Behavioral strategies
      including self-monitoring, problem solving, goal setting, stimulus control, food
      substitution, and relapse prevention were taught to assist participants in meeting their
      fiber and protein goals.
