      connection between inflammation and pathogenesis of some neoplasms was determined in a number
      of studies. Some studies show promise that ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte count (NLCR) may
      be recognized as a prognostic marker for several carcinomas: renal, lung and colorectal. The
      aim of the study is to assess whether the value of neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio from the
      routine preoperative blood test may predict lung tumors' grading. During routine preoperative
      blood tests complete blood count is done and NLCR, WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte count is
      noted. After the thoracic surgery intervention and histopathological examination grading of
      lung tumor is noted.
