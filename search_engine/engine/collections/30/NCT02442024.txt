      ingestion of protein and lipid happens before that of carbohydrates. A control group follows
      a standardized diet in which the ingestion of carbohydrates happens before that of protein
      and lipid. Both diets contain a reduced intake of high-glycemic index meals, saturated fatty
      acids, trans fatty acids and alcohol.

      On four days separated by one month each other (two before the beginning of the diet and two
      after 1 month and 2 months of diet) we measure clinical and metabolic parameters (weight,
      waist and hip circumferences, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fructosamine, lipid profile) to
      compare the effects of the two diets.
