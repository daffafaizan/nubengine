    
      In this prospective, randomized, sham-controlled study, fifty four patients (23 female and 31
      male, the mean age 53.61Â±11.99 years) with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve compression with
      clinical and electrophysiological findings were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to
      three groups: 1) Ultrasound-guided injection group, 2) TENS group, 3) Sham TENS group. The
      blockage of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was performed for therapeutic meralgia
      paresthetica management in group 1. Ten sessions of conventional TENS were administered to
      each patient 5 days a week for 2 weeks, for 20 minutes per daily session in Group 2, and sham
      TENS was applied to group 3 with the same protocol.

      Visual Analog Scale (VAS), painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q), Semmes Weinstein monofilament
      test (SWMt), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and health-related quality of life (SF
      36), at onset (T1), 15 days after treatment (T2) and 1 month after treatment (T3) were used
      for evaluation.
