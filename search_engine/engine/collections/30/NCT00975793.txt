    
      The primary aim of the study is to determine whether providing EGDT, compared to standard
      care, reduces 90-day mortality in patients presenting to the ED of hospitals in Australasia
      with severe sepsis.

      Each patient meeting all of the exclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      randomised in the ED to receive either EGDT for a total of 6 hours post-randomisation, or
      standard care.

      Patients assigned to receive EGDT will be cared for by the dedicated ARISE study team. The
      patient will receive treatment as per the study protocol for 6 hours with central blood
      oxygen levels as the target end-point, then receive standard care.

      Patients assigned to receive standard care will continue to be cared for by the hospital team
      in accordance with current best practice.

      Patients in both groups will also receive any additional treatment needed, such as
      antibiotics or surgery.

      This study will involve 1600 patients with severe sepsis admitted to the ED from multiple
      hospitals.
