      Primary

        -  Assess if temozolomide induces any changes in standard semen or sperm analysis
           parameters (i.e., volume, viscosity, pH, forward progression, total count, total motile
           count, motility, presence of round cells, agglutination, and morphology) in patients
           with newly diagnosed, recurrent, or progressive primary malignant brain tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      During treatment with temozolomide, patients undergo semen or sperm sample collection at
      baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for semen analysis. Samples are analyzed for volume,
      viscosity, pH, forward progression, total count, total motile count, motility, presence of
      round cells, agglutination, and morphology.
