      parents/caregivers of infants to improve feeding practices and decrease excessive weight gain
      in infants who are participants of the WIC program in two distinct locations, Puerto Rico and
      Hawaii; to assess acceptability and practicality of the intervention; and to assess
      acceptability of collecting blood spots in future studies. The investigators will recruit a
      convenience sample of parent/caregivers of infants 0-2 months participating in the WIC
      program in Puerto Rico and Hawaii to send weekly SMS for 4 months. The weekly messages will
      focus on reinforcing the breastfeeding messages provided by WIC, preventing overfeeding,
      delaying introduction of solid foods, and delaying and reducing baby juice consumption, which
      are key issues in low-income populations. Participants will complete validated questionnaires
      and anthropometry before and after the trial and results will be compared to the control
      group (no messages). Participants will also answer short questions by SMS at different points
      and an interview at the end of the trial to assess the SMS. The investigators will assess how
      many participants agree to collect blood spots in their infants in future studies.
