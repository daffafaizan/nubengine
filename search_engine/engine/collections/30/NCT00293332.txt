    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pathologic response rate and the resectability rate in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels or expression with response
           and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 15-60 minutes, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes,
      and bevacizumab* IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 4-6
      weeks after completion of chemotherapy, eligible patients with no distant or mediastinal
      disease progression undergo lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or segmentectomy with standard radical
      mediastinal lymph node dissection.

      NOTE: *Bevacizumab is only administered during courses 1 and 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 8 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
