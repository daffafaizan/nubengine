      primarily affects an individual's bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of blood
      cells. The major problem for most patients is aplastic anemia, the blood counts for red blood
      cells, white blood cells, and platelets are low. In addition, some patients have physical
      defects usually involving the skeleton and kidneys. Fanconi anemia is typically diagnosed in
      childhood, and there is a high fatality rate. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      is a common treatment for Fanconi anemia. However, there are many risks associated with HSCT
      including rejection of the transplanted cells and graft-versus-host disease.

      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector,
      the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of immune reconstitution in
      patients overcoming immune abnormalities present at the time of treatment, assessment of gene
      correction efficiency, and finally the long-term correction of Fanconi anemia associated
      disease symptoms.
