      dose-ranging study in infants and toddlers hospitalized for RSV LRTI. The study evaluated 3
      dose levels of ALX-0171 in a sequential part (safety Cohorts 1-3) followed by a parallel part
      (Cohort 4).

      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was assigned to review study data and provide
      recommendations on proceeding to the next safety cohort and on which dose levels could be
      taken forward in the parallel part.

      Three dose levels of ALX-0171 were evaluated:

        -  Dose 1: target dose of 3.0 mg/kg

        -  Dose 2: target dose of 6.0 mg/kg

        -  Dose 3: target dose of 9.0 mg/kg

      The study drug was administered by inhalation once daily for 3 consecutive days along with
      standard of care treatment, which was determined by the Investigator (or his/her designee)
      according to institutional practice.
