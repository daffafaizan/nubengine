      groups by randomization. They take the medication for four weeks under doubleblind. Two study
      groups take cetylpyridinium chloride of 1.5mg, 4.5mg daily for four weeks. Control group
      takes the placebo for the same period. The main outcome variables are measured and compared
      respectively in baseline, immediately after dosing end and two weeks, four weeks after the
      end of administration. Finally cetylpyridinium chloride is verified whether it has a
      preventive effect on sarcopenia and set an appropriate dose.
