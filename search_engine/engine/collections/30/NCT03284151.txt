    
      Focused stereotactic radiation treatment of localized prostatic adenocarcinoma. in order to
      quantify the delay between the focused treatment and the salvage procedure.

      Second objectives : objectives: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, MRI response,
      toxicity (CTCAEv4), quality of life (International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and The
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF5) scores).

      Method At first: Multiparametric Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - 12 biopsies within the
      whole gland.

      Placement under endorectal ultrasound control of 4 fiducials at least 2 cm spaced.

      Treatment : CyberKnife radiation treatment delivering 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, in 10 days.
      Tracking using the 4 fiducials. Critical organs: Rectal and bladder wall: V35<2cc. Bladder
      neck and urethra: V35<1cc.

      Salvage treatments: in such a context, salvage surgery or salvage intensity modulation
      radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments can in theory remain valid and safe options.
