      studied. We will test the effect that a physically effortful assignment has on the choices
      that a preadolescent makes using a forced choice paradigm in which the participant will be
      asked to choose between and carry out either a high cost-high reward option (HR) or a low
      cost-low reward (LR) option. The HR option will demand a significant amount of physical
      effort and will be paired up with a large reward as opposed to the LR option which will be
      less demanding physically and paired up with a small reward. The assignment will be carried
      out using a hand held dynamometer which measures the power produced by the participants'
      upper extremity.

      We propose that a child with ADHD will choose a task that involves less effort despite the
      small reward tied to it compared to a control child who will choose the more demanding task
      and the larger reward.
