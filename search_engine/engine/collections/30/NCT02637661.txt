    
      Primary objectives: Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of binaural earlobe crease as risk
      factors of AMI.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To study the characteristics of different earlobe creases in different gender of the
           patients with AMI.

        2. To analyze the characteristics of earlobe crease in different age groups.

        3. To compare the feature of earlobe crease in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction and
           non ST elevation myocardial infarction.

        4. The sensitivity,specificity,positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of
           binaural earlobe crease as risk factors of AMI.
