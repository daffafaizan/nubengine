        1. to unravel the targets of BT in severe asthma (how does it work?) which is fundamental
           for better patient selection (who benefits most?) and further improvement of BT
           technology and novel asthma therapy development (how to treat better?). These objectives
           can only be achieved by linking patient-reported outcomes to airway structure/function,
           which is the principal aim of the study proposed.

        2. to investigate clinical outcome analyses
