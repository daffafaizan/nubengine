      Bridge device in the correction of mitral valve regurgitation in patients who qualify for
      mitral valve repair as defined by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE). The device
      is a single use, mitral valve implant designed to reduce mitral regurgitation by reducing the
      septo-lateral mitral annular diameter, promoting early coaptation of the valve leaflets and
      restraining the leaflets below the intra-annular plane.

      The protocol was designed as a First In Man (FIM) with a 6-month follow up but was amended to
      follow the enrolled patients for a total of 5 years.
