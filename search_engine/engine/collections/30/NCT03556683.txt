      Procedures (methods): After undergoing a general health screen, participants will undergo a
      lung transmission scan to create an image of the lungs. Participants will then inhale
      nebulized radiolabeled aerosol and sit in front of a gamma camera for 2 hours to measure
      clearance of radiolabeled particles from the lungs (procedure called gamma scintigraphy),
      which will be used to calculate baseline MCC. Participants will then inhale HS, with
      spirometry performed before and at regular intervals after HS to assess for clinically
      significant reductions in lung function. Vital signs and symptom questionnaires will be
      administered as well. If they are deemed tolerant to HS (i.e. no clinically significant
      deterioration in lung function, vital signs, or symptom questionnaire scores), participants
      will move forward to the next study visit. At the next visit, participants will again inhale
      nebulized HS and will undergo a gamma scintigraphy scan immediately after to measure the
      acute effects of HS on MCC. At a separate visit, participants will inhale nebulized HS and
      undergo gamma scintigraphy scan 4 hours later to measure prolonged effects of HS on MCC.
