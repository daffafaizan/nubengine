      during treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors
      using meibography. Patients with dyslipidemia with or without HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
      (statin) treatment were recruited. Medical records are collected prospectively from Dec. 8th
      2016 to Dec. 31st 2019. Meibomian gland (MG) morphology described by meiboscores, lid margin
      abnormality scores, meibum quality, and dry eye parameters were compared between the two
      groups. This study may also provide information about possible treatment options in patients
      with meibomitis in the future.
