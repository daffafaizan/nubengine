      December 2015 is reviewed. The following definitions are adopted: R0 is any resection with at
      least 1 mm of negative margin; R1vasc is any resection with tumor exposure due to the
      detachment from major intrahepatic vessel (1st/2nd order glissonean pedicles and hepatic vein
      at caval confluence); R1-parenchymal (R1par) is any resection with tumor exposure at
      parenchymal margin.
