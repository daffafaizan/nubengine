    
      Background:

        -  Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can mediate
           the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with high-dose
           aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  In a series of consecutive trials using this chemotherapy preparative regimen alone or
           with 2 Gy or 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) objective response rates using RECIST
           criteria were 49%, 52%, and 72%, respectively. Of the 20 complete regressions seen in
           this trial, 19 are on-going at 70 to 114 months.

        -  The chemotherapy alone preparative regimen required in-patient treatment and was
           associated with significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia requiring multiple
           transfusions and treatment for febrile neutropenia.

      Objectives:

        -  With amendment D, to determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between
           patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not; both groups will
           receive non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen followed by autologous
           young TIL and administration of high dose aldesleukin.

        -  To determine the toxicity of the treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma

        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL

        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      Design:

        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected and after TIL growth is
           established, patients will receive ACT with TIL plus aldesleukin following high dose
           chemotherapy preparative regimen.

        -  Up to 64 patients may be enrolled over 4-5 years.
