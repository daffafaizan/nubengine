      depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),
      bleeding on probing (BOP). BMI and WHR were used for assessing obesity. In addition, HbA1c
      and fasting plasma glucose levels were used for elimination of diabetes mellitus. Based on
      the periodontal and anthropometric measurements, individuals (n=72) were divided into four
      groups: the periodontal-healthy group (n=18), chronic periodontitis group (n=18),
      periodontal-healthy with obesity group (n=18) and chronic periodontitis with obesity group
      (n=18). Periodontitis patients received nonsurgical periodontal therapy. GCF sampling and
      clinical periodontal parameters were assessed before and 6 weeks after therapy. Chemerin and
      IL-6 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
