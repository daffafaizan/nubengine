      fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. As with any condition of chronic pain, psychological
      mechanisms can help maintain discomfort and pain. These mechanisms may hinder the recovery of
      physical activity. Some patients may use cognitive strategies of emotional regulation that
      are ineffective to cope with pain and discomfort of everyday activities, such as rumination.
      The literature suggests that this process is linked to the physical and psychological
      difficulties of fibromyalgia. However, no study has revealed a causal link between rumination
      and negative affectivity in a context of physical activity in this population. The
      investigators want to test this hypothesis by directly manipulating the style of information
      processing following a relevant activity for these patients: climbing steps. In one group the
      investigators will induce rumination right after climbing the steps. In the other group the
      investigators will induce distraction. Patient with Fibromyalgia will be recruited at the
      Pain Center of CHU-Amiens. Patients will complete different scales before to climb steps and
      after experimental induction. The investigators hypothesize that Patients using a rumination
      strategy after an uncomfortable physical activity will experience a greater subjective
      discomfort than patients using a distraction strategy.
