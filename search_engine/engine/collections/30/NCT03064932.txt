      be randomly assigned to receive each 4-week treatment (diet) in random order. Each test diet
      period will be separated by a standard 4-week compliance break. Data collection will be
      conducted across at baseline (start of study) and the end of each diet period to assess the
      effects of chronic spice consumption on selected cardiovascular endpoints.
