      lead to the adverse remodeling of left ventricular. Doxycycline inhibiting MMPs and it help
      to prevent collagen degradation and following LV (left ventricular) dilatation. Some
      experimental studies on rat models have suggested an anti-remodeling effect of doxycycline in
      myocardial infarction by means of decrease in activity of MMPs-2 and recovery of contractile
      function of myocardium. The clinical trial was performed at 2013 (D.Antoniucci), but it was a
      single study and confirmed theoretical and experimental background.

      The study is randomized, opened, controlled. 45 patients with the first anterior STEMI will
      be enrolled. On admission all patients will receive reperfusion therapy during the first 24
      h. Patients will be randomized by the open envelope method and after that some of the
      participants will be on doxycycline (100 mg b.i.d. for 7 days) in addition to routine medical
      therapy for STEMI, but other will be on routine medical therapy of STEMI. After that they
      will have echocardiography at 3-d, 7-th, 14-th days and 6 month after STEMI. The
      investigators will evaluate left ventricular function of these patients by routine and
      speckle-tracking echocardiography, incidence of cardiovascular end points (death, recurrent
      myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, stroke) and their combinations, also the
      investigators will take blood samples to assess metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other
      biomarkers.
