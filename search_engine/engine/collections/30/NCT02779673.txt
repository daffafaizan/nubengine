      plant stanols (3.4g as plant stanol esters) on blood cholesterol level. A randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on subjects with LDL-cholesterol level
      130-159mg/dL. The subjects were randomly assigned to either a group ingesting yoghurt drink
      containing 2g plant stanols (3.4g as plant stanol esters) or a placebo group (yoghurt drink
      without plant stanols) for 4-week. The investigators assessed blood cholesterol level.
