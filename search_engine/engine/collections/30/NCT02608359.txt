      the outcome of the study), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team
      work on a medical research study), post-marketing surveillance ([PMS], surveillance of drugs,
      devices, appliances, etc., for efficacy or adverse effects, after they have been released for
      general sale) study. The study will consist of Screening and Enrolment Visit (Day 1) and
      Follow-up Period (12 months). For each participant, the follow-up visits will be conducted as
      per routine clinical practice at month 3, 6 and 9. The End-of-Study (EOS) Visit will be
      conducted after the completion of 12-months abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) and a telephonic
      follow-up will be conducted 30 days after the EOS Visit. The total duration of the study will
      be 13 months. Participants receiving abiraterone acetate as per locally approved prescribing
      information will be enrolled in the PMS. The use of abiraterone acetate will follow dosing
      and frequency stipulated in the locally approved prescribing information. Participants will
      be monitored during treatment of abiraterone acetate and up to 30 days post treatment for
      collection of adverse events. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
