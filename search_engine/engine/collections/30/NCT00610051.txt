      eligibility for transplant and all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed.
      The screening activities may be performed on an outpatient basis in stable patients or as an
      inpatient in unstable patients who are already hospitalized.

      Throughout the study, patients will be maintained medically in accordance with the national
      Guidelines for heart failure, which are mostly based on the European Guidelines for Heart
      Failure (2005) and the American Guidelines for Heart Failure, The primary assessment of
      efficacy is based on the number of days that the patient is hospitalized or is deceased
      during the 24 weeks following the day of randomization, As elective transplantation is biased
      by donor availability, observation period in those cases will be counted until ELECTIVE heart
      transplantation. Additional surrogate measures of efficacy will include monthly assessments
      of Nt-proBNP, patient assessment of dyspnoea, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      Questionnaire, NYHA classification, and use of beta1-blocker therapy.

      Study Population It is planned that a sufficient number of patients will be screened to
      enroll 500 patients (250 patients per treatment group). Compliance with the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria outlined below must be established prior to randomization to double-blind
      therapy.
