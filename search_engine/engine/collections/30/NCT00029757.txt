      identified, with exclusion based on estrogen contraindications. Subjects will have blood
      samples taken before, during and after an eight-day course of once-daily toothpaste that is
      admixed with 0.5 mg estradiol. Toothpaste shall meet strict quality control standards and
      instructions for uniform tooth brushing shall be provided. Serum estradiol will be determined
      from the samples obtained. Statistical analysis shall address absorption by comparing
      baseline estradiol measurements with those a few hours after use. The rate of build-up will
      be assessed by comparing the post-use levels of estradiol at the start of a week and at the
      end of the week. After a week off the estrogen, the rate of decline in serum estradiol will
      be calculated.
