      depression using a 14-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, combination of 100 mg/day of
      naltrexone, 200 mg/day of sertraline, and individual, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). For
      testing the medication, the design will be 2x2, consisting of four groups:
      naltrexone/sertraline, naltrexone only, sertraline only, placebo. All four groups will
      receive once weekly sessions of CBT given by therapists experienced in working with patients
      with substance disorders and trained in the principles of CBT.
