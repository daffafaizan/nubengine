    
      Phase I/II, prospective, single-center study, with consecutive inclusion of 20 diabetic
      patients with critical limb ischemia due to bellow-the-knee extensive arterial disease.

      After the inclusion, patients are submitted to a bone-marrow aspiration (30 ml) under
      sedation. Autologous bone-marrow mononuclear cells (minimum 80 millions mononuclear cells)
      are infused intraarterially at popliteal artery by blocking antegrade perfusion during 3
      minutes.

      Clinical and angiographic follow-up will be performed at 3 months after the infusion to
      assess the efficacy of autologous mononuclear cells transplantation in terms of:

        -  Changes in below-the-knee angiography from baseline to 3 months follow-up.

        -  Changes in Ankle-Brachial pressure Index, transcutaneous oxygen pressure, and size of
           main ischemic ulcer will be also assessed at target limb.
