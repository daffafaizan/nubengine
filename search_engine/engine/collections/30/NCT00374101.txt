      upper gastrointestinal bleeding recommends a high regimen of PPIs, consisting in a dosage of
      80-mg bolus followed by the 8 mg/H infusion, as being superior to the standard dosage (40 mg
      twice daily by bolus injection) in conjunction with some type of endoscopic therapy. However,
      by pooling data fromm studies comparing high doses of PPIs as continuous infusion versus
      regular doses as intermittent bolus, rebleeding, surgery, and mortality were not
      significantly different. As the previous conclusion became apparent in a meta-analytical
      evaluation of only 2 randomized clinical trials, more studies are needed on this topic.
