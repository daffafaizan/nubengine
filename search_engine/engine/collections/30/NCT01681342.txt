      brachytherapy in high dose rate will deliver 15 Gy to the CTVhr (high risk CTV) in two
      sessions.

      A clinical examination and an RMN are performed at the end of the external radiation to
      evaluate the residual tumoral volume. Two HDR brachytherapy sessions are then performed.

      During the first session, a CT-Scan and an RMN will be performed after the fletcher
      application. A second CT-Scan will be performed during the second treatment session to create
      new volumes and to improve organs at risk sparing.
