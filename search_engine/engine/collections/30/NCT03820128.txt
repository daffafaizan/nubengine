      feeding in acute pancreatitis (AP) both oral and via the feeding tube is safe, shortens the
      length of hospital stay, prevents the multi organ failure (MoF) and reduces mortality. The
      pediatric population lacks prospective data concerning refeeding modes in AP. The aim of the
      study is to assess the effect of the early oral refeeding and fat content in the diet on the
      length of stay, clinical course (included pain severity) in pediatric patients with mild and
      moderate AP. Patients will be randomized to groups: refeeding within 24 hours or after 24
      hours from the hospital admission. Biochemical tests including CRP, amylase, lipase and
      proinflammatory cytokines levels and zonulin level as well as severity of pain will be
      assessed again in the second, the third and the fifth hospital day.
