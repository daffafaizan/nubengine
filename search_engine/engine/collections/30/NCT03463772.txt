      undergoing their first cycle of IVF. The participation in this study will be approximately 2
      years with a total of 7 visits from the cycle beginning, pregnancy to delivery. On day 2 or
      day 3 following the onset of menstrual bleeding, eligible patients will be allocated to two
      groups at a ratio of 1:1- IVM protocol, and standard IVF protocol. All participants will be
      randomized through stratified block randomization according to the study sites.
