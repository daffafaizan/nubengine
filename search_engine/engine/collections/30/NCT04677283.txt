    
      This study is taking place in several nursing homes in Ile-de-France, which will be recruited
      at the end of the diagnostic campaign.

      At the initiative of the ARS Ile-de-France, residents and professionals of selected EHPADs
      will be subjected to systematic screening by RT-PCR for Covid-19, then by serology after the
      first screening, regardless of whether either the result

      Samples, by nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR, by capillary blood sampling or venipuncture
      according to the technique for serology, will be carried out according to the doctrines
      issued by the ARS Ile de France and the variations proposed by the appropriate departmental
      directorates in depending on local resources. The results will be brought to the attention of
      EHPADs to adapt the care of residents and positive professionals.

      Data will be collected daily from collection for the first test (RT-PCR), or retrospectively
      if the collection took place before the study.

      Regarding the approach for collecting serologies:

        -  All subjects included with a negative PCR will be offered the serological test, in
           accordance with the recommendations in force or the medical decisions of the
           establishments.

        -  The qualitative results of the serologies of the subjects included in the study
           (residents and professionals) will be collected according to the same circuit as those
           of the RT-PCRs.

        -  Only the symptoms of residents with a positive serology will be collected, from the date
           of the sample and for a period of 14 days.

        -  The symptoms of professionals with a positive serology can be collected, from the date
           of the sample and for a period of 14 days without mandatory character.

        -  Both techniques (ELISA or TROD) are accepted and the serology values will not be
           collected.
