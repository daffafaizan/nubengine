      impairment or distress, as manifested by at least three of a number of criteria such as
      tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, frequent use of alcohol in larger amounts or over longer
      periods than was intended, and others. Excessive intake of alcohol reduces the life span by a
      decade, and alcohol drinking is strongly related to mortality from liver cirrhosis, chronic
      pancreatitis, certain cancers, hypertension, accidents and violence. This study is planned to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of as-needed use of nalmefene 18.06 mg versus placebo in
      decreasing monthly Heavy Drinking Days (HDDs) and decreasing the total consumption during a
      period of 6 months in adult patients with alcohol dependence.
