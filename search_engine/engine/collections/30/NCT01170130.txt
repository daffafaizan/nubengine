      agents for achieving effective mydriasis during phacoemulsification surgery have compared 2
      different groups of patients, ie; One group received topical agents and the other received
      intracameral lidocaine. The resultant pupil size was recorded and evaluated in the 2 groups.
      Our purpose is to compare the effect of these agents on the same group of people.

      Patients recruited will be invited first for evaluation at least 1 week before the surgery.
      During this evaluation 1 dose (drop) of topical cyclopentolate 1% and Phenylephrine 10% will
      be instilled to the evaluated eye 3 times at 10 minutes intervals. After 1 hour from the last
      instillation pupil diameter will be recorded. In the second part of this study during the
      phacoemulsification surgery patients will be given intracamerally lidocaine 1% (0.2 ml) and
      the pupil size will be recorded after 90 seconds. the resultant values will be
      evaluated/compared.
