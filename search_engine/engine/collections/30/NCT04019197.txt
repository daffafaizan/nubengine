      semaglutide in people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy. Participants will be recruited
      from 2 different sites (Cleveland, OH and Charleston, SC). The duration of the study will be
      56 weeks. The interventional phase will last 32 weeks, followed by a 24-week observational
      phase to assess the sustainability of the intervention. Participants will be randomized 1:1
      to receive semaglutide by subcutaneous injection once weekly for 32 weeks (8-week dose
      escalation phase followed by full-dose for 24 weeks) or matching placebo. The primary
      objective of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of semaglutide in treating
      lipohypertrophy among non-diabetic people living with HIV by reducing fat accumulation and
      ectopic fat deposition, altering adipokine levels, improving endothelial function and
      arterial stiffness, down-regulating key pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune activation
      without modifying microbial translocation and gut integrity markers.
