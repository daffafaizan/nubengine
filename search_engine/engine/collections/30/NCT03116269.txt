    
      This investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind trial is prospectively conducted with
      two-arm parallel treatment groups and a single dose scheme: 100 mg aspirin daily and
      cilostazol placebo twice daily versus aspirin placebo daily and 100 mg cilostazol twice
      daily.

      A total of 80 eligible patients is planned to be recruited.

      All included patients undergo diagnostic studies including routine blood tests and
      cardiologic work-ups. The primary outcome is differences in endothelial function in the two
      groups measured by means of FMD on admission and at 3 months. According to previous studies,
      the adverse effects in two groups are investigated.
