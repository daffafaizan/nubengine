      Very-Low-Nicotine-Content cigarettes (VLNCCs) among non-daily, or intermittent smokers (ITS).
      This is a two-arm randomized study with an own-cigarette baseline control. After a 2-week
      baseline period smoking their own cigarettes, 455 ITS will be randomized (double-blind) for
      10 weeks to smoke experimental cigarettes, either: (a) normal nicotine content cigarettes
      (NNCCs; 0.8 mg) or (b) VLNCCs (0.07 mg), each matched to menthol status of subjects'
      preferred brand. ITS are more likely to be African-American (AA) smokers; thus AA smokers
      will be oversampled (to one third of the total sample). Change in cigarette consumption is
      the primary end-point, and biomarkers of smoke exposure and measures of smoking intensity are
      also assessed.
