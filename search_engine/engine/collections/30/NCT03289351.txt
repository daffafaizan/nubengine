      extraluminal fecal contents or visible holes on the appendix. Patients will be randomized to
      121 in each arm. Postoperative antibiotic therapy option will be decided based on blinded
      sequence model. 30 day postoperative follow up visit or calls will be made to assess and
      collect infectious complications.
