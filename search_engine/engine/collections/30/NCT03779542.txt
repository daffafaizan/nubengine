      surgery. Based on anterior chamber depth (ACD) and gonioscopy findings, the eyes are
      classified into two groups, shallow anterior chamber group (30 eyes) and narrow anterior
      chamber group (30 eyes). AS-SS-OCT was used to measure ACD and angle parameters (angle
      opening distance(AOD), angle recess area(ARA), trabecular iris space area（TISA）, and
      trabecular iris angle (TIA). Serial changes in each group were measured before and 3 months
      after phacoemulsification and IOL, and the differences between the two groups were compared.
