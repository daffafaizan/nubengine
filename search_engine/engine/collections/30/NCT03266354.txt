      hyperopia, and astigmatism. It is used to correct high degrees of myopia in patients for whom
      laser excimer refractive surgery is not indicated.

      The Artisan lens is designed to minimize the contact between the iris and the IOL resulting
      in less halo and glare from the prism effect.

      Several clinical studies show that the visual results of the Artisan lens are stable and
      predictable. Artisan phakic IOLs provides precise predictability.

      There have been concerns that the anterior chamber lens could damage the endothelial cell
      layer because of its proximity to the cornea. The manufacturer advises using the Artisan lens
      only in eyes with an ECD greater than 2000 cells/mm2 and an ACD greater than 2.6 mm.

      Corneal endothelium is metabolically active and responsible for keeping the corneal stroma in
      its usual dehydrated state of 70% water.

      loss of endothelial cells from increasing age, trauma, disease, or corneal surgery can reduce
      the density of endothelial cells and affect the ability of the endothelium to maintain it's
      primary function.

      Alterations in the corneal endothelium depend on surgical technique and style; although
      endothelial cell loss is mainly the result of surgical trauma, continuous endothelial cell
      loss can occur. Late corneal decompensation often occurs in the absence of direct
      intraoperative endothelial trauma. These complications can be explained by the toxic effect
      of inflammatory mediators on the corneal endothelium.

      Specular microscopy is used to view and record non-invasively the image of the corneal
      endothelial cell layer.
