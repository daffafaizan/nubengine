      impairment, and medication side effects compared to their younger counterparts.
      Unfortunately, little research is available to guide the treatment of subsyndromal depressive
      symptoms in older adults. This study will compare the antidepressant citalopram to placebo to
      determine the most effective treatment for reducing depressive symptoms in older patients
      with schizophrenia

      After patients have been on stable treatment with antipsychotic medication for at least 4
      weeks, they are randomly assigned to receive antipsychotic medication plus either citalopram
      or placebo for 3 months. Depressive symptoms and side effects are assessed weekly for the
      first month, biweekly for the second month, and again at the end of the third month.
      Cognition, motor and daily functioning, quality of life, and medication adherence are
      assessed throughout the study.
