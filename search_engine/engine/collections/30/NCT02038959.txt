      video calls to bring expert Parkinson disease care directly into patients' homes. Currently,
      access to care for Parkinson disease is limited by distance, disability, and the distribution
      of doctors. Approximately 200 individuals with Parkinson disease (who due to distance,
      disability, disparity, or doctor distribution have limited access to care) will be randomized
      to one of two arms in this comparative effectiveness study. The first (control) arm will be
      the individual's "usual care" supplemented by educational materials on their condition. This
      usual care may include care from a generalist, care from a neurologist, or in-person care
      from a Parkinson specialist. The care received by the control group will vary but will be an
      accurate reflection of usual care in this country. The second (intervention) arm will be
      usual care supplemented by educational materials and care from a Parkinson disease specialist
      delivered via web-based video conferencing into the patient's home. The participants will
      also be asked with they have a primary care partner, and care partners will be invited to
      enroll, for a total of approximately 400 participants.
