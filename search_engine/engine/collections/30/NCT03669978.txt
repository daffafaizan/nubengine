      be operated by the surgeon by creating a complete bone and arterial panorama of the
      femoro-popliteal axis with 2D-2D registration techniques. This study should have a clinical
      impact for the patient and caregiver. With this technique, we expect a reduction in the
      irradiation of the patient and the caregivers, a decrease in the volume of injected contrast
      product and a decrease in operating time.
