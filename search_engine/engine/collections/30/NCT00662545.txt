    
      Design: This is a randomized, controlled pilot study of open-label entecavir for the
      treatment of persistent HBV viremia in HIV-HBV coinfected individuals who have failed to
      suppress HBV replication after 48 weeks on tenofovir containing therapy.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the mean log reduction of HBV DNA with entecavir(ETV)
      intensification in comparison to continued standard therapy with tenofovir and
      lamivudine/emtricitabine at 24 weeks of therapy

      Study Population: HIV-HBV co-infected individuals with detectable HBV DNA after 48 weeks of
      therapy with tenofovir and lamivudine/emtricitabine whose HIV viremia is well controlled ( <
      75 copies at time of enrollment)

      Treatment: Subjects will be randomized to continue with standard therapy or to receive
      intensification with 1 mg daily of open label entecavir for the 24 week duration of the
      study.

      Sample Size: 24 subjects will be enrolled.

      Duration 24 weeks of treatment

      Primary Endpoint: Mean log10 reduction of HBV DNA at 24 weeks of standard therapy vs.
      entecavir intensification.
