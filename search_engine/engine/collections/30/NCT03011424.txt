    
      Primary issues to be addressed

        1. Can ELS be applied in an early phase of PLF?

        2. Is ELS safe and feasible for the treatment of PLF when practised according to a
           predefined protocol?

      Secondary issues to be addressed

        1. The development of predictive laboratory-chemical markers of liver failure

        2. Indirect measures of portal flow and portal pressure

        3. Indocyanine green clearance (ICG) under ELS treatment

        4. Clearance of toxic products as assessed in aliquots taken from the dialysate

      Design

        -  Prospective phase 1 safety and feasibility study

      Study Population

        -  10 consecutive patients being subjected to extended liver surgery (at least right sided
           or extended right/left sided hemihepatectomy)
