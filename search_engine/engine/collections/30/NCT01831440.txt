      less than 7. However, in clinical practice, the psychosocial functions of patients who reach
      remission are far from complete recovery. The recovery of psychosocial functions lags behind
      the disappearance of symptoms.so,we aim to determine the level of residual symptoms and
      psychosocial factors affecting recovery of psychosocial functions in MDD patients who reach
      remission, and investigate the recovery process of psychosocial functions.

      Method:200 MDD patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into CBT group
      and control group.All of subjects would complete the psychological assessment at
      0,1st,2nd,6th and 12th months for CBT group and 0,2nd,12th months for control group.ALL
      participants would undergo magnetic resonance imaging at 0,2nd,12th months.The scanning
      sequence is 3D,resting-state,task-state and diffusion tensor imaging（DTI）.During the magnetic
      resonance imaging（MRI） scans, subjects performed the facial and gender recognition tasks with
      three different facial stimuli(positive/neutral/negative).
