      central venous, and peripheral venous lactate measurements. When an arterial lactate is
      deemed to be necessary as part of ICU management, a central venous and peripheral venous
      sample will also obtained within 5 minutes. All of the samples will be analyzed using the
      same analyzer as quickly as possible. A maximum of 10 paired arterial and venous lactate
      samples will be obtained per patient to prevent a single patient from dominating the data
      set. Additional data collected on a standardized data collection form will include primary
      diagnosis, intubation status, use of inotropic agents, hypotension (defined as a systolic
      blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), ICU length of stay and mortality. The Bland-Altman method will be
      used to assess agreement between arterial (A), central venous(CV), and peripheral venous (PV)
      lactate measurements. Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in this study.
