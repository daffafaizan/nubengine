      to be a large gap in our understanding of disease pathogenesis and mechanisms accounting for
      large variability in disease phenotype. Untargeted metabolomics is an ideal approach to
      uncover the metabolic basis of disease, as well as discover unique drug target opportunities
      aimed at these nodal metabolic drivers of disease. There are very limited data from
      metabolomics studies from plasma/serum and exhaled breath condensate that suggest certain
      metabolic pathways or metabolites might predict the presence and/or severity of COPD
      phenotypes.

      The investigators hypothesize that: 1) smokers with COPD will have a metabolomics signature
      that is distinct from healthy non-COPD smokers; 2) this signature will be associated with
      clinically relevant manifestations of disease (e.g., GOLD classification, PFT).

      The availability of biosamples from a well-characterized population of smokers with and
      without COPD, combined with our established in-house metabolomics expertise, will robustly
      allow to test these novel hypotheses. The investigators hope to generate comprehensive,
      compartment specific (blood and lung) metabolite profiles that will be correlated with
      various clinical phenotypes of COPD, using a complementary approach of untargeted nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography (LC)- mass spectroscopy (MS) -based
      metabolomics. Moreover, this strategy may identify previously unrecognized metabolic pathways
      that are dysregulated in COPD. Collectively, these data will be used to direct a prospective
      clinical study to determine the association between metabolomics signatures and clinical
      outcomes.
