      open-label design.

      Subjects will donate one unit of fresh whole blood. This unit will be treated with the
      Mirasol PRT System for whole blood and then stored for 24 hours ± 1 hour at 22 ± 2°C. At the
      end of storage, platelet concentrates will be separated from the unit according to the
      Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) procedures. An aliquot will be removed
      from the platelet concentrates for testing and for radiolabeling and reinfusion. The
      platelets in Mirasol-treated whole blood will be tested for key in vitro parameters directly
      after treatment (Day 0) and at the end of storage (Day 1). Sterility testing will also be
      conducted on the stored units.

      An aliquot of the platelet concentrate separated from each unit of stored Mirasol-treated
      whole blood will be radiolabeled with either 111Indium Oxine or 51Chromium, and autologously
      infused. An intra-subject control will be utilized as per the BEST guidelines for platelet
      radiolabeling procedures. On the day of infusion, the subject will donate a fresh sample of
      whole blood. Platelets will be separated from this fresh sample and labeled with the
      radio-isotope that was not used to label the subject's Mirasol-treated platelet sample. The
      two radiolabeled platelet aliquots (Mirasol-treated and fresh control) will be infused
      simultaneously, and the recovery and survival of the two types of platelets will be measured
      according to standard institutional practice.
