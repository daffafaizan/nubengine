      including BSSL or infant formula without BSSL for the first 7 days. After a wash-out period
      of 2 days the patients will "crossover" to the other treatment regimen and receive an
      additional 7 days treatment. The primary efficacy measurements will be made by collecting
      stool during the last three days of each treatment period.
