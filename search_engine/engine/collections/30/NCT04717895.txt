        -  Complete clinical examination, carried out as part of your consultation in a day
           hospital.

        -  Perform a virtual reality session of about 2 hours. This session will take place as
           follows:

             -  Wear a virtual reality headset. The helmet is compatible with the wearing of
                glasses.

             -  View a virtual scene for two minutes in order to familiarize yourself with the
                device. This first viewing will be followed by a 10 minute break.

             -  Then the patient will be placed on a rectangular platform (Wii Balance Board - WBB)

             -  Give the virtual reality headset again to the patient, who will view a 2-minute
                series of a series of 2 minutes in a standing position comprising a moving virtual
                environment (one tilting forward and another in forward translation).

             -  After a 10 minute break, the session will continue with 4 other sets of 5 minutes
                duration (5 times 1 minute of a forward tilt or forward translation scene). These 4
                series will be separated by 10 min break

             -  During each break, the patient participating in the study will complete a
                questionnaire on the possible side effects of virtual reality (cybermalaise).
