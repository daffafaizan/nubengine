      strategy based on the use of treated nets and intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) based
      on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was adopted in 2005. Five years after its implementation,
      the investigators will check whether this strategy is still effective in the preventing
      maternal and congenital malaria on the one hand and maternal anemia, low birth weight and
      prematurity on the other hand.
