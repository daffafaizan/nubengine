      (non-dependent) emerging adult population. We will enroll individuals between the ages of 18
      and 25 years as this period overlaps with the general population of those attending college
      and who can be defined as emerging adults. We will conduct a double-blind control study in
      which 150 individuals will be randomized into 2 groups, therefore the N will be 300.
