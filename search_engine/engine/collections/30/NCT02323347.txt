      pregnancy outcome after fresh ET. No consensus on the cut-off value to define increased P-hCG
      seems to exist. It is accepted that high P advances endometrium, leading to asynchrony
      between the implanting embryo and the endometrium, and resulting in implantation failure. A
      freeze all embryos policy and postponement of ET in subsequent frozen-thawed cycle has been
      proposed.
