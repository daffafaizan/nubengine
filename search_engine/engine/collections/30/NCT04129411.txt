      such patients to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy.

      Following RFA procedure patients will be monitored to study the changes in primary tumor
      volume, development of lymph node involvement, development of distant metastasis and changes
      in serum thyroid hormone levels.

      Investigators will also assess the stability of these changes (need for repeat therapy) and
      the safety of the RFA procedure.
