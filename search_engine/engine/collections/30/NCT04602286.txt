      of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on Australians with or at risk of chronic pain. There
      is a critical need for the development and evaluation of fast-acting non-pharmaceutical
      treatments that have the capacity to target the multidimensional nature of chronic pain. This
      study will investigate how mindfulness meditation and common expectancy effects interact and
      will further characterise the mechanisms underlying these effects. Results will ultimately
      lead to targeted interventions that more effectively engage cognitive mechanisms associated
      with pain attenuation.
