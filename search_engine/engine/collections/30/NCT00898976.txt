        -  Evaluate a selected panel of molecular markers in tissue specimens from Native American
           women with breast cancer.

        -  Determine which molecular markers provide independent prognostic information with
           respect to traditional prognostic factors in these patients.

        -  Compare and contrast the prevalence of positivity in Native American women with breast
           cancer with an age- and stage-matched cohort of Caucasian women with breast cancer
           enrolled on clinical trial NCCTG-77-30-51 or the Mayo Breast Cancer Registry.

      OUTLINE: Immunohistochemistry is performed on tumor samples to analyze the following
      molecular markers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, c-erbB2, p53, Ki-67, Bcl-2, Bax,
      cyclin D-1, and insulin-like growth factor-1R.
