      and transmission of HIV. An HSV-2 vaccine is not available. We will study a
      replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine, HSV529, that is deleted for 2 essential viral proteins,
      that can infect, but not replicate in normal cells. The goals of the study are to determine
      (a) the safety of HSV529 vaccine in persons with or without HSV infection, and (b) the
      ability of the vaccine to elicit immune responses to HSV-2 including virus-specific
      antibodies and T cell responses to the virus. Three groups of 20 subjects each will be
      randomized and will receive 3 doses of HSV529 (15 subjects per group) or saline placebo
      injection (5 subjects per group). Each subject will be followed for 6 months after the last
      dose of vaccine. The 3 groups will be (a) subjects who were infected with HSV-2 in the past
      but may or may not have been infected with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/-/HSV-2+), (b) subjects who have
      been infected only with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/HSV-2-), and (c) subjects who have not been infected
      with HSV-1 or HSV-2 (HSV-1-/HSV-2-). Vaccine or placebo will be administered on Day 0 and
      approximately 1 month and 6 months after enrollment.
