      after kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of reduced dose or
      standard dose cyclosporine (CsA) in combination with sirolimus and corticosteroids. The
      incidence of acute graft rejection at 6 and 12 months following transplantation and patient
      and graft survival at 12 months after transplantation were evaluated also.
