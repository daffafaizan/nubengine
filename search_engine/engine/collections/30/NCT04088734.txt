      vg/kg of ABO-102 delivered one time through a venous catheter inserted into a peripheral limb
      vein. The target population includes MPS IIIA participants with a DQ lower than 60 in middle
      and advanced phases of the disease. Similar numbers of MPS IIIA participants with age
      equivalent above and below 18 months of age will be enrolled to ensure a representation of
      middle and advanced phases of the disease.
