      criteria will be invited to participate and, after signing the informed consent form, will be
      evaluated for anthropometric and clinical characteristics. At this moment, patients will be
      randomized into two groups: intervention and control. The intervention group will receive
      verbal guidance and a booklet developed by the authors on the deleterious effects of
      hospitalization and the importance of staying active during hospital admission on the day
      they are included in the study. The control group will not receive any type of intervention,
      nor even verbal guidance. Patients from both groups will have an accelerometer placed on the
      wrist in the dominant limb, which should only be removed at hospital discharge. Besides the
      level of physical activity, patients will be evaluated for functionality, peripheral muscle
      strength, length of hospital stay, and incidence of complications during the hospitalization
      period. The researchers will contact the patients via telephone within 72 hours after
      hospital discharge in order to apply a questionnaire for identification of the main barriers
      to stay active during hospitalization.
