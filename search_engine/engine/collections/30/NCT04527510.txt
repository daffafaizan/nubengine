      most women with dense breast and younger age at onset of breast cancer, ultrasound is more
      sensitive and widely available in breast cancer screening of China. We designed experiments
      to determine whether ABUS with remote reading mode is an effective breast cancer screening
      method and whether there is a difference in the efficiency of screening with or without
      artificial intelligence (AI) in Chinese women undergoing ABUS screening.
