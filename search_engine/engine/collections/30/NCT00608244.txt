    
      A three sequence, open-label, multi-center, prospective, study in stable liver transplant
      patients to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, C24, and AUC), and safety of
      LCP-Tacro (tacrolimus) tablets versus Prograf (tacrolimus) capsules.

      Stable liver transplant patients who fulfill all I/E criteria will be enrolled and kept on
      Prograf for 7 days. Following a 24-hour PK study on Day 7 to determine pharmacokinetics for
      Prograf, all patients will be converted to once daily LCP-Tacro for 14 days with one fixed
      dose change allowed at Day 15.

      On Day 14 and Day 21 a 24-hour LCP-Tacro PK study will be performed. On Day 22 patients will
      be converted back to their original twice daily dose of Prograf for a safety follow-up period
      of 30 days ending with a safety assessment on day 53.
