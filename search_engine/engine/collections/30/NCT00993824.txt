      individuals with type 2 diabetes on glycemic control by utilizing a novel technology,
      continuous glucose monitoring with ambulatory glucose profile analysis. To date there are no
      studies of this compound that have employed continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with
      ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) analysis to obtain data that will detail the diurnal glucose
      patterns associated with this therapy. We plan to employ CGM at critical points throughout
      the study. AGP analysis will enable rapid assessment of the clinical status of the subject.
      Using statistically stable estimates of hourly values represented by five percentile curves
      AGP depicts glucose exposure, variability and stability. Previously, we have used AGP
      analysis to characterize glucose perturbations in individuals ranging from normal glucose
      tolerance to overt type 2 diabetes.
