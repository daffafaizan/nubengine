      trial was a singlecentre, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the eﬃcacy of the
      addition of telemedicine (telemonitorization and teleintervention using videoconference) to
      an existing specialized, multidisciplinary, nurse-based, hospitalprimary care integrated HF
      programme for high-risk patients with CHF. The organizational characteristics of the
      programme and the impact in health outcomes resulting from its implementation have been
      previously published.2 In this study we aimed to compare the strategy of providing
      nurse-based structured follow-up to high-risk CHF patients through planned contacts between
      health care providers and patients and/or caregivers in the basis of face-to-face on-site
      encounters (usual care in our HF programme) or provide the planned care using telemedicine
      with the combination of remote daily monitoring of signs and symptoms of HF (telemonitoring)
      and delivery of structured nursebased follow-up health care using videoconference
      (teleintervention). The main hypothesis of this study was that adding telemedicine to an
      existing HF programme would be associated with a reduction in the number of non-fatal HF
      events in high-risk patients with CHF. As a secondary hypothesis we assumed that adding
      telemedicine would translate into a reduction in health care resource utilization and
      subsequently in health care costs.
