      enrolled sequentially at escalating doses of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg weekly. Dosing schedule
      for cohorts 2 and above may change after interim PK analysis after Cohort 1 Cycle 1 to
      bi-weekly or other regimen based on elimination profile of KN035 to avoid excessive drug
      accumulation. Dose escalation will continue until identification of MTD, up to a maximum dose
      of 10 mg/kg. MTD is defined as the highest dose studied at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects
      has experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1.
