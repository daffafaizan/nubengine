      The primary objective of this study is to determine if perioperative IV lidocaine therapy
      (P-IVLT) reduces 48-hour post-operative morphine utilization compared with a control, in
      adolescents undergoing PSIF. Secondary objectives of this study are to determine the effect
      of P-IVLT on self-reported pain scores, time to documented first stand, time to first walk of
      greater than 15 steps, and length of hospital stay (LOS).

      Research Methods:

      This will be a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized control trial (RCT) comparing
      48-hour postoperative morphine utilization among adolescents undergoing PSIF who have been
      randomly assigned to one of two groups:

      Intervention group (A) will receive P-IVLT in addition to the standard multimodal analgesia.
      P-IVLT will consist of 1 mg/kg bolus at start of anesthesia (T0), followed by 2 mg路kg-1路hr-1
      infusion for 8 hours (T1), then continued at 1 mg路kg-1路hr-1 infusion thereafter and
      postoperatively until T0 + 48 hours (T2).

      Control group (B) will receive a placebo (0.9% sodium chloride also known as normal saline),
      made to mimic the intervention protocol above, in addition to the standard multimodal
      analgesia.
