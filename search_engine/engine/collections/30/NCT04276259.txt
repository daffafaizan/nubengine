      signals (expected values and RPEs) to antidepressant responses (Aim1) by experimentally
      manipulating expected values using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting the
      vmPFC (Aim 2) and μ-opioid striatal RPE signal using pharmacological approaches (Aim 3). In a
      3x3 factorial double-blind trial, the investigators will randomize 120 unmedicated major
      depressive disorder (MDD) adults (18-55 years) to one of three between-subject opioid
      conditions: the μ-opioid agonist buprenorphine (n=40), the μ-opioid antagonist naltrexone
      (n=40), or the inert pill (n=40). Within each arm, individuals will be assigned to receive
      three within-subject counterbalanced sessions of TMS targeting the vmPFC-intermittent TBS
      (iTBS) expected to potentiate the vmPFC, continuous TBS (cTBS) expected to de-potentiate the
      vmPFC, and sham TBS (sTBS). These experimental manipulations will be used to modulate
      trial-by-trial reward learning signals and related brain activity during the Antidepressant
      fMRI Task. Understanding the mechanisms underlying antidepressant responses is essential to
      identify novel therapeutic targets for depression.
