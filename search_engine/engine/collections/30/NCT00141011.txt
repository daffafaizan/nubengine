      subjects had been entered into the two parallel trials, NCT00141001 and NCT00300196. The
      analyses were reviewed by the data safety monitoring board, which recommended that both
      studies be terminated because of futility. This was done at a point where 650 subjects had
      been entered into both studies, combined, but analyses were conducted only on the initial 500
      subjects. Results of the abbreviated analysis will be found with study NCT00141001 since that
      study contributed most of the subjects to the analysis.
