      based on a Simon Two-Stage design with incorporation of early stopping rules for safety and
      futility (See section 9 for statistical considerations). The Investigators will enroll up to
      35 patients on the study to obtain 28 evaluable patients for the primary endpoint. Safety of
      the combination will be evaluated after the first six patients complete the DLT observation
      period of 9 weeks. This lengthy DLT period is designed to capture safety and toxicity
      profile, understanding that immune-related toxicities from checkpoint inhibitors may not
      emerge immediately. This will also ensure adequate evaluation of potential cardiac and
      hepatic toxicity from combination doxorubicin and checkpoint inhibitor therapy. If two or
      more patients experience DLT in the initial safety lead-in cohort, the regimen will be
      declared intolerable. Any patients who do not complete study therapy through the 9-week DLT
      observation period for any reasons other than toxicity will be replaced for safety lead-in
      assessment. If fewer than two patients experience DLT, the investigators will proceed to
      expansion to complete enrollment of 15 patients in Stage 1. Following enrollment of stage
      one, accrual will pause for analysis of efficacy. If 6 or fewer of the 15 patients are
      progression-free at 6 months, the investigators will halt the study for futility. If 7 or
      more patients are free from progression, then the investigators will proceed with enrollment
      of 13 additional patients to complete stage 2. the investigators are powered to detect
      improvement in 6-month PFS rate to 63.4% with the combination over the 43.4% historical
      PFS6mo.
