      evaluating the effects of acute leptin administration on intracellular leptin signaling
      pathways after a 6 hour infusion period comparing an oral high fat meal, high fat lipid
      infusion, low fat lipid infusion, or placebo infusion (saline)iv lipid infusion, placebo
      (saline) and oral high fat meal. After a screening visit, study participation involves 1 meal
      pick-up visit, 1 overnight visit, and one 1 follow-up visit. Subjects will be randomized to
      one of 4 groups: an oral high fat meal, fat emulsion 20% infusion , fat emulsion 10%
      infusion, and a placebo (saline) infusion infusion and an oral high fat meal.

      We plan to screen 100 male and postmenopausal female subjects, with BMI greater than 18
      kg/m2, to consent 60 in order to have 32-48 evaluable subjects, 8-12 subjects per group,
      completing all parts of the study.

      The primary study outcome to be evaluated will be the changes in serum concentrations of
      glucose, hormones influencing metabolism such as insulin, fat-cell-secreted proteins such as
      leptin, molecules involved in metabolism such as free fatty acids (FFAs), and markers of
      inflammation such as interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma.

      The secondary outcome will be to examine the impacts of increased FFAs on intracellular
      leptin signaling by phosphorylation of STAT3.
