    
      Pelvic ultrasound is frequently performed in the ED in non-pregnant women to assess for
      ovarian pathology. During the pelvic examination a transvaginal ultrasound probe is used to
      visualize ovarian size, determine echotexture, assess whether ovarian tenderness is present,
      and sometimes measure ovarian blood flow. Though pelvic ultrasound is used in the Hennepin
      County Medical Center ED routinely, there is a paucity of literature assessing it's utility.

      This observational study will help determine the usefulness of this imaging modality, and how
      often it changes management in clinical practice.

      Specifically, this study will attempt to determine how often transvaginal ultrasound
      identifies the structures of interest, and then will correlate these findings with the final
      ED diagnosis. If a formal ultrasound is obtained, the findings of the ED ultrasound will also
      be compared to the findings of the formal ultrasound.

      The treating physicians will be queried the diagnosis and management plans before and after
      the pelvic US to ascertain changes in management.
