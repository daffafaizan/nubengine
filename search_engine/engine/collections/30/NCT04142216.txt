      decreased saliva flow rate due to various mechanisms is the main factor in its development.
      The significant decrease in saliva flow due to the atrophy and fibrosis of the salivary
      glands in HD patients is further affected by the restriction in fluid intake. The use of
      drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, aspirin,
      benzodiazepines, opioids and proton pump inhibitors also leads to hyposalivation and
      xerostomia. Thirst is common in chronic HD patients due to both volumetric and osmometric
      causes but the primary mechanism is osmometric. The osmolarity of the extracellular fluid
      increases with the dietary salt and the hypothalamus is stimulated by the shrinkage of the
      osmoreceptor cells, leading to the desire to ingest liquids. Volumetric thirst develops
      secondary to water and salt loss and the resultant stimulation of cardiac baroreceptors, with
      the cardiac return volume decreasing gradually towards the end of the HD session. Increased
      interdialytic weight in HD patients causes increased risk of death due to cerebrovascular
      events and cardiovascular diseases and leads to an increase in morbidity and mortality
      together with a deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Interdialytic weight gain
      (IWG) causes incompliance with fluid control as a result of the secondary excessive
      consumption of liquid and food and is an important condition.
