      percentage of chronic illness in middle- and old-aged population in communities and the
      impact on their physical and mental function. The Second year, we will use proper exercise
      prescriptions with exercise equipment available for chronic illness population and examine
      the improvement of their physical and mental functions after exercise intervention. The third
      year, we will adopt the concept of social marketing to promote knowledge about health-related
      fitness and exercise to communities and help to establish exercise center. To chronic illness
      people, the study seeks to delay the progression of disease and disability by encouraging
      them to participate in prescribed exercises. To relatively healthy people, exercise can
      achieve the purposes of healthy aging, decreased chronic illness, and improved ADLs function
      and life quality.
