      attending physician will assess the ventilation parameters according to study protocol and
      will note them in the case report form as he starts the data recording with MemoryBox (MB)in
      the mixed mode. Afterwards, the clinician will start the first phase by either keeping the
      patient in ASV 1.1 without any closed-loop controllers activated or switching to ASV 1.1 with
      only FiO2 controller activated according to the randomization. After 2.5 hours of recording
      in the first phase, the clinician will switch the patient to the second phase regarding
      randomization order. If the patient was ventilated without FiO2 controller activated in the
      first phase, the controller will be activated in the second phase. The patient will stay in
      the second phase for 2.5 hours as well. The first 0.5 hours of the first phase will be
      considered as run-in phase and the first 0.5 hours of the second phase will be considered as
      wash-out phase. Therefore the first 0.5 hours of each phase will be excluded from data
      analysis due to cross-over study design.
