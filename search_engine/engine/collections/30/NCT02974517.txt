        1. Time-lapse-Auto: All embryos are cultured in EmbryoScope®; embryo scores are evaluated
           on day 3 by KID Score system.

        2. Time-lapse-Manual: All embryos are cultured in EmbryoScope®; embryo scores are evaluated
           on day 3 by embryologist.

        3. Conventional Group: All embryos are cultured in our daily used incubators; embryo scores
           are evaluated on day 3 by embryologist.

      The aim is to compare IVF/ICSI outcomes, such as pregnancy outcome, fertilization rate,
      cleavage rate, high quality embryo rate, blastocyst formation rate, among these three groups.
