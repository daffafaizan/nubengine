      vaccine) at a potency that will be used to define maximum release limits for the INV_MMR in
      comparison to the US standard of care (M-M-R II/ M-M-R VaxPro vaccine referred to as COM_MMR
      vaccine). In order to obtain more representative data on the comparator vaccine, the COM_MMR
      used in this study will consist of two lots designated COM_MMR_L1 and COM_MMR_L2. Throughout
      the study COM_MMR_L1 and COM_MMR_L2 will be analyzed as pooled lots. This study is intended
      to support licensure of GSK's MMR vaccine in the US.

      All children will receive Varivax and Havrix vaccines, concomitantly with MMR containing
      vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age. Prevnar 13 will be administered only to US children. At
      the end of the study, GSK will provide a second dose of Havrix and/or varicella vaccine to
      participants enrolled in selected non-US countries if local health departments do not
      routinely provide hepatitis A and varicella vaccination. The second dose of Havrix and
      varicella vaccine is not part of the study procedures.
