    
      This is an epidemiological (the study of health-related states or events in specific
      populations) study of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's who have been treated
      previously with anticholinesterase drugs (class of drugs that act in the central nervous
      system) up to a maximum of fifteen days. The data for each patient will be recorded on two
      occasions; first at a baseline visit and then at a follow-up visit at 3 months. At the
      baseline visit, after the patient or his/her legal representative has given written informed
      consent, each participating neurologist will use the study questionnaire to collect patient
      sociodemographic characteristics (characteristics such as age, years of education, race, sex,
      religion, birthplace, income, occupation, geographic location, among others), medical history
      and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The neurologist will also record treatment for
      Alzheimer's disease and concomitant hypnotic medications (simultaneous use of medications
      that induce sleep) and evaluate the patient using two scales: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index (PSQI) to record sleep disturbances and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to determine the
      level of daytime sleepiness. Alzheimer treatment and concomitant hypnotic medications will be
      recorded again at the follow-up visit. Patient sleep quality using the PSQI and daytime
      sleepiness using the Epworth scale will also be evaluated again at this visit.
