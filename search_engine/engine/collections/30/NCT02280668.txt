      eccentrically damaging exercise recover their strength quicker and/or have less muscle
      soreness than those that do not receive any icing treatment after damaging exercise and if
      any differences in effectiveness between two icing protocols exist. Baseline measures of peak
      torque of the dominant arm's elbow flexor muscles will be measured by concentric and
      isometric contractions prior to participants undergoing eccentric muscle damaging exercise.
      Participants will be randomly assigned into 3 different experimental groups of approximately
      15 participants each. The first group will begin "Icing Protocol 1" at time 0 (or as close
      to). The second group will begin "Icing Protocol 2" six hours after their initial eccentric
      muscle damaging exercise. The remaining group will not receive any icing treatment; they are
      the control group. Participants will be brought back into the lab at specific post-exercise
      times (0h, 24h, 48h, 96h, and 7 days) to complete peak torque measures as they did with
      baseline measures prior to eccentric muscle damage. Measures of delayed onset muscle soreness
      (DOMS) will also be taken at baseline and during scheduled follow up times for participants.
