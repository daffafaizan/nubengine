      arthritis. New generation re-surfacing prostheses are engineered to anatomically restore a
      smooth articulating surface to the humeral head, while preserving bone stock, and potentially
      minimizing the risk for diaphyseal fracture. The results for shoulder resurfacing prostheses
      have largely been reported in retrospective reviews and have been very favorable. The purpose
      of this multi-centered, prospective study will be to determine the extent to which patient
      self-assessed outcomes (American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) Score) following humeral
      resurfacing improve compared to pre-operative ASES scores.
