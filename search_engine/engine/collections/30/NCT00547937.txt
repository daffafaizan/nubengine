      cross-over clinical study, in which patients received CPAP and sham therapy for two 12-week
      periods. Baseline measurements in healthy controls matched for age and gender were also
      obtained. At recruitment, 24-h blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), an echocardiogram (to rule
      out any cardiac dysfunction) and a sleep study was obtained in all participants . After
      fasting overnight, a venous blood sample (anti-coagulated with dipotassium EDTA, for
      8-isoprostane and total nitrate and nitrite concentration (NOx) determinations) and a urine
      sample were collected in all of them between 08:00 and 10:00 hours. Within 30 minutes of
      blood collection, plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. All plasma
      samples were stored at -60Â°C until analysis. Patients with OSAS underwent a full-night CPAP
      titration study using an automated pressure setting device (Auto Set; ResMed, Sydney,
      Australia). Compliance with therapy was obtained from a built-in run-time counter. After 12
      weeks, CPAP device was switched to the alternate mode of therapy and ABPM,, plasma and urine
      sampling were repeated in patients
