      content is designed to reduce the subject's pain during treatment. The objectives of this
      split-face designed study are to evaluate the pain-relieving effect and safety of adding
      lidocaine hydrochloride to Restylane SubQ and to evaluate the esthetic improvement obtained
      with the dermal filler using the global esthetic improvement scale (GEIS).
