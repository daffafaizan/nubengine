    
      This trial will be carried out at the Grenoble Alpes University Hospital's simulation center.
      Volunteer professionals will run scenarios simulating the information transmission chain
      "pre-hospital team - trauma leader - trauma team" just prior to the admission of a critical
      patient to the trauma center. In each scenario, the trauma leader will be alerted by phone
      that a patient is being managed by a pre-hospital medical team and is about to be transferred
      to the trauma center. The trauma leader will have to synthesize and disseminate the available
      information to the trauma team (composed of a junior physician, a resident and a nurse).
      Depending on the allocation group, the transmission chain will be supported or not by a
      specific trauma dashboard. The scenario will be discontinued at the end of this handover and
      before the patient's arrival.
