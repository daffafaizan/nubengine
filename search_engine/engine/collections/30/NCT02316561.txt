      radiation treatment. After a vigilant follow-up with MRI, breast conserving surgery will be
      performed 6 months after the ablative radiation treatment. The total follow-up time is 10
      years.

      This study aims to present an ablative radiotherapy treatment approach that could resolve to
      some extent the disadvantages of current breast conserving treatment in elderly low-risk
      breast cancer patients who are currently not treated according to guidelines due to
      co-morbidity.
