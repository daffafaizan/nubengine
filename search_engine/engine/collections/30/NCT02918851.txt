      stored for up to 42 days prior to transfusion. However, RBCs progressively develop
      abnormalities during storage. The efficacy of older stored blood, i.e., effective oxygen
      delivery, has not been established in rigorous controlled studies. Due to pragmatic reasons,
      a large clinical trial that randomizes patients to "old" blood may not be feasible.

      Every subject will have 2 phlebotomy visits at Stony Brook University Hospital. Subjects
      randomized to the 7- and 42-day old groups will have 2 units of blood removed at Week 0 and
      another 2 units removed at Week 5. However, the remaining 28-day group will have 2 units of
      blood removed at Week 2 and only 1 unit of blood removed at Week 5. During week 6, each
      subjects will have 3 study visits: 1) On Monday, a VO2 max test; 2) On Wednesday, a
      transfusion with 2 units of autologous RBCs (each over 1 hour), followed by a VO2 max test 2
      hours later; 3) On Friday, a VO2 max test will be done in order to calculate a delta VO2 max
      (Friday minus Monday results).
