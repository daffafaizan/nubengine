      randomised. Up to 100 patients with painful Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee may be recruited
      into the study. Eligible subjects will wash out of all treatments for their OA pain for a
      minimum of 7 days apart from protocol rescue medication (paracetamol). Following this,
      subjects will participate in three short term treatment periods with repeated administration
      of Naproxen (500 mg/twice daily) or placebo for 3 days. Between treatment periods subjects
      will receive placebo. Endpoints will include objective assessments of function (time to walk
      and stair climbing) and subjective assessments of pain including current pain, the Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Patient Global Impression of
      Change. Throughout the study subjects will be asked to rate their pain periodically. Subjects
      will attend the unit on Day 1 to be dispensed with study medication and to take their first
      dose in the unit. They will then return to the unit on Days 8, 10, 15, 17, 22 and 24 for pain
      assessments, with medication dispensed at each of these visits, excluding Day 24.
