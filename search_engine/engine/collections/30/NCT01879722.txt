      well-tolerated dose and also to treat schizophrenia. This study will look at how well
      different doses of TAK-063 are tolerated in healthy people of Japanese descent and in people
      with stable schizophrenia.

      Five dose levels will be examined, starting at the lowest, in each population with 10
      participants in each dose level. These participants will be randomized to receive TAK-063 (8
      subjects) and placebo (2 subjects) once daily (QD) for 7 days.

      In total, approximately 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. This trial will be
      conducted in single site in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study
      is up to 42 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic, including 8-10 days
      confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 7 days after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.

      Dose escalation and the actual choice of the subsequent dose level will only occur following
      a review of the blinded data from the previous cohorts.
