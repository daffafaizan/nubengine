      children and their accompanying in various medical and hospital surgical settings. A previous
      study on a population of 60 children was conducted to assess the impact of the presence of
      clowns during the production of botulinum toxin injection in children but not confirming the
      benefit of their participation in carrying this medical procedure. The results of this study
      are opposed to current scientific data. Their impact clown assessment criteria seem however
      insufficient to actually support the conclusion as to the ineffectiveness of distractibility
      clowns in this specific medical procedure iterative injection of botulinum toxin.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the pain and anxiety before and after the botulinum
      toxin injection session in children and hetero-assessment of pain and anxiety by accompanying
      depending on the presence or not of clown. The second objectives are the evaluation of the
      course of the session by the injector doctor, the accompanying of the child and to evaluated
      the effect of distraction during the toxin of the clown or the usual distraction (music,
      movie...)
