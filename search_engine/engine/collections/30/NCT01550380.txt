      (NVP-BKM120), the use of this agent may provide benefit to patients with endometrial and
      ovarian cancer. Endometrial and ovarian cancer are leading causes of cancer death in women
      and there are limited treatment options for those with metastatic or refractory disease.
      Alterations of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway have been identified in many cancers, including
      endometrial and ovarian cancers. Tumors with PI3K mutations have demonstrated sensitivity to
      this compound therefore justifying use of this agent in subjects with endometrial or ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Therefore use of this agent in cancer patients
      with PI3 kinase pathway activation offers a reasonable treatment option.

      Patients will be initially treated with single agent BKM120 for 28 days at a dose of 100mg
      per day. CT response will be adjudged post BKM120 therapy at day 28. If there is no
      significant progression on CT scan, patients will be continued on BKM120 for another two
      cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]). Response assessments will then be done at that time
      (after the third 28 day cycle). If there is no significant progression on CT scan, then the
      patients will continue BKM120 with response assessments using standard CT criteria every two
      cycles (28 days per cycle [+/- 3 days]) thereafter.

      If disease progression is observed, patient will have completed the study. Patient will be
      seen within 30 days for end of treatment visit.
