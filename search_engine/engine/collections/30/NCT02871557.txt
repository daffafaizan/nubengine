      in the geriatric department of Martinique university Hospitals. The inclusion of subjects ran
      from January 1st 2012 to June 30th 2012. To be eligible, patients had to be 75 or over and
      hospitalised for acute condition. Each patient was visited by a specialist in geriatrics
      familiar with the survey procedures. In the course of this interview, patients were informed
      about the study, prior to signing the consent form. If the clinical status and/or the
      cognitive status of the patient did not enable informed consent, the interviewer referred to
      the subject's representative. Follow-up was performed by visits and telephone interview till
      36 months.
