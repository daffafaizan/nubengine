      for personalized medicine. It is a highly annotated genetic and biosample resource for
      multiple nested observational cohort studies. It is designed to begin to understand the
      mechanisms underlying complex diseases using clinical information from the UPMC electronic
      health record (EHR), from case-report forms, and from biological samples.

      Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that point-of-care electronic health record (EHR)-based
      phenotyping and clinical measures will be useful for classifying patient by disease risk,
      subtype, activity, complications, quality of life or using statistical or systems approaches.

      Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that common diseases can be subtyped using genotype data.

      Aim 3. To test the hypothesis biological samples will provide additional functional and
      mechanistic information about subject health, disease or state.

      The study will be conducted using UPMC patients and population controls. Consent will allow
      EHR and/or case report form data, plus biological samples to be given a unique code number
      and transferred to researchers for analysis. Consent will also allow for a secure link to be
      maintained allowing the research data or samples to be updated, and to contact the clinical
      team and/or subject to provide them with additional information.
