      assigned one of 3 arms to be treated with artesunate monotherapy for 7 days at a ratio of
      2:1:2.

      Arm 2 serves as a control and will serve as a bridge to the ARC 1 study performed in
      2006/2007. Patients in Arm 1 will receive a relatively low "standard" dose, and patients in
      Arm 2 will receive the intermediate dose of 4 mg/kg that was used in the ARC1 study. Patients
      in Arm 3 will receive an experimental "high-dose" regimen. Currently available safety data
      extends to subjects who have received the 28 mg/Kg total dose over 7 days and to another
      study administering 8 mg/Kg/day for 3 days (total dose 24 mg/Kg). Subjects randomized into
      this study's 'high-dose' Arm 3 will, therefore, receive a total dose that is higher than has
      been previously studied in humans.

      The study design will be based on the WHO recommendations for the 'Assessment and Monitoring
      of Antimalarial Drug Efficacy for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria' (WHO,
      2003).
