      corresponding to a single oral dose of 12.6 Î¼g/kg b.w. exposure to acrylamide, and an edible
      capsule, which contains 350 mg AOB-w or the placebo with the same dose. Urine were collected
      within 48 hours thereafter. The diet was rigorously controlled within 24 hours prior to study
