      arm with often limited, unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a promising supplement or even
      alternative for neurorehabilitative training. Investigators aim at developing a unique
      intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training strategy of the arm. The exoskeleton
      robot ARMin will be further developed to adapt software components accordingly. The goal is
      to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is
      meaningful for the individual patient. It can be intensified by different strategies that
      will be evaluated alone and in combination. These strategies include:

      strength training an error-amplification strategy increased number of repetitions
      multisensory feedback multiplayer approach
