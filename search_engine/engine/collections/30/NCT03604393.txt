      organizations to test interventions designed to increase HPV vaccinations in both male and
      female patients aged 9-26 years. Using a step-wedge randomized controlled trial, we will
      design and test the effectiveness of multi-component primary care practice-based
      interventions on the completion of the HPV vaccine series and will explore implementation
      timing in high and low functioning practices to determine how specific characteristics affect
      the delivery of the full series. Additionally, we will design and test the impact of a
      community organization-based intervention intended to educate the public about HPV and cancer
      risk and risk reduction via vaccination.
