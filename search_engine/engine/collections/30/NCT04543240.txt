    
      This is a study examining the use of Integra™ for the treatment of lower extremity wounds to
      better understand the relationship between bacteria contamination levels and post-operative
      complications. Wounds requiring operative application of Integra™ alone or Integra™ followed
      by a planned subsequent application of a STSG will be enrolled into this study.

      The tolerance of Integra™ to bacterial bioburden at the time of application will be
      determined by observing their respective postoperative wound complications and correlating
      these findings with quantitative bacterial counts, qualitative culture results, and bacterial
      and wound protease levels at the time of Integra™ alone application or Integra™ followed by
      STSG application.

      Patients will then be followed until complete healing has occurred or until 16 weeks,
      whichever comes first.
