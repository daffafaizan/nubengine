      intravitreal injection (same day and the next day) after a preparation utilizing three cotton
      swabs soaked in 4% lidocaine versus a preparation using 3.5% lidocaine hydrochloride
      ophthalmic gel. Based on the available data, the researchers contend that a preparation based
      on viscous 3.5% ophthalmic lidocaine gel, which coats the surface and remains in contact with
      the eye longer, may provide greater anesthesia and result in greater patient comfort than the
      topical 4% lidocaine, which is part of the standard preparation routinely utilized in the
      ophthalmology department currently. Secondary outcome measure is the intraocular pressure
      rise after the injection, and the authors will generate prospective data to study whether
      softening the eye with cotton swabs prior to the injection lowers post-injection pressure
      spike.
