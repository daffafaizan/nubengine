        -  Determine the best hormonal scheme to be associated with pelvic radiotherapy in the
           curative management of prostatic carcinoma for hormonal treatment with regards to
           treatment outcome (overall survival, clinical disease free survival, local regional
           control), quality of life (treatment side effects, sexual function), and health economy
           (cost effectiveness ratio).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive external radiation for 5 weeks, followed by a pelvic boost given for 2 weeks
      and a 6 month combined androgen blockage initiated at the onset of external irradiation.
      Flutamide (Eulexin) or bicalutamide (Casodex) may be used as the antiandrogens. Antiandrogen
      treatment starts 1 week before the first injection of triptorelin.

      Patients are then randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive no further treatment.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive antiandrogen for 2.5 years plus and LHRH analogue (triptorelin)
           administered every 3 months. Patients then continue the LHRH analogue alone for an
           additional 2.5 years in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 966 patients will be accrued over 5 years.
