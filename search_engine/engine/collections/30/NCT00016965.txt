        -  Determine the 6-month survival rate and time to treatment failure in patients with
           advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with BMS-247550.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the complete and partial response in those patients with measurable disease
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually until 3 years after
      registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
