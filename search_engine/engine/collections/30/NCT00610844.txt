      Among these techniques, image-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation attained widespread
      consideration in the therapy of liver tumors and osteoid osteoma. Promising results of
      hepatic RF ablation raised expectations to utilize the advantages of image-guided ablation
      therapy for the treatment of pulmonary malignancies. The purpose of the study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation by pathological correlation and to characterize
      the tissue response after treatment of primary and secondary pulmonary tumors. Computed
      tomography-guided RF ablation is performed in local or general anesthesia, followed by
      surgical resection three days later. An analysis of complete RF ablation and a
      characterization of tissue response is performed by hematoxylin and eosin staining,
      immunostaining, and electron microscopy. Adverse effects and complications are recorded.
