      social interaction, and secondarily on language tasks, anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and
      global function in high functioning adults and adolescents with autism in a double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will also examine whether response to treatment
      can be predicted based upon markers of autonomic functioning, such as skin conductance, heart
      rate variability (HRV), and the pupillary light reflex (PLR), and whether anxiety can predict
      treatment response. The hypothesis is that social functioning and language abilities will
      benefit from serial doses of propranolol, and that those with the greatest degree of
      autonomic dysregulation, or the lowest functional connectivity, will demonstrate the greatest
      benefit from the drug.
