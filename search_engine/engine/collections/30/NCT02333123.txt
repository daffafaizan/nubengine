      out of the leg and venous system. This has been shown to be effective in many clinical
      trials. However, despite this treatment patients take many months to heal (with median
      healing times of approximately 12 weeks in previous trials) and for some patients compression
      therapy does not result in resolution of their leg ulcers. The use of compression (as well as
      dressings largely to manage the wound exudate) can be expensive as nurse time is required to
      change bandages which can be required weekly or more frequently. Furthermore, for many
      patients the compression therapy is uncomfortable (sometimes painful) and inconvenient for
      everyday life (compression is bulky and dressings have to be changed several times weekly).
      If other treatments were able to reduce the time to healing then this would be a significant
      breakthrough.

      Results from two earlier small trials suggest aspirin may be of benefit. However this trials
      were poorly designed and reported. The present study will evaluate whether the addition of
      300mg of daily aspirin to standard evidence based therapies reduces the time to healing of
      chronic venous leg ulceration using a more rigorous design. The study will also establish the
      feasibility of satisfactory participant recruitment for a bigger trial, and whether
      participants are compliant with their aspirin therapy. The safety of aspirin in this patient
      population will also be monitored.
