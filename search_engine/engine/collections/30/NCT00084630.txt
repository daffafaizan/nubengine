      I. To assess the response rate (confirmed complete and confirmed partial response) in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) treated
      with imatinib.

      II. To estimate the one-year progression-free survival probability in this population when
      treated with imatinib.

      III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment.

      IV. To measure the presence of PDGFB gene rearrangement in DFSP detectable by RT-PCR (for
      COL1A1-PDGFB fusions) and/or FISH (PDGFB rearrangements with unknown partners) and explore
      relationships between these measures and survival and tumor response in a preliminary manner.

      V. To investigate in a preliminary fashion the correlation of plasma levels of imatinib after
      1 month of treatment with the response of DFSP.

      VI. To obtain tumor material for additional future correlative studies of the activity of
      intracellular kinases, cDNA microarray analyses and PDGFB receptor gene sequence analyses.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-56. Treatment repeats every 56
      days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with documented tumor progression and no serious side effects may continue therapy at a
      higher dose for another 6 courses.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.
