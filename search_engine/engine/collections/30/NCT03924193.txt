      of a subgroup with binge-eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder.
      This study examined the effectiveness of two leading but distinct treatments -
      lisdexamfetamine (LDX) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) - alone and in combination, for
      BED in patients with obesity. LDX is the first and only FDA-approved medication for the
      treatment of BED and has demonstrated short-term effectiveness relative to placebo. CBT is
      the best-established psychological treatment, has demonstrated short-term effectiveness and
      "treatment specificity" (i.e., superiority to a variety of control and active treatments),
      has shown longer-term superiority to fluoxetine, and longer-term durability of outcomes.
      N=180 participants with BED and obesity will be randomly assigned to one of three
      interventions, CBT alone, LDX alone, or CBT combined with LDX. This RCT will provide new
      findings regarding the relative effectiveness of LDX, CBT, and combined CBT+LDX for patients
      with obesity and BED. No such study has been performed.
