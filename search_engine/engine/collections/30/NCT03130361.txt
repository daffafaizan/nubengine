      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are locked in a vicious circle of inactivity and social isolation
      which profoundly affects their quality of life and prognosis. A new wearable non invasive
      positive pressure ventilation device has been recently proposed; it can be used by
      intermittence during or after physical activities for reducing dyspnea or for shortening
      dyspnea- recovery time. The investigators hypothesize that this system, in reducing the
      inconvenience caused by dyspnea, would stimulate a more active lifestyle and improve quality
      of life. Their objective is to assess the impact of this device on physical activity and
      quality of life in patients with severe COPD, complaining of dyspnea.

      In this open study with no control group, participants will use the device at their
      convenience, according to their needs in daily life and for 4 weeks.
