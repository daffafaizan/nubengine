      approximately 10% of the population of developed countries, with the majority of persons with
      migraine being females between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Patients with migraine desire
      rapid and complete relief from headache and decreased frequency of recurrence over the 24
      hours after treatment. Current treatments for migraine often provide incomplete pain relief
      and additional acute treatments are needed. Lornoxicam is a member of the NSAID class of
      anti-inflammatory drugs and is shown to be effective in the acute management of postoperative
      pain and arthritis. The current study will evaluate the efficacy of single doses of
      lornoxicam, administered intravenously, in treatment of the headache of migraine to determine
      possible future uses of this drug in this condition.
