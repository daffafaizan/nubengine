      and disabling, and leads to frequent use of medical services. Most depressed elders are
      treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) and prior research has shown that collaboration
      between primary care physicians and depression care managers is effective in treating
      depression. The challenge has been in securing third-party reimbursement for such services.

      This research study will address this barrier by developing a collaborative depression care
      management model (C-DCM) that encourages collaboration between PCPs and trained social
      workers employed by community-based, public and nonprofit mental health clinics. In addition
      to developing C-DCM, a total of 112 primary care outpatients will participate in this study
      to test whether C-DCM is more effective than the standard of care in decreasing the severity
      of depression and disability experienced by older adults. Each subject will be randomized
      into either Usual Care or C-DCM. All subjects will be assessed at Baseline and at 2 and 4
      months while the C-DCM subjects will also meet with social worker depression case managers
      bi-weekly over four months. If shown effective, C-DCM may bring to bear an available, yet
      untapped resource in the care of depressed elders.
