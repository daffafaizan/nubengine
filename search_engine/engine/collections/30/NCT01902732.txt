      lung volume reduction by valve implantation will be prospectively included in the study.
      Heterogeneity of emphysema and fissure completeness of the relevant lobe will be proven from
      high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) prior to enrolment in the study. Fissure integrity
      will be analyzed by a core radiology. If fissure completeness is proved, patients will be
      enrolled in the study. All recruited patients will additionally receive a collateral
      ventilation measurement by using the ChartisÂ® Pulmonary Assement System during a flexible
      bronchoscopy. Depending on the results of this measurement, patients are divided in two
      parallel arms: A: complete fissure integrity and low collateral ventilation (CV negative) B:
      complete fissure integrity and high collateral ventilation (CV positive) Following the CV
      measurement, each patient will receive valve therapy.
