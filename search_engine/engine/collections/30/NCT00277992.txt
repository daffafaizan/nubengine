      the Norwood procedure had improved growth compared to those in past years who underwent
      traditional Norwood. Also, the standard of care has changed to GT/Nissen operation to
      facilitate "safe" feeding in those patients who are not able to feed by mouth (po feed).

      A second aim of this study is to evaluate whether children who are GT fed have improved
      growth compared to those who are not.

      We wish to review all patients who underwent Norwood procedure from January 1, 2001 to March
      31, 2005.
