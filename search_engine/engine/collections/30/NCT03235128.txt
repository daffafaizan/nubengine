      childhood,primarily owing to a disturbed immune function.This disease is characterized by
      alterations in selectivity at the glomerular capillary wall that lead to an inability to
      restrict the urinary loss of protein.The syndrome is characterized by the tetrad of nephrotic
      range proteinuria (>40 mg/m2/hour), hypoalbuminemia (<2.5 g/dl), generalized edema, and
      hyperlipidemia. It can be congenital or acquired.Currently,serum albumin, lipids, and
      proteinuria are the common diagnostic markers of childhood NS, but these markers may not
      accurately predict the outcome of individual patients because of the heterogeneity of the
      disease. Renal biopsy is more precise for establishing prognosis of renal outcome, but it has
      potential complications. Repeated monitoring is technically difficult, particularly for
      children. Therefore, there is still an urgent need to identify new non invasive diagnostic
      and prognostic biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for this disease.miRNA-30a expression
      in the serum of patients with nephrotic syndrome and analyzed the correlation between miRNA
      with largest over expression level and clinical features compared with healthy
      subjects.miRNA-30a expression level in drug resistant nephrotic syndrome patients was
      obviously higher than the drug sensitive patients and up-regulated most significantly in
      mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis among different pathological types, while it
      decreased most obviously in glomerular lesions. miRNA-30a could be treated as the molecular
      marker in predict drug resistance, pathological type of nephrotic syndrome and follow up of
      resistant cases.
