    
      Phase A: Safety Run-in to test the safety of CART-BCMA + huCART19 as split-dose infusions
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine in patients who have
      relapsed/refractory myeloma after two prior regimens but who are responding to their current
      therapy. Phase A Expansion: To occur once safety is demonstrated in Phase A. - Phase B:
      Randomization Phase in which patients responding to first or second-line therapy will receive
      either CART-BCMA alone (Cohort

      1) or CART-BCMA + huCART19 (Cohort 2) as split-dose infusions after lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine. Phase C: Single-dose infusion phase to test
      the safety of single-dose infusion of CART-BCMA alone (Cohort 1) and CART-BCMA + huCART19
      (Cohort 2) as single-dose infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
      + fludarabine in patients responding to first- or second-line therapy.
