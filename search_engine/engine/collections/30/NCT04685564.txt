    
      It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation, phase Ia study.
      The study will enroll 40 healthy subjects, including 5 dose escalation cohorts for dose
      escalation with 0.3 mg/kg body weight as the starting dose.

      After a single-dose injection, there will be a 4-week safety assessment and monitoring phase
      (Days 1-29). Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected within 60 minutes before dosing,
      and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after dosing, respectively.
      According to the previous PK results, the subsequent PK blood collection points can be
      adjusted. Total urine samples will be collected once before dosing and in each of 2 time
      periods after dosing: 0~8 h and 8~24 h. The total urine output will be recorded, and some
      urine samples will be collected in each time period to analyze and detect the urine drug
      concentration.

      Subjects will undergo safety follow-up from Day 29 to Day 85.
