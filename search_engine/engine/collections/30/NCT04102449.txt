      scores PsASon22 and PsASon13 in differentiating between clinically active and inactive
      patients with psoriatic arthritis, following a treatment with Apremilast for up to 24 months.
      Additionally, convergent construct validity, inter/intra-reader reliability, sensitivity to
      change and differences in change in certain patients will be tested for the ultrasound
      scores.
