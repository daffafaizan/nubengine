      Furthermore, it affects the expression of various genes that are necessary for proliferation
      of cancer cells. Vorinostat also appears to block angiogenic signaling. Pre-treating four
      human cancer cell lines (including a brain tumor line) with vorinostat increased the killing
      efficiency of etoposide, ellipticine, doxorubicin, or cisplatin, but not of the topoisomerase
      I inhibitor camptothecin 13. Topoisomerase II is a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme that is involved
      in DNA replication, transcription, chromosome segregation, and apoptosis. It is the target
      for several anti-cancer drugs including etoposide. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors induces
      expression of topoisomerase II in cancer cells and enhances the sensitivity to etoposide 14.

      Early phase clinical trials have demonstrated single agent anti-cancer activity with
      vorinostat. In our study, combination of vorinostat with carboplatin and paclitaxel,
      demonstrated promising anticancer activity against NSCLC, including histological subsets of
      patients whose tumors demonstrated neuroendocrine differentiation 8. For all these reasons,
      vorinostat is a rational choice to combine with the regimen of carboplatin and etoposide for
      evaluation in patients with SCLC-ED.
