      replication-defective, recombinant adenovirus containing the human interferon beta gene, for
      people that have refractory colorectal carcinoma with liver metastases. Scientists have been
      exploring a variety of approaches to develop medications to treat patients with refractory
      colorectal carcinoma with liver metastases; a disease for which current treatment provides
      only limited relief, so there is a need for new medications.
