      laboratory work. It includes two sessions and a seven-day daily diary in between sessions. In
      this feasibility study, for the first time all study procedures will be delivered remotely
      rather than in a laboratory because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome is the
      number of intrusive memories related to the film (analogue trauma) recorded in a daily
      electronic diary during the following week (week 1).

      The first aim is to investigate if the film (analogue trauma) will generate intrusive
      memories. The second aim is, if intrusive memories are generated, to investigate if
      participants in the experimental condition will report fewer intrusive memories of the film
      (analogue trauma) than participants in the control condition.
