      Indonesia. As a national health referral system in TB program, the hospital was related to
      four local sub district health centers that were involved in the recruitment of participants
      in the study.

      Patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis were randomly assigned into two groups,
      namely intervention group, which consisted of 65 participants and control group which had 64
      participants. Randomization was carried out using sealed, unmarked opaque envelopes that are
      allocated to participants in this study. A minimum sample size of per group (n=64) was
      determined by Windows version G*Power 3.1.5 software to identify a mean difference in body
      weight change of â‰¥1.1 kg between intervention and control groups.

      The intervention group obtained the standard therapy of TB and an additional 166.5 grams of
      boiled tempeh daily for two months. The control group obtained only standard TB therapy.
      Patients in the intervention group were instructed to divide one cake tempeh into three
      pieces and eat them three times in a day. Consumption frequencies of supplements were
      recorded in a logbook by an enumerator during random visits once a week. One of the patient
      family members was asked to help to supervise compliance.

      The participants were assessed before and after the intervention period for both groups. Body
      weight of the participants was evaluated by measuring the change in body weight. The change
      of physical function was assessed by handgrip strength using a digital dynamometer and
      6-minute walk test (6MWT). Protein and caloric intakes were estimated twice, measured during
      the first and second months using 24-hour dietary recall method during the intervention
      period.
