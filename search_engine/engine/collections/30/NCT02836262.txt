      prosthesis. The HHRS consists of a femoral stem, an acetabular cup and a Cobalt Chromium
      Molybdenum (CoCrMo) ball that articulates within a polyethylene liner. The ball sits on the
      acetabular cup, and the polyethylene liner is attached to the femoral cup, which attaches to
      the femoral stem, instead of the acetabular cup. The acetabular component of the HHRS
      consists of a hemispherical acetabular shell with a clustered screw-hole design. The outside
      of the shells are coated with titanium plasma to facilitate bone in-growth and provide secure
      intermediate fixation with the prepared bone surface at the site of implantation. The
      acetabular cup has a 3-hole design that accommodates three titanium alloy bone screws. Inside
      the acetabular cup is a male taper for assembly with the acetabular ball. The femoral
      component consists of a femoral stem manufactured from titanium and a mating cobalt chrome
      femoral cup lined with a highly cross-linked ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene
      (UHMWPE). As with the acetabular cup, the femoral stem is porous coated using a plasma spray
      of pure titanium, which is intended to facilitate bone in-growth and provide secure
      intermediate fixation with the prepared bone surface at the site of implantation. The femoral
      stem incorporates a female taper for assembly with the male taper of the femoral cup.

      The device has undergone extensive pre-clinical testing. There is no clinical experience with
      the HRS.
