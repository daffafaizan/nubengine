      (NAC) in trichotillomania. Forty subjects with DSM-IV trichotillomania will receive 12 weeks
      of double-blind NAC or placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that NAC will be effective and
      well tolerated in patients with trichotillomania compared to placebo. The proposed study will
      provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly
      effective treatment.
