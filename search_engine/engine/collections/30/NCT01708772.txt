      received anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids before admission, patients had
      immunosuppressive illness, patients had chronic organ failure; patients received massive
      blood transfusion; patients with radiation therapy and patients with previous organ
      transplantation were excluded from the study. At admission, patient's age, sex, weight and
      height were recorded. Patients data that include the clinical status; sequential organ
      failure assessment (SOFA) score; temperature; heart rate; respiratory rate; blood pressure;
      central venous pressure; laboratory analysis (complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen,
      blood sugar, serum sodium, potassium, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
      aminotransferase, prothrombin time, albumin and CRP) and arterial blood gas analysis were
      measured. Routine cultures of suspected sites, blood and urine were obtained to determine the
      presence of infection. We attempted to maintain the patient hemoglobin level at 10-12g/dl and
      central venous pressure at 8-12 cmH2o. When needed, intravascular fluid replacement, blood
      products and inotropic or vasopressor agents were administered. Each day the attending
      physician evaluated all the study patients for sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock as long
      as their stay in ICU.
