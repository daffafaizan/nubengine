    
      DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention: Looking At the Care
      Environment) is a multi-center, national NHLBI-funded grant to evaluate the real world
      implementation of the STOP protocol in which transcranial Doppler (TCD), a measure of
      cerebral blood vessel velocity, is used to screen for stroke risk in children ages 2-16 with
      sickle cell anemia (SCA). Based on the STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia)
      protocol, children identified as high risk of stroke by TCD are initiated on chronic red cell
      transfusion therapy (CRCT) for stroke prevention. Children with normal TCD are screened
      annually from the age of 2 until they are 16 years of age.

      This will be a THREE-part study beginning with Part 1 - a retrospective case record review
      followed by Part 2 - a multi-level qualitative assessment of barriers and enablers to TCD
      screening and initiation of chronic red blood cell transfusions and later adding Part 3 - a
      multi-center implementation clinical trial.The investigators will compare two implementation
      interventions to improve TCD screening.

      There are three aims of the grant and each aim is equivalent to the respective parts of the
      grant (i.e. Part 1 covers 1 aim). There are a total 28 consortium sites. The Medical
      University of South Carolina is the lead institution for this study.
