      quality of life questionnaires is the intervention being studied. Health-related quality of
      life questionnaires measure the physical, mental and social well-being of an individual, are
      recognised as important patient-reported outcomes and are increasingly being used in clinical
      trials and routine clinical practice. By asking study participants to complete a
      questionnaire assessing their physical, mental and social well-being, we are increasing their
      awareness of these aspects of their health and may directly or indirectly prompt them to take
      actions and/ or have thoughts that may improve or worsen their health status. Hence, we have
      considered this an interventional study. This survey will be conducted in Chinese.
