      obesity. After bariatric surgery, patients experience weight loss accompanied by a decrease
      in the amount of total body fat. It is unclear how the different surgical procedures vary in
      their effect in reducing the amount of the visceral fat layer . Ultrasonography (US) is an
      effective, efficient method in assessing this metabolically active layer of fat even when
      compared with gold standard techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance
      imaging. Only a few studies managed to show the actual decrease in the visceral fat layer
      after these kinds of bariatric surgeries. The aim is to compare by ultrasound evaluation the
      extent of fat layers reduction after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB),
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass (LRYGB).

      Visceral fat (VF) will be defined as the depth, in centimeters, from the rectus abdominis
      muscle to the aorta; and subcutaneous fat (SCF) defined as the depth, in centimeters, from
      the skin to the rectus abdominis muscle. Results will be compared with anthropometric
      measures as weight and waist circumference as well as laboratory results to try and find
      correlation between sonographic improvement and anthropometric and laboratory improvement.

      The hypothesis is that the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass being not only a restrictive
      procedure but also a malabsorptive procedure will have the best results in decreasing the
      amount of visceral fat.
