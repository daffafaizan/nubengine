      these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Predominant mechanism
      responsible for stroke is embolism from proximal rupture of atherosclerotic plaque and
      thrombus. 25-30% of stroke deaths related to the carotid stenosis. The primary therapy for
      carotid occlusive disease is the surgical removal of this atherosclerotic plaque from inside
      the artery. Another treatment option for subjects with significant surgical risk factors has
      been found: the carotid artery stenting is a non-surgical procedure which unblocks narrowing
      of the carotid artery lumen by inserting a small metal tube (stent) to keep the plaque
      against the wall of the artery to improve blood flow.
