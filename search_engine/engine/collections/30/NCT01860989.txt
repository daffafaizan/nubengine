    
      the study is comprised of 4 sequential cohorts, in total there will be up to 48 patients
      enrolled in the study.

      cohort 1: 6-12 patients receive 75mg single dose. cohort 2: 6-12 patients receive 150mg
      single dose. cohort 3: 6-12 patients receive 225mg single dose. cohort 4: 6-12 patients
      receive 300mg single dose. After approximately every 6 patients in any cohort have been
      treated with a given dose and complete the first 15 days, a safety and tolerability data
      review will be conducted by a Data Monitoring Committee(DMC). Consensus agreement of DMC is
      required to either escalate to the next dose level or expand a given cohort with an
      additional 6 patients in order to obtain more safety data.
