    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to measure the optimal time delay of
      1:1,000,000 epinephrine in saline solution injected by tumescent technique until maximum
      vasocontriction in the distal finger is achieved.

      Subjects will be injected in both his ring fingers(distal phalanges, volar side) with
      randomized solutions, one containing "one-per-mil" tumescent solution and the other
      containing only normal saline solution; information which both the injector and examiner are
      blinded from. Maximum vasoconstriction of the finger injected is depicted by the lowest
      oxygen saturation (recorded every minute until 45 minutes using pulse oxymeter).
