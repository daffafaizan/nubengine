      evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic EM program to improve patient-centred and clinical
      outcomes in older adults with acute CV disease. There will be 256 participants â‰¥60 years old
      with acute CV disease enrolled at 6 participating Canadian hospitals. The study will
      investigate whether EM improves functional status during admission, as compared to usual
      care, and whether this leads to improved health-related quality of life post-hospitalization.
      Functional status will be measured with the validated Level of Function Mobility Scale. The
      primary outcome will be the Short-Form SF-36 physical component scale score at 1-month
      post-hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include functional status and hospital readmission
      at 1-month post-hospitalization. Nested cohort studies will explore (1) the relationship
      between EM, sedentary time, and posthospitalization outcomes and (2) the impact of EM on
      muscle mass loss and inflammation in older adults with acute CV disease.
