      done as per standard of care.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PHIL® device in the
      treatment of intracranial dural ArterioVenous Fistula (dAVF). The PHIL® device, a
      non-adhesive liquid embolic agent, has been CE marked since July 2014. It is intended for use
      in the embolization of lesions in the peripheral and neurovasculature, including
      arteriovenous malformations and hypervascular tumors.

      All patients with an intracranial dAVF that has not been previously treated and will be
      treated by embolization with PHIL® are eligible for this study. A maximum of 70 patients will
      be enrolled in this study in 16 European Institutions.

      The expected approximate study duration is 38 months.
