      Diffuse Gastric Cancer Syndrome. Asymptomatic carriers have at high lifetime risk of diffuse
      gastric cancer (30-70%). Screening upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, even with multiple
      random biopsies, misses signet ring cell cancer foci. Invasive cancers can thus go
      undetected. There is therefore a recommendation of total risk-reducing gastrectomy, at least
      in carriers with a family history of gastric cancer. Novel screening strategies are needed.
      In this pilot project, the investigators will perform liquid biopsies of both blood and
      gastric fluid in asymptomatic carriers who refuse gastrectomy and in controls. The
      investigators aim to show that somatic mutations in a panel of genes involved in gastric
      cancer and methylation profiles are detected in a subset of carriers, and not in controls.
      These could be indicative of invasive cancer undetected by endoscopy, and would thus be a
      strong argument for risk-reducing gastrectomy. On the contrary, in the absence of somatic
      mutations in liquid biopsies, endoscopic surveillance could continue.
