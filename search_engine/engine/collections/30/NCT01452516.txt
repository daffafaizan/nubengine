      with autograft in conjunction with instrumented posterolateral gutter fusions using nanOss
      Bioactive bone void filler in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) characterized by
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

      Patients for this study will be recruited from up to 10 clinical sites. It is estimated that
      100 patients will be enrolled in the study. At least 10 investigators will participate in the
      study. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to sign the
      informed consent. Preoperatively, the patient will provide his /her medical history and
      complete self assessment forms. The investigator will perform a clinical evaluation.

      Patients who meet the criteria for entrance into the study will undergo lumbar fusion using
      interbody cages with autograft in conjunction with instrumented posterolateral gutter fusions
      using nanOss Bioactive in combination with local autograft and bone marrow aspirate (BMA).
      Anterior lumbar interbody fusion procedures are not allowed.

      Following surgery, operative and discharge information will be collected. The patients will
      be evaluated at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively. At each postoperative visit,
      the investigator will clinically evaluate the patient and the patient will complete self
      assessment documents, Oswestry Disability Index, Quality of Life questionnaires and a surgery
      satisfaction survey, e.g., very satisfied, satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied, or very
      unsatisfied with the surgery. Fusion status will be evaluated radiographically at each visit
      using plain films. CT scans at 12 months will be evaluated by an independent radiologist.
      Complication data will be recorded throughout the study.
