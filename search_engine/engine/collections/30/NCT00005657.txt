      polygenic nature of HCV infection. Both viral and host factors likely contribute to
      variations in infection outcome, disease susceptibility and progression, and treatment
      response. This protocol will focus on the immunogenetics of HCV infection. Various candidate
      genes, most of them related to host immune response in microbial infection, have defined
      genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with variable manifestations of infections
      including malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, AIDS and hepatitis B. In this proposal, we plan to
      collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a source of DNA from approximately 1500
      patients with HCV infection, analyze genetic polymorphisms of various candidate genes in
      association with viral clearance, disease progression or treatment response, and characterize
      the functional consequences of these polymorphisms in patients with well-defined clinical
      sequelae of HCV infection. We will also collect blood from patients with other forms of liver
      diseases (approximately 300) or normal volunteers (approximately 200) as controls. By
      identifying relevant host factors genetically and investigating their molecular interactions
      with HCV, we may gain additional insights into HCV pathogenesis and uncover new potential
      targets for vaccine development and treatment intervention.
