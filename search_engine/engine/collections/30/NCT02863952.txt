      well-established noninvasive procedure for the evaluation and risk stratification of patients
      with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, it has been recognized that in certain patients
      SPECT MPI is unable to detect the presence of CAD or underestimates its extent. The fact that
      moderate to severe perfusion defects are noted in less than half of the patients with
      significant left main disease has stimulated studies to improve the diagnostic accuracy of
      SPECT MPI. These studies have analyzed post-stress parameters such as left ventricular (LV)
      ejection fraction (EF), wall motion abnormalities and transient LV dilation. However, these
      parameters were derived from data acquired using conventional Anger cameras as long as 60
      minutes after stress tracer injection. Such delayed assessment may miss early ischemic
      stunning as a result of its rapid transient changes. However, with highly sensitive detectors
      and short lived tracers, the ability of PET MPI to measure EF during peak of stress has been
      reported. Similarly, the novel cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT cameras with solid state
      cardiac-focused detectors are significantly more sensitive than the conventional Anger
      scintillation cameras giving to SPECT the "PET-like" ability to image rapidly right after the
      stress test. The aim of this study is to evaluate early post-stress EF change (âˆ†EF) and its
      relation to the severity of myocardial ischemia and angiographic coronary disease using
      CZT-SPECT MPI.
