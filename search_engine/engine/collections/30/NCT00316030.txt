      relapsed or chemotherapy resistant AML. Further aggressive chemotherapy can be attempted, but
      generally yields poor results. This clinical study is the first use of bexarotene in the
      treatment of patient with relapsed or chemotherapy resistant AML. The main purpose of the
      study is to identify the maximum safe dose of bexarotene in patient with AML. Another
      objective of the study is to explore the side effect profile of bexarotene in AML patients.
      The study is organized so that the initial patients will get a low dose of bexarotene to be
      taken daily. If these patients tolerate the drug, then later patients will get higher daily
      doses. Further groups of patients will continue to increase their dose of bexarotene until a
      maximum tolerated dose is identified. The stu dy will end at that point. Patients will take
      the drug daily by mouth until such a time that their AML is worsening or they are
      experiencing unacceptable side effects. Their participating will end at that point.
