      ability to disseminate those treatments. There is a particular need to find innovative ways
      to disseminate key principles of empirically supported psychotherapy in primary care
      settings. Narrative communication is an alternative way to disseminate psychotherapy behavior
      change principles. Narrative communication refers to "storytelling" -real people talking
      about their struggles and successful ways of coping. An advantage of narrative communication
      is that it can be easily distributed (by video) and may reach people who do not have access
      to other technologies or who experience barriers to traditional psychotherapy. We propose
      that key principles of a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy (Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy, or ACT) can be readily disseminated through a video storytelling intervention.
      Together with a video production firm with a record of working in healthcare and developing
      documentary-style videos, we will produce a storytelling video intervention (sTVi).

      Our specific aim is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (n = 40) with depressed
      primary care patients who will receive either antidepressant treatment as usual (aTAU) + sTVi
      vs aTAU + attention control videos. Assessments will occur at baseline, 4 (post-treatment)
      and 12 weeks (follow-up). We will examine feasibility and acceptability of sTVi (e.g., uptake
      and completion of sTVi, engagement with videos, and understanding of key ACT principles), the
      attention control videos, and this research design. We will examine treatment differences
      (within relevant confidence intervals) on outcomes (e.g., depression severity). We will
      examine change in potential mechanisms, i.e., ACT-consistent coping strategies derived from
      key ACT principles.
