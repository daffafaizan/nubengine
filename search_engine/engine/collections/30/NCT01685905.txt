        1. The positive rates of QFT-G and TST as a screening test for LTBI

             -  The positive rates of QFT-G and TST will be analyzed

             -  Additional analysis will be performed according to the type of disease

        2. The agreement between QFT-G and TST as a screening test for LTBI

             -  The agreement between QFT-G and TST will be analyzed for patients with rheumatic
                diseases who examined both QFT-G and TST

             -  Additional analysis will be performed according to the type of disease

        3. The correlation of the occurrence of active TB and two tests (QFT-G and TST)

             -  The analysis of the correlation of the occurrence of active TB and two tests will
                be conducted for patients who have experienced anti-TNF agents

      3-1. The occurrence of active TB in accordance with results of TST

      3-2. The occurrence of active TB in accordance with results of QFT-G

      3-3. The difference in the occurrence of active TB in patients performed both QFT-G and TST
      compared with those performed only TST for detecting of LTBI who are candidates of TNF
      inhibitors (pilot study).
