      downward spiral that may lead to decreased strength and functionality. The term 'sarcopenia'
      (Greek 'sarx' or flesh + 'penia' or loss) has been proposed to describe this age-related
      decrease of muscle mass. Sarcopenia represents an impaired state of health with increased
      risk of falls and fractures, impaired ability to perform activities of daily living, and loss
      of independence. The imaging technologies used to detect loss of skeletal muscle mass in
      sarcopenia include: dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MR),
      computed tomography, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and ultrasound.

      The main scope of the present pilot study is to evaluate the possible association between the
      status of sarcopenia and the risk of fall in osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Forty
      osteoporotic postmenopausal women, previously (pre-recruitment) classified by DXA in 20
      sarcopenic and 20 non-sarcopenic subjects, will be recruited. Data will be collected on: 1)
      bone (vitamin D) and muscle (myokines) metabolisms through blood sampling; 2) Risk of fall by
      the OAK device produced by Khymeia; 3) thigh muscle quality through MR.

      A secondary outcome is to evaluate the differences in bone and muscle metabolism, risk of
      fall, and muscle quality between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic subjects.
