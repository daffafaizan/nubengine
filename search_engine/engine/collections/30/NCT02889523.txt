    
      Phase I:

      Up to 18 patients will be recruited, using a conventional dose-escalation algorithm (3+3
      patients per dose level) to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which will be deemed
      the RP2D. Patients will receive 8 cycles of RCHOP every 21 days and tazemetostat every day,
      starting on day 2 of cycle 1.

      4 cohorts are defined, according to dose levels of tazemetostat: 400mg Twice a day (BID)
      (cohort 1, starting level), 600mg BID (cohort 2), 800mg BID (cohort 3), 200mg BID (cohort
      -1), depending on the observed toxicities.

      Phase II:

      Up to 184 patients (122 DLBCL and 62 FL) will be recruited and treated with tazemetostat at
      the MTD and RCHOP.

      Patients will receive 6 cycles of RCHOP every 21 days and tazemetostat at the MTD every day,
      starting on day 2 of cyle 1, + 2 cycles of Rituximab+tazemetostat. For FL, a maintenance of
      tazemetostat (6 months) + rituximab (24 months) is expected
