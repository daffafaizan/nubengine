      severe pain and 8% significant disability. Current methods of management, such as the use of
      rigid pelvic belts, are limited in their effectiveness. The Dynamic Elastomeric Fabric
      Orthoses (DEFO) has recently proven beneficial in managing PGP in athletes. There is a need
      to explore the potential use of DEFO for managing PGP during pregnancy. The primary aim of
      the study is to compare the effectiveness of a DEFO to a rigid 'off the shelf' pelvic support
      belt in terms of its effectiveness in reducing PGP during pregnancy. The secondary aims of
      the study are to compare the effectiveness of the DEFO to the rigid 'off the shelf' pelvic
      support belt in (a) optimizing activity levels in pregnant women with PGP, (b)improving
      quality of life for pregnant women with PGP. The relative cost effectiveness of these two
      interventions will also be compared.
