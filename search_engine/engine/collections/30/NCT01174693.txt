      receptor. Clopidogrel must be converted into an active metabolite in order to show
      anti-platelet activity. Hepatic CYP2C19 enzyme is one of the key hepatic enzymes which
      convert clopidogrel into active metabolite and its genetic polymorphism is related to
      clopidogrel resistance. CYP2C19 poor or intermediate metabolizer groups show reduced
      anti-platelet activity of clopidogrel compared to extensive metabolizer group.

      This study is designed to prove the superiority of the triflusal in preventing recurrent
      stroke over the clopidogrel in ischemic stroke patient with poor or intermediate metabolizer
      of CYP2C19 polymorphism. Also we plan to prove that clopidogrel resistance is related to
      CYP2C19 polymorphism by comparing the ischemic preventive effect of clopidogrel between
      groups of different CYP2C19 polymorphism.
