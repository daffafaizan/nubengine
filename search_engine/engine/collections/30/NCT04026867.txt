      compare 2 linkage-to-care strategies. Permuted block randomization with 2 strata (i.e., <40
      years of age or active IDU [defined as IDU within 30 days], or â‰¥40 years of age without
      active IDU) and varying block sizes will be used to minimize imbalance, ensure appropriate
      numbers of patients in subgroups, and allow for efficient analyses. Allocation will be
      concealed by blinding block sizes and using the REDCap Randomization Module, a web-based
      platform to assign patients to arms (REDCap, Vanderbilt University, TN). Although patients
      will not be blinded to the interventions, they will be blinded to the outcomes. Also, a
      trained research assistant will perform all enrollment, including stratification and
      randomization. Clinical staff will not be blinded, however, to assignment.
