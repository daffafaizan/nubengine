      for individuals/couples in Guam by using culturally responsive approaches to foster healthy
      relationships and marriages using an Observational approach as there will be no comparison
      group, only the control group. Project activities include a 6-month education program of
      interactive curriculum-based groups and positive social/recreational activities to achieve
      positive outcomes for individuals/couples, community awareness events, and community and
      parenting skills training. The services offered is entrenched in cultures and traditions that
      are meaningful to the people of Guam, and includes capacity building and community awareness
      activities that will change community, family, and peer normative environments and attitudes.
