    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the response rate in patients with Stage III/IV or recurrent mycosis
      fungoides or Sezary syndrome treated with oral etoposide, with the addition of doxorubicin,
      then methotrexate for poor responders. II. Assess changes in the hematologic and immunologic
      status of the tumor in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are treated sequentially on Regimens A, B, and C depending on response. The
      following acronyms are used: CF Leucovorin calcium, NSC-3590 DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 MTX
      Methotrexate, NSC-740 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Regimen A: Single-Agent Chemotherapy.
      VP-16. Regimen B: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VP-16/DOX. Regimen C: 3-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy. VP-16/DOX/MTX.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Study duration will be at least 3 years with an anticipated accrual of 3
      patients/year.
