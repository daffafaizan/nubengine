      undergo 3 consultations with the physician, based on the usual follow up for this pathology.
      During the first consultation the physician will check the inclusion criteria, medical
      history, clinical data relative to the different outcomes, and prescribe optimizated pain
      killers and deliver information about self care and physical activity. Patient reported
      outcome measures will be assessed through self answering questionnaires with the help of a
      research assistant if necessary. After randomisation the prosthetist will take the
      measurement to conceive the custom brace. Patients will then be re-examined during a 2nd
      consultation 3 month later to assess the main outcome (pain reduction) and other secondary
      outcome (proms). A third consultation will be organised 6 months later for secondary outcome
      (pain reduction and proms).
