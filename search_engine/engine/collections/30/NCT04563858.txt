    
      Delirium, which generally is triggered by underlying medical conditions, is an acute and
      fluctuating disorder associated with attention and cognitive defects, and frequently
      accompanied by excessive arousal and perception-related problems. Delirium may lead to a
      variety of complications, e.g. cognitive impairments. Development of delirium is promoted by
      both anaesthesia and pain. Patients subjected to cardiac surgeries are at risk of delirium
      due to such factors as extracorporeal circulation applied during the intervention and various
      cardiovascular complications. Rapid identification of the problem may help eliminate
      avoidable complications which can be prevented at an early stage.
