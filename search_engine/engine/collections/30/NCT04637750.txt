      informative intervention addressed to GPs is effective in improving PPIs prescription in
      older people. All GPs of the Local Health Unit (LHU) of Caserta (southern Italy) and Bergamo
      (northern Italy) will be invited to participate to the study, because Caserta and Bergamo
      represent the areas with the highest level of inappropriate PPI prescription rate. All GPs
      involved in the study will receive an invitation letter illustrating the study purpose and
      containing information about aggregated data on PPI prescriptions out of AIFA reimbursement
      criteria in Italy and their local area. The GPs randomized to the intervention arm will also
      receive a feedback informing on their absolute number of patients treated with at least one
      PPI during the baseline period and if they have been prescribed above or below the median of
      appropriate prescriptions rate in their local area. They will be also provided with a
      scientific document including technical details on AIFA reimbursement criteria (NOTA 1 and
      48), short hints about adverse events related to PPI long- term use in older patients and
      recommendation on how to discontinue PPI. After 4 months GPs will also receive a
      patient-focused intervention leaflet and poster for patients about their medicines: what are
      the PPI and their possible side effects, nutritional and behavioral advices to prevent
      gastric and reflux problems and how to step down the treatment. The appropriateness of PPI
      prescriptions will be defined according to the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) reimbursement
      rules (NOTA 1 and 48).
