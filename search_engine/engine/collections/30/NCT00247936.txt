      Open esophagectomy can be associated with significant morbidity. We hypothesize that
      laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with reduced morbidity and a faster recovery.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy can be performed safely.

        2. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with reduced
           postoperative pain, decrease ICU and hospital stay, and reduced postoperative wound
           morbidity.

        3. Combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy is associated with similar long
           term survival as with the open approach for patients with esophageal malignancies.

      OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. To compare short-term outcome such as operative time, operative and in-patient costs,
           operative complications, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications
           between combined thoracoscopic/ laparoscopic esophagectomy and transhiatal
           esophagectomy.

        2. To evaluate physiologic outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy vs. transhiatal
           esophagectomy.

        3. To determine the long-term outcome, disease-free survival, survival and quality of life
           after minimally invasive esophagectomy compared to transhiatal esophagectomy
