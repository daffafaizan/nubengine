      randomized, controlled, examiner-blinded, two-period crossover study. 20 periodontal
      maintenance patients of the University Hospital of Dental Prosthetics and Restorative
      Dentistry were recruited. Each subject was asked to attend three appointments. In the first
      visit (day one), baseline plaque and bleeding indices were assessed. Each proband was
      instructed by the same experienced dental hygienist with two sizes of waist-shaped and
      cylindric interdental brushes, respectively. Primary outcome measure plaque index and
      secondary outcome measure papillary bleeding index were assessed by two blinded and
      calibrated examiners at four sites per tooth.The odds ratio and confidence interval for
      establishing plaque free interdental sites were calculated with logistic regression analysis.
