      applications of olive oil and of 10% Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) essential oil to
      both hands with a wash-out period of 3 hours. Effects on vasodilatation are measured with
      infrared thermography. Patients' sense of warmth is assessed by the "Herdecke warmth
      perception questionnaire". Measurements take place at baseline and 45 minutes following the
      interventions (pre-post-comparison). To determine within and between-differences, 2-sample
      t-tests will be used and effect sizes will be calculated (Standardized Effect Size).
