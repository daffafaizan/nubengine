      work-related outcomes. Three worksites in British Columbia were randomly assigned to one of
      three conditions: (1) an empirically-validated intervention directed at individual behavior
      change using personally-tailored messages delivered by email (ALIVE) ; (2) a comprehensive
      approach building on social and institutional support developed by the Canadian Cancer
      Society British Columbia Yukon and previously used for worksite tobacco control (CCS BCY) and
      (3) an intervention including both of these approaches (CCS BCY + ALIVE). The primary outcome
      was change in fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to 16 months, as an indicator of
      healthy diet. Change in weight, physical activity, and work productivity were secondary
      outcomes. The investigators also conducted focus groups to assess participant perspectives on
      the programs which comprise another secondary outcome.
