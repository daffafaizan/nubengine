      reducing the decrease in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) ability for elderly with hip
      fractures. Despite positive surgical outcomes, one-quarter dies within a year after surgery,
      around eight percent are readmitted to hospital, and just one-third regain their pre-fracture
      level of physical functioning and ADL ability. After hip fracture, the loss of independence,
      and further decrease in ADL ability often persists beyond three months after surgery. This
      increases the risk of social isolation, depression and thus a decrease in QoL. Therefore, the
      investigators want to evaluate whether an activity-based rehabilitation intervention across
      sectors is effective and influences this fragile group of patients. The investigators hope to
      increase the ability to safely and independently perform ADL in elderly with hip fractures,
      and thereby enhance their health-related QoL.
