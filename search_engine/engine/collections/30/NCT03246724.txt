      IV midazolam when administered for ocular procedures. Midazolam is an FDA-approved
      intravenous medication commonly used as a sedative for ocular procedures conducted in the
      operating room. This study will compare the use of triazolam, an FDA-approved oral sedative
      for the same types of ocular procedures, a purpose which has not fully been investigated. The
      benzodiazepine triazolam was chosen as the oral medication due to its similarity to
      midazolam. The similarities between midazolam and triazolam include similar half-life, risks,
      and patient experience.The medication doses were chosen from current SOC use based on weight.
      The lower dose for both medications are used for patients with a BMI less than 35 and the
      higher dose is used for patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 35.

      This is the first double-blind, prospective clinical trial that will compare IV and oral
      sedation for multiple ocular sub-specialty procedures. The procedures to be investigated
      include: cataract, retina, cornea, and glaucoma surgical groups.
