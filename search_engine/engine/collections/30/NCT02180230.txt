    
      The primary endpoint was the change in marginal bone levels (in mm) from the time of implant
      insertion to follow-up visits (3, 6, 12, 36 and 60 months).

      Further endpoints were:

        -  cumulative survival rates of the implants

        -  soft tissue parameters (papilla index, bleeding on probing)

        -  plaque formation
