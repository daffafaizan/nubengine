           cognitive functioning, including verbal memory, fluency, attention, spatial memory,
           motor speed, and executive function.

        2. Evaluate the effects of single doses of sildenafil 50 & 100 mg compared to placebo on
           psychotic, negative, and mood symptoms.

        3. Assess self-reports of side effects of sildenafil 50 & 100 mg.

      Location and Subjects:

      25 adult outpatients with schizophrenia will be recruited from the Massachusetts General
      Hospital outpatient clinic or the Freedom Trail Clinic of the Lindemann Center. All research
      procedures will be performed at the Psychopharmacology Clinic of the Massachusetts General
      Hospital. Subjects must be English speaking because the cognitive battery has only been
      validated in English.
