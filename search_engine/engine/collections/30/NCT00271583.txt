    
      Objective: To compare the efficacy, safety and tolerance of a 50 mg dose of a new
      antiprogestin, CDB-2914 with a 0.75 mg bid dose of levonorgestrel as emergency contraception

      Design: Multicenter, randomized, double blind Phase II study to compare a 50 mg dose of
      CDB-2914 to a 0.75 mg bid dose of levonorgestrel as emergency contraception

      Duration: A one-time treatment with either CDB-2914 or levonorgestrel with follow-up visits
      at 5-7 days after expected onset of menses and another visit at 12-14 days after expected
      onset of menses (if needed)

      Treatment: A one-time treatment with one of the following:

        -  Two doses of 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel to be taken 12 hours apart

        -  One dose of 50 mg CDB-2914 and a second placebo dose to be taken 12 hours later

      Study Sites: Multicenter study in the United States

      Subjects: Women of reproductive age (at least 18 years) at risk of pregnancy within 72 hours
      of unprotected coitus

      Sample Size: Approximately 811 women will be enrolled in each treatment group to obtain 1540
      evaluable subjects

      Outcome Evaluations

      Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of CDB-2914 used by subjects as an emergency postcoital
      contraceptive in comparison to a group of subjects receiving levonorgestrel.

      Secondary: To compare the tolerability (as measured by vomiting and nausea) of CDB-2914 used
      by subjects as an emergency postcoital contraceptive with that of a group of subjects
      receiving levonorgestrel.

      Safety/Other: To assess the frequency and intensity of adverse events and the effects on the
      menstrual cycle of subjects administered CDB-2914 in comparison to subjects given
      levonorgestrel.
