      memantine at the dosage range 5-20 mg/day in 20 outpatients with idiopathic PD and dementia
      secondary to PD. Using the dosage escalation regimen approved for Alzheimer disease, subjects
      will start memantine or comparable placebo at 5 mg daily and advance 5 mg/week to 20 mg /day
      by week 4, with dosing at 10 mg bid. Subjects will undergo 7 clinical visits over the 6-month
      trial (Screen, Baseline/Week 0, and Weeks 4, 8, 14, 20, and 24). The dosage can be titrated
      downward in increments of 5 mg to a minimum dose of 5 mg/day in the event memantine is not
      tolerated at the scheduled dosages. This broad dose range is being used because 1)a favorable
      cognitive response may be evident at lower doses of memantine than recommended for AD and
      2)adverse effects could emerge when typical AD dosing recommendations are used, as has been
      observed when treating PD patients with cholinesterase inhibitors. Subjects will remain on a
      stable dose of memantine/placebo after Week 8, unless precluded by adverse events. Ten
      subjects will be assigned to each treatment group. Randomization will be stratified according
      to whether subjects are taking a concomitant cholinesterase inhibitor. This will enable
      secondary group comparisons of treatment groups. Results from this initial small study will
      be used to evaluate the appropriateness of devising a larger-scale multi-site study of
      memantine for treatment of dementia in PD.

      The proposed assessment schedule was designed to represent use of memantine in general
      clinical practice and to minimize the burdens to caregivers and patients, who have impaired
      mobility as well as cognitive function.
