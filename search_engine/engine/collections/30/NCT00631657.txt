      population in the industrial countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,
      resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The majority of the insomniacs suffer
      chronically from their complaints.

      The maleic acid salt of Org 4420, code name Org 50081 (esmirtazapine), was selected for
      development in the treatment of insomnia. The first clinical trial with esmirtazapine was a
      proof-of-concept trial with a four-way cross-over design. All 3 esmirtazapine dose groups
      showed a statistically significant positive effect on TST (objective and subjective) and Wake
      Time After Sleep Onset (WASO), as compared to placebo.

      The current study is designed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of esmirtazapine in
      a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group outpatient trial in
      participants suffering from chronic primary insomnia. During the 6-month treatment period,
      participants are randomly assigned to receive either esmirtazapine or placebo. Then, during
      the 7-day discontinuation period, participants who received esmirtazapine in the 6-month
      treatment period are randomly assigned to receive either esmirtazapine or placebo, while
      participants who received placebo in the 6-month treatment period continue to receive
      placebo.
