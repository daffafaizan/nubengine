    
      Primary objective:

      To assess the feasibility of a randomized, parallel, two-arm, controlled and double blind
      trial designed to compare the quality of life of patients taking dexamethasone 20 mg IV 30
      minutes before paclitaxel with those taking a standard dose of dexamethasone, 20 mg orally 12
      hours and 6 hours before paclitaxel, in patients taking paclitaxel every two to three weeks
      for a minimum of two cycles in order to estimate a sample size.

      Secondary objectives:

      Between the two study groups, to compare:

        -  Quality of life during the first two cycles of chemotherapy;

        -  Efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing acute hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel
           in the first two cycles of chemotherapy;

        -  Adverse effects associated with dexamethasone on a daily basis during the first seven
           days of the first two cycles of chemotherapy.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups.
