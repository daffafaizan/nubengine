      and in arm 4, the participant will only be on placebo treatment. It is important to include
      this arm of the study as a key objective in looking at the benefit of continuing donepezil
      and therefore a placebo arm should be present as a comparator. To reduce the risk to
      participants of withdrawing donepezil too early in their illness, an inclusion criteria is
      that the participant is at a stage in their disease whereby the prescribing clinician feels a
      change in drug prescription may be appropriate.
