    
      We will compare two groups of babies born between 26+0 and 34+0 weeks gestation.Group 1 is
      the babies born to mothers with diabetes and/or high blood pressure, and babies that are
      small for dates. Group 2 are babies that are 26 to 34 weeks of age, that are born to mothers
      without these problems.

      In the study we will measure the baby's blood pressure once a day for the first 4 days, at 1
      week of age, and then once per week until the baby is discharged. We will also measure the
      blood pressure after discharge at 4 and 10 months of age, either on the day of your baby's
      follow-up appointment in the Neonatal Follow-up Clinic or at a visit to our Outpatient
      Nephrology Clinic, both at CHEO.

      As blood tests will be done. A small amount of extra blood, 0.75ml - 1.5 ml (about 1/6 -1/3
      of a teaspoon, or approximately 1 ml) will be collected for measurement of the blood
      substances we are studying will be collected when the baby has their regular non-study blood
      work.

      This will be done within six hours of birth and then again at 2-3 weeks of life.
