      States. All the current available Hydrocodone formulations are short acting and have
      Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen in them. Chronic pain patients who take pain medications for extended
      time are overloaded with Acetaminophen and there is a very serious concern about liver
      failure from excessive concurrent alcohol use. Also all the current hydrocodone combinations
      available in the U.S. are short acting and provide pain relief for 3-6 hrs.

      Hydromorphone is a metabolite of Hydrocodone and plays a significant role in providing pain
      relief in these patients. Although there are no long acting or extended release hydrocodone
      formulations that are FDA approve at this time, there is once a day extended release
      Hydromorphone (ER) approved by FDA and is currently marketed under the name Exalgo Â®. PK
      study of chronic hydrocodone/acetaminophen usage is important to determine equivalent potency
      with hydromorphone ER, so that clinicians can use a simple conversion formula to switch to
      hydromorphone ER.

      Although medical professionals use the Opiate conversion formula on a regular basis for
      Opioid rotation, there are no published studies showing the pharmacokinetic data in patients
      taking hydrocodone for chronic pain.

      Our goal is to use this PK data to guide clinicians with this data in using extended release
      hydromorphone for chronic pain management to provide predictable pain relief and minimize the
      acetaminophen usage.
