      consumption of flavonoids. We aimed to identify clinical and vascular parameters of treated
      hypertensive patients who present beneficial effects of dark chocolate for one-week period on
      vascular function. Twenty-one hypertensive patients in drug therapy, both genders, aged 40-65
      years, were included in a prospective study with measurement of blood pressure, brachial
      flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT) and central
      hemodynamic parameters by SphygmoCor. After seven days of eating dark chocolate (70% cocoa)
      75g/day, the clinical and vascular evaluation were repeated. Patients were divided into two
      groups according to the response in FMD: responders (increase in FMD, n=12) and
      non-responders (no improvement in FMD, n=9).
