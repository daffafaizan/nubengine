        1. 7 days of Omnipod Horizon™ use in Manual Mode without a connected CGM using manual entry
           of BG values to deliver boluses (Phase 1) followed by;

        2. 7 days of Omnipod Horizon™ use in Manual Mode with a connected CGM using the
           CGM-informed bolus calculator to deliver boluses (Phase 2)

      Following subject screening, system training and enrollment, subjects will commence the first
      7-day Manual Mode phase of the study.

      Subjects will be trained to use the Manual Mode feature of the system including how to use
      the bolus calculator using manual entry of BG values or by using the CGM-informed bolus
      calculator.

      After completion of the first 7 days of the Manual Mode phase using the Omnipod Horizon™
      without a connected CGM, subjects will transition to the next 7 days of the Manual Mode phase
      using the system with a connected CGM using the CGM-informed bolus calculator to deliver
      boluses.
