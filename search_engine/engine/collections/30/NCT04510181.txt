      are hypothesized to contribute to inadequate treatment outcomes in many individuals with FM
      and several studies have demonstrated symptom improvement in individuals with FM and low hGH
      who received rhGH therapy. The amino acid-based blend represents a novel mechanism for
      increasing endogenous hGH production. It has been shown to produce an increase in endogenous
      hGH levels in healthy individuals by attenuating the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on hGH
      release. The amino acid-based blend may be a safe and effective treatment for FM in
      individuals with poorly controlled FM and low-normal hGH.

      This study will investigate the effect of taking the amino acid blend on IGF-1 levels (a
      surrogate marker of the body's growth hormone levels), fibromyalgia symptoms, stress
      symptoms, body weight, and other cardiometabolic biomarkers in individuals with
      treatment-resistant FM and low-normal hGH.

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all eligible participants giving
      written informed consent will administer the amino acid-based blend daily. Standard care for
      fibromyalgia will continue.
