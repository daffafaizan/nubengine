      in different centres across different countries will be asked to participate in this
      cross-sectional study.

      A) for the HCP to fill out a questionnaire about their CP child, related to general subject
      characteristics, motor function, co-morbidities, type of therapies, anthropometry, feeding
      mode and nutritional status; and B) for parents (/legal representatives) to receive and fill
      out questionnaires about their CP child and themselves, related to general subject
      characteristics, motor function, co-morbidities, type of therapies, anthropometry, feeding
      mode and nutritional status, participation and (their own) quality of life.

      If parents (/legal representatives) agree to "A)", but not "B)" then a subject will still
      enter the study, but without the parental assessment.
