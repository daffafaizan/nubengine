    
      The effectiveness of the self-regulation-based e- and m-health intervention 'MyPlan 2.0' on
      changing physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the adult population will be
      investigated. Furthermore, the role of three different behaviour change techniques (action
      planning, coping planning, self-monitoring) will be examined via a 2x2x2 design, in which 8
      groups are created that all receive a different version of the intervention.
