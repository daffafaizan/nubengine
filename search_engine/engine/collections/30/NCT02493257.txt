      intranasal capsaicin challenge followed by assessment with optical rhinometry. Studies have
      shown that capsaicin therapy can improve symptoms of patients historically identified with
      NAIR via visual analog scale (VAS) rating of symptoms and symptom surveys; however, there has
      been no study evaluating the capsaicin therapy on patients objectively identified as NAIR
      patients.

      Multiple studies have demonstrated that intranasal capsaicin can improve nasal symptoms of
      NAIR patients. Regarding the usage of capsaicin, there is a product on the market: Sinus
      Buster which has capsaicin as the active ingredient. Numerous research papers have evaluated
      the efficacy and safety of Sinus Buster for the treatment of congestion in non-allergic
      rhinitis patients. However, the diagnosis of NAIR in these previous studies was based
      primarily on history. In addition, the primary outcome in these studies was symptomatic
      without any objective evaluation. The goal of this study will be two-fold: with patients
      objectively identified as NAIR patients via the optical rhinometer, we will re-evaluate the
      therapeutic action of intranasal capsaicin on the management of rhinitic symptoms. We expect
      that the patients will show significant improvement in their symptoms. We will then use
      optical rhinometry as a means to objectively monitor changes in symptoms in NAIR patients. We
      expect that post treatment, patients will no longer have the positive response previously
      seen on intranasal capsaicin challenge before receiving treatment. We hope to be able to
      establish optical rhinometry as an objective measurement of symptom improvement for NAIR
      symptoms, along with the subjective patient surveys.
