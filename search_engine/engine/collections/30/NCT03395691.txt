      preventing thrombosis. Use of those drugs is associated with increased risk of bleeding. Any
      invasive procedures may put those patients at additional risk of bleeding. Ultrasound (US)
      has become widely accepted to guide safe and accurate central venous catheterization.The
      axillary vein in the infraclavicular area is an alternative choice for subclavian vein.
      Ultrasound images of the infraclavicular axillary vein differ according to its position.
      Proximal infraclavicular axillary vein is a direct continuation of the subclavian vein. The
      associated anatomy is simple and the vein is straight and thick in longitudinal axis view,
      which are in favor of successful puncture. Meanwhile, distal axillary vein also has
      anatomical advantages for safe and successful cannulations. Distal axillary vein lies further
      away from the artery and chest wall, and the overlap between distal axillary vein and artery
      gets greater on moving laterally. It is still unknow that one of the puncture approaches is
      superior to the other. Until now, there are no studies comparing two puncture approaches in
      high bleeding risk patients. The aim of the study is to compare the success rate of first
      puncture and safety of US-guided proximal and distal axillary venous catheterization in
      cardiac surgery patients with risk of bleeding.
