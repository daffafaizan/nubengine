    
      Study Design: The investigators will conduct a prospective, single-center, observational
      study at the Cardiovascular Imaging Network at Queen's (CINQ, www.CINQLab.com). This facility
      allows a CEUS protocol to be conducted on the same day as the angiogram. It is anticipated
      that 100 participants can be recruited per month with a total target enrolment of up to 1000
      participants.

      Objectives

        1. To determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive
           predictive values) of carotid plaque by CEUS (Definity(R)) for predicting significant
           CAD (â‰¥50% stenosis) in participants referred for angiography

        2. To determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values) of
           carotid plaque by CEUS for predicting future CV events, such as death, stroke,
           myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular interventions.
