      texture of the pancreas. The stiffness of organs depends on histologic features such as
      content of fat, fibrotic tissue and micro vascular structures. Yet, pancreatic stiffness was
      evaluated only subjectively. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) may allow objective quantification of pancreatic stiffness prior to surgery.

      Endoscopic ultrasound elastography (EUE) is based on real-time Doppler technology. Image
      colors are derived from vibration patterns which depend on the stiffness of a specific region
      of the investigated organ. The retrieved images could be converted into numeric matrix using
      a specially designed program.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method for quantitatively assessing the
      mechanical properties of tissues based on fat tissue content.

      In this trial the investigators will assess at first the value of EUE and MRI in predicting
      development of postoperative pancreatic fistula and in a next step the value EUE and MRI as
      an objective method in prediction of pancreatic stiffness.
