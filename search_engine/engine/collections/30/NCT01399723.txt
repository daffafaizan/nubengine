      promoted in many developing countries for over 20 years. Despite this, pneumonia continues to
      claim over 1.5 million lives of children under five annually. The use of affordable,
      easily-administered, safe, effective treatments can potentially reduce the burden of
      childhood pneumonia. The WHO recommends the use of a single antibiotic for the treatment of
      severe pneumonia. Whereas in Asia, evidence from large randomized clinical trials has changed
      policy recommendations for treatment of severe pneumonia from parenteral penicillin to oral
      amoxicillin, there is little evidence to inform a similar move in African children where
      pneumonia is associated with poorer outcomes. In this study the investigators will
      investigate effectiveness of oral amoxicillin versus the current standard treatment, benzyl
      penicillin in severe childhood pneumonia using a randomized controlled non-inferiority design
      preceded by a pilot pre-intervention phase. The investigators will also collect observational
      data HIV-exposed / infected children with severe pneumonia. 594 children aged 2 - 59 months
      admitted with clinical signs of severe pneumonia to up to 7 hospitals in Kenya will be
      randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or injectable benzyl penicillin. They
      will then be followed up for the primary outcome of pre-defined treatment failure at 48
      hours. The results of this trial will provide valuable data on the effectiveness of oral
      amoxicillin in the treatment of severe pneumonia in a population of Kenyan children and
      determine the practicability of conducting large pragmatic trials on pneumonia in Africa
      similar to those done in Asia.
