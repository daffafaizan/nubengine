      there were approximately 44180 new cases of rectal cancer diagnosed in the United states.

      Due to the close proximity of the rectum to pelvic structures and organs, the absence of a
      serious membrane surrounding the rectum and the restriction of the surgical view and access
      by the pelvic cavity, the locoregional recurrence rate in rectal cancer is relatively high
      after surgery alone.

      Neoadjuvent therapy rather than surgery followed by adjuvent therap has been the preferred
      approach world wide in treatment of rectal cancer since the 2004 publication of the seminal
      German CAO/ARO/AIO-94 study ,which compared preoperative with postoperative chemoradiation in
      823 patients The use of neoadjuvent therapy is recommended for all newly diagnosed rectal
      adenocarcinoma with a clinical stage T3 or T4 based on trans rectal endoscopic ultrasound or
      pelvic MRI .Neoadjuvent therapy may comprise of either radiotherapy alone or in combination
      with chemotherapy, commonly prescribed chemotherapy agents include 5-fluorouracil and
      Oxaloplatin.

      Both short course radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 fractions) and long course radiotherapy (50.4Gy in
      28 fractions, conventionally fractionated therapy)can be applied as neoadjuvent radiotherapy.

      Several phase lll RCTs,including three large well-designed international RCTs have reported
      that short course neoadjuvent radiation treatment improves local control compared with
      surgery alone in patients with respectable rectal cancer.

      Also ,neoadjuvent chemoradiation with long course radiotherapy can be recommended for most
      patients with stage ll- lll rectal cancer with the aim of reducing the risk of local
      recurrence, for reducing rates of perioperative and post operative complications and in an
      attempt to avoid radical surgery with permanent colostomy.
