      Minute technical errors performed by the surgeon have the potential to lead to adverse
      patient outcomes. The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of this relationship
      through the development of an intraoperative model.

      Materials and Methods:

      The investigators used Constructivist Grounded Theory methodology, including a comprehensive
      review of the literature and interviews with surgeons, focusing on avoidance of technical
      errors. The investigators used the Observational Clinical Human Reliability Assessment
      system, which categorizes granular, technical intraoperative errors, as their conceptual
      framework. The investigators iteratively interviewed surgeons, from multiple adult and
      pediatric surgical specialties, refined our semi-structured interview, and developed a model.
      The model remained stable after interviewing 11 surgeons, and it was reviewed it with earlier
      interviewed surgeons.
