      and maintaining body weight. However, many people are not engaging in enough exercise, and
      some may not be achieving maximum benefits from the exercise that they already do. Performing
      exercise in the overnight fasted state has been shown to reduce energy intake over the course
      of a single day, without any compensatory reductions in free-living energy expenditure.
      Despite these promising findings, it is likely that not every member of the population is
      logistically able to perform exercise in the morning due to various work, family and social
      commitments, and exercise in the evening may be a logical alternative for these individuals.
      Whether the beneficial effects of overnight fasted exercise can be observed at an alternative
      time of the day (i.e. the evening) is unknown.

      Therefore, the investigators are interested in examining the compensatory appetite and energy
      intake responses following a bout of evening exercise performed after an extended (7 hour)
      period of fasting. Exercise performance will also be assessed as a marker of voluntary energy
      expenditure, which if reduced, has the potential to compensate for the reduced energy balance
      induced by fasted exercise.
