    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the drug
      PassiflorineÂ® (Passiflora incarnata L; Crataegus Oxyacantha L and Salix alba L) compared to
      Valeriana officinalis over a period of four weeks.

      The improvement of anxiety disorders parameters (primary outcome) will be measured by the
      score of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A).

      Does the administration of 2 tablets a day over a period of four weeks vs. Valeriana
      officinalis lead to an improvement in anxiety disorders?
