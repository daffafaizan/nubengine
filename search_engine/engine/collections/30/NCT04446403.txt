      suprascapular and circumflex nerve blocks versus suprascapular nerve and posterior cord
      blocks at infraclavicular level .

      Thirty four patients aged from 18-70 years old, with ASA physical status I-II-III and
      scheduled for shoulder surgeries will be included in the study. Patients will be randomly
      allocated using computer-generated table into one of two groups:

        -  Group circumflex → will undergo ultrasound guided SSN+circumflex.

        -  Group posterior cord → will undergo ultrasound guided SSN+posterior cord.
