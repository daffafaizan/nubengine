      follicular size at the oocyte pick-up day and consequently, the number of available mature
      oocytes and the number of competent embryos for implantation. The follicular size at the day
      of oocyte pick-up reflects the synchronicity of the individual follicular responsiveness to
      FSH.

      For successful preimplantation development of an embryo, the oocyte must contain all
      necessary maternal factors. Two of these factors are specific mRNA transcripts (GDF9, PTX3,
      HAS2, PTGS2, TNFAIP6) and microRNA (miR-224).

      For each Cumulus Oocyte Complex, the evaluation of embryo development and morphokinetics will
      be correlated with the expression and implantation data to identify a quantitative biomarker
      to predict the embryo with the highest chance of implantation in patients.

      Experimental Design:

        1. - Collection of Cumulus Oocyte Complex (COC) from patients

        2. - Separation of oocytes according to the size of the follicule they have been retrieved
           from (<17mm; â‰¥17mm)

        3. - Isolation of mRNA from both groups of cumulus cells

        4. - Expression studies, qRT-PCR (GDF9, PTX3, HAS2, PTGS2, TNFAIP6)

        5. - Analysis of miR-224, a negative regulator of cumulus expansion via PTX3

        6. - Time-lapse culture & evaluation of morphokinetics
