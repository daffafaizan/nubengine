    
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial in children with acute pancreatitis, which
      aims to demonstrate that, compared with the current standard approach of fasting with
      intravenous fluids, early enteral (oral or nasogastric) feeding with standard diet or formula
      will improve the following measures of outcome:

        1. Length of hospital admission.

        2. Serum amylase, lipase, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, urea, creatinine,
           liver function tests, C-reactive protein (biomarker of inflammation), and full blood
           count - routine blood tests performed daily until normalisation of serum lipase or until
           discharge and as directed by treating clinician thereafter.

        3. Weight at presentation and "ready for discharge", and at day 30 post-discharge clinic
           review.

        4. Systemic complications including hemodynamic instability, renal failure, intensive care
           admission.

        5. Analgesic requirement.

        6. Local complications including pancreatic necrosis, abscess, pseudocyst.

        7. Abdominal ultrasound findings during hospital admission (or other abdominal imaging as
           directed by treating clinicians).

      At day 30-60 post-discharge, a routine ultrasound (to assess for localized complication(s)
      e.g. pseudocyst) and clinical follow-up will be undertaken.
