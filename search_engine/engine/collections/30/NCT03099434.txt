      with dialysis, and are therefore reluctant to pursue live donor kidney transplant (LDKT). The
      investigators will conduct a prospective 3-arm randomized controlled trial with two novel
      interventions to increase live donation. Arm 1 includes LDC program and the Facebook app, Arm
      2 includes just the Facebook app, and Arm 3 includes standard of care. The investigators
      primary objective is to demonstrate the the effectiveness of these interventions in
      increasing live donor transplantation rates for candidates with no prior potential live
      donor.
