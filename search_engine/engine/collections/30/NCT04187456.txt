    
      This study is designed as an open-label, 2 treatment period, fixed sequence study in healthy
      male subjects, performed at a single study center.

      The study will comprise:

        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;

        -  Two treatment periods:

      Treatment Period 1 consists of 5 days (Study Days -1 to 4), starting with admission to the
      Study Center on Study Day -1, dosing of midazolam alone on Study Day 1 and ending on Study
      Day 4, after a 3 day washout period.

      Treatment Period 2 consists of 2 days (Study Days 5 and 6), with administration of midazolam
      in combination with savolitinib on Study Day 5. Subjects will be discharged from the Study
      Center on Study Day 6, after the last PK sample is collected.

        -  The Follow up Visit will occur at least 14 days (Study Day 19 or after) after the
           administration of savolitinib in Treatment Period 2.

        -  Subjects will be admitted to the Study Center on Study Day -1, prior to the evening meal
           the night before dosing with midazolam alone (Study Day 1) and will stay in house until
           at least 24 hours after dosing with midazolam in combination with savolitinib (Study Day
           5). Subjects will thus be discharged on Study Day 6, after the last PK sample has been
           collected.

      Each subject will be involved in the study between 21 and approximately 48 days.
