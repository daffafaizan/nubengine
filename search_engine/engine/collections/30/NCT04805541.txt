    
      This is a prospective study to assess the safety and efficacy of EyeCheckup in screening for
      DR.

      This study is a single-center observational study with primary endpoints to determine the
      sensitivity and specificity of EyeCheckup to diabetic retinopathy in the primary care
      setting.

      After exclusions, this study will enroll up to 900 subjects who are diagnosed with diabetes
      by the endocrinology polyclinic and meet the eligibility criteria. Participants who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be recruited after obtaining written informed consent from primary
      health care providers. Subjects will undergo fundus photography per, Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) cleared, ophthalmic cameras (product code: HKI). Images will be taken
      according to a specific EyeCheckup imaging protocol provided to the ophthalmic camera
      operator and then analyzed by the EyeCheckup device.

      The photography protocol consists of two images of the ocular fundus (one optic disc nerve
      centered, one macula centered), obtained from both eyes of enrolled participants.

      After the retinal images taken from ophthalmic cameras (product code: HKI), images are
      analyzed with EyeCheckup and a scan report is prepared. If it is necessary to enlarge the
      pupils, eye enlarging eye drops are applied and wait 15-30 minutes. This information is
      noted. DR is diagnosed by examination by a retina specialist with the captured images.
      EyeCheckup success rate is calculated by comparing both reports.

      The secondary purposes of the study are to prove that our product detects the presence of
      diabetic retinopathy.
