      (CTRC) medical staff and will include a physical exam by a clinician, anthropometry, and a
      chemical and lipid profile, liver and renal function. Participants meet with a registered
      dietitian to determine their caloric energy requirements and identify food preferences. The
      interview includes surveying the subject's physical activity over the previous 7 days.

      Subjects will undergo baseline microdialysis experiments to examine the function of the blood
      vessels in the skin microcirculation. Subjects will also go through a baseline assessment of
      conduit vessel endothelial and vascular smooth muscle function with brachial artery
      flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), and sublingual nitroglycerin. Following baseline
      experiments, subjects participate in 4 controlled feeding periods, each 8 days in duration.
      The controlled feeding periods are assigned in a randomized order. At the end of each 8-day
      controlled dietary period, subjects will repeat microdialysis experiments, brachial artery
      FMD, and responsiveness to sublingual nitroglycerin.
