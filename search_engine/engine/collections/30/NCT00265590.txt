      in patients with aniridia and attempt to make a phenotype-genotype correlation. Specifically,
      the study will determine whether specific mutations are more prevalent in aniridic patients
      who have a predominant involvement of the corneal epithelium. A blood sample will be
      collected from each individual for isolation of DNA and the PAX6 gene will be sequenced and
      analyzed. The principal investigator is Brian Brooks and the associated investigators are
      James Fielding Hejtmancik at the OMGS/OGVFB/NEI and Chi-Chao Chan, LI/NEI. Associate
      Investigators at collaborating institutions include Edward Holland (University of Cincinnati)
      and Ali Djalilian (University of Illinois, Chicago).
