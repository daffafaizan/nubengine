      potential new infections. There are an estimated 350 million carriers of HBV in the world. In
      China, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 10-15% of the population are
      chronically infected. In North America and Northern Europe, infection and carrier rates are
      much lower, usually below 1%. Intermediate carrier rates of 1-5% are found in Southern Europe
      (e.g., Italy, Greece and Spain), parts of South and Central America, the Middle East and
      Japan. Persistent infection develops in over 90% of perinatally infected children and in
      3-10% of people who become infected after the age of 6 years. Worldwide, it has been
      estimated that more than one million people die annually due to HBV-related end stage
      diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The goal of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B is to reduce a patient's risks for progressive
      liver disease through prolonged suppression or eradication of HBV infection and to arrest or
      ameliorate HBV-related liver damage.
