      vaccination was given to toddlers in the inpatient unit and the second and third doses will
      be administered on an outpatient basis. A safety evaluation was performed after the first
      dose before enrolling subjects in subsequent cohorts to receive a higher vaccine dose.

      After the study was initiated, its funder, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) made
      significant changes to the PATH Enteric Vaccine Initiative (EVI) portfolio and decided not to
      support the three higher-dose cohorts (Cohort 1, 2, and 3) planned as part of this study.
