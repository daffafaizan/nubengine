      occur in university students. Exercise is beneficial to ameliorate those problems however
      university students are not serious to uptake physical activity. Commercially available
      exergame such as Xbox 360 Kinect is one of the alternatives. This study aims to investigate
      the feasibility and the potential efficacy of using Xbox 360 Kinect game among healthcare
      undergraduate students. A pilot two-armed parallel randomized controlled trial was
      implemented. A total of 36 undergraduate students was recruited and randomly allocated into
      the intervention group (playing Xbox 360 Kinect) or the control group (continue with normal
      daily routine). The intervention group received 30 minutes of Xbox Kinect activity, three
      times per week for six weeks. Information on psychology (DASS-21) and sleep (FOSQ-30) status
      were collected at pre- and post-experiment. The researcher-developed feasibility
      questionnaire was given to the participants in the intervention group at post-experiment.
      Repeated-measures ANOVA analysis was used to investigate within-between group comparison and
      significant value was set at pâ‰¤0.05. The analysis found potential improvement on sleep
      (p=0.039) and psychological health (p=0.002-0.067). The intervention protocol is feasible and
      highly accepted by the participants. Required optimum amount of dosage, sample size and used
      of outcome measures are suggested from the findings. This pilot and feasibility study support
      the use of Xbox 360 Kinect games in practice and to be implemented for future research.
