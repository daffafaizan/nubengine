      study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive a single collagenase injection into the target finger cord on day 0.

      Arm II: Patients receive a single placebo injection as in arm I.

      Both arms: After the 1 month evaluation, patients who are unresponsive to treatment may
      receive monthly injections of collagenase for a maximum of 5 injections.

      Beginning at 1 day after completion of treatment, patients use a joint nighttime extension
      splint for 4 months and perform finger flexion/extension exercises.

      Patients are followed at 1, 7, and 14 days, monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 9
      months, and then annually for 4 years.
