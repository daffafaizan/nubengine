      administered one week apart, were performed on the same day of the week (Tuesday) and time
      (1-5pm). The average temperature inside the building during the trials ranged from 26°C to
      28°C. At first stage (exercise test 1) all athletes performed the Bangsbo Sprint Test (BST)
      to familiarization with the procedure. No interventions or comparators were applied before
      this test. However, at the second and third stages (exercise tests 2 and 3, respectively)
      either a placebo or active PBMT was applied according to randomization. Blood samples were
      collected from the athlete's fingertips prior to stretching and warming-up (baseline), and at
      3, 10, 30 and 60 minutes after BST at each of the three study stages/phase (exercise tests).
      After blood sample collection (to establish baseline), a warm-up comprised of low-intensity
      activities such as dynamic stretches and low-intensity short running were performed by each
      athlete. Following the warm-up and cool down period, either the active or placebo comparator
      was applied to the athlete according to the randomization procedure for the second test. For
      the third test, the other comparator was utilized to complete the cross over design. A quick
      perception of fatigue survey was administered following each test.
