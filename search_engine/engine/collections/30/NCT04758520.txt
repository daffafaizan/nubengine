        1. Test the safety and reliability of the FLOAT device for delivering post-acute motor and
           functional rehabilitation of patients with orthopaedic shoulder dysfunction.

        2. Assess the three different modalities of utilization of the exoskeleton (Passive Mode,
           Learn&Repeat Mode, Transparency Mode).

        3. Evaluate the usability of the device in terms of comfort, adaptability to different
           patients' anthropometrics, general functioning and overall satisfaction.

      Six injured workers with shoulder post-traumatic and post-operative dysfunction will be
      enrolled in a single testing session at the INAIL Rehabilitation Center in Volterra. Pilot
      testing of FLOAT device will focus mainly on the feasibility of implementing the multiple
      operating modes of the new device, recording patients and therapist's feedback. The session
      will last about 3 hours and all exercises will be administered by a trained physical
      therapist supported by a member of the engineering team.

      For Aim 1, Safety and Reliability of the device will be evaluated in terms of the number of
      adverse events and malfunctions occurring during the study session.

      For Aim 2, each modality will be assessed by means of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS),
      The Borg CR10 Scale Perceived Exertion (only for the Transparent mode) and ad-hoc
      clinician-generated questionnaires for both patients and therapists.

      For aim 3, patient and therapist's general evaluation about usability will be detected
      through a final ad-hoc questionnaire.
