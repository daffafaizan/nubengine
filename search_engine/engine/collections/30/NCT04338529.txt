    
      Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-Β ligand
      (RANKL), is a potent antiresorptive agent commonly prescribed in patients with postmenopausal
      osteoporosis. Discontinuation of denosumab results in a rebound response of bone turnover
      markers, which rise above baseline at 3 months and remain elevated until reaching again
      baseline levels approximately 30 months after the last dose. Bone mineral density (BMD) gains
      are also lost and BMD values reach original baseline values after 1-2 years off-treatment, in
      contrast to bisphosphonates, which remain within the skeleton acting for several months or
      even years after discontinuation while preserving most of the BMD gains achieved despite the
      cessation of treatment.

      For the above reasons, current literature recommends that patients who discontinue denosumab
      should continue to receive either intravenous (iv) or oral (peros) bisphosphonate therapy for
      some time. Due to lack of specifically designed studies, the period of treatment with
      bisphosphonates after denosumab discontinuation has been arbitrarily proposed to be 1 to 2
      years. Preservation of BMD gains after denosumab discontinuation has so far been
      demonstrated: (a) with one year of alendronate treatment, in a study designed to investigate
      patients' compliance to treatment, and b) with a single dose of zolendronate 5mg iv in a
      recent study specifically designed to address this question in which BMD levels remained
      stable for the next two years.

      Preventing bone loss, and the reported high risk of multiple vertebral fractures after
      discontinuation of denosumab treatment, is a clinical issue of critical importance raising
      serious concerns to the international scientific community and needs to be addressed.
      Clinical studies specifically designed to investigate both the efficacy of various
      bisphosphonates and the optimal duration of their administration in order to avoid the
      reported adverse effects of denosumab discontinuation are currently lacking.

      This study aims to investigate changes in the BMD of the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck
      (FN) 12 months after transitioning from denosumab to oral alendronate 70 mg in a weekly
      effervescent tablet formulation. Alendronate will be given either for 6 or 12 months
      following Denosumab discontinuation
