      United States (U.S.).

      Up to 780 subjects were planned to be enrolled (i.e. consented) to allow up to 720 subjects
      to be implanted enabling at least 600 subjects to be followed for at least 12-months
      post-implant.

      There are two primary objectives in this study (one safety and one efficacy). The primary
      safety objective of the study is to evaluate major complications related to the Micra system
      or procedure. The primary safety endpoint was pre-specified to be evaluated at 6-months (183
      days) post-implant. The primary efficacy objective, Micra pacing capture thresholds, was also
      pre-specified to be evaluated six months post-implant. This study also has a separate long
      term safety objective that will provide additional long-term safety data following potential
      regulatory submissions.

      All subjects will be followed until official study closure (official study closure is defined
      as when Medtronic and/or FDA requirements have been satisfied per the Clinical
      Investigational Plan and/or by a decision by Medtronic or regulatory authority).

      Additionally, the Micra Accelerometer Sensor Sub-Study (MASS) is being conducted at 4 centers
      already active in the Micra study in Austria, Spain, Hungary and France. Forty (40) subjects
      were enrolled in the Sub-Study, and enrollment in the Sub-Study was complete as of March 31,
      2016. The purpose of the Sub-Study is to test feasibility for future enhancements in the
      Micra device functionalities.

      An algorithm was designed to sense the atrial contraction using the Micra accelerometer.
