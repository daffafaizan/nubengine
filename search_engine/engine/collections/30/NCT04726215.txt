    
      Approximately 50 patients will undergo two research PET/CT scans with [18F]F AraG at two time
      points. Each patient will receive two 5 (+/-10%) mCi doses of [18F]F AraG, one for each
      imaging time point. Eligible subjects will undergo a pre-treatment [18F]F AraG PET/CT scan
      within 7 days prior to treatment, followed by treatment, and an on-treatment [18F]F AraG
      PET/CT within 7-14 days of treatment.

      Objectives:

        -  Quantify [18F]F-AraG uptake in advanced NSCLC tumor (primary, nodal, and metastatic
           sites) at baseline and after 1 dose of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients treated with
           standard of care immunotherapy (as monotherapy or part of combination therapy).

        -  Correlate change in [18F]F AraG uptake in tumor lesions with radiographic response.
