    
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide supervised access at this institution to
      TheraSphere® treatment for a heterogeneous population of patients with unresectable primary
      liver tumors, with the liver being the only dominant site of disease. Based on experience
      gained in previous studies and well-established interventional radiology techniques, this
      protocol allows multiple treatments with TheraSphere® that may be delivered on an inpatient
      or out patient basis. Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or lobar
      treatment delivered as a sequence of treatments approximately 30 - 90 days apart. The
      investigator, working with co-investigators in radiation oncology, interventional radiology
      and nuclear medicine, will develop a specific treatment plan for each patient, based upon the
      presenting condition of the patient, the vascular anatomy, and the desired goal of treatment.
