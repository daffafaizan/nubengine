    
      Primary Objective:

      To determine the 1 year progression-free survival(PFS) rate of the combination of thalidomide
      with gefitinib in patients who harbors EGFR mutations.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the objective response rate and 2 years overall survival of this combination
           therapy;

        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy;

        3. To acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of thalidomide on interleukin-2 level
           in serum.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Thalidomide starting at a dose of 50mg
      QD at night. After one week, increase the dose to 100mg QD at night.

      Aspirin will be administered at 100mg QD continuously. Gefitinib will be administered at
      250mg QD continuously. Maintenance Therapy patients responding to this therapy will be
      maintained with gefitinib„ÄÅthalidomide and aspirin.

      Duration of Therapy

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of
      the following criteria applies:

        1. Disease progression,

        2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

        3. Unacceptable adverse events(s),

        4. Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or

        5. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.
