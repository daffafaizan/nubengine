    
      Primary objective:

      definition of the distribution of intravenously injected ICG in the normal and pathological
      lymph nodes draining the dissected tumor in head and neck cancer patients or in nodes
      recurrences in head and neck cancer

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluation of the ability of NIR fluorescence imaging to determine the tumoral volume,
           specifically the margins of the tumoral tissues (in the operating room and in the
           pathology department)

        -  Analysis of the correlation between ICG fluorescence and tumoral invasion in the
           dissected lymph nodes
