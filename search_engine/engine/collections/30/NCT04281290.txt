    
      The study will be conducted on patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. 20 patients will
      be included in phase I clinical study and additional 20 patients in phase II clinical study
      (or in the extension of the clinical study).

      After surgical resection of pancreatic cancer, the posterior resection surface will be
      treated with purpose to lower disease recurrence rate. Plate electrodes will be used for ECT
      treatment, the electrodes will be placed between choledochal cut-end, truncus celiacus,
      remaining of the pancreas and aortal lymph nodes.

      ECT will be performed within 8-28 min after intravenous in bolus administration of bleomycin
      (15 mg/m2). Triggering of electric pulses will be synchronized with ECG signals, through the
      ECG triggering device AccuSync to avoid delivery of pulses in vulnerable period of the heart.

      All patients will be treated after the procedure has been thoroughly described to them and
      have signed informed consent.
