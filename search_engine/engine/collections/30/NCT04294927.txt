      recommended around the age of 40. This recommendation is based on a 10-40% life-time risk of
      ovarian cancer in this population and disappointing results of ovarian cancer surveillance
      for early detection. Moreover, the mortality rate of ovarian cancer is high. Effects of RRSO
      are a decrease in ovarian cancer risk (80-96%) on one hand and immediate onset of menopause
      and non-cancer related morbidity on the other hand. The fifty percent breast cancer risk
      reduction after RRSO has become disputable in the last years. Based on multiple studies
      showing that most high-grade serous ovarian cancers develop at the distal end of the
      Fallopian tube, an innovative strategy for RRSO has been developed for this study proposal:
      risk-reducing salpingectomy (RRS) with delayed risk-reducing oophorectomy (RRO). However, the
      safety of this strategy has not been proven yet. Before implementing this innovative strategy
      as standard care we need to investigate the long term effects on ovarian cancer incidence.
