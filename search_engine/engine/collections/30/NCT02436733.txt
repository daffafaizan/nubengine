      Patients with early stage MPM will be randomized between

        -  Arm A - immediate surgery: immediate P/D followed by three cycles of chemotherapy
           (pemetrexed 500mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2, both drugs given on day 1, every three
           weeks) for non-progressing patients

        -  Arm B - delayed surgery: three cycles of chemotherapy (same regimen) followed by P/D,
           for non-progressing patients.

      A maximum of four weeks (Â±2 weeks) will be allowed between the baseline tumor assessment and
      the start of treatment (surgery or chemotherapy). Randomization should be done as soon as
      possible after baseline tumor assessment.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the feasibility of immediate P/D
      followed by cisplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy or deferred P/D after cisplatin/pemetrexed
      chemotherapy in patients with early stage MPM.

      The results of this study will allow the LCG to take one of the arms further to a comparative
      study with either no surgery or EPP as control arm. The choice of the comparator will depend
      on the result of a parallel ongoing randomized study in the UK, comparing P/D with no surgery
