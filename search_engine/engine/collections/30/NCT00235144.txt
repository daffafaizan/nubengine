    
      This is a multicenter (up to 35 centers), prospective, randomized double blind study. This
      study has a 2-arm design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx
      VELOCITY stent to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY stent, both mounted on the Raptor Rapid Exchange
      Stent Delivery System. A total of 350 patients will be entered in the study and will be
      randomized on a 1:1 basis. Patients will be either randomized to the sirolimus coated or
      uncoated BX-VELOCITY stent. Patients will be followed at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at
      2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years post-procedure, with all patients undergoing repeat angiography
      at 8 months. Medical resource use during the 5 years follow-up period will be collected and
      analyzed.
