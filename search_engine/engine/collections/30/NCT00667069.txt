    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of event-free survival at 5 years, of immediate
           radio-hormonal therapy immediately after prostatectomy for tumor pT2, R1, pN0, or pNx
           versus radio-hormonal therapy at biochemical relapse.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the metastasis-free survival of these patients.

        -  Compare the acute and late toxicities of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the functional dependence of patients over 75 years old.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (delayed treatment): Patients receive triptorelin intramuscularly on day 1 and
           then 3 months later. Patients also undergo conformal radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week,
           for 7 weeks. Treatment begins at biochemical relapse (PSA is more than 0.2 ng/mL) and
           before PSA is more than 2 ng/mL.

        -  Arm II (immediate treatment): Patients receive treatment as in arm I, but treatment
           begins within 6 months after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.
