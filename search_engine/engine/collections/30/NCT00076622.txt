      one third of these residents are taking antidepressant medications (ADs). Although ADs are
      effective, evidence suggests that they can lead to significant adverse events, including an
      increased risk of falls and bone fractures. Many depressed nursing home residents suffer from
      an initial episode of late-life depression and do not meet guideline-based recommendations
      for maintenance treatment. This study will examine the benefits and risks of long-term AD
      treatment in depressed nursing home residents whose single episode of depression has been in
      continuous remission for at least six months.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue AD treatment.
      Participants will be monitored over a period of one year for recurrence of depression and
      related symptoms, as well as for the occurrence of falls, fractures, and other adverse
      events. Medical chart review, self-reported mood symptoms, and depression scales will be used
      to assess participants.
