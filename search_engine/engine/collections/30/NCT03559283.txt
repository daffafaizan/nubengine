      brain activity are modified in situations requiring significant attentional and cognitive
      demand. fNIRS is an interesting functional neuroimaging technique for studying cortical
      activity when performing a Dual Task (DT). To our knowledge, no studies have examined
      cerebral oxygenation levels in post-stroke patients based on different cognitive loads during
      walking. Understanding cognitive contributions in a dual-task walking situation is necessary
      to providing targeted interventions and preventing falls.

      Patients included in the study will be evaluated in single cognitive task, with two levels of
      difficulty, single walking motor task, and dual task with two levels of cognitive difficulty.
      The fNIRS will record the hemodynamic activity of the prefrontal cortex for the cognitive
      slope and the GAITRite will record the walking parameters.
