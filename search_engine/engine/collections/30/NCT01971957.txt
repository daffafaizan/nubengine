      laboratory investigations of potentially useful biochemical (lipid and protein) markers. Up
      to 50 SLS patients of all ages, gender and ethnic origins will be enrolled. A detailed
      clinical evaluation will be performed to determine the presence and extent of disease
      involving the skin, nervous system and eyes. Clinical testing will include brain magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalography (EEG), neurocognitive
      tests, ophthalmologic examination with retinal photographs and optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), photographs of the skin and tests of cutaneous transepidermal water loss. Laboratory
      investigations will include lipid analyses (e.g. fatty alcohols, farnesol, fatty acids, ether
      glycerolipids, etc.) of blood, skin and urine; proteomic analysis of skin (stratum corneum);
      and measurements of leukocyte fatty alcohol and farnesol oxidation. A skin biopsy (optional)
      will be obtained for electron microscopy, measurement of lanthanum perfusion (transepidermal
      water loss), and/or establishing keratinocyte cultures. Correlations between clinical
      abnormalities and laboratory measurements will be tested to identify the most useful
      biomarkers for future diagnostic and therapeutic studies. To characterize the progression of
      phenotypic features over time, patients <6 years of age will be followed yearly and patients
      â‰¥6 years of age will be followed every 3 years. In addition, a SLS patient registry will be
      established as a resource for future investigations in SLS.
