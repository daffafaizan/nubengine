      occurs behind an intact tympanic membrane. Primary acquired cholesteatoma: looks like a
      limited diverticulum of the pars flaccida with little or no history of otorrhea. Secondary
      acquired cholesteatoma: develops with posterosuperior perforations in eardrum and expansion
      of the disease process into the antrum, mastoid, attic and middle ear. Granulation tissue,
      polyps and foul- smelling otorrhea are common findings in this type
