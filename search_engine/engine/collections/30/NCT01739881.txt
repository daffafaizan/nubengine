        1. To improve diagnostic yield of pulmonary nodule or mass by using combined approach of
           navigation bronchoscopy and EBUS.

        2. To determine if characteristic features of EBUS and confocal microendoscopy exist as
           well as VOC patterns in alveolar and exhaled gas that can aid in discriminating
           malignant pulmonary nodule or mass from benign etiology by correlating with pathology.

        3. To identify VOC patterns specific for lung cancer by correlating VOC from directly
           sampled alveolar gas and exhaled breath with pathology. Exhaled breath VOC signature may
           complement CT in screening population at risk.
