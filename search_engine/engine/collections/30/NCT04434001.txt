      The two groups will receive the same priming solution (containing Red Blood Cells and albumin
      5%) and heparin/protamine management. In both groups coagulation will be assessed with
      rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM - EXTEM, INTEM, HEPTEM and FIBTEM tests) after heparin
      antagonization. In case of bleeding, coagulopathies will be treated differently:

        -  in the ZEPLAST group, fibrinogen deficiency (FIBTEM Maximum Clot Firmness MCF < 8 mm)
           will be treated with 30 mg/kg of concentrated fibrinogen; low thrombin generation (EXTEM
           Clotting Time CT > 100 s) will be treated with 20 mg/kg of prothrombin complex
           concentrate;

        -  in the control group, coagulopathies will be treated with 10-20 ml/kg of FFP. In case of
           refractory bleeding, PCC and fibrinogen can be administered as a rescue treatment.

      Further ROTEM tests will be performed at 24 and 48 hours post surgery. Outcome parameters
      will be collected at the same timepoints.
