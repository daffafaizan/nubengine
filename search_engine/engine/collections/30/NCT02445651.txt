      NAC, which is a strong antioxidant that increases brain glutathione, which may be beneficial
      in PD. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It
      is a common over-the-counter supplement and also is available as an injectable pharmaceutical
      that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory studies have displayed
      some benefits to use of NAC, such as its potential to counteract intracellular damage that
      leads to dopaminergic neuron death. It also has the potential to reduce markers of oxidative
      damage, protect against dopamine cell death from MPTP toxicity, and to increase glutathione
      in blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in PD patients.The second arm
      will be a waitlist control receiving standard PD care. It should be noted that both arms will
      receive standard PD care which will be augmented with NAC.
