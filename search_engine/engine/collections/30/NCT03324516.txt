      circular aneurysms, suprasellar lesions, and medial sphenoid wing tumors (1,2). A curvilinear
      incision from the midline widows peak and extending laterally to 1 cm anterior to the tragus
      of the ear, terminating within a skin crease, with preservation of the superficial temporal
      artery if possible. The temporalis fascia is encountered and divided. Either the entire
      temporalis muscle can be elevated or a cuff of temporalis muscle can be left on the cranium
      to facilitate closure and suspend the temporalis muscle. Subperiosteal dissection of the
      muscle is performed and the craniotomies are then accomplished.

      Reconstruction of the pterional approach can be accomplished with bony fixation of the bone
      flap. However, the TMS can be performed by:

        1. Resuspension of the temporalis muscle to the cuff of muscle left on the temporal crest
           or

        2. Suturing the temporalis muscle directly to one of the bone plates that is used to for
           fixation.

      The purpose of this prospective study is see if traditional techniques to the closure and
      temporal muscle suspension (TMS) after the pterional approach will show any differences in
      post-operative temporal hollowing (TH).
