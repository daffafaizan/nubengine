      pellet-type extracellular matrix-associated autologous chondrocytes (CartiLife®) compared
      with microfracture surgery in adults with articular cartilage defects due to trauma or
      degeneration of the knee. It is hypothesized that CartiLife® treatment will demonstrate
      structural regeneration and improvement in function and pain at Week 48 compared to baseline.
