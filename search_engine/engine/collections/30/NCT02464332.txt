      Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to
      participate.

      This is a two part study:

      Part 1 - Dose Finding: Subjects will be required to arrive at the phase 1 unit for dosing 2-3
      days prior to the planned surgical excision. Two dose levels of BLZ-100 (3 mg and 12 mg) will
      be evaluated in a total of 6 subjects with a 2-3 day post-dose imaging interval (also defined
      as the Intermediate Imaging interval).

      Part 2 - Imaging Interval Assessment: The BLZ-100 dose to be evaluated in Part 2 will be
      determined by the Protocol Steering Committee following completion of Part 1. In Part 2, up
      to 15 additional subjects will be randomized into one of three imaging interval groups (up to
      6 subjects per group): Early Imaging (within 1 day post BLZ-100 dose), Intermediate Imaging
      (2-3 days post BLZ-100 dose), and Late Imaging (4-7 days post BLZ-100 dose). Subjects will be
      required to arrive at the phase 1 unit for dosing between 1 and 7 days prior to planned
      surgical excision, depending on which imaging interval they are randomized to.

      Following dosing, all subjects will be monitored for safety.
