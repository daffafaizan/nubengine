      and quadratus lumborum type 2 for cesarean delivery.

      The transversus abdominus plane(TAP) block provides sensory block from T6 to L1 for lower
      abdominal surgeries.

      Quadratous lumborum type 2 block, the injection is posterior to the quadratus lumborum
      muscle. This method has the advantage of a more superficial point of injection with better
      ultrasonographic resolution.

      Only one RCT was done in this context by Kalpana Verma and his colleagues comparing quadratus
      lumborum type 2 and posterior transversus abdominus plane block. That shows marked
      discrepancy with time to first analgesic request from the quadratus lumborum block in other
      abdominal surgeries
