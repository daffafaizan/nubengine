      extraction solutions. Each installation will build a local anonymous database of GP
      consultations extracted from the local electronic patient record (EPR) system. These
      anonymous data records will be used to produce local disease statistics before they are
      exported to a centralized server available in the Norwegian Health network. The centralized
      server will produce daily reports about the epidemiological situation in the patient
      population. We will combine the syndromic data from the GP offices with data from the
      microbiology laboratories on the hospitals that covers the study areas. The epidemiological
      data will be made available to the intervention areas in the study through web based and
      customized client applications.

      By using data extracted from the GP offices EPR databases and the microbiology laboratories
      we will investigate the study hypothesis.
