    
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a severely debilitating disease associated with stiffness and
      pain in the knee joint, and with a loss of function. Hyaluronic acid (HA) injections are
      incorporated into non-surgical standard of care for knee OA patients and have been proven to
      relieve pain in patients who have not received symptomatic relief with other knee OA
      interventions. HA allows synovial fluid to act as a lubricant and shock absorber for joints,
      and although this is encouraging ground to advocate for the use of HA treatment in knee OA
      patients, these properties have yet to be proven in a controlled clinical trial setting.
      Therefore, we are undertaking this study to observe whether the physiological adaptation in
      the OA knee joint, initiated by HA injection, will result in biomechanical improvements in
      human knee OA patients, specifically walking mechanics.
