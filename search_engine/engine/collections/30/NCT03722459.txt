      studies to determine whether they can provide better, faster and more useful information for
      clinical diagnosis. In this study, the investigators propose to apply MR Fingerprinting and
      evaluate its performance for different diseases. These include, but are not limited to,
      diseases in the liver, kidney, cardiac, pancreas etc. The investigators hypothesize that the
      quantitative MR Fingerprinting imaging technique will lead to improved tissue
      characterization and diagnosis.
