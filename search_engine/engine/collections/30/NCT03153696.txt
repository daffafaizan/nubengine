    
      The goal of this study is to assess the Cellie Coping Kit for Injury intervention feasibility
      and initial efficacy.

      Aim 1: Intervention Feasibility Assess intervention feasibility (implementation, cost,
      fidelity).

      Aim 2: Intervention Efficacy (Mechanisms of Action and Health Outcomes): Conduct initial
      efficacy evaluation of the Cellie Intervention on mechanisms of action (adherence and coping
      behaviors) and health outcomes (physical recovery, HRQOL, emotional health).

      Hypotheses: At 6-week follow-up (T2), compared to a Treatment as Usual (TAU) control group,
      parents in the intervention group will report greater adherence to medical discharge
      instructions (H2.1) and encourage their child to use a higher number of adaptive coping
      strategies (cognitive, active, support seeking; H2.2); children in the intervention group
      will generate a greater number of adaptive coping strategies (H2.3).

      Hypotheses: At a 12-week follow-up (T3), compared to TAU, children in the intervention group
      will report better HRQOL and emotional health (H2.4); parents in the intervention group will
      report better child HRQOL and child emotional health (H2.5). Objective injury recovery scores
      will be higher for the intervention group (H2.6).

      Method: 80 children with injury and one parent per child will participate in a pilot RCT with
      a wait-list control design. Participants will complete baseline assessments of targeted study
      variables prior to randomization (40 to the intervention; 40 to usual care) and then repeat
      measures 6 (T2), 12 (T3), and 18 weeks (T4) later. Those in the immediate intervention
      condition will initiate the intervention following the T1 assessment. Those in the wait-list
      condition will initiate the intervention following the T3 assessment.
