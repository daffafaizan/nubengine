    
      Induced Hypothermia Protocol for comatose patient from CPR Core temperature: 34.9℃ within 30
      min, 33.5℃ within 120min and 33℃ for 12-24 Hours

        -  Decrease temperature in 0.9℃/hour

        -  CVP monitoring

        -  the infusions were temporarily stopped if CVP increased > 5 mm Hg over 5 mins.

        -  Continuous temperature monitoring with a rectal probe or bladder catheter

        -  One must be vigilant to avoid k+, Ma2+, and P depletion during and immediately after the
           infusion, particularly given the increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia that occurs with
           induced hypothermia.

        -  An evaluation of neurologic status

        -  IV Dormicum (midazolam 2 to 5 mg或0.125 mg/kg/hr initially) and fentanyl (0.002 mg/kg/hr
           initially), Pavulon (pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg) every 2 hours for a total of 32 hours.

        -  ABG values were used to adjust the ventilator to maintain PaO2>100 mm Hg and PaCO2<40 mm
           Hg.

        -  MAP: 90 ~ 100 mm Hg

        -  Lidocaine bolus (1 mg/kg) followed by an infusion (2 mg/min for 24 hours)

        -  K+> 4.0 mmol/L

        -  RI infusion < 180 mg/deciliter (10 mmol per liter)

        -  Antibiotics with β-lactam；Aspirin

        -  The temperature was maintained at 33℃ for 24 hours from the start of cooling, followed
           by passive rewarming, which we expected would occur over a period of 8 hours, followed
           by active rewarming.
