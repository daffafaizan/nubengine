      Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome describing a loss of physical and/or cognitive
      functionality which leads to a decreased resistance to stressors such as operations or
      illness. It is associated with increased number of falls, exacerbations, adverse health
      outcomes and a higher mortality (7-10).

      Frail LTx-candidates have a higher risk of being delisted before transplantation, adverse
      transplantation outcomes and a higher one-year-mortality compared to non-frail candidates.
      However, studies show that frailty can be decreased by physical training (11-13). A recent
      prospective cohort study in the UK observed a significant decrease of frailty in patients
      with COPD participating at an inpatient rehabilitation program (5). Singer et al. (USA) could
      detect a significant decrease of frailty by a homebased training for LTx-candidates (6).

      Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a three-week inpatient rehabilitation
      program on physical frailty (measured by Short Physical Performance Battery) in patients
      after LTx. Additionally, other functional measures as well as the cognitive, social and
      psychological state will be assessed in order to better understand the complex syndrome of
      frailty and the effects of rehabilitation.

      Design:

      This study is a prospective observational trial. The number of 30 participants is based on a
      sample size calculation. Assessments will take place in the beginning of rehabilitation
      program and at discharge.
