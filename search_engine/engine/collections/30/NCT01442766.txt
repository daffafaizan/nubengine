      disability. Recovery has been shown in animal models to be dependent upon adequate levels of
      acetylcholine within the brain - which in stroke is likely to be deficient. This is because
      acetylcholine-producing nerve cells in the brain are often damaged by strokes.

      Consequently, the investigators hypothesise that recovery may be improved by boosting
      acetylcholine levels in the brain - that can be readily achieved by treating with donepezil.
