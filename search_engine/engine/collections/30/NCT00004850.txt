      as having antibody to the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). This represented 72,000 of the
      estimated 12 million annual U.S. blood donations. By investigating a cohort of anti-HCV
      positive donors, this study aims to determine: 1) the primary routes of HCV transmission in
      an asymptomatic donor population; 2) the relationship between anti-HCV and evidence of acute
      or chronic liver disease; 3) the infectivity of anti-HCV positive individuals as judged by
      measurement of HCV RNA and by investigation of their sexual partners and prior blood
      recipients; 4) the chronic consequences of HCV infection. The study does not directly provide
      treatment for HCV infection. Enrollment is limited to persons identified as anti-HCV positive
      at the time of blood donation and persons from any source found to have clinical or molecular
      evidence of acute hepatitis C virus infection. Although the primary goal of this study is to
      investigate HCV infection and its outcomes, we occasionally encounter blood donors or NIH
      patients who are infected with HBV or who have HCV-HBV coinfection. We will enroll such
      patients to better understand HBV infection and to compare outcomes in those who are HCV
      monoinfected, HBV monoinfected or who have HCV-HBV coinfection.
