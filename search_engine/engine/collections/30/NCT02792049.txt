      using a standard and modified bag valve mask (BVM) device in a manikin airway model. Data was
      collected from July 2015 through October 2015 at the San Antonio Military Medical Center.
      Emergency medicine providers (physicians, physician assistants, residents, nurses, medics)
      were randomized to device order. Prior to participation each participant filled out a survey
      indicating their job status, gender, years of medical experience, and experience level with
      BVM ventilation. Hand grip strength and size (length, width, span) were measured. Each
      participant was then asked to provide BVM ventilation using the assigned devices at a rate of
      10 breaths per minute for 3 minutes for a total of 30 breaths. Tidal volume of each delivered
      breath was recorded in milliliters. After a 3 minute rest period, testing was repeated with
      the second device. After ventilation with each device, participants completed an anonymous
      questionnaire that used a Likert scale to assess perceived qualities of the modified device
      including ease of use, ability to provide a superior mask seal, willingness to use in an
      emergency situation, and overall preference between the two devices. Each participant served
      as his/her own control.
