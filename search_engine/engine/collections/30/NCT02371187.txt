    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, repeated measures study. 30 sedentary
      adults will be recruited for participation and randomly assigned to one of two 12-week
      treatments: 1) supervised endurance exercise training 4 days per week plus daily oral
      administration of Dapagliflozin; 2) supervised endurance exercise training 4 days per week
      plus daily oral administration of placebo. Prior to and following completion of the treatment
      the following dependent variables will be quantified: a) maximal aerobic capacity; b)
      substrate utilization during standardized low-moderate intensity exercise; c) skeletal muscle
      aerobic enzyme activity; d) body composition; and, e) oral glucose tolerance, fasting glucose
      and insulin resistance.

      The dose of Dapagliflozin will begin as 5 mg/day for the first 14-days. In the absence of
      complications, side effects, or unfavorable reactions, the dose will then increase to 10
      mg/day for the remainder of the study.
