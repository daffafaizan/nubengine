      induce positive affect and self-affirmation. At the start of the study all patients in
      conjunction with their physicians will select a program of mild to moderate physical activity
      or exercise to be adopted and maintained on a routine basis. Patients also will complete the
      Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index. Patients then will be divided into four
      groups according to the intervention they receive: 1) positive affect; 2) self-affirmation;
      3) positive affect and self-affirmation; 4) control. The main outcome is the change in the
      Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index scores from enrollment to 4 weeks.
