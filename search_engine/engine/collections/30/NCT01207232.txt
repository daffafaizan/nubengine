      Past psychology research has demonstrated that prompting people to form an implementation
      plan of the form, "When situation x arises, I will implement response y," increases
      attainment of desired goals because the desired behavior is linked to a concrete future
      moment. This type of planning prompt is a "nudge" in the direction of desired behavior that
      can be implemented at minimal expense and does not restrict individual autonomy. We conducted
      a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to test whether a low-cost planning intervention could
      increase influence vaccination rates. We show that planning prompts can be successfully
      applied to improve health behaviors.
