      young children living in areas of intense malaria transmission due to interactions with the
      immunologi-cal development has now been refuted in a number of studies including the D4
      study. The highly controversial question remains how African programmes can best reach a
      sustainable high coverage with ITNs in young children and pregnant women. Against this
      background it is planned to implement a cluster randomised controlled trial in Nouna Health
      District in Burkina Faso. Twenty-two peripheral health centres and their catchment areas will
      be randomised to (1) ITN provision to the general population through social marketing and (2)
      ITN provision to the general population through social marketing plus free provision to all
      pregnant women through antenatal services. The primary outcomes are ITN coverage in
      households and ITN use during pregnancy and infancy.
