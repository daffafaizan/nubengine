    
      50-75 years-old subjects participating in the regional screening program undergoing their
      first colonoscopy following a positive immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT) and
      meeting all eligibility criteria are randomised 1:1 to LCI (LCI group) or WLI (WL) during
      insertion and withdrawal phase of colonoscopy. A randomisation list for each participating
      center was produced by the coordinating center via computer-generated treatment code list.
      Randomisation is stratified by gender, age (50-60, 61-729 years) and screening history (first
      vs subsequent test) through an online centralised study database.All procedures are performed
      with a high-definition ELUXEO 700 series videocolonscopes with or without magnification
      (EC-760R, EC-760ZP, FUJIFILM Co., Tokyo).

      The primary outcome measure is the ADR, defined as the proportion of participants with at
      least one adenoma (per-patient analysis).
