      repair of aortic valve stenosis and/or insufficiency. CardioCel is a cardiovascular patch
      manufactured with the so called ADAPTÂ® technology. The ADAPT technology uses bovine
      spongiform encephalopathy-free pericardium which is processed in several ways to make it
      biocompatible with human tissue. CardioCel should provide an off the shelf material solution
      for tri-leaflet repair surgery due to its functional attributes, low propensity for post
      implant calcification, and overall biocompatibility. As a result adverse events and
      complications associated with the autologous pericardium repair surgery are mitigated.

      In this study patients suffering from moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis and/or aortic
      insufficiency will be included.

      In this study 80 patients will be enrolled in up to 7 centers in Europe and the US. The
      expected study duration is 36 months; 12 months of recruitment and 24 months follow-up.

      CardioCel is US FDA cleared for the repair of cardiac and vascular defects, including
      intra-cardiac defects; septal defects, valve and annulus repair, great vessel reconstruction,
      peripheral vascular reconstruction, suture line buttressing and pericardial closure.
