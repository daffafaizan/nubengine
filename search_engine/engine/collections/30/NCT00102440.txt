      receiving prior urate-lowering therapy underwent a 2-week washout period prior to
      randomization. Subjects were then randomized to one of three treatment groups: febuxostat 80
      milligram (mg), febuxostat 120 mg, or allopurinol 300 mg. Naproxen (250 mg twice daily) or
      colchicine (0.6 mg once daily) was provided for prophylaxis of acute gout flares during the
      washout period and the first 8 weeks of double-blind treatment.
