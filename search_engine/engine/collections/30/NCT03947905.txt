      modern health care systems. It is easy to speculate that some of this dissatisfaction is
      associated with travel, wait times and other issues that arise during routine clinic visits.
      The authors of recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible and feasible to conduct
      many routine visits remotely. It is our belief that virtual health assessments and treatment
      plans (VHAT) conducted remotely can be as effective, perhaps be more efficient and increase
      patient satisfaction when compared to regular physical health assessments and treatment plans
      (PHAT). Physicians want to provide optimal health care; however, in geographically isolated
      areas such as some locations in West Virginia that can be a challenge. It seems reasonable to
      believe that monitoring patients with telehealth technology, collecting on-going real time
      data and conducting VHAT can provide high quality health care for patients. It can also help
      to classify health risk, increase patient and medical staff satisfaction, decrease staff time
      for visits, while at the same time increase the efficiency of the follow-up process. The
      investigators plan to compare the physician assessments and future treatment plans made using
      VHAT to those made after PHAT. It is believed that VHAT assessments will be in agreement with
      those made with PHAT.
