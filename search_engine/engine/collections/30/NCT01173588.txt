      development. The most common probiotics are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species.
      Bifidobacteria spp are dominant in the intestinal microflora and are considered to be
      beneficial to the host, for this reason research efforts have focused on increasing their
      proportion in the intestinal microflora through oral administration of mixtures containing
      bifidobacteria or oral supplementation with prebiotics. An important limitation for the
      effectiveness of oral probiotics is that they might be destroyed during digestion in the
      gastrointestinal tract therefore and adequate vehicle could improve its potential benefits.
      Yogurt is a suitable vehicle for the administration of bifidobacteria, due to its
      physicochemical properties, such as pH and nutrients content, as well as the organoleptic
      properties that contribute to its increasing consumption. Thus simultaneous administration of
      probiotics and prebiotics in a suitable vehicle could act synergistically and may have
      potential for improving gut health. Few clinical trials have been performed using prebiotics
      and probiotics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the consumption of yogurt
      added with bifidobacteria and soluble fiber on gastrointestinal function of healthy adults. A
      product as herein described is expected to improve gastrointestinal function and maintain the
      intestinal microflora balance of healthy subjects and perhaps of patients with altered bowel
      functions.
