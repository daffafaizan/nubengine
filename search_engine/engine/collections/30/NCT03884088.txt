      These tests are utilized to assess both static and dynamic balance. However, sufficient
      research has not been conducted to decide which subjective balance test is more sensitive
      than the other tests. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare of sensitivity of the
      subjective balance tests with an objective system.
