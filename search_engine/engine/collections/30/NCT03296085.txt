      study. Clinicians will include attending physicians from any specialty, residents, medical
      students, physician assistants, physician assistant students, nurses, certified nurse
      practitioners, and certified nurse practitioner students.

      Once patients and clinicians have been recruited, the research team will maintain a list of
      the patients and a grid of which clinicians are to examine which patients. Each clinician
      will be given a data collection sheet, listing the patients' room numbers, and a grid for
      recording results for each of the patient's affected limb(s). The first data collection sheet
      (before instruction on the quantitative method) will just show a blank free text field so
      that clinicians can record their results as they normally do.

      After instruction in the novel quantitative technique, the clinicians will receive another
      data collection sheet now indicating the intent to have the clinicians record their findings
      in millimeters.

      The expectation is that a minimum of 6 examiners will determine the extent of edema on at
      least 38 limbs. If possible, the research will continue until approximately 100 limbs have
      been examined by a total of at least 10 to 20 clinicians.
