        1. Obtain a 3ml syringe made by the Baystate Pharmacy which will contain either sterile 70%
           ethanol solution or 10 units/ml heparin flush solution. Randomization into study groups
           will be performed by the pharmacy in patient blocks of 10. Treating physician and nurses
           will be blinded to patient group assignment. Syringes will be labeled "70%
           ethanol/heparin lock Study Solution"

        2. Cleanse Hands

        3. Use aseptic Technique throughout procedure

        4. Clean injection cap/posi-flow cap with alcohol for 30 seconds and let dry

        5. Unclamp the catheter and gently flush with normal saline to ensure patency of the
           catheter

        6. Instill ethanol/heparin lock into the catheter to fill volume

             -  Broviac Single Lumen 4.2 Fr (ID 0.7) Dose 0.8ml

             -  Broviac Single Lumen 6.6 Fr (ID 1mm) Dose 0.8ml

             -  Med-comp Single Lumen Catheter Dose 1.2ml

             -  Hickman Double Lumen 7 Fr Distal (ID 1mm) Dose 1.2ml

             -  Hickman Double Lumen 9 Fr Proximal (ID 0.7) Dose 1.2ml

             -  Med-comp Double Lumen 8 or 10 Fr Dose 1.2ml

             -  Port-a-cath- Any Port (including priming tubing) Dose 1.9ml

        7. Clamp the catheter

        8. Label the locked lumen with the provided label so that med is not flushed through the
           catheter

        9. Let ethanol dwell in catheter continuously for 4 hours

       10. When ethanol has dwelled for 4 hours, withdraw and discard the lock solution

       11. The above procedure should be repeated daily for 5 consecutive days

       12. The above procedure should be repeated to each lumen of the central venous catheter
           daily if there are multiple lumens
