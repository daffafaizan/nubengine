      characteristics and work characteristics of shift nurses and occupational burnout, sleep
      quality and physical and mental health. Use " acupressure " as an intervention to compare the
      status of shift nurses before and after intervention and to track after interventional
      therapy, 1, 2, and 3 months of longitudinal results. Use the "Smart Care VIP bracelet" to
      detect physical and mental conditions (psychological stress, physical fatigue) to assess the
      applicability of the Smart Care VIP bracelet as a "Shift Care Staff Sleep Quality, Physical
      and Mental Health and Occupational Burnout Management System" and evaluate effectiveness, and
      establishment of an effective management system.

      nursing staff generally has its efficacy, but the lack of research at proves that acupressure
      is used by nursing staff to improve sleep quality and improve occupational burnout. It is
      expected to be from May to December 2020. The nursing staff of a medical center in Taipei
      will be selected for stratified sampling. The conditions for receiving the case are shift
      nurses who have served in the institution for more than one year. Subjective sleep is
      assessed using Epworth sleepiness scale. The objective part is to use the "Smart Care VIP
      Bracelet" to measure sleep time; Chinese version of the Chinese Health Questionnaire-12
      (CHQ-12) and occupational burnout scale questionnaire as a tool for discussion. It is planned
      to randomly assign shift nurses to 42 acupressure groups and control group (sham), and use
      activity record (Smart Care VIP bracelet) to monitor and record fatigue Index and stress
