      2016; Merrick et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2014) New technology now allows for fusion of MRI
      images with TPM devices, allowing for targeting of cancerous-appearing lesions on MRI. Such
      technology that fuses MRI-imaging with TRUS biopsy has become routine in U.S. clinical
      practice, with improved cancer detection rates as compared with standard TRUS.(Ahmed et al.,
      2017; Robertson, Emberton, & Moore, 2013)

      This randomized trial will compare the safety and efficacy of TPM versus TRUS biopsies
      performed in the outpatient setting. Men will be randomized to receiving either TPM or TRUS
      targeted biopsy. All men will receive a urine culture within 2 weeks of biopsy and will be
      started on antibiotic prophylaxis prior to biopsy in accordance with AUA antimicrobial
      prophylaxis guidelines. Men with a positive urine culture will be treated with
      culture-specific antibiotics and must have a documented negative urine culture prior to
      biopsy.
