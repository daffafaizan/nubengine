      rise in prevalence. For this reason, there is a need for a better understanding of the
      mechanisms of allergic diseases and novel insights into modulating allergic inflammation.
      CD4+ Th2-type lymphocytes seems to be central to the pathogenesis of allergic disease, as the
      levels of these cells and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) are elevated in the airways of
      allergic asthma patients. The unifying hypothesis of this project is that understanding the
      mechanisms that determine the critical balance of effector and regulatory allergen-specific T
      cell activity in asthma will lead to new approaches for inducing allergen-specific tolerance
      and new therapeutic strategies for asthma.
