      2008) however they do not completely alleviate symptoms. This new study will therefore assess
      the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei LP-33 in the management of nasal and ocular symptoms,
      in addition to H1-antihistamines treatment. The main objective is to evaluate the effect of
      Lactobacillus paracasei LP-33 on quality of life. Additionally allergic rhinitis symptoms
      (nasal and eye symptoms) and immunological parameters will be evaluated, before and during
      the supplementation. Lactobacillus paracasei LP-33 is targeting the general population and
      improving quality of life of people sensitized to allergens. The study will be conducted in
      Europe on adult subjects with persistent allergic rhinitis.
