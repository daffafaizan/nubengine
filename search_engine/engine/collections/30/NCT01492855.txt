      incidence rate of up to 18 meniscal lesions per 10.000 subjects per year in Denmark. The
      meniscus may tear as a result of knee trauma or it may tear spontaneously due to aging and
      degenerative processes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in the
      diagnosis of meniscal lesions with documented high sensitivity and specificity. Meniscal
      lesion symptoms vary from reduction in knee function with decreased muscle strength and
      difficulties in performing strenuous activities involving knee flexion and rotation to pain,
      effusion locking and, giving way.
