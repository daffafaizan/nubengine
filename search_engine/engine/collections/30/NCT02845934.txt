    
      The patients eligible for this study will already be hospitalized with repeated monitoring of
      clinical and biological parameters.

      Participation in the study will result in an additional sampling of blood (estimated volume 6
      mL for each sampling) on day of suspicion of the mucormycosis and then twice a week up to a
      maximum of 8 weeks.

      vials will be added to the routine sampling of these patients (ie, at the time of routine
      sampling for galactomannan antigemia), and no new sampling procedure will be required.
