    
      This is a Phase 2, controlled study of BIO-11006 peptide given in addition to Gemcitabine and
      Docetaxel (GemTax) in the treatment of patients with advanced osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma
      with lung metastases. Patients will receive BIO-11006 in addition to GemTax chemotherapy,
      which is a current institutional treatment option for recurrent Osteosarcoma and Ewings's
      Sarcoma. The BIO-11006 inhalation solution will be given by mouth inhalation twice daily.
      BIO-11006 will be given during the first three cycles and then will be stopped. Patients will
      continue on GemTax for up to 6 additional cycles and will be clinically assessed before every
      cycle and have standard-of-care imaging assessments after cycle 3, 6 and 9. If the patient
      shows lung progression (either clinical or on imaging) at any point after cycle 4 has been
      given, but had shown at least a partial response during the tumor assessment after cycle 3,
      BIO-11006 may be re-started at the discretion of the investigator and continued for the
      duration of the GemTax treatment. Subjects will be followed for disease status during routine
      clinical follow-ups for 9 months post the end of study treatment. The trial will be conducted
      at a single site.
