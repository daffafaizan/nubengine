      benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) often have
      symptoms including urinary frequency and urgency. ABs and 5-ARIs may improve the obstructive
      voiding symptoms but not necessarily the storage symptoms.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for 6
      months in an open label fashion. Those patients who continue to report storage urinary
      symptoms, will be randomized to receive dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for an additional one
      year together with double-blind tolterodine ER 4 mg or matched tolterodine ER placebo once
      daily.
