      swelling and warmth. Over the past 10 years, advancements in biotechnology have
      revolutionized RA therapeutics with biologically-derived immunomodulating compounds.
      TNF-alpha inhibitors constitute the largest class of these new biologic therapies. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness two TNF inhibitors, etanercept and
      adalimumab, on memory B lymphocytes (B-cells) in the peripheral blood of participants with
      RA.

      This study will last 24 weeks. Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment
      groups. Participants in one group will receive a dose of etanercept once every week for 24
      weeks. Participants in the other group will receive a dose of adalimumab once every 2 weeks
      for 24 weeks.

      This study consists of seven study visits after randomization and will occur at study entry
      and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Blood collection will occur at all study visits. A written
      participant assessment, vital signs, and physical exam will occur at study entry and Weeks 12
      and 24. Follow-up calls to assess safety are scheduled for Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 20.

      Additionally, participants will be offered the opportunity to enter one of four sub-studies
      as mentioned in the brief summary above: B Cell Kinetic Sub-Study, Vaccine Response
      Sub-Study, Tonsil Biopsy Sub-Study, and Synovial Biopsy Sub-Study. More information on these
      sub-studies is in the protocol.
