    
      Patients with pain and/or nausea are enrolled in the Emergency Department (ED). They are
      given either oxycodone, hydrocodone, or ondansetron at the discretion of the Emergency
      Department (ED) provider or the triage nurse by triage protocol. Detailed prescription, over
      the counter, herbal, supplement, and illicit drug ingestion histories are taken from the
      patient or their health care proxy. Serial visual analogue scales are captured prior to study
      drug administration then between 30 and 90 minutes following drug administration.
