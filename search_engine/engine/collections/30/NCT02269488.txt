      administration is 0.2 mL (0.1 mL per nostril). For children not previously vaccinated against
      seasonal influenza, a second dose should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks.

      For the safety and tolerability endpoint, data will be gathered on solicited symptoms, AEs
      and SAEs.
