      I. To assess overall survival in chemo-naÏŠve patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) treated with combination of gemcitabine, carboplatin and PS-341.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete plus partial), in the subset
      of patients with measurable disease, progression-free survival and quantitative toxicities in
      this group of patients treated with this regimen.

      II. To investigate in an exploratory manner, the association of levels of hypoxia-induced
      secreted proteins and tumor DNA in plasma levels of apoptosis-associated proteins in tumor
      tissue, and the changes in the levels of PS-341 modulated proteins in peripheral white blood
      cells with patient response and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over 15-30
      minutes on day 1, and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue to receive
      bortezomib alone on the above schedule for up to 1 year at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years after registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 months.
