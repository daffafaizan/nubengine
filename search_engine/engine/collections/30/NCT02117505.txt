    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention), 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover
      (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial), and
      single-center study of JNJ-54781532. The duration of study will be approximately of 5 weeks
      per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study
      commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (consists of 2 single-dose treatments, either
      JNJ-54781532 formulation 1 [reference] or JNJ-54781532 formulation 2 [test]), in subsequent
      2-treatment periods, each separated with washout period of 7 days); and End-of-Study (done
      upon completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 4 of Period 2, or at the time
      of early withdrawal). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2
      treatment sequences to ensure that they receive both of the following treatments, one in each
      period. Followed by an overnight fast of at least 10 hours participants will be administered
      with study treatment 30 minutes after high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. Participants will not
      be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected
      for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative
      bioavailability of two formulations of JNJ-54781532 (test and reference) will be evaluated
      primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
