      proliferation of the HMC-1V560G cell line, while it is ineffective on inhibiting the growth
      of HMC-1V560G, D816V cells. Apart from wtKit, Kit molecules carrying mutations in the
      extracellular, transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains, such as V560G, F522C and K509I,
      remain sensitive to imatinib. In contrast, several experiments have provided compelling
      evidence regarding the resistance against the growth-inhibitory effects of imatinib on cells
      carrying the D816V KIT mutation. As a consequence, sensitive and specific methods should be
      used in order to avoid "false" KIT mutation-negative cases and, for that purpose, mainly in
      cases with low bone marrow mast cell numbers, mutational studies should be performed using
      highly purified bone marrow mast cells by means of Facs sorting systems better than whole
      bone marrow, unsorted mononuclear cell fraction or mononuclear cell fraction pre-enriched
      using magnetic beads conjugated with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody. In the present study
      mutational studies were performed in all cases in purified bone marrow mast cells (purity >
      97%) using a FACSaria system (Becton-Dickinson Biosciences) as previously described.

      Patients without B or C findings according to the World Health Organization, and without
      features of biological progression of the disease receive oral Imatinib Mesylate 300 mg daily
      for up to 12 months or until clinical progression/unacceptable toxicity. Patients with B or C
      findings or biological progression initially receive oral Imatinib Mesylate 300 mg daily for
      two weeks; then, dose is increased up to 400 mg/day except in patients who develop
      hematological or any other dose-limiting toxicity.

      Biological progression is defined as the presence of at least one of the following features:
      i) increased serum tryptase levels > 200 ng/mL, ii) diffuse bone sclerosis, iii) patchy
      sclerosis with osteolysis and increased risk of bone fracture or significant bone pain, and,
      iv) organomegalies or lymph node enlargement due to mastocytosis.
