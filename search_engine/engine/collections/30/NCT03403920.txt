    
      The translation of the original version of "Profile Fitness Mapping Low Back Questionnaire"
      to Turkish will be translated by two independent professional translators. Afterwards, a
      person without a medical history and a native English speaker will be translated into English
      again. Once the translation stages are complete, the translators will be brought together to
      discuss the two versions of the questionnaire. Then the final state will be translated into
      the main language of the questionnaire and the compliance will be checked.

      First of all, people who have been suffering from low back pain for at least six months will
      complete the "Profile Fitness Mapping Low Back Questionnaire", "Oswestry Disability Index"
      and "SF-36 health related quality of life questionnaire".

      Seven days after the questionnaire, the "Profile Fitness Mapping Low Back Questionnaire" will
      be completed again.
