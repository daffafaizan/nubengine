      Hong Kong. Approximately 50% of patients had negative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), which
      indicates an escape of host immune clearance by the host. Oral antiviral drugs are very
      effective in suppressing viral replication and inducing biochemical remission [1]. However,
      the timing to stop oral antiviral agents is controversial. Hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg) seroclearance has been recommended as the best time for drug cessation for
      HBeAg-negative patients [2,3], but its occurrence is very uncommon especially among Asian
      patients. The Asian Pacific guideline recommended stopping treatment when serum HBV DNA
      became undetectable for three times within 12 months [4], but approximately 50% of patients
      will experience virologic relapse post-treatment [5,6].

      HBsAg quantification has been shown to correlate with the concentration of covalently closed
      circular DNA in the liver [7]. In a Hong Kong study among 53 HBeAg-negative patients who
      stopped lamivudine, HBsAg â‰¤ 100 IU/ml and/or reduction of > 1 log at the end of treatment
      could predict sustained response up to 5 years post-treatment [8]. In other words, it is
      probable that patients who have a lower serum HBsAg level, which may reflect a lower
      concentration of virus inside the liver, have a lower risk of viral relapse after stopping
      antiviral therapy.
