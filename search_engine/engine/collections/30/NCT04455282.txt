      from a peripheral vein and additional 40 mL from tumor draining veins. In addition, around 5
      mL of lymphatic fluid will be collected from the thoracic duct, when exposed and opened
      during the surgical resection. Annual blood draws (20 mL) will be performed during routine
      clinical follow-up or at the time point when the patients develops a (metastatic) relapse. A
      one tube protocol will be performed from each blood sample to assess CTCs and tumor derived
      extracellular Vesicles (tdEVs) using CELLSEARCH® and ACCEPT
      (https://github.com/LeonieZ/ACCEPT/blob/master/ACCEPT.m). In addition, tumor cells will be
      enumerated by CELLSEARCH® in the lymphatic fluid. ctDNA will be extracted from plasma of each
      blood collection tube and analyzed by mFAST-SeqS. If the mutational status of the primary
      tumor is known, deep sequencing of ctDNA will be applied for mutation tracking at a later
      time point. Tissue resected during the surgical procedure and not required for routine
      pathology will be collected into a biobank (cry-conserved and formalin fixed and paraffin
      embedded (FFPE).
