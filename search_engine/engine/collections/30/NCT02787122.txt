      psychosis. Several meta-analyses showed an effect of CBTp in addition to antipsychotic
      treatment of small to medium effect size with regard to positive symptoms, general
      psychopathology and depression. Nevertheless, present research suggests that are especially
      emotional processes are closely related to positive symptoms and delusions, such as negative
      emotions, low self-esteem, depression and anxiety, whereas present interventions of CBTp
      focus often especially on cognitive interventions in order to change delusions as well as
      more cognitive risk factors for delusions such as reasoning biases and a dysfunctional causal
      attribution style.

      Thus, the aim of the present single-blind randomized-controlled pilot therapy study was to
      assess the efficacy of a new form of emotion-focussed Cognitive behavior therapy for
      psychosis with regard to change in positive symptoms and delusions in comparison to standard
      treatment.

      The main hypotheses are:

      - Efficacy of CBT-E: patients with schizophrenia who receive CBT-E show a more pronounced
      reduction of delusions (primary outcome), as well as a more pronounced reduction of positive
      symptoms, depression and general psychopathology, a stronger improvement in general and
      social functioning and will receive lower doses of antipsychotic medication (secondary
      outcomes) at post-treatment.
