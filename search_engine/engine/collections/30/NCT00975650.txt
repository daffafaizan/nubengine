      The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of Nasobol in the treatment
      of hypogonadal men requiring testosterone replacement therapy. Efficacy was determined by
      establishing a pharmacokinetic profile for serum testosterone levels following Nasobol
      treatment, and comparing it to that of the active control, AndrodermÂ®.

      Secondary Objective:

      To establish a safety profile for Nasobol.
