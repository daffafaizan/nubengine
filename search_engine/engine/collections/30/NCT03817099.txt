      hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and dehydration among people with diabetes. Also,
      Ramadan triggers a prime dietary change leading to increased risk of nutritional issues from
      improper eating habits and reduction in physical activity level (Hamdy et al., 2016). Ramadan
      fasting, therefore, represents a challenge to both patients and healthcare professionals
      (HCPs) including dietitians.

      Ramadan Nutrition Plan (RNP) has recently published by the International Diabetes Federation
      (IDF) and the Diabetes and Ramadan (DAR) International Alliance IDF-DAR guidelines. The goal
      is to provide comprehensive guidance on nutrition practice during Ramadan. However, its
      feasibility in the real clinical scenarios warrants further investigation.

      Besides, the use of a diabetes-specific nutrition formula (Nutren Untuk Diabetik®) has been
      shown beneficial in improving blood glucose control and managing body weight as well as
      enhancing the nutrient adequacy among people with diabetes (Hamdy and Barakatun-Nisak 2016).
      While the benefits have been well established, no study has explored its potential during
      Ramadan.

      Malaysia Diabetes-Ramadan Nutrition Plan (My Dia-RNP) is proposed to determine the
      feasibility of implementing the RNP and to incorporate the diabetes-specific nutrition
      formula (Nutren Untuk Diabetik®) during Ramadan on dietary adherence and acceptability in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
