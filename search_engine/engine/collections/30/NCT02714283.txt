      pulmonary NTM disease. Both are rare but rising in incidence and disproportionately affect
      the elderly and women. Therapy of non-CF bronchiectasis aims to reduce inflammation via
      either ICS-induced immunosuppression or antibiotic-associated immunomodulation and/or
      suppression of pathogenic organisms. Both strategies, pursued long-term alone or some cases
      concomitantly, have inherent risks, and the relative risks and benefits of these differential
      approaches are poorly studied to date. Ultimately, our study will provide patients and their
      physicians with greater understanding of the risks and benefits of these therapeutic choices.
