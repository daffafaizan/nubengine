      2018 in 17 countries, which mainly occur in rural areas with an average of 55,000 cases per
      year between 2001 - 2018 in 17 countries. Diagnostic confirmation is required to start
      treatment, however current diagnostic methods have several limitations, and sometimes it is
      necessary to perform confirmatory tests that are not available in endemic areas.

      Several molecular diagnostic tests have been developed for the diagnosis of CL, however, the
      technical requirements and costs of sample processing by conventional or quantitative PCR
      preclude their routine use in primary care facilities in resource-constrained settings. A
      recently developed method of Isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) targeting
      Leishmania kinetoplast DNA, coupled with lateral flow (LF) immunochromatographic strip has
      shown high accuracy in detecting Leishmania Viannia spp. We evaluated the diagnostic
      performance of RPA-LF test in two scenarios: laboratory reference center and field with
      community participation.
