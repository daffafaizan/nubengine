      alterations in endocrine hormones, mood and cardiovascular measures. The studies also intend
      to examine the contribution of menstrual cycle phase. It is hypothesized that this novel
      focus on nicotine's rapid hormonal, cardiovascular and subjective effects will be important
      for developing novel biologic approaches to treatment for nicotine abuse and dependence as
      well as advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of nicotine reinforcement.
