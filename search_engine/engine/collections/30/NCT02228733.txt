    
      This is an open-label, parallel-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074 following a single dose administration of
      KBP-5074 with and without food. The study includes 2 parts.

      Part 1: Pharmacokinetics from each dose cohort will be characterized before initiation of
      dosing in the subsequent cohorts. Eight subjects in each dose cohort will receive active
      drug. The total number of cohorts will be up to 5. Extensive PK samplings will be collected
      prior to and following administration of single dose of KBP-5074.

      Part 2: A separate panel of 6 subjects will receive a single dose of KBP-5074 under fed
      conditions. Extensive PK samplings will be collected prior to and following administration of
      single dose of KBP-5074 under fed conditions.

      Serum and plasma samples for pharmacodynamic markers (plasma aldosterone and serum potassium
      levels) will be collected at pre-dose and postdose in both Part 1 and Part 2.

      The urine samples will be also used for quantitative determination of urinary albumin in both
      Part 1 and Part 2.

      Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs (blood
      pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature), clinical laboratory findings,
      12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination findings.
