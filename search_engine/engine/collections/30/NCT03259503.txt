      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of olaparib combined with
      vorinostat/gemcitabine/busulfan/melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplant [ASCT]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the 2-year event-free survival (EFS). II. 2-year overall survival (OS). III.
      Complete remission (CR) rate. IV. Overall remission rate (ORR). V. Describe the toxicity
      profile. VI. Describe changes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response and repair,
      poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and downstream cellular effects in peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells and, when available, malignant lymphocytes obtained by fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) of peripheral lymph nodes.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of olaparib.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -11 to -3, vorinostat PO on
      days -10 to -3, gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 4.5 hours on days -9 and -4, busulfan IV
      over 3 hours on day -9 to -6, melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -4 and -3, and undergo
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant IV over 30-60 minutes on day 0. Patients with CD20+
      tumors also receive rituximab IV over 3-6 hours on day -10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 1-2 days for 30 days and
      then every 2 weeks for up to 100 days.
