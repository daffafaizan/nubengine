    
      This aim of this registry is to create a multi centric database for the analysis of basic
      long term outcomes and immediate postoperative outcomes of total arterial CABG in comparison
      to saphenous vein based CABG. The registry will include both on pump and off pump surgery.
      The registry is intended to capture the "real-life" picture of the CABG scenario among
      centers worldwide
