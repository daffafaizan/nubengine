      cancer patients after been treated with surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy. These
      effects include whether apatinib could shrink the tumor or slow down its growth and what side
      effects apatinib will have on the tumor.

      Eligible are patients with metastatic esophageal cancer who have achieved stable disease or
      have disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy) and
      have at least one separate measurable sites of metastatic lesions. Extent of metastatic
      disease is recorded either at CT or MRI scanning. Apatinib (850mg) is given daily during the
      therapy for 28 days. Tumor response is evaluated by assessing clinical and CT/MRI response in
      the metastatic sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II Simon
      design is used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one; if
      there are no tumor responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more
      responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients.
