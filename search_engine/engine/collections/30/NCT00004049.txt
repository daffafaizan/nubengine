      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic
      effects of SR-45023A in these patients. III. Assess the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of
      SR-45023A and relate these to drug effects, if possible, in these patients. IV. Determine any
      preliminary antitumor activity of SR-45023A in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral SR-45023A weekly. Treatment
      continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SR-45023A until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for up to 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
