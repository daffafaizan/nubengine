      supplementation with ACRB on fasting and postprandial levels of plasma triglycerides, as well
      as other parameters of lipid and glucose homeostasis and inflammation. Postprandial changes
      will be evaluated after consumption of a high-fat meal.

      Subjects will receive either a: i) placebo (control),or ii) ACRB product for 8 weeks. At the
      beginning and at the end of the 8-week period, subjects will be submitted to a metabolic
      challenge consisting of consuming a high-fat meal after receiving the study product (placebo,
      ACRB). The high-fat meal will consist of English muffin bread, sausage, egg and cheese,
      obtained from US market with carotenoid-free palm oil added to bring the total dietary fat to
      the desired level. The total weight of the high-fat meal will be 320 g with 70.5 g of fat
      (29.8 g of saturated fat), 270 mg of cholesterol, 65 g carbohydrate, 5.2 g sugar, and 33 g
      protein. The total energy content of the high-fat meal will be 1,026 Kcal with a total of 62%
      energy originated from fat, 25% from carbohydrates and 13% from protein. Blood will be taken
      by venipuncture before (baseline, 0 h) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 h after consumption of
      both the high-fat meal and the study product. Plasma will be collected and chylomicrons and
      peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) will be isolated. Blood pressure and skin carotenoid
      content will be measured. Subjects will be also asked to collect feces before starting and at
      the end of the 8 week period.
