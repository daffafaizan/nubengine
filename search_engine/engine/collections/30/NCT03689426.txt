    
      PREDICT-HF a low risk single centre observational study in which 150 consecutive patients
      admitted with a new, primary diagnosis of heart failure undergo advanced CMR to
      non-invasively establish their individual myocardial tissue characteristics during their
      initial presentation.

      All study participants will be invited to participate in an optional heart rhythm and rate
      monitoring sub study which will involve continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for up to
      2 days prior to discharge and up to 30 day immediately post discharge using a Samsung S-PATCH
      device.

      To enable multivariate statistical analysis to be performed each study participant will
      undergo a range of validated investigation to comprehensively establish and monitor other
      recognised heart failure prognostic biomarkers.

      Participants will be managed per current NICE heart failure guidelines and will undergo
      rigorous clinical reviews at 6, 12 and 24 months. All clinically relevant event data e.g.
      MACE, rehospitalisation, decompensation and arrhythmias will be meticulously recorded for
      each participant throughout the study period.

      This study will identify novel CMR derived tissue characterisation biomarkers of adverse
      outcome, response to therapy and arrhythmias in a hospitalised heart failure population. It
      will also be the first study to utilise wearable heart monitoring technology to accurately
      record heart rate and rhythm data in this population and investigate the potential impact of
      this on patient's clinical management and outcomes.
