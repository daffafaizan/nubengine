      Declaration. Written informed consent was received from the OSAS Subjects patients and
      control subjects before enrolment in the study. The patient and control cohorts were
      recruited from the Pulmonary Medicine Department, Medical Faculty, Yuzuncu YÄ±l University.
      Blood samples were analysed at the Biochemistry Laboratory of Harran University Medical
      Faculty TAC and TOS levels were measured by using an automated measurement method. TAC
      measurement method involves the production of a potent biological hydroxyl radical. Ferrous
      ion solution is mixed with hydrogen peroxide. Thus, it is possible to measure the
      anti-oxidative effect of the sample against the potent free radical reactions initiated by
      the production of the hydroxyl radical. TOS method is based on the oxidation of ferrous ion
      to ferric ion in the presence of various oxidant species in acidic medium and the measurement
      of the ferric ion by xylenol orange. mmol Trolox equivalent (equiv)/L, mmol H2O2 /L and
      mg/dL, respectively.
