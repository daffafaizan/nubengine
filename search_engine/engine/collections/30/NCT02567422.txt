    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of M6620 (VX-970) when administered along with weekly
      cisplatin and radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      II. Establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of M6620 (VX-970). II. Assess for potential
      drug-drug interaction between M6620 (VX-970) and aprepitant.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IV. To assess the rate of complete metabolic
      response (CMR) at 12 weeks post completion of chemoradiation using 18 fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

      V. To collect archival tumor material for retrospective analysis of association between
      tissue-based biomarkers and clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ATR kinase inhibitor M6620.

      Patients receive berzosertib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day -7 and then weekly on
      day 2 and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes weekly on day 1. Patients also undergo radiation
      therapy once daily, 5 days a week. Treatment continues for up to 7 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 2 weeks for
      3 months, and then every 3 months for 2 years.
