      behaviour and mental health of rheumatic patients and to compare them with healthy
      individual. This is cross-sectional survey, 360 participants were included and divided into
      cases group composed of 180 patients with rheumatic diseases and control group composed of
      180 healthy people. Data were collected via a self-administered structured questionnaire
      (Google form) which was sent to participants via social networks and emails to different
      rheumatic patients and healthy individuals. Mental health was measured by the five-item Brief
      Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5).

      disease itself, being of no less importance. It is essential for mental health professionals

      chronically ill patients and their families, individuals, communities and health care
      workers.
