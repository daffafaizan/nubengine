      Measure the proportion of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML patients in CP treated
      with Cemivil who achieve optimal response :

        -  Complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months;

        -  Minor cytogenetic response (mCyR) at 3 months (Ph+ ≤65%); partial cytogenetic response
           (PCyR) at 6 months (Ph+ ≤35%), and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months (No
           Ph+ metaphases);

        -  Major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months of Cemivil therapy [a ratio of BCR-ABL1 to
           ABL1 ≤0.1% on the International Scale];

      Assess the safety and tolerability of Cemivil after one year of treatment, based on:

        -  Incidence, severity, and relationship of adverse events (AEs) to the study medication;

        -  Serious AEs;

        -  AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation;

        -  Clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests (according to laboratory reference
           ranges).

      Number of Subjects evaluated: 91 (N=33 received generic imatinib as first-line therapy
      "first-line patients". N=58 switched from patented imatinib to generic imatinib "switched
      patients")
