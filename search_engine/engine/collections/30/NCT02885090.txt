    
      Search for pathogenic chromosomal imbalance through comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
      on DNA microarrays will be done in a group of patients having typical or atypical forms of
      RTT without known mutations in MECP2, CDKL5 et FOXG1B genes.

      After imbalance confirmation by qPCR, the pathogenic potential of the segmental aneusomy will
      be assigned according to the interpretation of aCGH technique-dedicated DECEPHER, BACH and
      GVD databases. Analysis of parents will allow distinguishing between inherited polymorphic
      variants and potentially deleterious new imbalances.

      In case of a new imbalance, a bioinformatics approach will look for candidate genes that will
      be possibly confirmed by classic mutation screening (sequencing and PCR) in all typical and
      atypical cases of RTT present in the cohort.

      The identification of new genes involved in RTT will ameliorate the molecular diagnosis of
      the disease and genetic counseling for families. This project will allow progression in
      comprehension of physiopathological mechanisms of cerebral development abnormalities
