      acute otitis media (AOM) is recommended by Canadian and American authorities. However, North
      American children receive more antibiotics for AOM than for any other reason, making
      AOM-related prescribing a key focus for antimicrobial stewardship interventions. Low uptake
      of the ED suggested management strategies may be caused by caregiver under-appreciation of
      antibiotic-associated harms or from problems understanding the discharge plan, of which both
      could be remedied by a novel video-based knowledge translation platform.

      The aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a follow-up large trial. The
      main clinical research question is: for caregivers of previously healthy children aged 6-59
      months who are diagnosed by the ED physician with acute otitis media and judged to be
      eligible for a watchful waiting approach, will the use of an innovative informative video
      lead to lower rates of unnecessary antibiotic use as compared to a pamphlet or no
      intervention (reference standard)?

      This will be a single-centre, randomized, controlled, pilot trial. Caregivers of previously
      well children aged 6-59 months presenting to the McMaster Children's Hospital (MCH) ED with
      non-severe AOM eligible for a watchful waiting approach will be enrolled and randomized to a
      video intervention, a pamphlet intervention, or standard care (no intervention). The primary
      outcome is the proportion of caregivers who fill a prescription for antimicrobials <48 hours
      after recruitment, as caregivers are generally advised to wait 48-72 hours prior to
      administering antibiotics to healthy children with mild AOM.
