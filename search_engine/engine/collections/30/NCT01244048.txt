    
      Fifty three mildly hypertriacylglycerolemic subjects (TAG â‰¥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L))
      participated on the placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel designed study.

      The subjects consumed placebo yoghurt (1), or n3 LC-PUFA-enriched yoghurt (0.8 g n3 LC-PUFA/d
      (2), 3 g n3 LC-PUFA/d (3)) for 10 weeks.

      Blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the period.

      Parameters:

        -  Blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triacylglycerols)

        -  Fatty acid distribution of plasma lipids (PL) and erythrocyte membranes (EM)

        -  Concentrations of eicosanoids (PGs, HETEs)

        -  Production of ex vivo stimulated cytokines by T cells

        -  SNPs in the CD36 genotype
