      minimise these adverse events, two novel formulations were developed to improve compliance
      and ease of administration. This study will evaluate these formulations in terms of their
      pharmacokinetic profiles and effects on SSF. In addition, the effects of this combination and
      its entities on urine frequency and safety/tolerability will be assessed.
