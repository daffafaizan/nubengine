    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To estimate the progression-free ratio, as defined by the progression-free survival time on
      study treatment divided by the progression-free survival time on the last treatment received
      by patient, for an identified actionable mutation, who will be treated with an off-label
      treatment off label therapy based on a simplified selection methodology using the Next
      Generation Sequencing results.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate patient response rate on off-label treatments for actionable mutations based
           on Next Generation Sequencing results.

        -  To estimate overall survival (OS) for patients treated with off-label treatments for
           actionable mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.

        -  To describe the safety of using off-label or other experimental treatments for patients
           with actionable mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To describe health related quality of life in patients undergoing off-label treatment
           targeting genetic mutations, as measured by the PROMIS-29 Overall Health-Related Quality
           of Life, Including 4-Item Anxiety Subscale.

        -  Using the Satisfaction with Medical Decision Scale, to describe patient satisfaction
           with decision to pursue off-label treatment.

        -  To identify types of actionable mutations with available targeted treatment occurring in
           cancer patients.

        -  To characterize the historical treatment regimens for these patients relative to the
           targetable mutation.

        -  To describe patient clinical and demographic characteristics of those with actionable
           mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.

        -  To identify barriers to treatment based on Next Generation Sequencing results.
