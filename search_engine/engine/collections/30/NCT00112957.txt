    
      Patients received a single intradermal injection of rV-NY-ESO-1 (3.1 × 10^7 plaque forming
      units [PFU]) on Day 1, followed by monthly subcutaneous injections of rF-NY-ESO-1 (7.41 ×
      10^7 PFU) for 6 months (Days 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, and 169) or until observation of
      treatment-related ≥ grade 3 toxicity or disease progression. Study injections were
      administered during a 28-week evaluation period. Patients returned to the clinic for
      follow-up on Day 197 (i.e., 28 days after the last study injection) and every 2 months
      thereafter for at least 12 months. In patients with measurable disease, tumor response was
      assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0.
      Patients were monitored continuously for safety for the duration of study participation.
