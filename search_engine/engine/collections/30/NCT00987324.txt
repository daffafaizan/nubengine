      compared to bare metal stents (BMS), but 5% to 10% of patients receiving DES are still in
      need of revascularization of the treated vessel. Two important families of drugs are used for
      stent coating: paclitaxel belonging to the taxane family, and the "limus"-family such as
      sirolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus, biolimus A9 and pimecrolimus.

      Data regarding the optimal treatment of in-DES-restenosis is very limited. Implanting a new
      DES for in-DES-restenosis has been reported to be associated with re-restenosis rates as high
      as 43%. Several recent well published studies have shown a substantial reduction of
      restenosis using paclitaxel-eluting balloons (PEB) for de-novo lesions and BMS-restenotic
      lesions.

      The objective of this randomized trial is to assess the hypothesis, that PEB are non-inferior
      to paclitaxel-eluting-stents (PES) for restenosis in "limus"-eluting-stents (LES), and both,
      PEB and PES, are superior to plain angioplasty in patients with restenosis after initial LES
      implantation.
