      the patients with T1 non-small cell lung cancer enrolled in clinics from 2015 to 2017 were
      included via a retrospectively review method and the study data on patient demographic/tumor
      biological characteristics, and clinical treatments were collected to explore the clinical
      odd factors of lymph metastases, evaluate the effects of clinical characteristics on lymph
      metastases, and compare the differences in lymph metastases in the subgroups.
