      consultations in pediatric practice. In many children constipation is accompanied by overflow
      soiling (fecal incontinence). This condition often gives rise to behavioral, social, and
      emotional problems.

      We plan to develop a disease-specific instrument to assess HRQoL in children with
      constipation and fecal incontinence. We hypothesize that HRQoL is worse in children with
      fecal incontinence compared to children with constipation but no fecal incontinence. The
      instrument will involve both parent and child self-reporting measures and will enable
      researchers to evaluate how disease and treatment strategies impact both child and parent
      perceptions of quality of life. In the long run this will enable physicians to develop a
      child friendly approach to management of chronic constipation and fecal incontinence.
