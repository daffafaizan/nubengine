      A PDA was developed to be administered during anethesia consultation for surgical patients.
      We expect the PDA would benefit the intervention group in the aspects of knowledge and
      communication in choosing reversal drugs.The aim of this study is to conduct a multicenter
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the benefit of PDAs on decision making.

      Patients and Methods:

      Decision aids are interventions designed to help surgical patients with general anethesia to
      choose their options of neostigmine or sugammadex by providing information on those options.
      In this multicenter RCT, surgical patients are randomly divided into SDM and control groups.
      In control group, patients will receive details of anesthesia using single introductory
      sheet. In SDM group, PDA will be used as a tool to explain the benefits and harms between the
      traditional reversal drugs and sugammadex. And by following SDM principles, the patients are
      guided to consider their individual values and preferences and helped to make a choice that
      best meet their needs. This study will be conducted in 2 hospitals (Shuang Ho Hospital and
      Chi Mei Medical Center). The outcomes are decision conflicts and decision-making difficulties
      after consultation of the patients.

      Hypothesis:

      The patients of the SDM group are predicted to have lower decisional conflict scores and
      higher knowledge scores when compared with controlled group. Our study hopes to support the
      efficacy of PDAs in helping surgical patients to make a choice that best meet their needs.
