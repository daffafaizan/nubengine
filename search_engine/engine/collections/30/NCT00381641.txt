      I. Determine the response rate of single agent sunitinib (sunitinib malate) in patients with
      iodine refractory, unresectable well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) who have evidence
      of disease progression within 6 months of study enrollment.

      II. Determine the response rate of single agent sunitinib in patients with medullary thyroid
      cancer (MTC) who have evidence of disease progression within 6 months of study enrollment.

      III. Determine the toxicity, duration of response, progression free survival, and overall
      survival in patients with WDTC or MTC treated with single agent sunitinib.

      IV. Determine whether the presence of ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene rearrangements in
      patients with WDTC or RET mutations in patients with MTC predict response to sunitinib.

      V. Determine whether therapy with sunitinib affects phosphorylation of downstream RET
      effector, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK), in WDTC and MTC tissue.

      VI. Determine whether specific germ-line polymorphisms in the RET gene are associated with
      favorable outcome in patients with WDTC treated with sunitinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to type of thyroid cancer
      (medullary vs well-differentiated).

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
