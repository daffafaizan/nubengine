      Healthcare Hamilton in 2012, there are daily phone calls and e-mails from patients with a
      variety of chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis, Crohns, chronic
      irritable bowel syndrome, chronic severe constipation due to dysbiosis, which are formally
      diagnosed by gastroenterologists who specialize in this disorder to request for FMT. Out of
      desperation, some of these patients have explored the option of performing FMT at home.

      There are instructions on how to manufacture and perform home FMTs on the internet. Given
      this some patients may perform FMTs at home using stool samples from unscreened and/or
      inappropriate donors. Individuals with metabolic disorders, family history of colonic cancer,
      autoimmune disease, gastrointestinal disorders as well as the ones whose blood and stools are
      unscreened should be excluded from donating stools. Unsupervised and using stool samples from
      an unscreened or unsuitable donor can lead to undesirable immediate and long-term
      consequences. The real possibility of these patients performing FMTs at home using stool
      samples from unscreened donors is very concerning.
