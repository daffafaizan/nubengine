      Part A: Induction dose escalation - 7+3 combined with SGN-CD33A (Day 1 and Day 4 dosing)

      Part B: Consolidation dose escalation - consolidation combined with SGN-CD33A; up to 4 cycles
      of consolidation therapy will be administered after SGN-CD33A (Day 1 of each cycle).

      Part C: Maintenance - SGN-CD33A Monotherapy; Up to 24 patients with and up to 24 patient
      without prior allogeneic stem cell transplant will be treated with SGN-CD33A. Both arms will
      enroll simultaneously. SGN-CD33A will be administered on Day 1 of each 6-week cycle for up to
      8 cycles.

      Part D: Induction plus consolidation - induction/consolidation combined with SGN-CD33A;
      patients who achieve a CR/CRi (with or without a second induction) will receive up to 4
      cycles of consolidation therapy administered after SGN-CD33A (Day 1 of each cycle).
