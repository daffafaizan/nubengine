      imaging in patients who were seen at Mayo Clinic for clinically indicated endoscopic
      surveillance and biopsies of BE.

      Endoscopy reports and pathology results will be reviewed from 100 patients who have undergone
      endoscopy. These results will be correlated with images obtained with confocal microscopy at
      the time of the endoscopy. There will be no patient contact.
