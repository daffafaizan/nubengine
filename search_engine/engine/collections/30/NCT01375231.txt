      Multiple etiologies have been theorized concerning the cause of this problem including
      tibiofemoral instability, patellofemoral (PF) instability, PF maltracking and patella stress
      fractures. It has been reported that patellofemoral forces are associated with anterior knee
      pain. Moreover, it has been reported that a correlation exists between the tension of the
      quadriceps muscle and the forces on the patella. In a biomechanical, cadaver study, Browne et
      al. found that a longer extensor moment arm reduced the tension on the quadriceps and reduced
      the patellar forces.
