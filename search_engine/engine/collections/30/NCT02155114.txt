           in the context of neoplasia. Our 2013 pilot study showed that iron deficiency is a
           common problem in medical inpatients (13.7%) and that about 55% of these also showed
           signs of inflammation. The relevance of iron storage levels on clinical outcome in the
           presence of inflammation is conflicting. On the one hand, lack of iron prevents many
           viruses and bacteria, as well as other microorganisms, to reproduce and on the other
           hand the abundance of available iron stimulates hematopoiesis and reduces symptoms of
           iron deficiency.

        -  Methodology: We plan to enroll 1000-1500 patients with laboratory signs of inflammation
           during a period of six months and to analyze iron specific laboratory parameters twice
           during hospital stay. Additional laboratory analyses are planned for a smaller sample to
           portray the processes in iron homeostasis during inflammation.

        -  Significance: Contradicting evidence of forty and more years of scientific research
           backs current therapeutic practices in patients with inflammatory disease and iron
           deficiency. This study records prevalence of different iron storage states, mortality,
           morbidity and therapies in inflammatory states combined with iron deficiency and could
           very well be able to recommend a therapeutic regimen as well as limits for typically
           used laboratory parameters.
