    
      This study will be a Phase II, single-site, 8-week, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group comparison of aprepitant (125 mg/d) or placebo. Subjects
      will be 100 outpatients seeking treatment for current cannabis dependence with no clinically
      significant medical or psychiatric disorders (including substance use disorders or a positive
      drug screen for substances other than cannabis or nicotine). All subjects will receive weekly
      manual-guided abstinence-oriented counseling to facilitate showing a drug effect above and
      beyond available therapies (Weeks 0-8). Research assessments of marijuana use and withdrawal
      and drug safety and tolerability will occur weekly through the treatment phase of the 8-week
      study. Post treatment follow-up assessments will occur at Weeks 9 and 12. Neuropsychological
      testing will occur at Weeks 0 and 4 and 8.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the relative efficacy of aprepitant 125 mg/d vs. placebo for
      reducing cannabis withdrawal symptoms in cannabis dependent outpatients, including anxiety,
      mood, craving and sleep symptoms.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the relative efficacy of aprepitant 125 mg/d vs. placebo for
      reducing marijuana use in cannabis dependent outpatients.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the relative efficacy of aprepitant 125 mg/d vs. placebo for
      reducing cannabis related impairments in executive functioning in cannabis dependent
      outpatients.
