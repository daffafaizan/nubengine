    
      This study aims to establish OLO's performance accuracy of CBC results for finger prick
      samples across the OLO reportable range, and particularly around relevant medical decision
      points.

      The evaluation will include two studies:

        1. A matrix study will compare a capillary sample collected via finger prick with a venous
           sample collected into a blood tube, both scanned on OLO.

        2. A method comparison study will compare Sight OLO to the site reference analyzer using a
           venous sample collected into a blood tube.
