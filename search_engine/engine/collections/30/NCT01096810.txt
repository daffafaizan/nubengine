      Undetermined Significance (MGUS), defined by parameters of M spike and bone marrow. After
      evolution to myeloma, patients may be asymptomatic, that is, without any endorgan disease of
      hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia or bone lesions. In asymptomatic myeloma (ASxM),
      there is no standard therapy. Thalidomide has been tried in patients with ASxM but with
      significant toxicity. The patients with ASxM are evaluable in terms of paraprotein
      measurements. TBL12 sea cucumber extract has been shown to have a number of antitumor
      properties preclinically, including antiangiogenesis and direct tumor cytotoxicity. TBL12 has
      been used by a number of patients as a food supplement without any toxicity detected. We thus
      propose to determine the clinical activity of this agent in patients with ASxM. Patients will
      be given TBL12 at the dose of 2 units of 20 mL each twice per day daily for one year and the
      effects on the paraprotein noted. Clinical effects seen will be correlated with any in vitro
      changes in angiogenesis in patient bone marrow samples. The results of this trial may form
      the basis for the use of this nontoxic agent in patients with the prodrome of or with other
      early cancers.
