      diabetes. It is associated with sodium retention, left ventricular hypertrophy and elevated
      markers of inflammation and is an important predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin aldosterone
      system are both involved in the development of hypertension in obese individuals.
      Hypertension in obese individuals is often associated with dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinaemia
      and impaired glucose tolerance.

      In order to decrease the cardiovascular risk of obese hypertensive patients, therapy should
      not only be directed to lowering blood pressure values but also to improvement of their
      metabolic situation. As it is possible that antihypertensive treatment based on an
      angiotensin receptor antagonist (like candesartan) might be superior to beta-blocker or
      calcium channel blocker therapy in preventing diabetes, a combination of candesartan with
      already existing insufficiently effective beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy
      will be used in this study.
