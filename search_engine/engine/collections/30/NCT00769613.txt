      Primary

        -  To provide access to cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65- and IE-1-specific cytotoxic T
           lymphocytes (CTL) in patients with persistent CMV infections after allogeneic stem cell
           transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize CMV pp65- and IE-1-specific immune responses in terms of cytotoxicity
           and cytokine production pre-infusion and then periodically thereafter.

        -  To characterize the levels of CMV DNA in recipients of CMV pp65- and IE-1-specific CTL
           and observe whether the CTL infusion has any impact on level of virus.

        -  To determine the feasibility of CMV CTL culture from CMV-seronegative donors who have
           received a CMV vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive allogeneic cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65- and IE-1-specific cytotoxic T-cell
      lymphocytes infusion over 5 minutes on day 1. Patients may receive up to 2 more doses at
      least 2 weeks after previous dose.

      Blood samples are collected and analyzed by quantitative CMV PCR, chromium-release assays for
      CMV pp65- and IE-1-specific cytotoxicity, and immunophenotype for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD19,
      and CD45RA/RO. Intracellular cytofluorometry is used to assess IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-Î³
      production by CD4 and CD8 CMV-specific effector cells.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.
