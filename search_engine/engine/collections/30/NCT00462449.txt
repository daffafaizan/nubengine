      practice (RTP) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) in individuals who receive routine
      clinical Botox ® injections for upper extremity spasticity. Botox® injections in combination
      with repetitive task practice (RTP) is used routinely to manage upper limb spasticity after
      stroke or acquired brain injury. RTP is an activity-based rehabilitation program that has
      been shown effective in promoting motor recovery (Wolf et al., 2002), but it requires a
      sufficient level of baseline motor function. Since FES enhances motor function, we
      hypothesize that an FES-assisted RTP intervention will provide greater improvement in hand
      function than RTP alone in patients receiving Botox ® injections.

      The primary outcome will be upper extremity use during activities of daily living assessed
      observationally by the motor activities log (MAL-O). Secondary outcomes will be 1) dexterous
      hand function as measured by the action research arm test (ARAT); 2) client's perception of
      self-performance in activities of daily living assessed with the (MAL - Self Report); 3)
      global upper extremity impairment assessed by the Chedoke-McMaster Assessment (CMA); and 4)
      clinical spasticity assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).

      The primary endpoint will be 6 weeks post-injection. Outcomes will also be assessed at a
      secondary endpoint, 12 weeks post-injection, to determine the persistence of treatment
      effects.
