      finding clinical trial.

      The study will involve two treatment groups. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive
      either FXFM244 - 1%, FXFM244 - 4% , in a blinded fashion. Patients will be treated twice
      daily for 7 days. Following the screening period and baseline visit, study subjects will
