      that may result in client's inability to adjust with the situations and use of medical
      support. This experience may lead to increase agitation, anxiety as well as physiological
      stress of client, decrease comfort level and increase recovery time as well as hospital stay.
      There has been great emphasis on non-pharmacological methods that decrease anxiety and stress
      since they are very appropriate and affordable.
