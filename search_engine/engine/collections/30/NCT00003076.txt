      significant reduction of the Ki67 labelling index in subjects with intestinal type Barrett's
      esophagus and low grade dysplastic Barrett's esophagus. II. Determine whether oral DFMO will
      alter the pathology and morphology of Barrett's esophagus. III. Determine whether there is a
      difference in cellular DNA ploidy and/or nuclear or nucleolar morphometry in patients with
      dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and nondysplastic intestinal type Barrett's esophagus compared
      to normal gastric fundic mucosa. Determine whether DFMO modulates changes in these surrogate
      endpoint biomarkers towards normal mucosal values. IV. Determine whether cells demonstrating
      nuclear p53 protein accumulation are either lost or undergo a change in cellular
      distribution, following treatment of patients with dysplastic Barrett's mucosa with DFMO. V.
      Determine whether DFMO modulates changes in growth factor or oncogene expression in
      dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and nondysplastic intestinal type Barrett's esophagus. VI.
      Determine whether pathologic or biologic surrogate modulation occurring during 6 months of
      DFMO treatment reverts 6 months after treatment is discontinued.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind prevention study. Patients
      are initially stratified by dysplasia status at baseline (metaplastic vs low grade
      dysplastic) and treatment group (placebo vs eflornithine). Patients are randomized to receive
      daily doses of eflornithine (DFMO) or placebo for 26 weeks. At 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26
      weeks there are toxicity and adherence evaluations and at weeks 26 and 52 patients have
      follow-up endoscopies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of a 152 evaluable patients will be accrued in this study.
