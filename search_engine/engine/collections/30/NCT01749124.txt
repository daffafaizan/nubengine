      which their providers will have access to by logging in to a secure website. Providers will
      also be able to indicate using the website whether they found a particular narrative helpful
      or not. Providers will have access to audio recordings of the voice responses, transcribed
      text of the responses, as well as "word clouds" generated from the text. Word clouds are a
      method of displaying the content of text such that words that are used more frequently are
      displayed in a larger size than words used less frequently. Clients will call in to the
      system approximately twice a week for a period of four months.
