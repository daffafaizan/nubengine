    
      1025 residents aged â‰¥ 50 years will be recruited using door-to-door enumeration in randomly
      selected rural communities in Wuchuan, China, and will be followed in 3 years. At baseline
      and follow-up visits, subjects will complete a home interview (including, but not limited to,
      socio-demographic factors, physical activity level using IPA-Q questionnaire,WOMAC
      questionnaire) and have a weight-bearing posteroanterior semiflexed view of radiographs at
      tibiofemoral (TF) joints. Radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) worsening for a knee is defined
      if its Kellgren and Lawrence (K/L) grade increases by at least 1 grade except for the change
      from 0 to 1 during follow-up. The relationship between level of physical activity and ROA
      worsening will be assessed.
