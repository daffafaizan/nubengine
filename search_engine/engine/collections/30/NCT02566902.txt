      lead to statistically greater improvement in FEV1 when compared to an equivalent dose
      delivered via a standard t-piece nebulizer. The primary aim will be to study changes in
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in patients presenting to an urban pediatric
      emergency department with a moderate to severe acute asthma exacerbation when utilizing these
      two nebulizers. Secondary aims will include evaluation of hospital admission rates, emergency
      department (ED) length of stay (LOS), changes in asthma severity scores, vital sign changes,
      medication side effects, and total quantity of albuterol given in the ED. A distal aim of the
      study will be to perform a cost analysis; though the investigators will likely need further
      clinical trials utilizing multiple dose administration in order to accurately analyze cost.
