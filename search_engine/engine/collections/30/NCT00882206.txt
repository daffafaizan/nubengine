      Primary

        -  Patients undergo blood and bone marrow sample collection at baseline, on day 5, Day 19
           and at the end of study treatment for correlative laboratory studies. Samples are
           analyzed for hypermethylation at diagnosis and demethylation post-exposure with
           decitabine and vorinostat using LINE methylation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour and oral vorinostat twice daily on days 1-4;
      vincristine sulfate IV on days 5, 12, 19, and 26; oral prednisone twice daily on days 5-33;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes and cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 5;
      pegaspargase IV or intramuscularly on days 6, 12, 19, and 26; and methotrexate* IT on days 12
      and 33. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease may also receive oral imatinib
      mesylate once daily on days 5-33.

      NOTE: *Patients with central nervous system (CNS)-positive disease also receive methotrexate
      IT on days 19 and 26.

      Patients undergo blood and bone marrow sample collection at baseline, on day 5, Day 19 and at
      the end of study treatment for correlative laboratory studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 60 days.
