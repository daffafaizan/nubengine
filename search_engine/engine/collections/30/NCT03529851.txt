      patient reported outcomes) is feasible for a following randomized trial (PRO-WIDE trial -
      Patient Reported Outcomes used for Weekly Internet-based DEtection of progressive disease in
      lung cancer; a randomized controlled trial). The RCT (randomized controlled trial) will test
      if weekly supplementary internet-based self-monitoring of 12 core symptoms can increase
      survival in Danish lung cancer patients during follow-up or maintenance treatment. A
      threshold mechanism will automatically send an alert to the hospital in case of alarming
      symptoms and the patient will be contacted by the clinicians.

      In the pilot study, initial interviews with 7-10 patients will explore possible missing items
      and conceptual issues in the questionnaire. Based on the results an adjustment of the
      questionnaire will be considered.

      Then the system including the alert trigger mechanism will be tested on 20 patients in
      medical antineoplastic treatment for three consecutive weeks. Acceptability, usability and
      relevance will be evaluated by a questionnaire at the end of the study period.
      Inclusion-rate, number of alerts per completed questionnaire and time usage of
      alert-management will be registered. For final evaluation, interviews with two nurses and two
      doctors will be made at the end of the study.
