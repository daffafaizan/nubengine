      goal-setting at enrollment and half will receive a pedometer and goal-setting 2 months later.
      It is a 4 month study. Our aims are as follows:

      Primary Aim: Determine the relationship between gait speed, grip strength and walking steps
      in patients randomized to a self-exercise program compared to usual care in complex medical
      patients.

      Second Primary aim: To determine the effect of a self-exercise program compared to usual care
      on weight loss in complex medical patients.

      Secondary Aim: Determine the relationship between the number of hospitalizations in patients
      randomized to a self-exercise program compared to usual care in complex medical patients.
