    
      The aim will be to evaluate if Glicoset® 1000, a nutraceutical containing Ilex
      Paraguariensis, White Mulberry and Chromium Picolinate, can be effective in improving
      glycemic status in subject with dysglycemia.

      The investigators will enroll patients with impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG) or impaired
      glucose tolerance (IGT), not taking hypoglycemic agents (both pharmaceuticals or
      nutraceutical agents). Patients will be randomized to take placebo or Glicoset® 1000 for 3
      months, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Glicoset® 1000 and placebo
      will be self-administered once a day, 1 tablet during the breakfast.
