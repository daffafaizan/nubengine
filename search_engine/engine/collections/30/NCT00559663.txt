      especially high concentrations in the form of flavanols in green tea as well as in cocoa, and
      are known to have beneficial antioxidant effects in vitro. Flavonoids have been proposed as a
      key protective dietary component, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, including the
      reduction of elevated blood pressure in persons with hypertension and capable of decreasing
      LDL.

      The aim of this prospective single cross-over study is to assess the effect of green tea and
      dark chocolate consumption on inhibiting platelet activation, Lipid levels, and hsCRP in
      healthy volunteers.

      This research will be done at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and will include 35 subjects who
      will be randomized equally between the two groups.

      All blood work will be processed at the Sinai Center for Thrombosis Research. Clinical
      outcomes will be recorded using a standard case report form.
