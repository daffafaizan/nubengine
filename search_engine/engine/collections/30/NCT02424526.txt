    
      The purpose of this study is to determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill
      training by comparing high-intensity (5 days/week, twice daily for 10-20 min for 6 weeks) to
      low-intensity (2 days/week, once daily for 10-20 minutes for 6 weeks) treadmill training; and
      to compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking attainment
      and overall walking activity in young children with cerebral palsy.

      Hypotheses

        -  A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase walking onset in young
           children with CP.

        -  A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase overall walking activity
           in young children with CP.

      Specific Aims

        -  To determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill training by comparing
           high-intensity to low-intensity home-based treadmill training.

        -  To compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking onset
           and overall walking activity.

      Study design •Prospective randomized controlled trial

      Study population

      •Two groups of 12 children with CP under the age of 3 years and are not walking yet will
      receive either home-based high-intensity treadmill training or low-intensity treadmill
      training. The children will be assessed before, immediately after, at 1-month and at 4-months
      following the intervention via standardized outcome measures.
