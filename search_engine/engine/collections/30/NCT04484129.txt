      China were continuously evaluated one by one, their close contacts were screened for
      elibgility. All subjects were followed for the same length of time: 80 weeks after
      enrollment. The symptoms and signs of tuberculosis were followed up to monitor the occurrence
      of tuberculosis.

      The primary objective is to investigate the incidence of etiologically confirmed or
      clinically diagnosed active TUBERCULOSIS in close contacts of MDR-TB patients.

      The secondary objective is to assess latent TB infection rates in close contacts of MDR-TB
      patients; evaluate the high risk factors of TUBERCULOSIS in close contact population; assess
      the loss rate of close contacts within 80 weeks; assess the 80-week mortality rate among
      close contacts; isolate the mycobacterium tuberculosis from all patients with active
      tuberculosis and analyze drug resistance to evaluate the homology and drug-resistant
      transmission pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
