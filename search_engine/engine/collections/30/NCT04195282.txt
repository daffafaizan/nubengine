      with high mortality rate in China. But there still lacks of effective therapies in treatment
      of HBV related ACLF, except liver transplantation. RL-1 Novel Human-derived Bio-artificial
      Liver treatment may be an effective and safe therapy due to the previous clinical data. This
      study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of RL-1 Novel Human-derived
      Bio-artificial Liver treatment in patients with HBV related ACLF.
