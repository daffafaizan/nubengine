      threshold (=decreased intranasal sensibility) and low expression of TRP channels of the
      mucosa suffer more often from impaired nasal breathing after surgery. This could lead to the
      identification of prognostic factors and therefore prevention of nasal surgery with bad
      outcome.

      Further, differences between patients with empty nose syndrome and asymptomatic patients
      after extended intranasal surgery, concerning trigeminal perception and TRP channel
      expression will be investigated.
