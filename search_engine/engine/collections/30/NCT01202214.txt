      receptor antagonist which is being developed for the treatment of asthma. This will be a
      two-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single (Part A)
      and repeat (Part B) oral doses of GSK1440115 in healthy adult male and female (of non-child
      bearing potential) subjects. This study will be a randomized, single-blind,
      placebo-controlled, dose escalation design. Part A will evaluate a single dose of GSK1440115.
      Part B will evaluate repeat daily doses for 7 days.
