      encompasses their hip as part of the standard clinical evaluation for hip surgery. This
      provides an opportunity to perform an MSK ultrasound at the same time.

      Both CT and MSK have established imaging techniques of soft tissue. Both techniques provide a
      2D digital slice representation. Although the image is black and white, there are a large
      number of intervals, up to 255, between the two extremes of black and white, termed
      grayscale. The application of an algorithm based upon the grayscale is used to define the
      different characteristics of the muscle, e.g. striated muscle versus fat infiltration. The
      algorithms used to measure muscle characteristics are entirely dependent on the originating
      imaging source. This means that an estimate of adipose using the CT algorithm is entirely
      independent of the algorithm applied to the MSK estimation of adipose.

      This study, therefore, aims to determine how well the two imaging techniques correlate with
      each other when IMAT is measured by the two separate techniques.
