      important areas of daily living for people with scleroderma: pain, depression, and distress
      about disfigurement. The study will also examine the effect of clinical depression on impact
      of the psychological treatments. Because psychological interventions requiring a trained
      professional can be costly and are often not available to the majority of patients, the study
      will also examine the efficacy of a self-help intervention.

      The study will recruit 201 patients with systemic sclerosis who report symptoms of pain,
      depression, or distress about disfigurement and will randomly assign them to one of three
      interventions: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, self-help cognitive behavioral
      intervention facilitated by a psychologist, or a disease/health education intervention. An
      individual blinded to intervention assignment will collect measures of pain, functioning,
      distress about disfigurement, and mood at baseline and following the 8-week intervention
      period.

      Both the cognitive-behavioral self-help materials and the educational materials (eight
      written chapters and audiotapes) will be designed for home use but will be supplemented by
      two individual sessions and two telephone contacts with the professional. Patients will be
      followed for 1 year after completing the active intervention phase.

      These findings will increase understanding of the quality of life of individuals with
      scleroderma and determine whether self-help interventions can be used effectively to manage
      pain, depression, and distress about disfigurement.
