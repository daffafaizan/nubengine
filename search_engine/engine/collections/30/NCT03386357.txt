    
      This is an open-label, randomized, prospective, multicenter phase II clinical trial of
      pembrolizumab with or without local radiotherapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
      HNSCC after progression to platinum-based therapy.

      All patients will receive pembrolizumab 200mg absolute dose administered every third week.
      Patients in treatment arm A will receive radiotherapy of one, two or three metastases with a
      total tumor volume of at least 10cmÂ³ intended to induce tumor cell death acting as an in situ
      vaccination. Radiotherapy will be performed conventionally fractioned with single doses of
      3Gy to a total dose of 36Gy. There will be a strict time schedule. Radiotherapy will always
      start on Wednesday. After application of the third radiation dose (Friday) the patients will
      receive pembrolizumab. After an interruption of radiotherapy for two days (Saturday, Sunday),
      radiotherapy will be continued. Pembrolizumab will be continued on an every three week
      schedule until confirmed disease progression according to iRECIST criteria, unacceptable
      toxicity, patient's wish to stop therapy or a maximal treatment time of 12 months.

      Tumor assessment will be performed every 9 weeks and will be evaluated according to iRECIST
      and RECIST. For each patient the same assessment method will be used throughout the study.
      Toxicity will be assessed according to CTCAE 4.0.
