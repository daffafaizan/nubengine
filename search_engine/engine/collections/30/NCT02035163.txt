      concomitant with cardiac surgery have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with atrial
      fibrillation. Cryoablation of atrial fibrillation recently has been shown to lead to outcomes
      that were at least equivalent to those reported for other energy modalities over both short-
      and medium-term follow-up times.
