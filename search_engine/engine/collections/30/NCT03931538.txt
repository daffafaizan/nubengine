      offers a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity than conventional culture methods in
      the identification of UTI pathogens as determined by the previous prospective comparison
      study. Additionally, conventional methods are often inadequate in the case of polymicrobial
      infections. More accurate and timely pathogen identification allows for prompt and more
      targeted treatment with less reliance on empiric therapy and decreased rates of antibiotic
      therapy changes and retreatment. This leads to more favorable patient outcomes and decreases
      the development of resistant organisms.
