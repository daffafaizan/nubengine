      rotator cuff. The two most common treatments at this point in time are arthroscopic cuff
      repair with and without acromioplasty. The purpose of acromioplasty is to create adequate
      space for the rotator cuff tendons. Arthroscopic acromioplasty involves the removal of the
      subacromial bursa, resection of the coracoacromial ligament and anteroinferior portion of the
      acromion, and resection of any osteophytes from the acromioclavicular joint that are thought
      to be contributing to impingement. However, acromioplasty without cuff repair has been
      reported to have both good and poor results, showing that the technique may be suspect in
      repair of full thickness tears alone.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic cuff repair with
      acromioplasty to arthroscopic cuff repair without acromioplasty in repair of full thickness
      tears of the rotator cuff.

      We hypothesize that there will be a significant clinical improvement in quality of life in
      patients who receive a rotator cuff repair without acromioplasty compared to those who
      receive a cuff repair with acromioplasty.
