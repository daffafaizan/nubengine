      resource utilisation prior to COPD diagnosis (including lower respiratory tract infections
      [LRTIs], consultations and hospitalisations) could be used as 'flags' to aid earlier
      diagnosis, and 2) characterize comorbid conditions present at the time of COPD diagnosis, and
      evaluate the relationship to COPD disease severity and age at diagnosis.
