      chemotherapy and radiotherapy to lower the risk of local recurrence. In recent years, an
      increasing number of retrospective and prospective observational studies have indicated that
      a subset of patients may avoid surgery altogether if they can achieve a complete response to
      chemoradiotherapy. These studies have mainly focused on locally advanced tumors with a high
      risk of local recurrence. Smaller, less advanced tumors appear to respond better to
      chemoradiotherapy, but the optimal treatment for non-surgical management has not been
      established. Prospective trials, including the previous Danish Watchful Waiting trials
      (NCT00952926, NCT02438839) in early rectal cancer have demonstrated high levels of organ
      preservation with dose-escalation, but it is unclear whether this was primarily due to tumor
      stage or dose level. High-level evidence is currently absent for the question of radiotherapy
      dose, especially in early stage cancers.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate if a higher dose of radiotherapy is superior
      compared to a standard dose in patients with early rectal cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy
      with curative intent.
