      I. Determine the safety, dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of daily RAD001
      (everolimus) when given in combination with a fixed dose of weekly cetuximab in patients with
      solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether a pharmacokinetic interaction exists between RAD001 and CETUXIMAB in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine preliminary clinical evidence of anti-tumor activity by time to progression and
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria with this regimen.

      III. Determine the association between clinical outcomes and biologic markers that may
      predict sensitivity of a tumor in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of this regimen on post-therapy tumor and/or skin
      specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -14 and then 1-28. Patients
      also receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days -7 and then once weekly
      beginning on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for at least 1
      year.
