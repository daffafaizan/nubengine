      (DRD2) and has been effectively and safely employed for over half a century in the treatment
      of psychiatric disorders. CPZ displays a series of remarkable bio-molecular effects in cancer
      cells, as inhibition of cell growth, nuclear aberrations, inhibition of the phosphoinositide
      3-kinase/mammilian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) axis, induction of cytotoxic autophagy,
      inhibition of glutamate and DRD2 receptors.
