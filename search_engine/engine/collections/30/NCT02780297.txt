      important in stone formation, including primary hyperoxaluria, cystinuria, Dent disease, and
      adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (APRTd). Patients with these disorders
      experience recurring stones from childhood and are at high risk for chronic kidney disease
      caused by crystal nephropathy. Enteric hyperoxaluria is an acquired disease characterized by
      hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate crystal nephropathy associated with chronic kidney disease,
      and in that respect similar to the inherited stone diseases. The investigators will collect
      longitudinal data of individual patients in order to provide clues about potentially
      modifiable factors that influence disease severity and identify factors leading to kidney
      injury. the investigator will measure blood and urinary markers of inflammation and determine
      relationship to the disease course. Cross-comparisons among the disorders will allow to
      better evaluate mechanisms of renal dysfunction in these diseases.
