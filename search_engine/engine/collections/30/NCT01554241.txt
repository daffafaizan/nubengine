      unbound 25-OH vitamin D3 to supplemental vitamin D3 at daily doses of 800 (currently
      recommended for the elderly), 2000, and 4000 IU or 50,000 IU/weekly in a randomized blinded
      investigation of 16 weeks duration. The investigators will also compare the efficacy of each
      dosing regimen in achieving 25-OH vitamin D levels >20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and identify
      covariates that contribute to inter-individual variation in the dose response relationship.
      In patients with osteoporosis, relationships between unbound vs. total 25-OH on intact
      parathyroid hormone and a marker of bone resorption (beta-Ctx) will be analyzed. The
      investigators will also examine responses of inflammatory cytokines.

      Note: as of April 8,2014, there will be no further enrollment in the 50,000 IU/weekly dose
      group
