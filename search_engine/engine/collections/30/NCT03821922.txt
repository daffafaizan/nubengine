      control women matched for maternal and gestational age were enrolled in the study. All the
      subjects underwent antepartum screening in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen
      University. Blood samples were obtained after overnight fasting at the first, second and
      third trimester respectively. Serum FGF23 levels were determined by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were correlated with anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine
      parameters.

      Data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 database. The results were expressed as mean Â± standard
      deviations or median with interquartile range. Differences between groups were assessed by
      Student's unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi-square test as appropriate.
      Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank correlation method. To identify
      independent relationships and adjust the effects of covariates, multiple linear regression
      analyses were performed. P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
