      throughout the MICU admission when available. Stool Bio specimens will be recorded/coded and
      processed by the investigators. Stool Bio specimens will be analyzed for 16sRNA and
      metabolomics. Surveys will be conducted at study entry, in addition to 6 months and 12 months
      following discharge.

      By longitudinally sampling discarded biospecimens from subjects throughout their MICU
      admission in additionally to describing long term following up. We will be able to correlate
      changes in the microbiome with clinical data, and follow up surveys to identify factors that
      may impact the composition of the microbiome and their impact on clinical outcomes.
