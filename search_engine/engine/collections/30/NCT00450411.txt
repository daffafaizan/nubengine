      Primary

        -  Determine the late treatment-related gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU)
           adverse events in patients with locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate
           previously treated with external-beam radiotherapy who are currently receiving
           transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103 brachytherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the acute treatment-related GI and GU adverse events in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease-specific survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine clinical patterns of tumor recurrence (time to local tumor progression or
           distant failure) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to biochemical failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the post-brachytherapy dosimetric coverage in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study.

      Patients undergo transperineal ultrasound-guided iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103
      brachytherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study.
