    
      Amblyopia is the condition in which there is a decrease in monocular visual acuity or, less
      frequently, binocular, in absence of structural anomalies or ocular pathology. It is a
      reversible condition that affects up to 5% of the population, and that is the result of an
      abnormal visual experience during the most sensitive period of visual development.

      The aim of this study is reviewing, analyzing and, if applicable, updating the current
      treatment model for amblyopia.

      A randomized clinical trial will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the monocular
      treatment with action video-games in comparison with the occlusion therapy alone in amblyopic
      patients, and the satisfaction with the different evaluated treatments. The participants will
      be distributed in two groups. The first group will include those participants who will follow
      a daily occlusive treatment and the second group will include patients who will be treated
      with monocular therapy with video-games.The sample will include subjects between 4 to 10
      years old with a diagnosis of refractive and / or strabismic amblyopia.
