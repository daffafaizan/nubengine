        -  To determine the feasibility and acute tolerability of intraoperative electron
           radiotherapy (IOERT) and external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after lumpectomy in women
           with stage I or II breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy.

        -  To determine the local tumor control and distant tumor control rates in these patients.

        -  To determine the long-term side effects and cosmetic outcome of IOERT to the tumor bed
           and EBRT after lumpectomy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard lumpectomy. Patients with negative lymph nodes undergo
      intraoperative electron radiotherapy to the tumor bed. Beginning 2-8 weeks after surgery,
      patients undergo whole breast external beam radiotherapy once daily for 24-27 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 8 years.
