      months of life causing appreciable distress for both parents and pediatricians. The reported
      incidence of infantile colic ranges from 3% to 28% in prospective studies and up to 40% in
      retrospective surveys.

      The pathogenesis of infantile colic remains elusive despite decades of research. It appears
      that multiple independent origins might be involved: amongst them infant's difficult
      temperament, inadequate mother-infant communication or maternal anxiety, transient lactase
      deficiency, exposure to cow's milk, abnormal gastrointestinal function, maternal smoking
      during pregnancy or after delivery. Consequently, various treatment approaches have been
      tried to alleviate this condition.

      Recent studies have suggested that changes of intestinal microflora of a newborn may play an
      important role in pathogenesis of infantile colic. Therefore, dietary supplementation with
      probiotics has been proposed for the improvement of this condition.
