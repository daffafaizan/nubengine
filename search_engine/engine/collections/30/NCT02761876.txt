      areas. Our inception research in Singida identified five pressing issues faced by smallholder
      farmers that may contribute to this high rate of stunting. They are (A) hierarchical, or "top
      down" farmer education, (B) low soil fertility and little knowledge of agroecological
      solutions, (C) high levels of gender inequality and high workloads for women, (D) food
      insecurity and low dietary diversity, and (E) sub-optimal infant and young child feeding.
      Singida Nutrition and Agroecology Project (SNAP) is a randomized effectiveness trial of a
      participatory, agroecological peer farmer education intervention. Each intervention village
      will choose 2 mentor farmers, 1 man and 1 woman, who will participate in a field visit to and
      training by existing mentor farmers in Malawi and a two week long follow-up and refresher
      trainings in Tanzania integrating agroecology, climate change, nutrition, and gender
      equality. Mentor farmers will then conduct monthly visits to participating households and
      support the households in conducting experimentation with agroecological practices and/or new
      behaviors regarding nutrition and gender equality. Quarterly meetings among mentor farmers
      and biannual meeting of participating farmers within each village will be held to discuss
      progress and challenges of peer education and household experimentations.
