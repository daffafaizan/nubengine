      PLA General Hospital between January 2014 and December 2019. CMR was performed at 7 days and
      6 months after primary PCI to assess the final infarction size(IS), microvascular obstruction
      (MVO), intramyocardial hemorrhage(IMH), area at risk (AAR) and related strain parameters. All
      patients will be followed up by 5 years after addimission index. Cardiovascular events
      concluding stroke, repeat revascularization, rehospitalization for acute heart failure,
      nonfatal myocardial infarction, and all cause death. All adverse clinical events as well as
      study end points were monitored and adjudicated by the independent event committee.
