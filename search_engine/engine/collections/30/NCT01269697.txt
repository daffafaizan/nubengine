      with lutein and zeaxanthin to increase their plasma concentration and the density of macular
      pigment, in subjects at high genetic risk for AMD (1st generation stemming from parent
      affected by DMLA). This study is a multicentric, double blind, randomized clinical trial of
      supplementation versus placebo
