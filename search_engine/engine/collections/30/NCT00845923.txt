      is composed of a 1-week non-treatment Baseline Period (Day -7 to -1), during which subjects
      will be required to complete a Daily Diary assessing overall pain and sleep interference. The
      1-week Baseline Period will be followed by a 4-week Treatment Period, in which subjects will
      apply the Civamide Patch (0.015%) daily 12 hours per day, for a period of 4 weeks, complete a
      Daily Diary assessing overall pain and sleep interference, followed by a 2-week
      Post-Treatment Observation Period. In the course of the study, subjects will visit the clinic
      a total of five times for physical examinations, vital signs, review of diaries, and
      distribution and collection of test patches. Efficacy assessment will be the mean change from
      Baseline Period in efficacy variables during the course of the study.
