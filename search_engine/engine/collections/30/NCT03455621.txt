      after the use of increasing amounts of fluoride toothpaste. Children from 18 to 42 months
      from a community daycare participated. The study had a crossover and blind design. The
      amounts of toothpastes tested were: 1. A pea-size amount (0.3 g) of a non-F toothpaste; 2.
      0.025 g of a F toothpaste (1,100 ppm F, as NaF); 3. 0.05 g of the same F toothpaste; 4. 0.1 g
      of the same F toothpaste; or 5. 0.3 g (pea-size) of the same F toothpaste. Children were to
      brush their teeth with the designated amount of toothpaste twice/day from Monday to Friday.
      In order to allow biofilm accumulation, caregivers were instructed to brush only the occlusal
      surfaces of primary molars. On Friday morning, at least one hour after breakfast, saliva and
      one biofilm sample from the right or left hemiarch were collected and analyzed for fluoride
      concentration. Then, brushing with the respective amount of toothpaste was performed, and
      saliva was collected 5, 15 and 30 min later. The biofilm from the other side of the mouth was
      collected after 30 min. Fluoride concentration in saliva and biofilm samples was determined
      with an ion-specific electrode.
