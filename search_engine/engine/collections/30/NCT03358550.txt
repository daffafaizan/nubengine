      corrected right eyes of 39 subjects aged from 18 to 40 years were investigated in this
      randomized, cross-sectional study. Accommodation measurements in photopic luminance were
      taken for 6 m of empty field and for optotype fixation at 2 m, 1 m and 0.5 m. At scotopic
      luminance, dark focus of accommodation was examined directly after darkening and after 10 min
      of dark adaptation. After adaptation, subjects had to visualize imaginary targets in the four
      distances while accommodation was measured.
