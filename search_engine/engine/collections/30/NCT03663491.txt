      endoscopy (EGD). In most cases, peroral gastroscopy is performed. The aim of this study was
      to evaluate the necessity and outpatients' demand for transnasal gastroscopy (nEGD).

      Methods: A questionnaire was used to assess patients' choice of method, previous experience,
      psychological and sociodemographic data. Furthermore, the patients' satisfaction with and
      potentially perceived discomfort during the examination as well as their preference for a
      method with regard to future examinations was evaluated.
