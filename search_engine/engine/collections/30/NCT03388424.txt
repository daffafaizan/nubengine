      considered the "second brain" of our organism for its bi-directional communication with the
      central nervous system. Microbiota consists of trillions of microorganisms located in all the
      biological cavity, In the intestine it is distributed in ecological niches having multiple
      metabolic activities which influence individual health. Microbiota acts as barrier against
      pathogens, regulating the absorption of nutrients, the production of energy and the
      development of the immune system4. Intestinal bacteria are generally divided into 4 Phylum:
      Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes, in which their proportion shows
      a correlation with individuals health status. When in equilibrium among them, these bacteria
      are essential for the good health of the digestive tract, the good function of immune system
      and for brain performace. The relationships between individual health status and microbiota
      are based on a sort of "mutual cooperation." The balance of the microbiota can be compromised
      by various factors such as environmental, psycho-physical stress, malnutrition (over or low),
      breastfeeding, chronic diseases, oncology and pharmacological treatments (especially
      antibiotics and chemotherapics). This disequilibrium leads to altered capability of bacteria
      to properly extract calories from food affecting the trend of many pathophisilogical status
      such as obesity, allergic states, inflammatory bowel syndromes cardiovascular diseases,
      metabolic, oncological and neurodegenerative diseases. The impact of dysbiosis on today's
      society affects over 70% of the world population
