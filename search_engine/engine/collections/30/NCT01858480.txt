      D-ribose administered via peripheral intravenous line for 24 hours to stabilized hospitalized
      patients following standard of care treatment for acute decompensation of CHF, followed by
      oral dosing of D-ribose three times a daily through the remainder of the inpatient hospital
      stay and outpatient period of 3 months. Subjects will complete Pretreatment Screening
      procedures only after the Investigator has established that they have met the pre-specified
      criteria for stabilization of heart failure, and be randomized to treatment no more than 7
      days after admission to the hospital.
