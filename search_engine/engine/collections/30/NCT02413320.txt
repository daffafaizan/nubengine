      pathological and molecular similarities which have led to the exploration of DNA damaging
      agents like platinum compounds in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Recent studies
      demonstrate that addition of neoadjuvant carboplatin to
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/taxane-based chemotherapy improves pathological complete
      response in patients with stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer but also increase
      toxicity.

      A recent study reported encouraging pathological complete response rates with a
      non-anthracycline carboplatin plus docetaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in a cohort of
      49 triple negative breast cancer patients. This chemotherapy regimen of carboplatin plus
      docetaxel yielded an overall pathological complete response rate of 65% in unselected
      triple-negative breast cancer with pathological complete response rates of 61% in sporadic
      and 77% in germline BRCA-associated triple-negative breast cancer. The chemotherapy regimen
      of carboplatin/docetaxel is well tolerated and should be studied further and compared with
      regimens that add carboplatin to the standard anthracycline/taxane containing regimens.

      This is the basis for the proposed randomized neoadjuvant phase II study to further estimate
      and compare pathological complete response rates of carboplatin plus docetaxel x 6 cycles to
      carboplatin plus paclitaxel x 4 cycles followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide x 4
      cycles in stage I-III triple negative-breast cancer.
