    
      The Zephyr Valve Registry (ZEVR) is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective Registry. The
      objective of this Registry is to provide ongoing safety and effectiveness assessment of the
      Zephyr Valve treatment of patients with hyperinflation associated with severe emphysema, in
      regions of the lung that have little to no collateral ventilation.

      Approximately 150 patients undergoing Zephyr Valve treatment in the commercial setting will
      be enrolled and followed out to 3 years. Assessments will be conducted at 45-days, 6-months,
      12-months, 24-months and 36-months post-procedure. The Zephyr Valve Registry will be
      conducted at a minimum of 5, and a maximum of 10 clinical sites.

      Subjects prescribed Zephyr Valve treatment for their emphysema will be consented and will be
      enrolled only after determination of little to no collateral ventilation between target and
      ipsilateral lobes. Safety and effectiveness of the Zephyr Valve treatment will be evaluated
      post-treatment based on data collected out to 3 years after the treatment.
