    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), 4-way crossover (method
      used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another), placebo- and
      positive-controlled (the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to an inactive
      substance and a standard treatment or procedure), single site, multiple dose study. The study
      has 3 phases: a Screening Phase (up to 35 days); a Double-blind Treatment Phase (4 treatment
      periods with a washout period of 7 to 15 days); and a Post-treatment Phase (Day 5 of Period 4
      or at the time of early withdrawal). All eligible participants will receive each of the 4
      treatments: tramadol HCl at therapeutic dose of 400 milligram per day (mg/day), tramadol HCl
      at supratherapeutic dose of 600 mg/day, placebo, and positive control moxifloxacin 400 mg; in
      any of the treatment period as per assigned treatment sequence. The total duration of each
      participant's participation will be up to a maximum of 100 days. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
