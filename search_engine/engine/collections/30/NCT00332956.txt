    
      Primary Objective: To select a dosage and schedule of rF1V vaccine for further study based on
      the immune response to F1 and V antigens up to Day 210.

      Secondary Objectives: 1) To assess the safety of three injections of rF1V vaccine
      administered IM at two dosage levels.

      2) To assess the onset and duration of the humoral immune response to F1 and V antigens.

      3) To assess the humoral immune response to rF1V antigen. 4) To collect and store blood
      samples for future plague related research.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      To assess additional humoral immune responses to rF1V vaccine antigens.
