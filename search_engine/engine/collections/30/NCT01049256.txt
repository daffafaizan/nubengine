      to changes in carbon dioxide), which is one of the principle determinants of whether people
      with heart failure develop abnormal breathing patterns We have shown in a pilot study that
      administering sinusoidal patterns of inspired carbon dioxide produces similar sinusoidal
      responses in ventilation. We aim to test our method for measuring chemosensitivity, which
      uses sinusoidal carbon dioxide stimuli (similar to those that drive the oscillations in
      ventilation found in periodic breathing). We aim to show that how the cycle time of carbon
      dioxide administered affects the resulting ventilatory oscillations and therefore that when
      measuring the chemoreflex clinically, it is important to deliver carbon dioxide stimuli that
      replicate the cycle time of oscillations in carbon dioxide seen in periodic breathing
      (typically approximately one minute).
