      addition of a brief fear retrieval trial prior to treatment, and the use of compound
      extinction during treatment. The goal of the study is to determine whether these behavioral
      techniques enhance the efficacy of exposure therapy, one of the most empirically supported
      treatments for anxiety disorders. Individuals between the ages of 18-65 with elevated fear of
      spiders or fear of snakes are randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions (1)
      standard exposure therapy, (2) exposure therapy with fear retrieval augmentation, (3)
      exposure therapy with compound extinction augmentation, and (4) exposure therapy with fear
      retrieval and compound extinction augmentations. All participants undergo an online prescreen
      and a face-to-face screening assessment to determine eligibility and baseline (pre-treatment)
      symptom severity. Participants additionally complete assessments directly after treatment
      (post-treatment), and approximately one week after treatment (follow-up). The pre-treatment
      assessment occurs 1-14 days prior to treatment, the post-treatment assessment occurs during
      the treatment visit as soon as the treatment procedure is complete, and the follow-up
      assessment occurs within a window of 6-14 days after the completion of treatment.
      Participants complete two behavioral approach tests (in the treatment context and in the
      generalization context) at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up. Participants
      complete a battery of self-report questionnaires at pre-treatment and follow-up.
