    
      The population for this open-label study includes patients who successfully complete one of
      the randomized, controlled (placebo or comparator) blinded Phase 3 base studies (LIB003-003,
      LIB003-004, LIB003-005, LIB003-006, LIB003-008, and LIB003-011). Patients will continue to
      maintain their existing oral lipid-lowering therapy (LLT). It will also include de novo HoFH
      patients, who have not participated LIB003-003 HoFH Phase 3 trial study who are either 6 to
      17 years of age on stable oral LLT or are on LLT and stable apheresis.

      Following completion of a base study and providing informed consent, patients will receive
      doses of LIB003 300 mg Q4W (<31 days) on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,
      40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, and 68. Patients will be seen in the clinic Q4W (<31 days) for at
      least the initial 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks (Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72) with the
      interim Q4W (<31 days) doses administered at home. De novo HoFH patients will continue with
      clinic visits Q4W (<31 days) throughout the first 24 weeks and then continue dosing at home
      Q4W (<31 days) with clinic visits every 12 weeks.

      Patients may begin the OLE on the final visit of their prior study after completion of all
      requirements for that trial. Their lipids will remain blinded (to patient, study staff and
      sponsor) until week 4 to avoid any unblinding of the prior trial. Thereafter lipid results
      will be unblinded throughout the remainder of the 72 week trial.
