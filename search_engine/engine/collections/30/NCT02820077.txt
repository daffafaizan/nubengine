      rate. Several endoscopic hemostasis techniques have been tested, but results were
      disappointing. Re-bleeding and mortality rates are still high.

      Hemostatic powder is a promising therapy for tumor bleeding, since it can be applied over
      large surfaces. Bleeding from a tumor lesion often occurs diffusely on the surface of the
      tumor rather than from a specific vessel.
