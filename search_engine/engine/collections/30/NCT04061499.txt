      pain, stiffness, and weakness the most frequently reported symptoms. Weakness is a major
      concern as decreased lower extremity strength is a contributor to balance and other mobility
      limitations that increase fall risk in the aging population. Weakness in the primary hip
      muscles in particular have been shown to contribute to gait variability and altered mechanics
      of stepping when recovering from a balance perturbation. Contributing factors for these
      strength deficits are multifactorial and may include decreased muscle mass/size, changes in
      muscle composition, and/or a decreased ability to activate the muscle. Intramuscular fat
      infiltration (IMAT), has been reported in several conditions affecting older adults, and has
      been shown to be more modifiable at lower levels, suggesting that earlier detection and
      intervention may be important. CT and MRI are both commonly used to measure these relevant
      muscle properties, but ultrasound imaging may be valid alternative, and has the advantage of
      being more accessible to clinicians in many settings. The investigators hypothesize that
      cross-sectional area (CSA) and IMAT of the hip and lumbar musculature will be significantly
      altered in individuals with hip OA (affected limb) compared to that seen in similar-aged
      control participants, and that larger differences in CSA and IMAT will be positively
      correlated with OA severity, increased impairment, pain, and disability.
