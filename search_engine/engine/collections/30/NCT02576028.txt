      show important differences between types and numbers of treatment sessions. Objectives are to
      investigate effectiveness of Fascial Manipulation when associated to a standard protocol of
      care.

      Methods. Fifty-one subjects operated with THA were randomized into two groups, both followed
      a standard protocol of care where two sessions were replaced with Fascial Manipulation in the
      study group. Functional outcomes measures collected before and after treatment and at the end
      of the rehabilitation program included Harris Hip Score, Time Up and Go test, articular range
      of motion and verbal numerical scale.
