      ii) the experimental group will present a significantly greater improvement in the tests
      evaluated by their parents after the intervention compared to the passive control group. All
      hypotheses will be controlled for age, estimate of IQ and socioeconomic status, as well as
      previous experience in board games and other cognitive activities.
