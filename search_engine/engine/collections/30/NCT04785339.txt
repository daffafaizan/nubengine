      need to develop an evidence-based interventions reducing stress experienced by this
      population that can be easily scalable across diverse clinical settings and geographically
      distinct immigrant communities. Thus, the purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test
      a novel group acculturative stress intervention for Latinx immigrants.

      Study activities Aim 1: Co-develop an acculturation stress intervention for adult Latinx
      immigrants to decrease stress, increase resilience, and prevent declines in mental and
      physical health.

      Aim 2: Examine the preliminary clinical impact, feasibility, and acceptability of a group
      acculturative stress in Latinx immigrants and collect information to inform subsequent
      implementation.

      Aim 2a: Conduct pilot testing of the group intervention in Latinx immigrant participants
      (N=24-30)to evaluate its preliminary clinical impact from baseline to post-assessment on
      stress, resilience, and health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety, self-rated health).

      Aim 2b: Characterize the inner and outer context, facilitators, barriers, intent to adopt,
      and resources across the Duke University Health System through multiple stakeholder
      interviews with providers and administrators (n=8-10).
