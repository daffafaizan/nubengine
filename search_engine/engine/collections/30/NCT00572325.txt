    
      Eligible patients (see below) will receive radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the
      initially involved mediastinal lymph nodes to the following MLD (Mean Lung Dose):

        -  MLD=19 Gy when Fev1 and DLCO>50% of the predicted value

        -  MLD=15 Gy when Fev1 and/or DLCO 40-49% of the predicted value

        -  MLD=10 Gy when Fev1 and/or DLCO <40% of the predicted value

      Other dose-constrains: spinal cord max: 54 Gy, brachial plexus (Dmax):66 Gy Minimum tumor
      dose:54 Gy. Maximal tumor dose:69 Gy

      Radiotherapy will be delivered as follows:

        1. First 3 weeks: 30 fractions: twice-daily fractions of 1.5 Gy, with 8 to 10 h as
           interfraction-interval, 5 days per week Total dose;45Gy/30 fractions

        2. Thereafter: once-daily fractions of 2.0 Gy, 5 days per week until the target dose has
           been reached.

      The radiation doses will be specified according to ICRU 50. Lung density corrections will be
      applied, as well as all standard QA procedures. Technical requirements are the same as in
      standard practice at MAASTRO clinic.

      Chemotherapy schedules allowed:

        1. 1-2 cycles induction chemotherapy; any type will be registered.

        2. concurrent part:(day1= first day of radiotherapy)

             1. cisplatin - vinorelbine

                  -  Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 day 2 and day 9

                  -  Vinorelbine 20 mg/m2 day 2 and day 9

                  -  Cisplatin 40mg/m2 day 23

                  -  Vinorelbine 15mg/m2 day 23 and day 30

             2. cisplatin - docetaxel

                  -  Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 day 2,9 and 29

                  -  Docetaxel 20 mg/m2 day 2, 9, 16, 23 and 29

             3. cisplatin - etoposide

                  -  Cisplatin 60 mg/m2 day 1

                  -  Docetaxel 120 mg/m2 day 1-3

      Q 3 weeks, 3 cycles

      When the calculated creatinin clearance is less than 60 ml/min, cisplatin may be substituted
      for carboplatin
