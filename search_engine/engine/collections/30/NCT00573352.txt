      relatively mild forms such as tendonitis and bursitis to crippling forms as rheumatoid
      arthritis. Pain syndromes include fibromyalgia and arthritis-related disorders as lupus
      erythematosus that involve every part of the body. There are forms of the disease, such as
      gout that almost nobody connects with arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of
      arthritis.

      The objective for the study is to access the possibility of using far infrared radiation for
      pain management.
