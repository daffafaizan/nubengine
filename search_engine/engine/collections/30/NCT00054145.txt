        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory,
           locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with perifosine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the stable disease rate, time to disease progression, objective response
           duration, and duration of stable disease in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate potential endpoints, including phosphorylated ERK, PKB, and SAPK,
           phosphorylated PKC alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms, p21 ^WAF1; and activated capase-3 in
           tumor biopsies, with clinical outcome in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine on days 1 and 2 and once daily on days
      3-21 during course 1. Patients receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-21 in each
      subsequent course. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) may receive 2 additional
      courses beyond the CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
