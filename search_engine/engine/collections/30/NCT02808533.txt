      functioning. While >70% of individuals with first episode illness respond to antipsychotics
      (APs), there remains a subgroup left with persisting psychotic symptoms. For these
      individuals, clozapine (CLZ) is also the sole drug with treatment superiority, but also
      carries the greatest metabolic liability. Another complicating factor in those treated with
      CLZ is the observation that while effective in some, 40-70% of individuals fail to show
      significant improvement with CLZ, often leading to augmentation strategies. While controlled
      trials are, in general lacking, a number of agents have been suggested as useful. One such
      group of medications includes the anticonvulsants.

      Topiramate represents one of the newer anticonvulsant agents approved for the treatment of
      epilepsy and prophylaxis of migraines. Importantly, topiramate possesses a weight-reducing
      effect that has been substantiated by a meta-analysis in non-psychiatric patients.
      Interestingly, topiramate has been studied as an adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia with some evidence demonstrating small to moderate benefits with topiramate
      augmentation on psychopathology. However, these benefits must also be weighed against reports
      (primarily from epilepsy populations), that topiramate may cause cognitive dysfunction.

      This study will examine:

        1. Topiramate-related effects on weight

        2. Topiramate-related effects on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity

        3. Topiramate-related effects on psychopathology and cognition

        4. Topiramate-related effects on adiposity
