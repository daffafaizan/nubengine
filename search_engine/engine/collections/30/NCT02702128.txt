      bleeding during surgery to orthognathism. Our hypothesis is that this preventive treatment is
      not enough reduces bleeding to cause a change in patient management (count additional blood
      count, extra padding, transfusion).

      Prospective equivalence trial type controlled by two parallel group, randomized, triple-blind
      (patient, surgical team, anesthesia team).

        -  EXACYL速 Group: 1 syringe 1g EXACYL速 on one hour + 1 syringe 1g EXACYL速 on 8 hours

        -  Control group: 1 syringe 30 mL of saline on one hour + 1 syringe 30 mL saline on 8 hours
           Main criteria is amount of blood during the entire hospitalization: bleeding during
           surgery completed in the amount of blood present in the suction drains and nasogastric
           tube until ablation thereof.
