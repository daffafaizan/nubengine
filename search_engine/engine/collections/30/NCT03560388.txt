      intense anxiety prior to surgery, reflecting the accompanying uncertainty regarding the
      diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of their illness. Following operation, pain and other
      quality of life-related concerns further exacerbate the emotional distress, which may itself
      aggravate pain and other symptoms. Clinical, controlled studied among patients with
      gynecological cancer undergoing chemotherapy had demonstrated effectiveness of complementary
      and integrative medicine (CIM) treatments for improving quality of life (QOL) and related
      symptoms, such as pain, gastro-intestinal concerns, fatigue, and anxiety.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to explore the impact of CIM treatments (including
      acupuncture) on anxiety, pain, and general QOL of patients referred to gynecological oncology
      surgery. The investigators' working hypothesis is that an intensive CIM treatment program,
      provided to patients within 24 hours prior to and during surgery will reduce perioperative
      anxiety and pain, and will reduce the need for intra-operative and post-operative analgesia.
