      improved long-term survival. Furthermore, CTO is an independent predictor for the occurrence
      of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and implantable
      cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). One may speculate that a successful CTO recanalization
      may provide electrical stability. However, no data are available on the incidence of
      sustained VA in this patient population.

      Objective: The objective of the present pilot study is to assess the incidence of sustained
      VA in 3 CTO groups: patients with successful percutaneous CTO recanalization (group A),
      patients with failed percutaneous CTO recanalization (group B), and patients with untreated
      CTO (group C).

      Study design: Three-arm pilot study of patients with CTO.

      Study population: A total of 90 patients will be enrolled. Intervention: A Medtronic Reveal
      LINQâ„¢ Insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) will be implanted in every patient to continuously
      monitor heart rhythm during the follow-up period.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: To assess the incidence of VA defined as sustained
      ventricular tachycardia >30 s or ventricular fibrillation.
