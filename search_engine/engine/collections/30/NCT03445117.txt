      in the elderly. While recommended vaccines can reduce disease burden, vaccine uptake remains
      very low in Singapore, with approximately only 10% of elderly appropriately vaccinated for
      either disease. Improving vaccine uptake rates could be effected through private sector
      primary care clinics, which are highly accessible in Singapore. An intervention bundle we
      piloted in one clinic comprised physician reminders and patient-targeted posters and
      brochures. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccine rates both increased by >30% over the baseline,
      although half of eligible patients remained unvaccinated. There is thus scope to devise a
      more effective intervention bundle and demonstrate its efficacy through a more robust and
      generalisable study design.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention bundle deployed in general
      practice clinics to promote influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake among elderly patients.
      The intervention bundle components include educational materials such as posters and flyers,
      which also serve as reminder slips for attending physicians. The intervention will be
      implemented in a two-arm cluster randomised crossover trial in up to 30 primary care clinics.
      Control arm clinics will receive no interventions. Clinics will be randomised into either of
      the two arms for a period of 3 months, followed by a washout of 1 month before a crossover is
      performed. The investigators will subsequently compare vaccination rates during intervention
      and control periods to provide evidence for effectiveness of the intervention.
