    
      The physiologic mechanisms mediating the glucose-lowering effect of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass
      (RYGB) or post-Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) are unknown. The reduction in glucose
      excursions prior to weight loss has lead to postulates that the incretin hormone, GLP-1, may
      play an important role.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of GLP-1 in causing extreme postprandial
      glucose reductions in a subset of post-bariatric patients through the pharmacologic blockade
      of the GLP-1 receptor in post-RYGB or post-VSG patients with severe symptomatic hypoglycemia.
