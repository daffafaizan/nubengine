        1. To evaluate the three-month success rate for AV fistulas constructed while using
           regional anesthesia against those constructed while using local anesthesia. Success will
           be evaluated by a dialysis access ultrasound, which will be performed three months after
           completion of the procedure. Successful will be defined as a mean blood flow of 600
           ml/min and above, or receiving hemodialysis using the newly created AV fistula.

        2. To evaluate the immediate (within 3 days) and long-term complications three months after
           AV fistula construction under regional anesthesia or local anesthesia.

      The secondary objective of the study is to use a short questionnaire survey To assess patient
      comfort level after creation of AV fistula (e.g. nausea, analgesia).
