      tazemetostat + doxorubicin, as well as to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      RP3D. The phase 3 portion of the clinical trial aims to compare tazemetostat + doxorubicin to
      the current front-line standard treatment, single-agent doxorubicin + placebo, when used as
      first-line treatment in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic ES.
