      non traumatic primary intracerebral hemorrhage. In vivo diagnosis of these two cerebral
      diseases may be difficult and is based on hematoma location and pattern of cerebral
      microbleeds (CMB) distribution. We aimed to evaluate a multimodal approach including brain
      MRI, Pet AV-45 Amyloid imaging and neuropsychological assessment to improve etiological
      diagnosis of primary intracerebral hemorrhage. 70 patients with acute primary non traumatic
      intracerebral hemorrhage will be prospectively included and two groups will be compared:
      lobar hemorrhage group and deep hemorrhage group. Brain MRI, Pet AV-45 Cerebral Amyloid
      imaging (during the first month) and neuropsychological assessment (Three months later) are
      performed. Differences between the two groups are evaluated for AV45 cortical binding, CMB
      distribution, White Matter Lesions and cognitive profile.
