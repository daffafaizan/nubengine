    
      This is a randomized, double-blind study of PIPE-307 or placebo given as single and multiple
      escalating doses in normal healthy subjects. The study will be conducted in three parts: Part
      1 will be a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study enrolling approximately 48 subjects for a total
      duration of 6 weeks. Part 2 will be a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study enrolling
      approximately 24 subjects for a total duration of 7 weeks, and part 3 will be a selected SAD
      cohort in a fed state to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of PIPE-307,
      enrolling approximately 8 subjects from a selected SAD cohort for a duration of 6 weeks.
      Safety will be assessed by periodic measurement of vital signs, physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms, blood laboratory analyses and occurrence of adverse events (AE).
