      germline mutations in mismatch repair genes that confer a high lifetime risk of colorectal
      cancer (CRC) (60 to 70%). Most CRCs arise from asymptomatic polyps. Development of such
      polyps into cancer can be prevented if polyps are detected early by endoscopy and removed.
      Colonoscopy is proposed every 2 years in LS patients more than 25 years old, and every year
      when colonic neoplasia has been detected. Efficient chemoprevention has the potential to
      represent a cost-effective intervention in these patients and could allow a delay in
      colonoscopic surveillance.

      Several epidemiological studies have shown that regular use of low dose aspirin (75 to 300
      mg/d) is associated with a 20 to 30 % reduction in the risk of sporadic colonic polyps and
      CRC. Four randomised controlled trials (RCT) have also shown a decrease in colorectal polyp
      recurrence. In a pooled analysis of cardio-vascular prevention RCTs, as well as in a
      meta-analysis, daily aspirin was associated with a reduced risk of CRC and CRC associated
      mortality. Aspirin preventive benefit is expected to outweigh its putative side effects in
      high risk patients. The CAPP2 study in Lynch syndrome patients showed that aspirin (300 mg
      x2/d) did not reduce significantly the risk of colorectal neoplasia after 29 months, but an
      extended follow-up (mean 56 months) showed a reduction in colorectal cancer in the aspirin
      group. In this study, the endoscopic follow-up was not optimal with a relatively low
      detection rate of colorectal neoplasia according to usual reported rate when chromo-endoscopy
      is performed. So, the real effect and clinical benefit of aspirin are still to be
      characterised in Lynch syndrome patients.
