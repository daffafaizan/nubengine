      IIA, IIB, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete resection. Cisplatin and
      pemetrexed combination is the standard regimen for lung adenocarcinoma in adjuvant setting.
      The BR. 19 trial reported adjuvant gefitinib after complete resection of early stage
      NSCLC(stage IB 49%, II 38%, III 13%) did not confer disease free survival(DFS) or overall
      survival(OS) advantage in overall population. While the median gefitinib treatment time is
      only 4.8 months. There are only 76 patients with EGFR mutations included in this analysis.
      The study closed prematurely in 2005.

      Activating somatic mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) have been characterized in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC.The EGFR
      mutation rate was 30% in Chinese NSCLC. Patients harboring these mutations in their tumors
      show excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). This randomized phase
      III trial is studying gefitinib and synchronous pemetrexed/cisplatin chenmotherapy to see how
      well it works compared to pemetrexed/cisplatin chenmotherapy alone in treating patients who
      have undergone surgery for stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR activating
      mutation in Asian population.
