    
      This study is an unblinded, randomized controlled cross-over study, which involves taking 2
      different forms of levothyroxine sequentially over a 16 week period. Subjects will have a
      total of 3 visits over this time period. At the first visit, subjects are randomized to
      receive either generic (Sandoz) levothyroxine or Synthroid (Abbott) brand of levothyroxine.
      Blood is drawn for baseline thyroid function studies and other markers which are influenced
      by thyroid hormone at each visit. The second visit is the cross-over visit, and the final
      visit is a close-out visit, after which each subject will resume taking their previous
      formulation of levothyroxine.
