      without significant cardiac (New York Heart Association class IV) disease and not be on
      kidney dialysis. Additionally, after testing, their blood must not contain antibodies to
      mouse proteins. The study requires an intravenous infusion, over 10 minutes, of the
      radiolabeled antibody, followed 48 hours later by a PET/CT scan. A repeat scan is done 5 or 7
      days after infusion of the antibody. A 5 ml blood specimen needs to be furnished 4 and 8
      weeks after the antibody infusion.
