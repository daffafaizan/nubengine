      laser therapy to that of scaling and root planning with hand instruments in nonsurgical
      treatment of chronic periodontitis.Twenty-ﬁve systemically healthy patients with
      moderate-to-advanced periodontal destruction were selected for this study. The quadrants were
      randomly allocated in a split-mouth design to either combined Er:YAG (160 mj/pulse, and 10
      Hz) and Nd:YAG laser (100 mJ/pulse, and 20 Hz) therapy (test group) or scaling root planning
      using hand instruments (control group). At baseline, 1 month, and 3 months after treatment,
      clinical measurements, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD),
      clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing (%) (BOP), were performed and
      gingival crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque samples were taken. The gingival crevicular
      fluid levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were analyzed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total antioxidant status (TAS)/total oxidant status (TOS)
      were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and a novel automatic colorimetric
      method. Quantitative analysis of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf),
      and Treponema denticola (Td) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      procedures.
