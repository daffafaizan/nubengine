      demonstrated an enlarged prostate with or without pubic arch obstruction. After signing the
      informed consent document they will have a loading dose of 240 mg Degarelix and then monthly
      maintenance dose injections of 80 mg until such time as sufficient prostate reduction has
      occured (2-3 months) or they complete the 6 months of required androgen ablation for their
      disease status.
