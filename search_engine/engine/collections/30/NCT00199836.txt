    
      This is a pilot study of patients of HLA-A2 phenotype whose tumor expresses the NY-ESO-1 or
      LAGE-1 antigen. Patients will receive NY-ESO-1b peptide mixed with 0.5mL of Montanide ISA-51
      and 1mg of CpG7909 given every three weeks for four doses by subcutaneous injection. There
      will be a three-week follow-up period after the fourth injection making the cycle 13 weeks
      long. In the absence of toxicity and progressive disease, a second cycle will be offered to
      patients who have received four vaccinations.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the immune response (antibodies, CD8+ T cells, and DTH)
      and safety to vaccination with NY-ESO-1b peptide mixed with CpG 7909 and Montanide in
      patients with cancer expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1. The secondary objective is to document
      tumor responses in patients with evaluable or measurable disease.
