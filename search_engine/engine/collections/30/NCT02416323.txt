    
      This study is a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of AIM HI ("An Individualized
      Mental Health Intervention for ASD"), an intervention designed specifically for
      implementation in community mental health clinics, to reduce problem behavior among
      school-age children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although the individual components
      of AIM HI are well-established evidence-based practice strategies and pilot study data
      indicate that child behavior problems decrease when their community mental health therapists
      deliver AIM HI, the effectiveness of the protocol has not been established. Therefore, the
      primary aims are to test the impact of training community therapists in AIM HI on child and
      family outcomes and determine how child/ family characteristics and level of therapist
      fidelity moderate treatment effects. The secondary aim is to collect initial data on
      implementation outcomes and conduct exploratory analyses to identify barriers and
      facilitators of AIM HI implementation (e.g., intervention, organization, provider
      characteristics). This study has the potential to make a significant impact by building local
      capacity to serve school-age children with ASD in routine service settings, and advancing the
      science on the effectiveness of packaging evidence-based practices (EBPs) for specific
      services settings. It will also produce generalizable knowledge about implementation that can
      be applied for this population/ setting.
