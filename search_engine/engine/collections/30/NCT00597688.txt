      setting of mechanical ventilation. It accounts of 86% of nosocomial pneumonia and in contrast
      to other more common nosocomial infections is accompanied by a mortality rate of upto 76% in
      certain settings. A number of preventive methods have been studied to reduce the rate of VAP
      but a consensus is lacking with regards to appropriate preventive strategies. Studies in
      adults have shown a beneficial effect of oral mucosal application of chlorhexidine but
      similar studies in pediatric population are not available. This research project aims at
      addressing the gap.
