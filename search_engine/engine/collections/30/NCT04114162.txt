    
      Patients suffering from septic shock admitted in our critical care unit for less than 24
      hours will be eligible. TBW, ECW and ICW volumes will be measured using the BCM just before
      (T0), just at the end (T1) and 1 h after the end (T2) of a fluid challenge of 500 ml of
      saline. Fluid responsiveness will be assessed using trans thoracic echocardiography (TTE).
      TTE will be performed at T0, T1 and T2. Blood samples will be obtained at T0, T1 and T2 to
      dose biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and of capillary leak. The effectiveness of fluid
      challenge on microcirculation will be investigated by measuring the tissue perfusion index of
      the urethral mucosa using the IKORUS UP device.

      Patients will be followed until Day 28 after admission in the critical care unit.
