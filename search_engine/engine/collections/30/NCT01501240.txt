      necrosis, fibrosis, distortion of the normal hepatic architecture and a spectrum of nodular
      lesions that includes regenerative nodules (RN), dysplastic nodules (DN) and hepatocellular
      carcinomas (HCC). Since HCC is the leading cause of death among the patients with liver
      cirrhosis, Early and accurate diagnosis of HCC and its precursors by using optimal imaging
      technique is critical for its treatment and management.

      Recently state-of-the-art magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadoxetic acid, which works
      both an extracellular and hepatocyte-specific contrast agent, has been increasing used to
      evaluate the patients with liver cirrhosis. Several studies correlated gadoxetic
      acid-enhanced MR of HCC and hepatocellular nodules with the pathology from biopsy or surgical
      resection specimens. However, all of those studies are limited by its lack of complete
      correlation between pathologic and imaging findings and the resulting bias being toward the
      positive studies. Ideally, the use of whole explant pathologic correlation would be helpful
      for exact characterization of HCC and its precursors on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR.

      The question of our study is how accurate gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR is in the evaluation of
      the patients with cirrhotic liver to detect HCC and dysplastic nodules and, by using
      thin-section whole-explant correlation following liver transplantation as the reference
      standard.
