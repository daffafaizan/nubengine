    
      All eligible patients will be equally randomized between the 2 following treatment groups:

        -  Standard of care arm: standard chemoradiation (whole pelvis chemoradiation therapy).

        -  Experimental arm: pretherapeutic paraaortic lymphadenectomy followed by tailored
           chemoradiation. Pretherapeutic lymphadenectomy will be performed via the laparoscopic
           extraperitoneal or transperitoneal approach using either traditional laparoscopy or
           robotically-assisted laparoscopy.

      The surgery (extraperitoneal or transperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy) is considered
      investigational.

      Chemoradiation treatment (with either pelvis or tailored radiation) is considered as standard
      treatment approved in France for the treatment of cervical cancer.
