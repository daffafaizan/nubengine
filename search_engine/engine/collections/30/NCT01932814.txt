      encumbered by a high mortality rate close to 30%. One cornerstone of the management of these
      patients remains the early and appropriate antibiotic administration, , which must be also
      active at the site of infection. Aminoglycosides are often administered in combination with
      beta lactams in this context . According to the progress in pharmacokinetic management
      achieved over the past decade, their safety and efficiency tended to increase but many
      uncertainties remain. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether administration
      of aminoglycosides in septic critically ill patient is a risk factor for acute kidney injury.

      Study design: This is an open retrospective monocentric cohort study including septic
      critically ill patients from november 2008 to january 2010. To determine the incidence and
      the specific risk of nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides, only hospitalized patients without
      initial acute kidney injury or with rapidly improving kidney function during the three first
      days will be included.Primary outcome will be the occurrence of acute kidney injury assessed
      with the RIFLE classification (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease)
      from day 4 to day 15. Patients receiving aminoglycosides will be compared with a control
      group, i.e. not receiving them. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals
      (CI) with adjusted and propensity score (PS)-matched Cox-proportional hazards models.
