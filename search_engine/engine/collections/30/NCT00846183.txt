      injury to endometrium may improve endometrial receptivity and implantation rate. A total of
      120 patients in first IVF cycles, who are stimulated with long protocol, are randomly divided
      into two groups. In one group, on the day of oocyte retrieval, local injury to endometrium
      with a Novak curet to anterior and posterior wall of endometrium are performed and in the
      other group no interventions are done. After fresh embryo transfers, implantation and
      clinical pregnancy rates are compared between two groups.
