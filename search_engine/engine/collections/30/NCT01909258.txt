      A. The intra-judge reproducibility and the interrater reliability for the different tools
      used to measure hip extension will be evaluated. Intra-judge reproducibility (photography)
      and interrater reliability (goniometry and photography) for the different tools used for
      measuring hip extension will be evaluated.

      B. The concordance between EOS measurements and measurements acquired via goniometry and
      photography will be evaluated.

      C. Describe certain radiographic measurements via the EOS system for the four morphotypes
