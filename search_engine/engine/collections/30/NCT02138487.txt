      and 30% of American women will undergo reconstructive surgery for urinary incontinence or
      pelvic organ prolapse to improve bothersome symptoms and quality of life. Surgical goals of
      women with PFD is often to resume their normal activities, which they have limited secondary
      to bothersome symptoms. Yet, traditionally surgeons placed strict postoperative restrictions
      on patient's activity levels for 3 months; sometimes even recommending life long lifting and
      activity restrictions. Activity restrictions are imposed on the premise that exercise can
      "weaken" surgical healing; however, emerging data from other fields suggests that increased
      activity may actually promote the healing process. We aim to determine whether satisfaction,
      recovery, and anatomic outcomes after surgery are related to type of postoperative activity
      recommendations (liberal versus restricted). Women having surgery for PFD will be randomized
      to receive either liberal or restricted postoperative activity recommendations and
      satisfaction, symptoms, QOL and anatomic outcomes will be measured after surgery. We
      hypothesize that women with liberal activity recommendations will recover more quickly and
      report higher satisfaction and QOL, have fewer symptoms, and have similar anatomic outcomes
      to women with restricted activity restrictions. These data will change paradigms of women's
      health and recovery after surgery.
