      surgeon to be consulted. The pathophysiology of degenerative spine disease is acknowledged as
      complex, involving a wide array of risk factors ranging from genetic polymorphisms, to
      behavioural characteristics. While conflicting opinions exist with regard the direction of
      treatment for lumbar disk disease, de-compressive surgery is currently the gold standard for
      patients in which protocols of physiotherapy and analgesics have failed to comply.

      Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is widely used in the practice of spine
      surgery as a mean of preventing and reducing severe complications inherent to surgical
      techniques like paraparesis, paraplegia and quadriplegia. Indeed, a great deal of funding and
      work have been devoted to research projects seeking to determine the impact of IONM in
      reducing these risks. The results of such projects have been notoriously interesting, and
      frequently opposing to each other. This has lead to an open debate on weather the use of IONM
      may or not be justified by better outcomes in patients who undergo such procedure. To our
      knowledge there is no study in the literature that has addressed the potential role of the
      IOM to predict the long-term outcome of the patient in therms of radicular symptoms
      improvement.
