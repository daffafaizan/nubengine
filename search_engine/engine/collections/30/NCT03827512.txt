      people worldwide. The prevalence of this pathology is estimated in France at 11% in patients
      over 40 years old. The Doppler arterial waveforms analysis is an important element to assess
      the hemodynamic state of a patient and contributes to the diagnosis of the pathology. A
      number of classifications have been proposed but their use varies from one university to
      another. We hypothesize that there is a great heterogeneity in the description of the
      arterial Doppler flow analysis. In addition, a new classification (Saint-Bonnet) has recently
      been proposed and we will evaluate the effect of the use of this one. The main objective is
      to evaluate the differences of terminology used when describing arterial Doppler waveforms.

      The secondary objectives are: to understand the variations observed and expected (initial,
      continuous training, place of exercise ...) and to study the effect of a new classification
      on the heterogeneity of responses.
