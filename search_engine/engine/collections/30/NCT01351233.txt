      of refractive astigmatism. New toric IOL designs (Acrysof © toric IOL; Alcon), approved by
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the end of 2005, have been found to be more
      stable and safety in the capsular bag in subjects with normal axis length of eye. Then,this
      study aims at the confirmation of the stability of The AcrySof Toric intraocular lens in the
      bag in high myopic subjects.Then we may find a more effective treatment for the high myopic
      patients with complicated cataract and sever cornea astigmatism .
