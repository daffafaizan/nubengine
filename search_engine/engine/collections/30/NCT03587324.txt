      blood impedance aggregometry using a multiple electrode aggregometer (Multiplate). The
      agonists used are arachidonic acid for aspirin and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for
      clopidogrel. Vascular patients requiring treatment for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or
      carotid stenosis are included in the study. To identify possible risk factors demographic
      data, concomitant medication, laboratory parameters, co-morbidities, severity of the
      condition and the type of procedure performed are documented. In addition, a follow-up
      aggregometry is performed after completion of the vascular procedure.
