      advancements continue to increase life expectancies in various illnesses. Quality of life
      (QoL) encompasses the physical, psychological, and social well-being of a person. Studies
      focusing on health related QoL show that providers have a limited understanding of the QoL of
      their patients, demonstrating a need for further research. Mortality rates in pediatric
      intestinal failure (PIF) have significantly dropped over the past 3-4 decades and long-term
      morbidity rather than survival has come into focus as the outcome of interest. However, there
      remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the specific factors that contribute to QoL
      among PIF patients and their families. Insight into the challenges these patients face can
      promote enhanced support services and psycho-education for caregivers of these children as
      well as help to tailor medical and surgical treatment with a focus on improved QoL. Due to
      the rare nature of PIF, and despite a recent bloom in multidisciplinary PIF centers,
      experience is limited in individual centers and a multi-site study with a robust and diverse
      patient population is optimal to study QoL in pediatric intestinal failure.
