    
      Background:

        -  Persons may be prone to develop hematologic or lymphoproliferative cancer for a variety
           of reasons including: inherited predisposition of benign, premalignant, or malignant
           conditions; environmental exposures shared by family members; previous tumors or
           preneoplastic conditions; immune deficiency; or stochastic processes

        -  Investigations of individuals and families at high risk of cancer often lead to
           etiologic clues that may be important in the sporadic counterparts of these cancers in
           the general population

        -  Identification of etiologically important genetic factors could inform chemoprevention
           trials, screening programs, and treatment of hematologic and lymphoproliferative cancers

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate and define the clinical spectrum and natural history of disease in syndromes
           predisposing to hematologic cancer

        -  To evaluate potential precursor states of malignancy in families at risk and increase
           understanding of the factors that cause progression

        -  To quantify the risks of specific tumors in family members and define syndromic
           constellations

        -  To identify, map, characterize, clone, and determine function of tumor susceptibility
           genes

        -  To validate and test associations of biomarkers with risk

        -  To identify genetic determinants, environmental factors, and gene-environmental
           interactions conferring cancer risk in individuals and families

        -  To identify differences and similarities between the familial and sporadic condition

        -  To educate and counsel study participants about their risk of hematologic malignancy
           including prevention recommendations and early detection activities when known

        -  To develop syndrome-specific educational materials for medical professionals and
           high-risk family members

      Eligibility:

        -  Persons of any age will be considered if

             -  there is a personal or family medical history of hematologic/lymphoproliferative
                malignancy of an unusual type, pattern, or number; or,

             -  there are known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to hematologic malignancy,
                either genetic or congenital factors, environmental exposure, or unusual
                demographic features

        -  For familial neoplasms, two or more living affected cases among family members are
           generally required

      Design:

        -  This is a prospective study. Families are studied long-term using a cohort approach.

        -  The study design and clinical evaluation vary by the specific type of familial neoplasm
           being studied

        -  The overall approach to eligible families includes defining affection status,
           characterization of disease, localization of genetic loci, identification of genes,
           evaluation of phenotype/genotype correlations, estimation of risk of the disease
           associated with carrier status and identification of other risk factors that modify
           penetrance (genetic, environmental, and host factors)
