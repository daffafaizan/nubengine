    
      Primary Objective:To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of d limonene when combined
      with radiation and platinum based chemotherapy in subjects with loco regionally advanced head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) based upon dose limiting toxicity (DLT)

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and subject compliance with adjuvant administration of d
           limonene daily up to a maximum of 4 months after completion of chemoradiation

        -  To correlate the level of d-limonene measured in the plasma to the dose levels(s)
           administered to the subject

        -  To correlate the level of d limonene measured in the plasma to saliva flow rate and
           xerostomia questionnaire scores in subjects enrolled in this trial
