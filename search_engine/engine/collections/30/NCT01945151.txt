      hyperexcitability, increased resistance to passive stretch, Babinski sign, clonus, reflexes
      and involuntary spasms skin.

      As a consequence, there may be contractures and muscle shortening, generating functional
      limitations. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation feature that can control the spasticity
      through reciprocal inhibition, muscle relaxation and sensory stimulation. The goal will be to
      evaluate and compare the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation when applied in the
      agonist and antagonist muscles of spastic hemiparetic patients.
