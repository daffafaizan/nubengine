    
      This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, study of healthy term formula fed (FF)
      infants. FF infants will be randomized to receive either a experimental infant formula,
      formulated for healthy term infants (BBN) or a commercially available infant formula for
      healthy term infants (Brand). Infants will consume the formula for a total of 16-weeks;
      infant growth, serum markers for inflammation and tolerance to the formulas will be assessed
      throughout the study.
