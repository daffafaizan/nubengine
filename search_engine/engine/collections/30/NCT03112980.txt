      begun, as procedural results of TAVI have improved significantly within the past years.
      Nevertheless, a prospective and independent comparison of surgical (SAVR) and interventional
      (TAVI) valve therapy in patients considered at low to intermediate risk that covers an
      "all-comers" patient population and multiple devices has not yet been performed.

      The DEDICATE-trial is designed as a prospectively randomized (1:1), multi-center,
      comparator-controlled interventional trial to investigate whether transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation (TAVI) is non-inferior - as measured by all-cause mortality or stroke after 1
      and 5 years - compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the treatment of
      patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at low to intermediate operative risk of
      mortality, as assessed by the local Heart Team.
