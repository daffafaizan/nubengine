      I. To compare the severity of subjective stress burden (emotional impact) between caregivers
      of patients seen at the Supportive Care Center (SCC) and those seen at the Palliative Care
      Unit (PCU) as measured by the Montgomery - Borgatta Caregiver Burden Scale.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare objective burden (impact on tangible aspects of life) between caregivers of
      patients seen at SCC and the PCU.

      II. To compare subjective demand burden (impact on the patient-caregiver relationship)
      between caregivers of patients seen at the SCC and the PCU.

      III. To compare caregiver quality of life (measured by the Short-form 36) and symptom
      distress (measured by the caregiver ESAS [Edmonton Symptom Assessment System]) between
      caregivers of patients seen at the SCC and the PCU.

      IV. To examine if there is a correlation between caregiver burden (Montgomery-Borgatta
      scale), quality of life (Short-form 36 scale) and symptom distress (ESAS caregiver scale).

      V. To determine which caregiver and/or patients' factors are associated with caregiver
      burden, quality of life, and symptom distress.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and caregivers visiting SCC for a consult or admitted to PCU complete questionnaires
      over 35 minutes.
