      perform automated functional assessment and identify trends that are indicators of acute
      health changes and slower progressive decline (e.g., dementia). By implementing prompt-based
      interventions that support functional independence and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors
      (e.g., social contact, exercise, regular sleep), the investigators can improve overall health
      and well-being. The investigators hypothesize that smart home technologies can be used to
      detect and predict functional change, to slow functional change and extend functional
      independence, and to improve quality of life in elderly individuals who are at risk of
      transitioning to mild cognitive impairment and to dementia. This hypothesis has been
      formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced by the applicants which supports the
      efficacy of using smart home technologies for both functional status assessment and for
      prompting the initiation and completion of activities in individuals with mild cognitive
      impairment and dementia. The rationale of the proposed work is that understanding the natural
      history of functional change between aging and dementia will lead to early prevention and
      proactive interventions that will slow functional change, thereby delaying nursing home
      placement and cost of care to society. The investigators plan to pursue the following
      specific aims: (1) Characterize the daily lifestyle of smart environment residents through
      minimal-supervision activity recognition and activity discovery, (2) Design software
      algorithms that detect trends in behavioral data, and (3) Evaluate the efficacy of
      activity-aware automated prompting technology for extending functional independence and
      improving quality of life. The proposed work is innovative because it will track a large
      number of individuals longitudinal in their own homes and determine whether this technology
      can be used to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and detect health care changes that may
      lead to early interventions, improved quality of life, and decreased health care utilization.
      The project is significant because it will introduce new technologies for activity discovery
      and tracking that require minimal-supervision, contribute algorithms that predict cognitive
      decline and signal more acute health status change, and demonstrate for the first time that
      activity-aware automated prompting technologies can be used to support and/or slow functional
      change and to increase quality of life in elderly individuals.
