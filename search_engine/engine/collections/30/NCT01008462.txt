      I. Event-free survival (EFS) at 1-year after autograft.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Relapse rates at 1-year after autograft.

      II. Overall survival (OS) at 1-year after autograft.

      III. Incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD and chronic extensive GVHD.

      IV. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 200 days and 1 year after allograft.

      V. Donor engraftment at day +84.

      VI. Incidence of infections.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN 1 (lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, or chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia [CLL] with no dose limiting radiation or significant comorbidities: Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo high-dose total body
      irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to -1.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN 2 (lymphoma, Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, CLL, with prior
      dose-limiting radiation, or significant comorbidities): Patients receive carmustine IV on day
      -7, etoposide IV BID on days -6 to -3, cytarabine IV BID on days -6 to -3, and melphalan IV
      on day -2.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN 3 (multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia, with no significant renal
      insufficiency or other significant comorbidities): Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV on
      day -2.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN 4 (multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia, with significant renal
      insufficiency or other significant comorbidities): Patients receive lessened dose of
      melphalan IV on day -2.

      PBSC TRANSPLANTATION: All patients undergo autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0.

      WAITING INTERVAL: Between 40 and 120 days.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV once daily
      (QD) on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV QD on days -6 to -5 and day 3. Patients infused
      with donor's peripheral blood stem cells will additionally receive cyclophosphamide IV on day
      4. Patients undergo low-dose TBI on day -1.

      ALLOGENEIC BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor bone marrow transplantation on
      day 0.

      GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day 4, patients receive tacrolimus orally
      (PO) or IV and taper beginning on day 86 if no graft-versus-host disease. Patients also
      receive mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) on days 4 - 35.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNT SUPPORT: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously (SC)
      beginning from day 4 and continue till blood counts recover.

      ALLOGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMC) TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor
      PBMC transplantation on day 0.

      GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day 5, patients receive tacrolimus orally
      (PO) or IV and taper beginning on day 86 if no graft-versus-host disease. Patients also
      receive mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) on days 5 - 35.

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD COUNT SUPPORT: Patients receive filgrastim IV or SC beginning from day 5 and
      continue till blood counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.
