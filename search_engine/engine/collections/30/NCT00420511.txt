      progressive decline in beta-cell function that occurs over time. Recent evidence, however,
      suggests that a new class of anti-diabetic medications, called dipeptidyl peptidase-IV
      (DPP-IV) inhibitors, may be able to protect beta cells and hence alter the natural history of
      T2DM. We thus wish to study the effect of sitagliptin (a DPP-IV inhibitor) on the
      preservation of beta-cell function in patients with T2DM randomized to either (i) sitagliptin
      and metformin or (ii) placebo and metformin.
