    
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single oral
      dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of SEP-363856 and its
      metabolite SEP-363854 in male and female subjects with schizophrenia. This study will
      determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for a single oral dose of SEP-363856, and
      characterize the plasma PK profiles of SEP-363856 and its metabolite SEP-363854 in male and
      female subjects with schizophrenia.

      For each of the dose-escalation cohorts, 12 subjects (9 active subjects and 3 placebo
      subjects) will receive a single oral dose. An attempt will be made to have at least one-third
      of subjects in each cohort be female.

      Each cohort will be comprised of 12 subjects (9 active, 3 placebo). Within each cohort,
      subjects will be randomized to receive either SEP-363856 (active) or matched placebo in a 3:1
      ratio.

      The planned dose levels that will be evaluated are:

        -  Cohort 1: A single oral 25 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.

        -  Cohort 2: A single oral 50 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.

        -  Cohort 3: A single oral 100 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.

        -  Cohort 4: A single oral 150 mg dose of SEP-363856 or matched placebo.
