      detection and management of recurrences results in improved survival. Post-operative
      surveillance consists of serial CT scans, chest x-rays, colonoscopy and CEA determinations.
      Elevations in the serum CEA level can be the earliest and most sensitive indicator of
      recurrence. A rise in the serum CEA level in the absence of imageable disease presents a
      particular diagnostic challenge. Advanced imaging modalities such as Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET) and anti-CEA antibody immunoscintigraphy have been proposed as a way of
      localizing disease in these patients. This study will evaluate the sensitivity, specificity,
      accuracy and predictive value of FDG-PET scans and anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy in patients
      following resection of colorectal carcinoma who have rising serum CEA values in the absence
      of imageable disease by conventional modalities. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will
      undergo FDG-PET scan and anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy followed by an exploratory laparotomy.
      Abdominal explorations will be conducted by two surgeons, one of whom will be blinded to the
      results of the FDG-PET and CEA scans. All suspicious lesions will be biopsied and if possible
      resected. Results at operation will be correlated with the results of the scans. The goal of
      the study is to determine the role of FDG-PET scanning and anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy in the
      localization of recurrent colorectal carcinoma in patients with rising serum CEA levels.
