      stimuli consisting of a flickering pattern of bars above or below a static rectangle. For
      each stimulus presentation, the user has to tap the region that is flickering. The duration
      of the app is less than 2 minutes.

      This study will assess the validity of the test construct in measuring flicker fusion
      thresholds, and serve as a foundation for further iterative designs of the app and future
      validation and characterization studies.
