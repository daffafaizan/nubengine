    
      Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation
      technology.Recent studies have found that tVNS may involve in the regulation of cognition and
      improve the memory of the elderly.However, due to the limited number of studies, the effect
      of tVNS on improving cognitive function and stimulation parameters are currently unclear.

      To investigate the effects of tVNS on improving cognition in community-dwelling elderly
      people, our study will recruit 120 subjects. Participants will undergo baseline cognitive
      assessment, EEG and eye tracking. Active vs. sham treatment will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 fashion in groups using computer generated lists. Subjects and evaluators will be blind
      to treatment. All subjects will repeat the baseline assessments after 1st session, 5th
      sessionï¼Œ10th session and within 3 days after 10th session.
