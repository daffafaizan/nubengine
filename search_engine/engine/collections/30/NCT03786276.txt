      regimen utilizing components of Blue Goji VR Active Gaming. The synthesis of physical
      activity and an enriched VR environment is expected to yield superior working memory training
      stemming from greater neurological activation. This enhanced working memory training task
      will result in greater motivation to engage and complete a training regimen, thus fostering
      greater improvements in executive function than traditional working memory training tasks;
      ultimately resulting in increased self-control over alcohol use and other high-risk
      behaviors.
