      know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center),
      randomized (study drug assigned by chance) study in participants with reflux esophagitis. The
      study will include 4 visits: Visit 1 (Screening period of up to 14 days), Visit 2 (Day 1),
      Visit 3 (Day 29+3), and Visit 4 (Day 56). After Screening, eligible participants will be
      analyzed on Visit 2 (Day 1) for symptoms during past week, At visit 3 (Day 29+3) participants
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups: rabeprazole 20 milligram (mg) or
      lansoprazole 30 mg group. Participants will receive rabeprazole 20 mg tablet orally once
      daily for 28 to 56 days or lansoprazole 30 mg capsule orally once daily for 28 to 56 days. A
      post-study follow-up visit will be conducted only if participant will be affected by any
      serious adverse event within 30 days after the completion of study drug. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for the cure rate of reflux esophagitis based on endoscopy of 2 groups.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
