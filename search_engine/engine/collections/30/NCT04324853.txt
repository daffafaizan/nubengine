      helminth infection in general and particularly of infection with S. haematobium during
      pregnancy on Vitamin D metabolism and its related factors as well as the impact of maternal
      infection on infants developing immune system and health.

      Specific Objectives To assess the effect of maternal helminths infections on Vitamin D and
      vitamin-D-related factors in the serum of pregnant women and cord blood of their infants,

      To assess the effect of helminth infection on placental biology:

      Determine expression levels of VDR and inflammatory genes Investigate histologically the
      gestational age and other functional aspects of the placenta Determine the influence of
      helminth driven inflammation and helminth antigens on placental tissue by establishing a
      (co-)culture system using primary placental cells and a placental cell line To assess whether
      helminth infections influence the infant's peripheral immune system by analyzing composition,
      reactivity and lineage determination of fetal cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) in
      relation to the maternal and fetal immune and Vitamin D status.

      Current study focusing objectives In the present study the investigators explore if and how
      Vitamin D and its related signals are modulated by helminth infection and how helminth
      infection could thereby shape the developing immune system of the newborn by analyzing CBMCs.
