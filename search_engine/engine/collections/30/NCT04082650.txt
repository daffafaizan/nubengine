    
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of female infertility,
      affecting around 5% of women with a child-bearing age in China. Vitamin D insufficiency is
      common in women with PCOS and is associated with lower live birth rates in these women.
      However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of vitamin D treatment in women with PCOS is
      inconclusive. This multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomised trial aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation prior to IVF on the live birth rate
      in women with PCOS.

      The investigators plan to enroll women with PCOS scheduled for IVF. Eligible participants
      will be randomised 1:1 to receive oral capsules of 4000IU vitamin D per day or placebo for
      around 12 weeks until the day of triggering. All IVF procedures will be carried out following
      a routine method in each center. Women will be followed up until six months after
      randomisation for those who fail to get pregnant after the completion of the first embryo
      transfer or delivery for those who get pregnant after the first embryo transfer. The primary
      outcome is live birth after the first embryo transfer. Primary analysis will be by
      intention-to-treat analysis. The investigators plan to recruit 860 women to demonstrate women
      treated with vitamin D have a higher live birth rate than those treated with placebo (48%
      versus 38%), accounting for 10% loss to follow-up with a significance level at 0.05 and a
      power of 80%.
