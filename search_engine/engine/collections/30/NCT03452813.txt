      associated with effective transitions of care through structured telephone interviews to
      evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions
      and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home in 2,400 participants across
      12 comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) in Florida. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care
      Performance Index (TOSC PI) will be derived and validated. The primary outcomes are the TOSC
      PI and 90-day readmission. Other stroke outcomes include stroke disability, recurrence,
      cardiovascular events, and death at 3 months. Outcomes will be collected through telephone
      interviews and review of patient charts. Predictors of disparities in transition of care and
      outcomes will be evaluated using baseline in-hospital data during acute stroke
      hospitalization obtained from the Florida Stroke Registry and Social Determinants of Health
      obtained through novel data collected from publicly available records. Based on identified
      predictors of disparities in TOSC, we will develop and demonstrate feasibility of initiatives
      for interventions to reduce disparities in TOSC that target systems of care with a TOSC
      disparities dashboard, and health care providers with a training module for enhanced
      education and support at discharge and during follow-up. We will evaluate any temporal
      improvements in the TOSC Performance Index and outcomes before and after the interventions.
