      priority. The development of theory-based, acceptable and feasible psychosocial interventions
      would begin to address the needs of family caregivers. A prominent theory of coping with
      bereavement, Stroebe and Schut's Dual Process Model, describes oscillation between
      loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping; having a balance between these processes
      predicted more positive outcomes for older bereaved spouses. Similarly, the process of
      "finding balance" emerged as a first step in the search for new hope in the PI's grounded
      theory research with older bereaved family caregivers. They described the importance and
      difficulty of "finding balance" as they recovered from caregiving and struggled to find a new
      meaning and purpose for their lives after the loss of a spouse to cancer. An intervention
      focused on "finding balance" provides an innovative and promising approach to guiding the
      development of a theory-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers who become
      bereaved. In clinical work a highly focused writing intervention has shown important benefits
      (personal communication, Dr. Robert Neimeyer, March 4, 2009). A validated tool to measure the
      effectiveness of an intervention to find balance does not exist, however valid existing
      measures of hope, grief, and an inventory of balance based on the Dual Process Model will be
      used as proxies. Therefore, the overall purpose of this study is to develop and pilot-test a
      theory-based psychosocial supportive "finding balance" intervention for older, bereaved
      spousal caregivers of a palliative cancer patient.
