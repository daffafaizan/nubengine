      cancer and other cancers in clinical trials. An investigational drug in Canada is a drug that
      is not yet approved for standard treatment. SU011248 inhibits enzymes (chemicals that help
      cells function) called tyrosine kinases, which are important enzymes for tumor growth and
      tumor spread in your body. If these enzymes are blocked, tumor growth may be disrupted and
      subsequently the cancer cell may die. SU011248 has been given to patients with kidney cancer
      and other cancers in clinical trials and some of them have improved, although it is not yet
      certain how often this occurs. There is some evidence that the enzymes inhibited by SU011248
      also play an important role in the development and growth of germ cell cancers. This is the
      reason why SU011248 is being tested in subjects with germ cell cancers.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      To assess the response rate of SU011248 in patients with relapsed or cisplatin- refractory
      germ cell cancer.

      Secondary: To assess the rate of disease stabilizations, toxicity, time to progression and
      response duration of SU011248 given to patients with relapsed or cisplatin-refractory germ
      cell cancer.

      Study Drug Regimen:

      SU011248 will be given at 50 mg once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest
      period to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks. SU011248 will be orally self-administered
      once daily without regard to meals. Patients will remain on the study drug until disease
      progression.
