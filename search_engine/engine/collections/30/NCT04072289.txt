    
      Prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial with bilateral commercial
      treatment for FDA approved indications and unilateral treatments for investigational
      refractive errors. Data from each treated eye of subjects will be treated independently.
      Monovision treatments and retreatments of the study eye will not be allowed during the course
      of the study. Successful bilateral treatment is required for performance based testing and
      patient reported outcome testing. Subjects will be randomized into the 0.25 and 0.50 sphere
      only and spherical cylinder bins using a sequential alternating randomization with an equal
      number assigned to both bins. Other subjects will be assigned to the bins they qualify for as
      they are enrolled into the study. Appointments are given to patients requesting refractive
      surgery randomly.
