      since 1996, but the efficacy is extremely limited by a response rate of 6-8%, and median
      survival of 5.5-7 months. However, Gemcitabine-based combination treatments fail to transcend
      GEM monotherapy on overall survival, including GEM + 5-Fu [10], GEM + Oxaliplatin[11], and
      GEM + Irinotecan [12] and GEM + Cisplatin [13] (7-8) . Until 2011, Conroy et al.[15] reported
      that FOLFIRINOX solutions significantly improved ORR (31.6% vs 9%, P=0.0008), PFS (6.4 vs.
      3.3 months, P<0.0001) and OS (11.1 vs. 6.8 months, P<0.001) than GEM single-agent, but the
      significant increase of grade 3/4 adverse reactions, to some extent, limited its wide
      application. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore effective and safe
      chemotherapy of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Nab-Paclitaxel was approved by FDA for advanced pancreatic cancer in September 2013. S-1 has
      demonstrated potential value in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer as a new compound
      oral 5-FU(4-5) and has been approved for pancreatic cancer treatment in Japan.

      We conducted a single arm, prospective, phase II study in our center on the first-line
      treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with nab-Paclitaxel and S-1 to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of the combination regimen.
