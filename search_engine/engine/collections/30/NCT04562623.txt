      the world for women ; high grade serous ovarian cancer is a rare pathology but survival is
      less 25% at 5 years.

      Breast and ovarian cancers are complex entities with heterogeneous tumor cells but also
      normal cells including immune cells with represent the microenvironment of the tumor.This
      microenvironment limits tumor progression but also has been shown to play a crucial role in
      disease progression, tumor angiogenesis, maintenance and resistance to anticancer therapies.

      Despite newly developed immunotherapies, only one-third of patients with breast and ovarian
      cancer responds to checkpoint inhibitors ; so today there is poor benefit to treat breast and
      ovarian cancers with immunotherapies. Therefore it needs to better understand immune
      mechanisms which reduce treatment efficacy. The aim of this clinical study is to better
      understand mechanisms of immune response inhibition in breast and ovarian cancers. It would
      characterize actionable targets in patients with resistance to conventional anticancer
      treatments or immunotherapies.In this context, the hypothesis is that some specific
      phenotypical or functional alterations of specific immune cells populations (DC, LB,
      plasmocytes IgA, neutrophils, NK cells, CD8+CD39+ LT, Treg) induce tumoral progression in
      breast and ovarian cancer. These immune populations will be described (qualitative,
      quantitative and functional descriptions ; proteic, transcriptomic and genomic profiles) in
      order to i) determine new immune surveillance mechanisms ii) new targets which allow
      efficient antitumoral immunity in breast and ovarian cancers.
