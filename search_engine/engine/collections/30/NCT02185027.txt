        -  First, there is significant intra- and inter-individual variability in the
           pharmacokinetics of NOACs, which is further heightened in the critical setting by drug
           interactions with other agents that interfere with P-GP (P-GLYCOPROTEIN)and cytochrome
           P4503A4 in patients who are often elderly and multi medicated, and by rapid variations
           in renal function, which is essential for elimination of NOACs.

        -  Second, biological guidance is weak: there is no clearcut therapeutic range nor any
           validated hemostatic safety cutoff, as is the case with the INR (International
           Normalized Ratio) for VKAs. Conventional coagulation tests (PT/aPTT) are poorly
           standardized and difficult to interpret. Assays to measure the serum concentrations of
           these drugs are not widespread outside of a few teaching hospitals.

        -  Third, there is a lack of clinical experience. Analyses of critical situations that
           occurred during clinical trials were done after the fact and the data collected are
           heterogeneous and incomplete. Clinical cases reported in the literature are rarely well
           documented.

      The objective of the observatory is to rapidly acquire documented and thorough feedback on
      clinical experience with these new drugs that will be able to confer a higher level of
      evidence to the management recommendations for treated patients.
