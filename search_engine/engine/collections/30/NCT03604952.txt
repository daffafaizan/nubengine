      worldwide ; prevalence is high in Tunisia, with 7.8 % and 4.2 % of the population in disease
      stages 1 and 2 respectively . Patients with COPD show an impaired exercise tolerance, often
      with severe dyspnea, a decreased ability to participate in the activities of daily living,
      and a poor health-related quality of life.

      The common practice of those observing Ramadan is to have two meals per day: a large meal
      shortly after sunset and a much lighter one immediately before dawn. Ramadan observance (RO)
      is characterized by many changes in diet and sleep patterns , often with a decrease in the
      time available for nocturnal sleep . Studies in athletes have shown altered muscle metabolism
      , hormonal changes , and an impaired physical performance depending on the time of day at
      which test sessions were performed . Sometimes there are disturbances of cognitive function ,
      and Patel et al noted decreases in postural control even in young adults, due to momentary
      lapses of attention after sleep deprivation . Such changes are of particular concern in
      elderly patients with COPD, since their ability to carry out the activities of daily living
      may initially be marginal, and any disturbances of balance and cognitive function associated
      with RO could increase the risk of falls .

      To date, only one previous study has examined the effects of Ramadan observance in patients
      with COPD ; this report focused almost exclusively upon changes in medication use during RO.
      Most Muslim patients with COPD observe Ramadan (for example, 93% in Turkey ), but little is
      known about the clinical and physiological effects of such fasting in COPD .Thus, the aim of
      the present study was to analyze the effects of RO on pulmonary variables, exercise
      performance and postural balance in patients with COPD.
