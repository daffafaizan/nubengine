    
      -  Retrospective Data Analysis will be performed after the CBCT images are pooled from the
           computer database of "Dokki radiology center"

        -  Scans scanned using PaX-i3D Green VATECH with 0.2 voxel resolution will be examined.

        -  Exposure parameters of the scans was varied depending on the individual patient's sizes.

        -  CBCT images will be analysed using OnDemand3D Â® DENTAL (Cybermed, Seoul, Korea) using
           the 3D module. In the axial plane, the reference line will be oriented to pass through
           the center of the examined tooth perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth and buccal
           alveolar bone. The long axis of the tooth will dictate the orientation of the vertical
           slice. Bone thickness will be measured from the sagittal cross sectional cut where the
           CEJ will be identified and followed by the measurements in 3 different locations (figure
           3): A, 1 mm apical to alveolar crest ; B, 3 mm from the alveolar crest; and C, 5 mm away
           from alveolar crest.
