      to control onchocerciasis, but the drug is not lethal to adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites.
      Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium necessary for the fecundity of O. volvulus, can be
      eradicated with four-six week courses of doxycycline, but this cannot be implemented in
      current mass drug administration programs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a
      shorter course (five days) with antibiotics that could be used in children and potentially
      pregnant women would likewise be effective.

      Guatemalan patients with onchocercal nodules will be enrolled in an open label trial with
      four treatment groups: Group A (rifampin 20 mg/kg by mouth [po; maximum 600 mg/day]); B
      (azithromycin 12 mg/kg po [maximum 500 mg/day]); C (combination of rifampin 20 mg/kg po
      [maximum 600 mg/day] and azithromycin 12 mg/kg po [maximum 500 mg/day]); D (control group,
      multivitamin). At the end of the five day treatment course all participants will receive a
      single dose of ivermectin (150 mcg/kg).

      Nodulectomies will be performed 9 months after treatment and the O. volvulus will be analyzed
      by immunohistochemical staining specific for Wolbachia.
