      treatment for many forms of pain. Sore throat has been established to be an acceptable model
      of analgesic effect, and ibuprofen has been found to offer relief in studies of sore throat.
      Several studies have demonstrated that ibuprofen in suspension is absorbed into the system
      more quickly and results in earlier maximum blood concentrations. To date, no study has
      evaluated onset to analgesia as reported by the patient for suspension versus tablet
      formation of ibuprofen in an emergency department population presenting with complaints of
      sore throat. This is a double blinded randomized placebo controlled trial to compare
      suspension versus tablet ibuprofen in an emergency department population presenting with sore
      throat. The purpose of this study is to assess whether ibuprofen in suspension form results
      in relief of pain more quickly than the tablet form of an equivalent dose of ibuprofen. We
      will also determine if there is an interval difference from time of analgesia administration
      to perception of analgesia that is clinically significant.
