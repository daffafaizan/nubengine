      present in the blood of patients with invasive candida infection (ICI). Several studies
      showed a good diagnostic accuracy (1,3)-β-D-glucan in predicting ICI. However, others have
      challenged (1,3)-β-D-glucan as a diagnostic tool in critically ill patients as many
      substances used in the intensive care unit might affect the results of the assay. The goal of
      this study is to investigate whether (1,3)-β-D-glucan can early identify sepsis patients in
      need of antifungal therapy. Patients randomized to the standard of care group receive
      antifungals depending on microbiological results according to current guidelines. Patients
      randomized to the BDG group receive antifungals depending on the (1,3)-β-D-glucan plasma
      concentration on day 1 and day after diagnosing sepsis. Therapy may be modified according to
      microbiological results.
