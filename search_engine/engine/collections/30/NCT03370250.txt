      carried out orderly. The omentum was harvested laparoscopically, following breast-conserving
      surgery . Following the remove of resected omentum, the harvested greater omentum was poured
      by ice protection fluid from right gastric omentum artery. Besides, right arteriovenous vein
      of stomach omentum was dissected carefully under microscope. When operation started, front
      latissimus dorsi was separated from subaxillary incision, as well as the right thoracic
      dorsal artery and accompanying vein. Separated greater omentum was put on the subcutaneous
      deficient site of right breast incision and vascular pedicle was pulled through tunnel,
      reaching to the axillary incision. Under the help of microscope, vascular anastomosis between
      right stomach omentum arteriovenous and right thoracic dorsal arteriovenous was proceeded.
      Consequently, greater omentum was filled to shape the reconstructed breast. Finally, drainage
      tube and drainage strip were left at subcutaneous and subaxillary incision, respectively.
