      health professionals, it is imperative to obtain and analyze the following information: why
      this type of medicine is used, what are its benefits, how does the patient get information
      and what are his sources, who practices them and how the patient perceives the place of the
      hospital and the various health professionals to develop and secure the use of CAM.

      Our study will focus on CAM that can bring iatrogenic risk (phytotherapy, food supplements,
      acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, essential oils), and the following
      techniques: hypnosis and sophrology.

      The study is carried out in two successive phases: the interview phase which will make it
      possible to obtain results to carry out the questionnaires phase. Patients who will be
      included in the interview phase will not participate in the questionnaire phase. Finally,
      patients who participate in the questionnaire phase will not have semi-structured interviews.
      They will only have to answer the questionnaire.
