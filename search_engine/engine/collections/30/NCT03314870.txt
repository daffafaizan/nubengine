      chemotherapy, administered before surgical resection. Unfortunately, many patients do not
      respond to this treatment, or only respond partially. Clinicians therefore need predictive
      biomarkers of treatment response. Thanks to an innovative technique, called CATS, this study
      aims at identifying blood and tissue biomarkers which are predictive of response to
      chemotherapy.

      The objective of this study is to develop molecular signatures predictive of response to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy which would be able to discriminate between patient groups based on
      their epithelio-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status and their immune status. As these two
      parameters are known to be responsible for incomplete responses to chemotherapy,
      investigators hypothesize that these signatures will be predictive of response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. In a second step, researchers will evaluate the ability of these signatures to
      predict treatment response in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      The investigators will investigate two types of signatures: a tissue signature and a
      circulating signature. The former is based on the level of expression of several mRNA and
      miRNA assessed by CATS-RNASeq in the biopsy. The circulating signature will be based on the
      expression level of several miRNA by the same technique. Given that the expression level of
      tumoral miRNA is affected by the EMT and immunological status, and given that tumors secrete
      miRNA in the circulation, investigators expect the miRNA plasma content to reflect the EMT
      and immunological status of the tumor. The circulating signature will have the additional
      advantage of being independent of tumor heterogeneity.
