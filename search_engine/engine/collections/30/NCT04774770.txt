      dialysis that hinder adjustment outcomes. It is hypothesized that these may include: poor
      understanding on what is needed or 'how to implement treatment principles', misperceptions
      related to disease and treatment, catastrophizing beliefs about impact of dialysis and low
      level of confidence on ability to manage treatment regime and renegotiate life roles as a
      "dialysis patient".

      This study seeks to explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a two-arm
      parallel randomized controlled trial of a group-based intervention (titled HED-Start).
      HED-Start is specifically developed to reduce psychological distress and support self-care
      and self-management outcomes in incident hemodialysis patients.

      Drawing on self-management and motivational interviewing principles paradigm, the HED-Start
      program aims to facilitate acquisition of skills and knowledge to support and improve
      self-care and emotional adjustment outcomes.
