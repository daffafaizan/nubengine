      life. To control the course of the disease and to reduce its complications, insulin treatment
      is planned for the whole life of Type 1 diabetic patients, and frequently for approximately
      40% of Type 2 diabetic patients. Frequent or incorrect administration of insulin injections
      may lead to the development of complications such as regional pain, ecchymosis, or hematoma
      on the injection site. It is emphasized that the pain caused by repeated insulin injections
      negatively affects the psychological well-being of the individuals as well as their physical
      comfort. Pain control is one of the main tasks of nurses. By alleviating pain, the patient's
      acceptance of treatment increases, and thus the quality of life improves. In the literature,
      lavender is reported to have the ability to heal burns and insect bites as well as analgesic,
      wound healing, antibacterial, antifungal, sedative, and antidepressant effects. The main
      components of lavender, such as lavender and linalyl acetate and linalool, are also
      recommended as topical analgesics in animal models. Whatever the cause, acute pain is a
      serious problem for individuals with chronic illnesses. Therefore, this study evaluated the
      effect of topically administered lavender aromatherapy on the pain of insulin injection in
      diabetic patients.
