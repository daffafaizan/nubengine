    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, sequential, 2-cohort, phase 2 study to assess
      the overall disease control rate of Ofatumumab according to criteria of RECIST (Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) v. 1.1. in subjects with unresectable stage III B (T1-
      4a, N2b-c), stage III C or stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2009) disease.

      Cohort 1: 10 eligible patients will be treated with ofatumumab alone. If interim analysis
      shows that at least 1 confirmed overall response occurs, an additional 19 eligible patients
      will be treated, for a total of 29 patients.

      Cohort 2: If no confirmed overall response by ofatumumab alone-therapy is seen in the first
      10 patients, cohort 2 will be opened. Initially, 13 eligible patients will be treated with a
      combination of Dacarbazine plus ofatumumab. If interim analysis gives at least 2 confirmed
      overall responses, additional 26 patients will be recruited.
