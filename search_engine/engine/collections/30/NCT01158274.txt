      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RO4929097 and capecitabine administered
      in subjects with advanced solid tumors. (Part 1) II. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) of combined RO492097 and capecitabine. (Part 1) III. To determine the safety of
      RO4929097 and capecitabine administered in combination. (Part 1) IV. To determine the safety
      of RO4929097 and capecitabine in subjects with metastatic CRC. (Part 2a) V. To evaluate the
      safety of RO4929097 and capecitabine in combination for subjects with HER2/neu negative MBC.
      (Part 2b)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of RO4929097 and capecitabine administered in
      combination to subjects with advanced solid tumors. (Parts 1, 2a, and 2b) II. To evaluate the
      changes in the expression of Notch1 signaling pathway members and downstream targets of Notch
      by PCR including HEs1, 3 and 5; Hey 1 and 2 after treatment with RO4929097 at the MTD
      expansion cohorts. (Parts 1, 2a, and 2b) III. To determine the pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacogenomic profiles of the combination of RO4929097 and capecitabine. (Parts 1, 2a, and
      2b) IV. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of RO4929097 and capecitabine when
      administered at the MTD level in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and a
      history of 1 or 2 prior therapies. (Part 2a) V. To determine the response and overall
      survival (OS) rates following RO4929097 and capecitabine administration at the MTD level in
      subjects with metastatic CRC. (Part 2a) VI. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of
      RO4929097 and capecitabine when administered at the MTD level to subjects when administered
      first or second line for HER2/neu negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC). (Part 2b) V. To
      determine the progression-free and overall survival rates following RO4929097 and
      capecitabine administration at the MTD level in subjects with HER2/neu negative MBC. (Part
      2b)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097.

      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and
      15-17 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may undergo tumor biopsy before and after treatment for biomarker analysis and blood
      sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days (Part 1) or every 3
      months (Parts 2a and 2b).
