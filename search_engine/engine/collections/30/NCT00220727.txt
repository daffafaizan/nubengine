    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-center, open, cross-over trial in patients with a
      confirmed diagnosis of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP). ITP is defined as isolated
      thrombocytopenia in a patient with no other clinically apparent associated conditions or
      factors that are known to cause thrombocytopenia as defined by the ITP Practice Guidelines
      Committee of the American Society of Hematology.

      Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (IGIV-C) at a dose
      of 1.0 g/kg will be given on 2 occasions as a single daily infusion for platelet counts <
      30,000 microliters (uL) or if clinically indicated, at maximum intervals of six weeks.
      Eligible patients will be randomized into one of two cross-over groups. Patients randomized
      to Group 1 will receive their first IGIV-C infusion at a rate of 0.08 mL/kg/min and their
      second infusion at a rate of 0.14 mL/kg/min. Conversely patients randomized to Group 2 will
      receive their first IGIV-C infusion at a rate of 0.14 mL/kg/min and their second infusion at
      a rate of 0.08 mL/kg/min according to the following schema:

      Group 1:

        -  Infusion #1 (Week 0) IGIV-C (0.08 mL/kg/min)

        -  Infusion #2 (Week <6) IGIV-C (0.14 mL/kg/min)

      Group 2:

        -  Infusion #1 (Week 0) IGIV-C (0.14 mL/kg/min)

        -  Infusion #2 (Week <6) IGIV-C (0.08 mL/kg/min)
