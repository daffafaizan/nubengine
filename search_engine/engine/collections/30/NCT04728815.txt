      phase (ages 18-25) seeking services at CCCs. Forty-four participants (N=44) from four CCCs
      will be randomized to one of three treatments delivered via a hybrid model: (1) a
      suicide-focused treatment - Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) for
      4-8 weeks (n=16); (2) Treatment as Usual (TAU) for 4-8 weeks (n=16); or (3) Comprehensive
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for 16 weeks (n=12), which includes individual therapy,
      skills training, phone/text coaching for the clients, and peer consultation for the
      counselors.

      Sufficient responders to CAMS or TAU will discontinue services/be stepped down after 4-8
      weeks. Non-responders to CAMS or TAU will be re-randomized to one of two higher
      intensity/dosage intervention options for an additional 8 weeks of treatment: (1) CAMS
      (either continued or administered for the first time) or (2) Comprehensive DBT.

      For the feasibility study, we will also enroll 12 CCC counselors (3 per site) who will serve
      as study counselor participants and periodically complete measures focused on the experience
      of counselors working with suicidal college students.
