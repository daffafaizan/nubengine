    
      Hip arthroscopy (HAS) is a standard procedure with good mid and long-term results.
      Postoperative pain is a great concern and postoperative pain management of great importance.
      High demand for opiates and the associated side effects especially nausea limit the
      postoperative rehabilitation.

      Promising results to reduce postoperative pain and nausea have been achieved by perioperative
      dexamethasone, which has a strong anti-inflammatory effect reducing pain and inflammation as
      well as a strong anti-emetic effect, especially in total hip replacement.

      It is our goal to compare the effect of perioperative intravenous dexamethasone (3x 4mg Amp.
      Fortecortin =12mg prior to surgery and 3x4mg Amp. Fortecortin = 12mg at 8.00am of the first
      postoperative day in 250ml saline solution) to a control group (placebo) (1x 250ml saline
      solution postoperative day 1 at 8.00am) regarding pain level, opiate consumption,
      postoperative nausea and patient satisfaction.

      A double-blinded prospective randomized control trial including 60 patients receiving
      elective unilateral HAS will be conducted.
