      begins in childhood. It is characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions that are
      distressing, time consuming and significantly impairing. OCD is distinct in the extent to
      which it disrupts family functioning, in that there is intense parental pressure to become
      involved in rituals and to change home environments and schedules to avoid triggers, thus
      accommodating the OCD. It is also well known that OCD severity tends to worsen in the context
      of stressful environments and situations. While effective treatment approaches for pediatric
      OCD have been identified, partial response and treatment refusal are all too common, leading
      to chronicity of both the illness itself and of its deleterious familial effects.

      The investigators plan to study a novel approach to help manage the stress of parenting a
      child with OCD, thus facilitating more effective resistance to OCD family accommodation and
      supporting the child in fighting this difficult illness. The investigators will explore the
      role of group-based mindfulness-based skills training (P-MBST) in supporting parents of
      OCD-affected youth, in particular investigating the possibility that increased distress
      tolerance as a result of mindfulness practice may help parents reduce OCD accommodation.
