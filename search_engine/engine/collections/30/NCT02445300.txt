      wounds had blistering up to 26%. The jubilee dressing, which consisted of a highly absorbent
      Hydrofiber inner layer and (Aquacel; ConvaTec Inc.) and a viscoelastic hydrocolloid outer
      layer (DuoDERM Extra Thin; ConvaTec Inc.), was introduced for lower limb arthroplasty wounds
      with lower blistering rate (2% vs. 18%) and lower surgical site infection (1% vs. 3%)
      compared to traditional adhesive dressing. A new modern dressing regime (Aquacel Ag Surgical
      dressing; ConvaTec Inc.) also reported longer wear time, less dressing change and less
      blistering.

      In our institution, the standard wound care after TKA was an antimicrobial dressing
      (Sofra-Tulle®; Royal Chem. & Pharm. Co., Kaohsiung, Taiwan) in the inner layer and gauzes in
      the outer layer.

      The investigators hypothesized that AQUACEL® Ag Surgical dressing would have a significant
      improvement in the efficacy of wound care and wound complications compared with traditional
      Sofra-Tulle® dressings after MIS-TKA.
