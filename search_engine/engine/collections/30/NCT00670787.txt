      cardiovascular disease, blood pressure levels are not adequately controlled in many
      hypertensive patients. More intensive blood pressure lowering treatment is required to
      achieve maximum reduction of cardiovascular disease. Combination pills of blood pressure
      lowering drugs could be a safe and effective strategy to achieve blood pressure target but
      there is no randomized evidence that established the beneficial effects of combination pills
      of blood pressure lowering drugs. The purpose of the study is to determine whether
      combination pill of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide will improve medication
      compliance among patients with high blood pressure.
