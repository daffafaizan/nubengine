      cyclophosphamide (1.5 gm/m2) will be as efficacious as the intermediate dose (3 gm/m2), based
      on cell number collected, number of apheresis required and resource utilization.

      The time to collection of autologous hematopoietic stem cells was ten to twelve days
      following cyclophosphamide and daily filgrastim. Peripheral blood CD34+ cell numbers were
      examined beginning ten days after cyclophosphamide administration. Leukapheresis began once
      the blood CD34+ number reached 10 cells/mcl. Patients received consecutive days of
      leukapheresis, with the goal of collecting > 5 x 106 CD34+cells/kg. The collection process,
      concentration and storage of PBSC were similar for all patients. Briefly, a 4-blood volume
      leukapheresis PBSC collection was performed daily using a COBE Spectra cell separator (COBE
      BCT, Lakewood, CO). Collected cells were concentrated and cryopreserved. Cells were frozen in
      Cryocyte freezing bags (Nexell Therapeutics Inc.) in a controlled rate freezer (Custom
      BioGenic Systems, Shelby Township, MI). At the conclusion of this freezing, the cells were
      transferred to the vapor phase of a monitored liquid nitrogen freezer (CryoPlus III, Forma
      Scientific, Marietta, OH) at a temperature of -120 0C or below.
