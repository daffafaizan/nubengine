      babies as adequate if it matches the age-equivalent weight gains typical of term infants,
      approximately 10-15 grams per kg per day. Unfortunately, many pre-terms, especially very low
      birth weight ones, do not achieve this rate, resulting in neurodevelopmental deficits and low
      discharge weights. Typical feeding regimens, designed to increase weight gain, however, have
      been shown to increase the rate of fat accretion and increase the risk of obesity and
      metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, later in life. Research
      has shown that higher protein diets can reduce the accretion of body fat in older, normal
      weight infants but this has not been systematically tested in low birth weight pre-terms. The
      current study will compare weight gain based on fat accretion and change in body composition
      in preterm infants receiving higher (4g/100 kcal) versus lower (3 g/100 kcal) protein-energy
      ratio diets. The hypothesis tested in this study is: Increased protein intake will reduce the
      percentage of weight gain due to fat accretion in pre-term infants. The identification of an
      effective feeding regimen that would both allow pre-term infants to acquire age-equivalent
      growth rates similar to those of term infants while avoiding the excess accretion of body fat
      could significantly improve the long term health outcomes of this high-risk population.
