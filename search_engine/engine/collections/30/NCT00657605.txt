      approached by a carefully designed, prospective clinical study of the rapidly-sampled
      dynamics of endocrine rhythms during the course of leptin-replacement treatment in the only
      three adult individuals identified in the world so far who are leptin-naive due to a
      functional leptin gene mutation. A study of leptin-naive subjects avoids all confounding
      factors and pitfalls, because the only bioactive leptin to which they will be exposed is the
      exogenously administered recombinant protein. Thus, this proposal will permit us to ascertain
      the endocrine effects of human leptin.
