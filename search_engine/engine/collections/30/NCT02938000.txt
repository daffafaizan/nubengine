      to have strokes by 2030.1 Nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually and of these, 25% occur after
      a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).2 Put another way, stroke recurrence
      affects 30% of stroke survivors.3 Given the high burden of stroke among stroke survivors,
      preventing recurrence is a top priority for post-stroke and post-TIA management.

      Stroke survivors must cope with impairments in functioning that can range from facial droops
      to hemiparesis and aphasia. These physical challenges mean that even four years after stroke,
      71% of survivors feel they have not completely recovered from the stroke.4 The peak oxygen
      cost (VO2) of participating in activities of daily living such as walking is higher in stroke
      survivors six months after stroke than able-bodied individuals.5,6 This increased energy cost
      is related to decreased cardiorespiratory reserve, changes in tissue composition, and gait
      deviation and asymmetry.5,6 The exhaustion point for hemiparetic stroke survivors falls
      within the range of aerobic fitness required to perform activities of daily living (3-5 METS
      [Metabolic Equivalents]).6 Small increases in aerobic capacity would therefore translate into
      the ability to perform activities of daily living.6

      The American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association issued guidelines in
      2014 recommending physical activity and exercise to improve stroke survivors' functional
      ability, quality of life, and morbidity of stroke recurrence.3 It is the goal of this study
      to improve physical activity adherence in stroke survivors and thereby improve their
      cardiorespiratory reserve and reduce depression. Secondary variables to be examined include
      functional ability, balance, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), rates of cerebrovascular
      and cardiovascular events, and mortality.

      Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation post-stroke or post-TIA Cardiac rehabilitation care
      post-discharge for stroke survivors is not established standard of practice. Several groups
      have been evaluating the efficacy of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation, as provided to
      patients after acute MI, in post-stroke populations. This intervention has been shown to be
      cost effective in post-MI care, reducing healthcare cost overall (attributed to fewer
      re-admissions) and per quality-adjusted life year.12 Several groups have conducted
      small-scale trials of cardiac rehabilitation among TIA and stroke patients with promising
      improvements in cardiovascular fitness outcomes.13-16 Aerobic exercise for rehabilitation
      after stroke has been evaluated in small randomized controlled trials.6,17

      One group conducted a randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation
      program in chronic stroke patients after ischemic events.14 Their intervention was twice
      weekly, supervised exercise on cycle ergometers (upper or lower body) to 50-60% maximal heart
      rate.14 At the end of the ten-week program, subjects in the intervention arm showed
      significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness as measured by peak oxygen consumption
      (VO2) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) after three minutes of exercise.14 Self-reported
      depression and anxiety scores also improved in the intervention arm, though health-related
      quality of life did not.14 The same group is now conducting a larger clinical trial called
      Cardiac Rehabilitation Adapted For Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke (CRAFTS) expanding on
      the results of the earlier pilot.13,14

      Another group in London, Ontario conducted a feasibility study evaluating the use of
      comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) in patients within 12 months of TIA or mild,
      non-disabling stroke.15 In this prospective cohort study, 100 patients were enrolled and 80
      patients completed the CCR with group-based or home-based progressive aerobic training for
      six months.15 Diet counseling in individual or group-based sessions emphasized the
      Mediterranean diet.15 Patients were screened for depression and referred to a psychologist
      for anxiety, depression, and smoking cessation as needed.15 Medications were optimized to
      meet AHA recommendations regarding use of aspirin or anti-platelet agent, angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, and blood pressure management with diuretic.15 The
      results of the feasibility study were promising with improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness,
      blood lipid profile, BMI, weight, waist circumference, smoking status, and Duke Treadmill
      Score.15 Although the study was not powered to evaluate morbidity of stroke/TIA and
      mortality, the recurrence of stroke was 0% among patients who completed intake/outtake and
      4.6% including patients who left CCR.15

      A third study, PREVENT, is a randomized controlled trial out of Nova Scotia, Canada currently
      enrolling patients post-TIA or non-disabling stroke to evaluate a program of rehabilitative
      exercise and education in improving risk factors.16 The trial aims to randomize 250 patients
      to control (usual care) or to a 12-week comprehensive rehabilitation program comprising
      group- and home-based exercise with aerobic and resistance training and weekly education
      classes.16 Primary outcomes to be measured include lipid profile, blood pressure, waist
      circumference, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c; secondary outcomes to be assessed are
      exercise capacity, walking endurance, cognitive function, depression, health-related quality
      of life, and physical activity.16 The trial was not powered to evaluate the effectiveness of
      the intervention in preventing morbidity of stroke/TIA/cardiac events.16

      AHA Recommendation In 2014, American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association
      released recommendations regarding physical activity in stroke survivors.3 Prior to starting,
      a pre-exercise physical evaluation including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate monitoring,
      and graded exercise testing. Recommended exercise is aerobic cardiovascular exercise 3-5
      times weekly for 20-60 minutes; aerobic activity should achieve 40-70% peak O2 or heart rate
      maximum.3 Additional exercise in resistance training two to three days weekly is also
      recommended.

      The proposed intervention differs from these studies in that it involves a one-way
      communication via streaming video in addition to case management follow-up phone calls. To
      our knowledge, the efficacy of this tele-intervention has not been reported previously.

      Thera-band® elastic bands Thera band® elastic bands (The Hygienic Corporation, Akron, Ohio)
      are versatile exercise training tools used primarily to provide graded resistance during
      strength training.22 They have been used in home-based resistance training for stroke
      rehabilitation with improvement in strength, gait speed, and functional ability.22 Combined
      with aerobic activity, strength training of hip flexors, extensors, and abductors improved
      gait speeds between 3.6-12.6 meters/minute in ambulatory stroke survivors after ten weeks of
      intervention.22-24 A small study (sponsored by the manufacturer of Thera band®) found using
      Thera band® elastic band is comparable to using resistance-training machines in activating
      exercised muscles, as demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).25 Community-based training with
      physiotherapists guiding stroke survivors in the use of Thera band® elastic bands for
      resistance training over 16 weeks improves balance and strength.26

      In addition to providing resistance, Thera band® can be used to assist stroke survivors in
      dorsiflexion during gait training. Patients who received gait training using Thera band®
      showed faster improvement in mobility than usual care.27

      A guided, community-based model is the most representative of e-rehabilitation. Strength and
      gait improvements are comparable in supervised and unsupervised resistance training in stroke
      survivors.23 This study's recorded exercise videos are intended to visually demonstrate
      aerobic resistance training to community-dwelling patients. Although the patients will remain
      unsupervised, exercise sessions will be entirely guided by a trained exercise physiologist.

      This pilot, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study will compare a comprehensive
      lifestyle and exercise rehabilitation intervention to usual care in patients after acute
      stroke. The investigators of this study intend to evaluate an online exercise video
      rehabilitation program for stroke survivors with moderate disability compared to usual care.
      The intervention videos combine aerobic and resistance training using a latex resistance
      band, Thera band® elastic band, specifically designed for rehabilitation.

      The proposed study will be performed at the Kaiser Permanente (KP) San Diego Medical Center.
      Kaiser Permanente patients that are admitted with acute ischemic stroke, resulting in
      moderate disability, in the prior two weeks to enrollment range will be recruited in the
      medical center. Patients will be directly offered participation in the study by the principal
      investigator, at the time of hospital admission to the KP San Diego Medical Center with
      ischemic stroke. For patients interested in participating in the trial, screening based on
      written inclusion and exclusion criteria will be done by reviewing patient information in the
      electronic medical record system. If patient meets initial eligibility criteria, they will be
      notified by telephone.

      As part of usual care, all enrolled patients will have an initial study visit included within
      their post-hospital discharge follow-up visit. Informed consent will be obtained at this
      time, as well as subsequent collection of baseline data, including vital signs, social and
      medical history, demographic variables, and questionnaire response items.

      All patients will have an appointment at Positive Choice within two weeks of the initial
      visit for education training, further testing (aerobic capacity measures), and distribution
      of Thera bands to the intervention group. Within the subsequent week patients and family in
      the intervention arm will receive an educational outreach call which will include medication
      reconciliation and adherence, dietary adjustments, smoking cessation, physical activity,
      depression education, as well as how to access the physical therapy videos online. Videos are
      20-30 minutes with combination of aerobic and resistance training to be done in seated
      positions.

      Study staff will call patients 1 week after the aforementioned educational phone call to
      offer encouragement, ask about progress, and answer any questions the patient may have
      regarding the videos. To control patients, the call will be a brief reminder to continue to
      adhere to medical therapy. Study staff will also call all enrolled patients to screen for
      depression at 4-week intervals, and to ensure coordination for depression treatment with
      primary care physician. Investigator will perform physical exam including NIH stroke scale at
      the completion of prescribed therapy. At this time, patient will be advised to continue
      physical activity with videos as part of AHA recommendation.

      The outcome status (in terms of toxicity, response, reason off study, progression, and
      survival) of all eligible patients will be reported. All eligible patients who begin
      treatment will be included in the analysis of survival and time-to-failure. The primary
      outcomes of this study are the impact on the depression scores and cardiorespiratory reserve
      change of stroke survivors as a result of the intervention videos combined with aerobic and
      resistance training using a latex resistance bands. Additional outcomes of this study are
      measurement of potential changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), hemoglobin
      A1c (HbA1c), functional status, balance, incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      events, as well as adherence to exercise program.
