      Approximately 75% of the population reports at least one fall in a 6-month period and nearly
      half report frequent falls. Falls can result in physical injuries and contribute to activity
      curtailment. Despite the negative consequences, limited evidenced-based fall prevention
      programs designed specifically for wheelchair and scooter users with MS exist.

      Recognizing the threat falls pose to health and well-being and the dearth of fall prevention
      programs, the purpose of this study to perform a structured process evaluation and examine
      the feasibility and efficacy of a community-based intervention specifically designed to
      reduce fall incidence among wheelchair and scooter users with MS. Secondary aims of the
      intervention are to improve functional mobility skills associated with fall risk (e.g.
      transfer and wheelchair skills, balance), increase knowledge of fall risk factors, decrease
      fear of falling and enhance quality of life and community participation.
