      training locales with at-risk populations, maximize resuscitation skill retention, and
      promote willingness to act. To accomplish this, we will empower stakeholders at UPHS
      hospitals to develop local implementation approaches, using either UPHS volunteers or nursing
      staff as VSI proctors. These stakeholders will be studied as a research subset. The VSI
      proctors will use the AHAs CPR Anytime kit, and will work with family members of patients at
      high risk for a CA to learn lifesaving CPR skills. We will use a modified AHA CPR video using
      the new AHA recommendations for bystanders which suggests doing chest compression only CPR.
      Using the original AHA video and the modified chest compression only video, we will randomize
      family members of patients at high risk for CA to one of these groups. The VSI proctors will
      also be blinded to which video these subjects will be watching. We will follow up with the
      family members at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months to see if they retained their CPR
      knowledge and skills and to see if they had been in a situation where their CPR skills were
      needed and assess whether they performed their skills or not. We will also measure the number
      of people with whom the subjects shared their CPR Anytime kits a quantity known as the
      multiplier effect to determine if they had shared the CPR Anytime kit with their family and
      friends, thereby increasing the possible number of lay persons trained in CPR and in turn
      able to perform bystander CPR if needed. We will also assess the perceptions and attitudes of
      the nurses and volunteers regarding this project.
