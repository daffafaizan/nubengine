      one of three treatment arms: placebo, usual dose or high dose sirolimus. Patients received a
      cumulative loading dose of 0, 8 or 24 mg of sirolimus two days prior to and the day of repeat
      intervention followed by maintenance therapy of 2 mg/day for 7 days. Angiographic restenosis
      at 6-months angiography was the primary end point of the study.
