      groups. After informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the
      treatment group or the control group.

      Group 1: This group will serve as the control group, and will be scheduled to receive one
      gram (1g) acetaminophen PO every 8 hours.

      Group 2: This group will serve as the treatment group, and will be scheduled to receive one
      gram (1g) acetaminophen IV every 8 hours

      The standardized pain control protocol for hip fracture patients will be initiated for all
      patients. The pain protocol will be initiated at hospital admission, and after three
      postoperative doses of the group assigned acetaminophen all patients will be switched to one
      gram scheduled acetaminophen PO in preparation for hospital discharge.
