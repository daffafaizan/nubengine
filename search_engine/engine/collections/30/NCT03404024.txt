      ischemia in myocardium, is a group of disease that include: angina and myocardial infarction.

      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) predicts rapid progression of necrosis. AMI is a serious
      health condition that it's mortality rate is about 30% and also more likely to have a higher
      incidence of cardiac dysrhythmia or ventricular aneurysm.

      Therapeutic angiogenesis is promising approach for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
      66 to 75% of coronary artery disease patients have insufficient coronary collaterals and 30%
      of myocardial infarction patients display inadequate myocardial perfusion although there are
      procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

      In phase I study for ischemic heart disease, VM202RY appeared to have improved regional
      myocardial perfusion and wall thickness of the diastolic and systolic phases in the injected
      region. These results suggest that VM202RY improves the myocardial perfusion and inhibits
      cardiac remodeling in ischemic heart disease patients.
