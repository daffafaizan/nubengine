      quantity, and timing. Naturally circulating melatonin is instrumental in regulating
      sleep/wake schedules. Tart Montmorency cherries (Prunus Cerasus) contain high levels of
      melatonin and may be a useful intervention to supplement for realignment of circadian phase
      and by increasing the robustness of circadian amplitude. In normal healthy adults, with
      experimentally induced phase advanced circadian misalignment, the administration of a 3mg
      supplement of melatonin significantly increased sleep architecture characteristics. In this
      study we want to examine the efficacy of tart cherry juice in increasing urinary levels of
      melatonin and the subsequent impact this will have on sleep parameters.
