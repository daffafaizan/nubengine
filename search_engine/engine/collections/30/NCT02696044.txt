      participants with Rett syndrome using laboratory values, electrocardiogram, rate of adverse
      events (AE), and physical exam. This study also seeks to evaluate the efficacy of UX007
      (triheptanoin) in improving overall seizure frequency, dystonia severity, and quality of
      life. Participants who are eligible will take triheptanoin daily. Participation in the
      primary arm of this study will last up to 8.5 months, with an optional 36 month extension.
