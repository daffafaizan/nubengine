      are significantly reduced in patient with colectomy. To validate the measurement of uremic
      toxins level in serum as biomarkers for cardiovascular risk, we need to know about
      intra-individual variability over time and the impact of diet or digestive disorders on
      uremic toxin serum level. We propose a prospective study evaluating the intra-individual
      variability in 3 uremic toxins serum levels the SI, the pCS and IAA.

      The main objective is to study the kinetics of three serum uremic toxins: the indoxyl
      sulfate, p cresyl sulfate and indole acetic acid (and thus determine the intra-individual
      variability) in a population of chronic hemodialysis patients during 1 year.
