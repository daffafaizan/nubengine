      Sclerosis (SPMS) in which patients experience a remission or lessening of their symptoms,
      Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by progression of disability
      from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements. The age of
      onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than for the relapsing-remitting, but
      similar to mean the age of progression between the relapsing-remitting and the secondary
      progressive - around 40 years of age. Because of its prevalence, RRMS represents the largest
      basis for basic and clinical MS research. Therefore, drugs have primarily been developed to
      slow disease progression in RRMS and SPMS patients. No treatment has been proven successful
      in treating primary progressive MS.

      The MURDOCK-MS collection represents a unique opportunity to carry out detailed biomarker
      research on PPMS patients and, to the knowledge of this investigator and his colleagues in
      the field, would represent an exceptional cohort that is not available elsewhere in the US or
      the rest of the world. Aside from first in disease sampling, the serial, biannual collection
      of samples from PPMS patients would not only permit the identification of 'omic profiles that
      can be compared and contrasted to those from RRMS patients in a parallel study, but it would
      also allow the generation of 'omic markers of disease progression. This progressive etiology
      would provide valuable insight into PPMS development and may also shed light on SPMS
      progression.
