      were excluded according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Remaining one hundred fifty four
      were American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) I-II classified children , aged 2-15 yr, undergoing
      elective tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, under general anesthesia . Induction
      and maintenance of anesthesia were standardized with fentanyl, lidocaine, rocuronium and
      sevoflurane in nitrous oxide (N(2)O). Subjects were assigned to two groups administered with
      saline solution (%0.9 saline) at different rates; either 10 ml/kg/h or 20ml/kg/h delivery
      arms.
