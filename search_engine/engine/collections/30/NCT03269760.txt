      disturbances. Many patients also have difficulty sleeping after shoulder surgery due to the
      constraints of sling immobilization. While in the hospital, sleep is also disrupted due to
      pain, nursing staff, other patients, and bathroom use. While poor sleep may appear trivial,
      sleep deprivation in animal models has identified significant adverse effects on bone
      metabolism, bone mass, and recovery from post surgical pain.

      Recent evidence has shown that non-pharmacological sleep interventions that improve sleep
      hygiene and duration can optimize athletic peak performance, fatigue, and recovery.
      Furthermore, pharmacological sleep aid use with zolpidem in orthopaedic postoperative
      patients has suggested safe administration, improved pain control, reduced pain medication
      use, and higher patient satisfaction in the settings of total knee and hip arthroplasty,
      rotator cuff repairs, and ACL reconstruction.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of sleep medicine in the recovery of
      orthopaedic shoulder arthroplasty patients. The investigators hypothesize that a multimodal
      sleep pathway including non-pharmacological sleep hygiene interventions and the use of
      zolpidem can improve patient sleep, pain control, and subsequent recovery after undergoing
      total shoulder arthroplasty.
