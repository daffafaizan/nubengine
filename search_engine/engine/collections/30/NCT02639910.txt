    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and preliminary efficacy of
      tafasitamab (MOR208) combined with idelalisib or venetoclax. The study will include safety
      run-in phase for each cohort with an evaluation of the safety data by an Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee.

      An optional sub-study has been introduced to collect biological samples for investigations on
      biomarkers (e.g., CD19 expression) after tafasitamab treatment.
