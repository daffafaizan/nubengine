    
      Therapeutic indication:

      Corneal surface reepithelizing

      Statistical methodology:

      The data will be expressed with measures of central tendency: mean and standard deviation for
      the quantitative variables. The qualitative variables will be presented in frequencies and
      percentages. The statistical analysis will be carried out through the Mann-Whitney U test for
      quantitative variables. The difference between the qualitative variables will be analyzed by
      means of square chi (Chi2). An alpha â‰¤ 0.05 will be considered significant.
