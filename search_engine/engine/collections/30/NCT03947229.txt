      without clinical events for 12 months after DES implantation will be included in this study.
      Eligible patients will be randomized to continue DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for further
      24 months or to change to single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel (clopidogrel-alone).
      Randomization will be stratified according to 1) clinical presentation (acute coronary
      syndrome or stable coronary artery disease) and 2) age (â‰¥75 or <75). Baseline clinical and
      angiographic characteristics, laboratory findings will be assessed at the time of
      randomization. All patients will provide informed consent on their own initiative. All of
      study subjects will be have an outpatient visit as scheduled in outpatient clinic. Occurrence
      of study endpoints will be documented at clinical visit or telephone interview every 6 months
      since randomization. Antiplatelet drugs will be open-label and prescribed by attending
      physician.
