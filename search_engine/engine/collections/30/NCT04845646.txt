    
      This multiarm study in HVs and subjects with NAFLD is designed to further characterize the
      PK, safety and tolerability of ASC41.

      Part I of the study will assess the effect of itraconazole and phenytoin on the single-dose
      PK of ASC41 in HVs. Part II of the study will evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of
      single dose ASC41 in subjects with NAFLD. The pharmacokinetics of ASC41 and its metabolite
      ASC41-A will be assessed in both parts I and II.

      The secondary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of oral
      ASC41 in subjects in the U.S. with NAFLD and in HVs. Approximately 24 male and female
      participants will be enrolled. This study consists of 3 cohorts.
