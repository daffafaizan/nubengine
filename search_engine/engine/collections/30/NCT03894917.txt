      participants and to study treatment patterns that may be barriers to treatment and risk
      factors for increased morbidity. Characteristics of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment will
      be obtained prior to standard interventional treatment for participants that are 65 years or
      older. Observations will be made of treatment toxicities and cellular senescence with
      treatment outcomes. Findings from this study will result in the development of R01
      intervention studies that develop and validate a treatment algorithm based on these
      associations to provide older adults with a personalized treatment plan.
