      disorder (BED). Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) has been shown to reduce binge eating but
      its long-term impact and time course on other BED-related symptoms remain largely unknown.
      This study compares the effects of group CBT and group IPT across BED-related symptoms among
      overweight individuals with BED. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two overweight patients meeting
      DSM-IV criteria for BED were randomly assigned to 20 weekly sessions of either group CBT or
      group IPT. Assessments of binge eating and associated eating disorder psychopathology,
      general psychological functioning, and weight occurred before treatment, at posttreatment,
      and at 4-month intervals up to 12 months following treatment. RESULTS: Binge-eating recovery
      rates were equivalent for CBT and IPT at posttreatment (64 [79%] of 81 vs 59 [73%] of 81) and
      at 1-year follow-up (48 [59%] of 81 vs 50 [62%] of 81). Binge eating increased slightly
      through follow-up but remained significantly below pretreatment levels. Across treatments,
      patients had similar significant reductions in associated eating disorders and psychiatric
      symptoms and maintenance of gains through follow-up. Dietary restraint decreased more quickly
      in CBT but IPT had equivalent levels by later follow-ups. Patients' relative weight decreased
      significantly but only slightly, with the greatest reduction among patients sustaining
      recovery from binge eating from posttreatment to 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Group IPT is
      a viable alternative to group CBT for the treatment of overweight patients with BED. Although
      lacking a nonspecific control condition limits conclusions about treatment specificity, both
      treatments showed initial and long-term efficacy for the core and related symptoms of BED.
