      apnea group (OSA), and central sleep apnea group (CSA). The training lasted ten consecutive
      weeks with 30 uninterrupted sessions. The actigraph together with the Pittsburg sleep quality
      index (PSQI) was used in sleep quality assessment. The actigraph (Actiwatch Minimitter
      Company, Incorporated (INC) - Sunriver, OR, USA) was placed on the non-dominant wrist and
      activities were monitored continuously while being recorded at one-minute intervals. The
      participants kept the device for a period of 96 hours, filled PSQI, and did 6MWT before the
      first and last training sessions.
