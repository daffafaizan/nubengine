      myoplasty done for facial nerve impairment. The investigators already observed few cases of
      spontaneous neurotization and the investigators want to check the nerve command of the facial
      muscles. Clinical and photographic evaluations will be performed before and after a facial
      nerve block using 1% lidocaine.
