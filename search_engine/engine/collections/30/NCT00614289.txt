      involvement that allows for right/left treatment comparisons. Hand dermatitis is also
      important due to its implication on healthcare workers in particular, where frequent hand
      washing and chronic occlusion from gloving, provide a route for skin sensitization to natural
      rubber latex proteins increase the risk of colonization of microorganisms on the skin, and
      thereby increase the likelihood of contact dermatitis.

      This feasibility study will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of PVDF coatings in
      treating chronic hand dermatitis.
