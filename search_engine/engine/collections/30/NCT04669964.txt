    
      As of January 1, 2021, Robert Packer Hospital will implement a standardized hydration
      protocol for patients at high risk for readmission due to dehydration.

      All postoperative ileostomy patients will be provided the following instructions at the
      bedside to ensure complete comprehension:

        1. Stoma maintenance education

        2. Hydration recommendations

        3. Intake and Output Worksheet education and trial

      The colorectal surgeons standardized the postoperative medical management of ileostomy
      output.

      Before discharge, the healthcare providers will complete a "Discharge Assessment Checklist".

      On the day of discharge, patients will be categorized by the "Discharge Algorithm for
      Patients with Ileostomies." The algorithm will assign patients by their ileostomy output and
      determine their next management steps.

      After discharge, all patients will record their fluid input and output using the "Daily
      Measurement of Intake/Output Worksheet" which will be used to monitor hydration over time.
      Patients who are high risk will receive outpatient intravenous hydration therapy. At each
      intravenous therapy appointment, the health care provider will review the Outpatient
      Intravenous Hydration Algorithm to determine the volume of fluid to distribute or if
      re-evaluation is necessary.

      Data Collection After starting the standardized hydration protocol, researchers will
      prospectively collect data from monthly reports of patients who received an ileostomy
      creation.

      Researchers will not mask the patients, care providers, investigators, and outcomes
      assessors.
