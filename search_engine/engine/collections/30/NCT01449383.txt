      processes, including digestion of actually indigestible food components and fat storage. Due
      to that it may contributes to the developement of obesity being one of the most important
      risk factors for many chronic diseases. Gut microbiota is under the influence of nutrition,
      consumption of pro- and prebiotics can promote the growth of certain bacterial strains. In a
      cross over dietary intervention this work will investigate the effect of defined diets on the
      intestinal microbiota in 20 healthy adults. The diets contain either high amounts (more than
      40g/d) of dietary fibre and low red meat (less than 30g/d) or low amounts (less than 20g/d)
      of dietary fibre and high amounts of red meat (200g/d). Intervention periods last 3 weeks
      each interrupted by a 3 weeks wash out period. Examination of participants will happen at the
      beginning and at the end of both interventions and will contain anthropometry, blood sample,
      faecal sample, urine sample and saliva sample.
