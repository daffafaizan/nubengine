      behavioral activation intervention to decrease the negative physical and psychological
      consequences of being homebound among older adults during the time of COVID.The intervention
      will focus on decreasing the impact of social isolation, inactivity and poor nutrition on old
      people during a time when many in-person social activities are not possible. It will be
      delivered through telephone and other communication tools that allow remote (i.e. not in
      person) communication over 10 sessions. Subjects will be a total of 60 people aged 75 years
      an older, who will be recruited from primary care in the Boston MA region and senior living
      facilities in the Baltimore MD region. Coaches will be trained using an on-line based modules
      developed to support this intervention. Self-report outcomes will be measured by telephone at
      baseline and 4-month follow-up.
