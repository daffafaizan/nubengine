      associated with fat mass in animal studies and human observational studies. Some of the
      proposed mechanisms include an association with lipogenesis, insulin sensitivity and
      disrupted energy metabolism.

      The overall aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of a diet low in methionine and
      cysteine on markers of lipids, amino acids, glucose and other biomarkers related to energy
      metabolism, including transcriptomic and protein expression data from adipose tissue and
      lymphocytes. Overweight and obese but otherwise healthy volunteers will be randomized to
      receive a diet either low, moderate or high in methionine and cysteine concentrations for 1
      week.

      This is a pilot study that may be considered an extension of NCT02647970. In addition to the
      primary and secondary outcomes we will evaluate the feasibility of the intervention and
      procedures.
