      factors for compromised bone health, but our current understanding of skeletal fragility in
      glomerular disease is lacking. In the first large population-based cohort study, we recently
      found that primary glomerular disease was independently associated with an increased risk of
      incident fracture, and that hip fracture risk was >2-fold greater in patients younger vs.
      older than 40 years of age. Mechanisms that drive increased fracture risk in glomerular
      disease are not clear but likely multifactorial. Our prior work demonstrated that glomerular
      disease is associated with disturbances in vitamin D and mineral metabolism, in addition to
      and exacerbated by reduced kidney function.

      Patients with glomerular disease are also exposed to medications which may negatively impact
      bone health, most notably high-dose and long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Identifying
      modifiable factors that compromise bone strength will facilitate the development of
      strategies to reduce fractures and other skeletal complications across the life course. The
      proposed multi-center study will leverage the infrastructure of the NIH-funded Cure
      Glomerulopathy (CureGN) prospective cohort study and the resources of two health systems with
      expertise in state-of-the-art high-resolution bone imaging methods, to conduct the first
      prospective, longitudinal study to assess determinants of impaired bone quality and strength
      in glomerular disease.
