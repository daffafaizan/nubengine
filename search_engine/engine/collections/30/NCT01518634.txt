      distress syndrome (BDS). BDS is a unifying diagnosis that encompasses a group of closely
      related conditions such as somatization disorder, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and
      chronic fatigue syndrome. The project consists of a double-blinded placebo controlled trial
      of treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant Imipramine in dosages of 25-75 mg. Primary
      outcome is patient-rated improvement measured by Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I).
      Secondary outcome is functional level (physical, mental and social) measured by the SF-36
      Physical Component Summary (PCS). The study requires 140 participants and study duration is
      19 weeks for each patient. End point is 13 weeks, i.e. after 10 weeks of 25-75 mg study drug.
