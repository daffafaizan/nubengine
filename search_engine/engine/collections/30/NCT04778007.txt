      without dysphagia. The study will assess the construct validity and reliability of the
      Turkish version of Laryngopharyngeal Measure of Perceived Sensation (T-LUMP) Questionnaire.
      The investigators developed the Turkish version of this questionnaire (T-LUMP), according to
      the cross-cultural adaptation guidelines. Two translators translated the LUMP into Turkish
      and a native English language speaker reverse-translated it into English. The back
      translation was sent to the original author for proofreading. The final version of the LUMP
      questionnaire consisted of 8 basic and understandable questions related with globus
      pharyngeus symptoms.
