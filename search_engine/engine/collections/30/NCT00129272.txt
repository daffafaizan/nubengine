      causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Most smokers begin smoking during
      adolescence, and though they seem motivated to quit smoking, they frequently fail. Although
      behavioral treatments are available, they have not been very successful in past studies.

      Depressed adults may have more difficulty quitting smoking than non depressed adults; this
      finding may also apply to depressed youth. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of bupropion in combination with standard behavioral treatment in helping young
      smokers quit, as compared to behavioral treatment alone. Finally, the study examines whether
      hormonal response to stress measured prior to treatment initiation predicts whether
      individuals respond well to treatment with bupropion.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either bupropion
      or placebo. Both groups will receive behavioral treatment. The trial will last for 9 weeks,
      with weekly study visits. Study visits will last 30 minutes to 1 hour and will include
      medication monitoring, self-reported and biological measures of smoking, and behavioral
      treatment. Participants will have follow-up visits six months after completion of treatment.
