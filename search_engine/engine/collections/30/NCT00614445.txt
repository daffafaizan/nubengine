    
      Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), also known as "morning sickness," is a common
      condition that affects a large percentage of pregnant women. The symptoms can range from mild
      nausea to severe nausea and vomiting for which a woman may need to be hospitalized. Nausea
      and vomiting of pregnancy can affect a woman's quality of life and ability to conduct daily
      activities.

      Diclectin® is a combination of 10 mg doxylamine succinate (an antihistamine), and 10 mg
      pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) in a delayed release tablet formulation. It has been
      commercially available in Canada for the management of NVP for over 25 years and has been
      prescribed to over 33 million pregnant women.

      Presently, there is no Food Drug and Administration (FDA) approved drug on the market to
      treat the symptoms of NVP. This study will test the efficacy of Diclectin® (doxylamine 10 mg,
      pyridoxine 10 mg in a delayed-release formulation) for NVP.

      Patients enrolled in the study will receive between 2 and 4 tablets of Diclectin® or placebo
      daily, depending on their symptoms for up to 14 days. Patients will assess their symptoms of
      nausea and vomiting daily using a standardized questionnaire.
