    
      This is a 3-part phase 1-2 study in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) + or other
      potentially crizotinib-sensitive NSCLC who have been receiving crizotinib. Part A is a
      single-arm, Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation design in patients with NSCLC who have
      already been receiving crizotinib for at least 8 weeks and continue to tolerate therapy. Part
      B is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized continuation design comparing crizotinib alone versus
      the combination of crizotinib + AT13387 at the maximum tolerated dose established in Part A.
      Part C is an open-label, randomized, Phase 2, Simon's 2 stage design evaluating single agent
      AT13387 or combination AT13387 + crizotinib at the MTD established in Part A in patients who
      progressed on crizotinib at any time.
