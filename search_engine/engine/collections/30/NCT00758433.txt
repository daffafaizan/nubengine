    
      This is a double-blind, randomized study of the tolerability of two different strengths of a
      Civamide Patch compared to placebo patch. The study consists of a Screening Period (Days -21
      to Day 1), a one week Treatment Period (Days 1-8) and a follow-up telephone call to subjects
      on Day 10.

      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed relative to dosing on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 8 in a subset
      of subjects. Subjects will also rate stinging and burning sensation at the application site
      during the Treatment Period.

      Twenty-four (24) hours after the last patch application, subjects will return to the study
      site on Day 8. The treatment area will be evaluated by the Study Physician. Subjects will
      complete a Subject's Global Rating of Stinging and Burning Sensation and a Subject's Global
      Rating of Tolerability.
