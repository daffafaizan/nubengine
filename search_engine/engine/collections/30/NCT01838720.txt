      nephrectomy (PN). Zero ischemia partial nephrectomy technique using renal arterial branch
      microdissection could protect renal function during surgery, but it requires longer operative
      time and more blood loss than conventional partial nephrectomy. The technique of zero
      ischemia laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted enucleation of renal cell carcinoma
      appears to be an alternative that eliminates warm ischemia, preserves the maximal parenchyma
      and is oncologically safe. Our study was designed to evaluate this technique in comparison
      with the conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.
