      Nutritional Supplementation (ONS) on muscle accretion and functional performance in
      malnourished elderly patients. The objectives of this study are to determine feasibility of
      recruitment, adherence to intervention and retention of the sample, as well as the capacity
      of subjects to complete functional and muscle mass measures for a planned multi-centre
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).
