      inventor suggested insertion technique is called standard technique.

      Standard I-gel insertion technique: I-gel insertion will be performed by firmly grasping the
      lubricated I-gel along the integral bite block site. I-gel cuff outlet will face towards the
      patient's chin and before insertion chin will be gently pressed down. The I-gel soft tip will
      be introduced into patient's mouth in a direction towards the hard palate. Then I-gel will be
      slide downwards and backwards along the hard palate with a continuous but gentle push until a
      definitive resistance is felt.

      Modified jaw thrust technique: I-gel insertion will be performed by firmly grasping the
      lubricated I-gel along the integral bite block. I-gel cuff outlet will face towards the
      patient's chin and before insertion chin will be gently pressed down. The I-gel soft tip will
      be introduced into patient's mouth in a direction towards the hard palate and it slides
      gently into the oropharynx. I-gel will be left in oral cavity and both hands will be used to
      thrust the jaw by lifting the angle of mandible with little fingers and other fingers to
      stabilize the jaw then both thumbs will used to apply the balance force towards the final
      I-gel placement position by looking at the integral bite block mark at incisor teeth level.
