      joints of patients with various types of arthritis leads to significant and durable
      improvement in pain and function and is safe to use. To date, there is no published
      literature that evaluate the effects of intraarticular Botulinum Toxin A in the treatment of
      ankle OA. Sun el al reported that 3 or 5 weekly injection of hyaluronate may improve pain and
      physical function in patients with ankle OA and the treatment effects may last for 6 months.
      The effect of one injection of hyaluronate plus exercise had never been studied. The purpose
      of this study is to compare the effects of intraarticular Botulinum Toxin A versus
      intraarticular hyaluronate plus rehabilitation exercise for patients with ankle OA.
