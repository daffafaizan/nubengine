      patients with previously untreated advanced hepatobiliary cancer treated with dolastatin 10.
      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus
      every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within
      9 months.
