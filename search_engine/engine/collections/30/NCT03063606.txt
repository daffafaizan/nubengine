      strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment. Improved treatments for patients with
      obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes and promote weight
      loss. This study (specialist treatment) RCT will provide new and novel findings from a
      controlled test, amongst non-responders to acute treatments, whether cognitive-behavioral
      therapy augments on-going blinded pharmacotherapy (naltrexone/bupropion or placebo) compared
      with on-going pharmacotherapy alone (without added cognitive-behavioral therapy).
