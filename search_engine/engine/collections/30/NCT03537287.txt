    
      This study aims to compare between the efficacy of intramuscular 17alpha-hydroxyprogestrone,
      progesterone vaginal suppositories and dydrogesterone oral tablets in prevention of preterm
      labor in high risk women.

      All women will be counseled regarding mode of intervention and informed consent will be
      obtained. All cases will be subjected to complete history taking, routine antenatal
      examination and investigations, treatment of genital or urinary tract infections if
      diagnosed. Routine obstetric ultrasound examination and measurement of cervical length by
      transvaginal ultrasound will be carried out at 16-18weeks of pregnancy.

      The study population will be randomly distributed according to the mode of intervention into
      3 groups.

      Randomization is performed using a Computer-generated randomization system. Blinding of the
      intervention is not feasible in this trial (owing to the different route of administration of
      the studied drugs).Table of randomization is obtained
