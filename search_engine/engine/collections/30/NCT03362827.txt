      subjects group will be arranged in this study. 50 subjects will be recruited in each group,
      The healthy subjects were matched for sex and age in relation to the low back pain group.
      Conditioning electrical stimulation (100 Hz, repeated 5 times with 10 s intervals, 500
      impulses) using circular pin electrodes will be used in both groups to induce LTP-like pain
      amplification. The pain intensity changes to pinprick and light touch stimuli will be
      compared between two groups.
