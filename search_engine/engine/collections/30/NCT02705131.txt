      the efficacy and safety of the balance chiropractic therapy for CSR. Participants aged 18 to
      65, who are in conformity with the diagnostic criteria of CSR and the pain score regarding
      visual analog scales is more than 4 points and less than 8 points, will be included and
      randomly allocated into two groups: test group and control group. Participants in the test
      group will be treated with the balance chiropractic therapy, while the control group will
      receive the traction therapy. The primary outcome is pain severity (measured with a visual
      analogue scale (VAS)). Secondary outcomes will include cervical curvature (measured by Borden
      index), a composite of functional status(measured by Neck Disability Index ,NDI), individual
      patients health status(evaluated by SF-36 health survey ), and adverse events as reported in
      the trial.
