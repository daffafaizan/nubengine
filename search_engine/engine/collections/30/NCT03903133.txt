      Screening/Baselie Phase

        -  Detailed medical history with special emphasis on demographic data, transfusion and
           chelation therapy, disease modifying therapy

        -  Thorough clinical examination

        -  Laboratory investigations to be done will include:

             -  Liver function test

             -  Marker of hemolysis

             -  Serum ferritin .

             -  Complete blood count(CBC)

             -  Hemoglobin electrophoresis

             -  Determination of serum levels of EMAP II

             -  Lipid Peroxidation (Malondialdehyde Concentration.), Superoxide Dismutase activity,
                Catalase activity, Glutathione Peroxidase activity, Glutathione Reductase activity,
                Vitamin E concentration, GSH

      The patients under investigations will receive vitamin E supplementation for three months

      Patients will be followed up for clinical assessment lying stress on frequency and severity
      of sickling crisis, length of hospital admission, and frequency and severity of painful
      crisis

      The biochemical investigations, EMAPII and oxidative stress biomarkers will be measured also
      after the three months vitamin E oral administration.

      Statistical analysis Result will be expressed as the mean (+/-) standard deviation (SD). For
      all tests significance was set at P<0.05. All statistical analysis will be performed using
      software package SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc,Chicago, IL, USA). Differences over time will be
      tested with analysis covariance (ANOVA) repeated measures. Repeated measures analysis will be
      used to test treatment and time effects in addition to group -by- time interaction for
      clinical laboratory parameters. In cases where interactions will be identified, post hoc
      comparisons will be adjusted using Bonferroni correlations.
