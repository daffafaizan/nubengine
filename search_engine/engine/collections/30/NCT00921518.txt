    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, double-blinded. The study will take
      place at Community Medical Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The inclusion criteria are
      patients undergoing elective, urgent, or emergent cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary
      bypass and having a baseline GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2 estimated using the Modification
      of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Patients will be excluded from the study if they have
      cardiogenic shock (defined as a cardiac index less 2 L/min/m2 despite high dose inotropes or
      the need for intra-aortic balloon pump), end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis,
      received an infusion of sodium bicarbonate on the same day as cardiac surgery, or if they are
      enrolled in a separate clinical research trial. This trial will involve two treatment groups.
      Group one will receive isotonic saline at 3 ml/kg/hr for one hour pre-operatively until the
      patient is started on cardiopulmonary bypass. Then the infusion will be reduced to 1 ml/kg/hr
      throughout cardiopulmonary bypass and for six hours following cardiopulmonary bypass. Group
      two will receive sodium bicarbonate 150mEq in 850ml of a 5% dextrose solution using the same
      infusion regimen as described above for isotonic saline. The primary efficacy outcome of the
      study will be the incidence of AKI postoperatively. Acute kidney injury will be defined as an
      increase in serum creatinine concentration by at least 25% from baseline or an absolute
      increase of 0.5 mg/dL at any time within the first five postoperative days.
