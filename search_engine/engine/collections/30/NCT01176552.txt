      exists for this patients category. We suggest that combination of granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon alpha (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulate
      immune system from dendritic cells till cytotoxic T-lymphocytes step by step and eliminate
      residuary tumor cells.

      This prospective, non-randomized, phase II trial assessed low-dose GM-CSF, IFN and IL-2
      postoperatively in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma.
