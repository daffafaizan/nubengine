    
      Objective: To assess the safety and feasibility of curative esophagectomy combined with three
      field lymphadenectomy after chemo-radiation in Western patients with resectable thoracic
      esophageal carcinoma and cervical lymph node metastases. Secondary objective is to determine
      the effect on survival and recurrence.

      Study design: Mono centre prospective phase II single-arm feasibility study. Study
      population: Western patients diagnosed with resectable (cT1-4a, N1-3) intra thoracic
      esophageal carcinoma with histological or cytological proven cervical lymph node metastases
      in level III and/ or IV.

      Intervention: Transthoracic esophageal resection combined with three field lymphadenectomy
      after neoadjuvant chemo-radiation.

      Main study parameters/ endpoints: Primary outcome is the percentage of overall surgical
      complications grade 3b and higher as stated by the Modified Clavien-Dindo classification.
      Secondary outcomes are mortality, operation related events and postoperative recovery,
      including quality of life, disease free survival, overall survival and if applicable the
      location of recurrent disease.
