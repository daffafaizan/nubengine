      The activation of the coagulation system leads to consumption of procoagulatory as well as
      anticoagulatory proteins and platelets. This process may induce microcirculatory thrombosis
      as well as hemorrhagic diathesis, which is commonly described as disseminated intravascular
      coagulation (DIC).

      The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recommends the use of the DIC
      score to describe this syndrome. A score of at least 5 points is defined as an overt DIC.
      However, the DIC score does not allow to differentiate between a hypercoagulation and
      hypocoagulation states and whether there could be a difference regarding outcome between the
      two states.

      In this prospective observational study, patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit
      will be included. The DIC score as well as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) will be
      evaluated within the first 24 hours after the diagnosis of sepsis as well as on day 3 and 5.
