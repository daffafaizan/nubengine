    
      Registry to explore characteristics, use and management of new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) and
      vitamin K antagonists (VKA) treatment among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and recent
      cerebrovascular disease in a "real-world" setting at a stroke centre. Special interest is
      payed to conditions not or only in part investigated in the large randomised controlled
      Trials (RCT) and that are specific to patients with cerebrovascular disease. This includes
      early start of NOAC treatment after recent stroke, very old patients, multimorbidity,
      patients with a history of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and patient satisfaction and
      preferences with VKA/NOACS.
