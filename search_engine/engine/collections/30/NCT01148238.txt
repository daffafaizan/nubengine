      inflammatory cells. One hypothesis in that T-reg is a cause of autoimmunity, and that T-reg
      concentrations are low in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes type 1.

      Blood samples will be taken from 10 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, Latent
      Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) and type 1 diabetes older than 10 years and the same
      amount of samples from healthy, age- and sex-matched blood donors. Markers of autoimmune
      diabetes will be analyzed.
