    
      This Phase II, limited institution, open-label, single-arm, baseline-controlled study is
      designed to obtain data on the percentage of patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer
      from a solid tumor (including, but not limited to, breast, lung, mesothelioma, liver,
      colorectal, prostate, head and neck, pancreas, bladder and testicular cancer) with increased
      uptake of FalateScan in tumors, correlate the immunohistochemical staining findings with the
      FolateScan images, and verify product safety in patients with suspected recurrent or
      metastatic disease from any solid tumor.
