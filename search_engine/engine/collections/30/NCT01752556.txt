    
      Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, open, parallel noninferiority. 440 patients will
      be randomized to diagnose and follow treatment based on the PR or PSG generating four groups:
      two treated and two untreated with CPAP. The latter did not undergo self-certification home.
      The monitoring will be 6 months and 4 assessments. Statistical analysis: compare the change
      of the scale Epworth before and after the intervention between both treatment arms using
      analysis of covariance. The premise is non-inferiority of -1.6 at the lower limit of 95%.
      Secondary variables were analyzed by independent means differences (or nonparametric
      equivalent) or Chi2 for dichotomous variables. Cost-effectiveness: the costs generated by the
      two methods will be measured against the effectiveness of the primary endpoint using Bayesian
      techniques
