      perifosine and sorafenib will be determined. The experience with perifosine and other
      biologic agents has been that doses determined in Phase I studies are not as well tolerated
      in larger groups of patients when response is an endpoint. Thus in part 2, with the MTD as a
      starting point, a group of patients will be accrued with the goal of ensuring that they will
      be able to tolerate at least three courses of therapy, which would make them evaluable for
      response in a Phase II study. The effects of the combination of perifosine and sorafenib will
      be evaluated for response rate and time to progression. The pharmacokinetics of the
      combination of the study drugs will be measured.

      For the purposes of this study, one cycle of therapy will be defined as 4 weeks. Patients
      will take perifosine one to three times a day and will also receive sorafenib one to two
      times a day. Patients may need anti-emetics and/or anti-diarrheals.

        -  Patients who experience toxicity may continue on treatment with doses delayed or
           reduced.

        -  All patients should continue therapy unless disease progression is documented on two
           occasions four weeks apart

      All patients should be evaluated at each visit for adverse events. Patients will keep a diary
      documenting compliance with study drug, toxicities and any symptoms of hand/foot syndrome
      including numbness, tingling, redness or presence of sores, and any symptoms of hypertension.
      Patients will be evaluated for progression or response at 12-week intervals.
