      Rehabilitation System, known as IpsiHand, on functional motor recovery and neuroplasticity
      for chronic stroke survivors with hemiparesis (N=27). The IpsiHand system involves a
      Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) as a control for a robotic hand orthosis. Participants will
      complete 16-32 weeks of home therapy with the IpsiHand system.
