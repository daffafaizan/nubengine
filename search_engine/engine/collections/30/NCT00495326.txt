      and reduces mortality among TB patients with deep immune suppression. The Fixed Drug
      Combination (FDC) nevirapine (NVP)-lamivudine-stavudine is the first line ART available for
      low-income countries. Rifampicin (RMP), due to its liver induction effect, reduces
      significantly NVP plasma concentration, raising concerns regarding the risk of resistance and
      subsequent treatment failure. Therefore, in co-infected patients, WHO recommends delaying ART
      or using efavirenz (EFV)-based ART. Although EFV is also reduced at lower level, longitudinal
      studies report good efficacy and safety when given concomitantly with RMP.

      In low-income countries, poor access to EFV, contradiction during pregnancy and absence of
      FDC containing EFV lead to difficulties in HIV-TB treatment.

      Despite 2 limited retrospective studies and a non-randomised prospective study, which report
      good virological response at 6 months in co-infected patients receiving NVP and RMP
      co-administration, existing data are too limited to change the recommendation.

      The aim of the study is to compare, in terms of therapeutic efficacy and clinical safety, the
      nevirapine-based HAART to the standard efavirenz-based HAART, in HIV/TB co-infected patients
      receiving a rifampicin-based TB treatment.

      The study will evaluate one year after TB treatment initiation, whether the HAART efficacy
      (virological outcome, death or lost of follow-up) induced by NVP-based HAART is non-inferior
      to those induced by EFV based HAART, in patients receiving concomitantly HAART and RMP-based
      TB treatment.
