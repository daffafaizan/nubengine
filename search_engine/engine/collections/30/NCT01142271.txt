      is distal subtotal gastrectomy. However, the optimal reconstruction procedure after that has
      still not to be established. Although B-I reconstruction is most common method due to the
      safety and simplicity, the duodenal fluid may reflux into the remnant stomach which may
      contribute to the mucosal injury to remnant stomach and esophagus. Roux en Y reconstruction
      may reduce the reflux to remnant stomach due to the length of Roux en Y limb, although it is
      more complicated procedure.

      Therefore, we plan to collect 120 patients to compare the degree of reflux between Roux en Y
      and Billroth-I reconstructions after distal subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. In
      addition, we compare the surgical outcome and quality of life between two groups.
