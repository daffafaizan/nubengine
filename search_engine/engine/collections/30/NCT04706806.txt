      states and depression. Although the mechanism is not known, increased gut fermentation is
      suspected as changes in gut tryptophan metabolism was noted in these trials. Tryptophan is
      the precursor to serotonin, the neurotransmitter associated with improved mood state, but
      other metabolites of tryptophan have been associated with mental wellbeing as well. The main
      ingredient of vinegar, acetic acid, is the most common metabolite produced during gut
      fermentation of dietary fiber (mainly from fruits and vegetables) and can also be expected to
      influence the gut microbiome. It has been reported that vinegar ingestion is linked to a
      change in tryptophan metabolism in healthy adults consuming vinegar daily for 8 weeks. This
      study will explore the impact of vinegar ingestion on mood states.
