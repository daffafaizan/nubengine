      often compromises the esthetic and functional result. Alveolar ridge preservation has been
      evaluated in many studies. A variety of bone grafting materials and barrier membranes have
      been studied for their ability to enhance bone formation in damaged alveolar ridges, and to
      evaluate their bone healing and bone-forming capacity in extraction sockets. However, the
      newly developed resorbable collagen membrane OSSIX-Plus has not been evaluated for this
      purpose. This study is designed to test the ability of OSSIX-Plus (OraPharma Inc.,
      Warminster, Pennsylvania) in promoting optimal bone healing following exodontia. We
      hypothesize that use of OSSIX-Plus will result in preservation of the height, width and
      density of the residual alveolar ridge following tooth extraction.
