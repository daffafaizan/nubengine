      chemotherapy have an unfavorable prognosis, and there is currently no treatment able to
      improve their survival. New approaches to treat these patients are thus urgently needed.
      Active immunization against tumor antigens is certainly one of these approaches. The tumor
      antigen targeted in this study is WT1, which is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene in
      leukemia and several types of solid tumors. WT1-positive acute myeloid Leukemia patients in
      complete remission (CR) will first undergo two cytaphereses, one of which being frozen, after
      CD25+ T cell depletion, the second, being frozen unmanipulated as a Treg back-up. Next,
      patients will be treated for 5 weeks with oral cyclophosphamide according to the so-called
      "metronomic regimen" to achieve in vivo Treg depletion. Patients will thereafter receive WT1
      ASCI combined with CD25+ T cell depleted lymphocytes. The total duration of the treatment
      period will last 48 months (4 years).
