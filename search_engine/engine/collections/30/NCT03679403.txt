    
      Primary Aim:

        1. To examine the developmental changes and stability of neuropsychological functions (NFs,
           assessed by CPT and CANTAB) and structural (morphometric, cortical thickness,
           gyrification, fiber tract integrity) and functional connectivity (assessed by SE rsfMRI,
           counting-Stroop fMRI) from childhood to late adolescence and young adulthood;

           Secondary Aims:

        2. To validate a wide range of neuropsychological functions (assessed by CPT, CANTAB, CNB),
           structural and functional connectivity in the frontostriatal (FS), frontoparietal (FP)
           and other circuitries, and neurophysiological functions (assessed by event-related
           potential [ERP]: MMN, Gamma ARRS) as effective imaging endophenotypes by demonstrating
           the intermediate position of unaffected siblings between ADHD probands, and age-, sex-,
           and handedness-matched neurotypicals at Time 1 and Follow-up;

        3. To identify the Time 1 predictors (behavioral symptoms, NFs, and imaging data) for
           Follow-up neuroimaging data (Morphometric, DSI, rfMRI, task-fMRI, MMN, Gamma ARRS); and

        4. To correlate all kinds of neurocognitive data and clinical symptoms profiles stratifying
           by the presence of ADHD, proband-unaffected sibling dyads, and two time points.

      Hypothesis The investigators anticipated despite increasing thinning of cortical thickness,
      microstructural integrity of several targets fiber tracts, and brain activity of target brain
      regions and improving neuropsychiatric performance from childhood to late adolescence/young
      adulthood in neurotypicals and probably in ADHD with lower developmental changes slope in
      ADHD. These changes of unaffected siblings are in the intermediate position between the ADHD
      probands and neurotypicals. For the endophenotype part, the investigators anticipate that
      ADHD probands may have a higher level of altered microstructural integrity and decreased
      brain activity of the FS, FP, other hypothesized fiber tracts/brain networks, deficits in MMN
      and Gamma, and impaired a wide-ranging NFs than neurotypicals. These differences in the
      unaffected siblings would be in the intermediate position between ADHD probands and
      neurotypicals.
