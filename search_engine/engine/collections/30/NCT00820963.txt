      Primary

        -  Compare the survival of patients over 60 with glioblastoma multiforme treated with
           standard radiotherapy vs hypofractionated radiotherapy vs chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the quality of life (QLQ-C30) of these patients.

        -  Compare the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of these regimens.

        -  Assess the pharmacoeconomic cost of these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
           for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
