      with potential adverse events, especially in the long term. As C. difficile and CAP are
      important causes of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs, it is important to study the
      underlying mechanisms of PPI-induced dysbiosis.

      In this prospective interventional study, study procedures will be performed at inclusion
      (1), after a baseline period of 4 weeks (2) and after treatment with Pantoprazole (PantomedÂ®)
      40mg once daily during 4 weeks (3) in healthy volunteers and FD patients. In addition, study
      procedures will be performed at inclusion (1) and after PPI-withdrawal for 8 weeks in
      refractory FD patients.

      The investigators aim to assess alterations of the duodenal (mucosa-associated and luminal)
      microbiome with PPI therapy and to correlate changes in the duodenal microbiota with oral and
      fecal microbiota, bile acids, intestinal permeability and histology and biochemical
      variables.

      The results from this study will help to unravel the onset and extent of dysbiosis and
      provide additional arguments not to prescribe or continue PPI without clear clinical
      indications, especially in cases where alternative regimens may be available or the benefits
      of PPI are uncertain.
