    
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, non-blinded, dual-arm comparator study that
      will include two-phases, the 60-patient pilot study (30 patients in the treatment arm and 30
      patients in the control arm) followed by a pivotal study (up to 200 patients in the treatment
      and control arm combined) for a total of up to 260 patients overall in both phases. The pilot
      study will serve as an opportunity to assess the protocol and make adjustments, if necessary.
      In addition, descriptive statistics including effect size will be calculated and the safety
      of the device will be assessed at the conclusion of the pilot study.

      Subjects will be assigned to study arm based on a block randomization schedule generated a
      priori.

      The study sponsor believes that the device and therapeutic treatment that will be evaluated
      in this study is a non-significant risk (NSR) to the subjects.
