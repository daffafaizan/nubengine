      compromised in patients with type 2 diabetes. The enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
      type 1 (11β-HSD1) activates glucocorticoids in target tissues including skin. Pre-clinical
      data demonstrate that 11β-HSD1 inhibition improves skin function and wound healing but this
      has not been investigated in man.

      Using the 11β-HSD1 inhibitor AZD4017, we will investigate if

        1. Oral AZD4017 inhibits 11β-HSD1 activity in skin

        2. AZD4017 is safe and well-tolerated in patient with T2DM

        3. Oral AZD4017 regulates skin function

        4. Systemic glucocorticoid levels and skin 11β-HSD1 activity, independently or in
           combination correlate with measures of skin function

      Study feasibility will also be assessed; if successful, data from this pilot study will
      inform power calculations for a future trial to investigate the ability of 11β-HSD1
      inhibition to promote foot ulcer healing in type 2 diabetes.
