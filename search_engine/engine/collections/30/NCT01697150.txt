        1. Primary objective The purpose of this pilot study is to test a closed-loop
           Control-to-Range (CTR) system in a semi-controlled environment and especially to
           evaluate if the system can accurately collect data coming from patient inputs, insulin
           pump, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with more than 80% of time of use.

        2. Secondary objectives

      This pilot study will use a Artificial Pancreas Platform (AP Platform) cell phone/phone-based
      system to test an outpatient controller and remote monitoring as follows:

        -  test that the CTR system can be remotely monitored by nurses/physicians/ technicians to
           confirm appropriate functioning outside of the hospital setting

        -  test that the CTR system can be deployed, with appropriate subject response, outside of
           the hospital setting

      I.B. STUDY DESIGN

      This study is an early feasibility pilot trial with the principal goal is to validate an
      initial outpatient ready CTR system and its remote-monitoring capability. Therefore, this is
      an unblinded pilot study and no control group will be used.
