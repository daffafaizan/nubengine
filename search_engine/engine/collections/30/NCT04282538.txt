      clinical study. The main purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation assisted
      rehabilitation in the treatment of cerebrovascular disease-related gait disorders. The
      secondary objective was to assess the effects of these two types of neuromodulation on
      cognitive, emotional, and daily living abilities.
