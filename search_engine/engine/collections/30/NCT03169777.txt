      described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year or until they
      experience progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose
      reduction), withdraw consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's
      best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction
      phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects may remain in the maintenance
      phase of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until
      the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction),
      withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best
      interest to continue treatment.
