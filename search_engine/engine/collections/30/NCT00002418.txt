      Throughout the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA
      levels and lymphocyte subsets and for development of adverse events and toxicities. Patients
      who experience virologic failure have the option of adding hydroxyurea to their treatment
      regimen or discontinuing from the study. After Week 24, patients with documented virologic
      response may continue treatment with didanosine, stavudine, nevirapine, and MKC-442, and, if
      applicable, hydroxyurea until a change in virologic status occurs (i.e., the patient
      experiences virologic failure). Follow-up visits are conducted every 4 to 12 weeks until
      permanent discontinuation from the study.
