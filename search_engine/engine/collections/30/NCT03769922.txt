    
      EME and LME are the two surgical procedures which are commonly used in the treatment of
      Crohn's disease. However, the areas of the mesenteric tissue resected are different.

      EME means that the mesentery is resected avoiding the root region, i.e. 1 cm from the root of
      ileocolic artery and vein.

      LME represents that the mesentery is retained, i.e. "Close shave" or 3 cm from the border of
      bowel (using whatever approach - clips, or haemostatic vessel sealing device).
