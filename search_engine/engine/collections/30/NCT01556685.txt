    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of neutralizing antibodies
      in patients treated with IFN beta 1a IM (Avonex) and IFN beta 1a IM biosimilar formulation
      (Jumtab).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluate the effect of Nabs on the severity of the relapses on each treatment group,
           measured by:

             -  The need and duration of steroid courses

             -  The need and duration for hospitalization.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the IFN beta 1a IM treatments [Avonex and
           Jumtab].

        -  To identify the genetic profile of the patients with relation to the predisposition to
           Nab development (HLA DR4 (in particular HLADRB1* 0401 and 0408) and DR16 (in particular
           HLADRB1* 1601)

        -  At selected sites: To evaluate the influence of the interferon and the Nabs on the
           activation of neopterin
