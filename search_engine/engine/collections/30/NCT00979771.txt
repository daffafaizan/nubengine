      in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on stable doses of Enbrel. Subjects with an
      adequate response to Enbrel will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be withdrawn from
      their Enbrel and randomized to receive 28 days of dosing with either GSK706769 or placebo
      followed by 28 days off-drug. This study is exploring a novel therapeutic paradigm for RA,
      remission maintenance. In such an approach, remission is induced and then the inducing agent
      is stopped and a maintenance agent is added. The clinical benefit would be derived from the
      fact that the remission agent may be easier to take (e.g. oral rather than parenteral), more
      durable in its maintenance of remission, and/or safer (e.g. no TB reactivation). This study
      directly explores remission maintenance. Specifically, in a randomised, double blind, placebo
      controlled study, RA patients in remission through an adequate response to Enbrel will be
      recruited. Enbrel has been selected as it has a relatively short half life and therefore it
      is more likely patients treated with placebo may have a higher incidence of relapse after 28
      days than with other anti-TNF treatments. After withdrawal of Enbrel (and possibly other oral
      DMARDs), subjects will be randomised to receive GSK706769 or placebo for 28 days followed by
      a period of 28 days off treatment. It is hypothesized that GSK706769 will prevent any CCR5+
      cells from returning into the synovium, thereby resulting in maintenance of the efficacy
      induced by Enbrel. In the placebo group, CCR5 cells may re-populate the synovium resulting in
      increased inflammation. Patients experiencing increased disease activity will be able to
      withdraw from the study and resume standard of care.
