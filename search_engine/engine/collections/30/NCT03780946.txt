      vessels and vessels, biliary and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as in recanalization of the
      biliary stricture, and bilioenteric anastomotic stricture. During the past 15 years, the
      investigators have designed different types of magnets, and attempted these magnets in
      vascular, intestine, and biliary anastomosis in preclinical studies. In recent five years, we
      have successfully developed different types of magnets and utilized in biliojejunostomy,
      concomitant biliojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy during Whipple. This study is
      designed as a prospective study by utilization of the bar-like magnets for
      pancreaticojejunostomy.
