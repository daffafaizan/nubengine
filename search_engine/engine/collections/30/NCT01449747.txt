      In clinical trials, sitagliptin showed effective control of blood glucose level in type 2
      diabetes and 100 mg once daily with metformin was similar to sulfonylurea (glipizide) with
      metformin in lowering HbA1c. Mostly in practice, stable blood glucose levels were maintained
      after change of sulfonylurea to sitagliptin in type 2 diabetes treatment. However, in some
      cases, there were abrupt severe hyperglycemia and uncontrolled blood glucose level after drug
      change to sitagliptin.

      Several mechanism could be considered for reduced response to DPP-4 inhibitor in some type 2
      diabetes patients. Firstly, significantly reduced secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1
      (GLP-1) more than expected in diabetes or functional defect of GLP-1 activity could be the
      mechanism of loss of GLP-1 effect irrespective of DPP-4. Secondly, mutation or functional
      defect of DPP-4 enzyme could not be inhibited by DPP-4 inhibitor. Thirdly, GLP-1 receptor
      mutation or other defect in Î²-cell responsiveness to GLP-1 leads to reduction of response to
      DPP-4 inhibitor.
