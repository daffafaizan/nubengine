      with metastatic breast cancer. II. Assess the antineoplastic activity and safety profile of
      this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive daunorubicin liposomal IV over a
      minimum of 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of daunorubicin liposomal until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease are followed at 1 and 3 months, then
      every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
