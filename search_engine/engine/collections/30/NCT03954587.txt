      or without human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) trigger or endometrial preparation with
      hormonal treatment (artificial cycles), with or without Gonadotrophin - releasing hormone
      agonist suppression. Recent studies comparing artificial and natural cycles concluded that
      the optimal means of endometrial preparation for frozen- thawed cycle remains unclear and
      both options may be offered to women with regular ovulatory cycles.

      Correctly identified spontaneous natural cycles are the preferred option for frozen-thawed
      embryo transfer in women with regular menstrual cycles.

      Investigators will be comparing artificial (HRT) frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles to
      correctly conducted spontaneous natural cycles after the transfer of a chromosomally normal
      embryo.
