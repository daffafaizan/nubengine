      COVID-19 epidemic. According to data from the Ministry of Health, in Spain 26% of health
      personnel have been infected by COVID-19, for a total of 31,053 professionals, representing
      up to 18.5% of all infections in the Spanish state, with variations between the different
      autonomous communities.1 In Italy it was estimated that up to 20% of health workers who
      responded to the epidemic would have been infected within a month.

      There are no unified guidelines at the state level to determine infection prevention
      strategies in health personnel in order to validate them, beyond the use of Personal
      Protective Equipment (PPE) in personnel and general strategies for isolation and prevention
      of transmission.

      There are no approved drug prevention strategies for primary prophylaxis against COVID-19.

      Currently, there are no universal mass screening strategies (virological or immunological) to
      estimate the actual number of health personnel with an asymptomatic infection, as well as to
      determine the percentage of personnel who have already passed the infection asymptomatically
      or to determine the percentage of personnel A healthcare provider who has developed some form
      of immunity following a confirmed COVID-19 infection.

      The HUGTiP, like the rest of Catalan hospitals, has suffered a massive avalanche accumulated
      in the time of admission by COVID-19, which has forced it to adopt different innovative
      strategies to visit them in emergencies, enter them in conventional hospitalization in a
      conventional plant, or attend them in the intensive care units that had to be created de novo
      against the clock. As of April 20, 2020, 1,000 hospital discharges have been granted to
      patients admitted by COVID-19 in conventional hospitalization plants and 170 more discharges
      from those admitted to intensive care units at HUGTiP. Likewise, the Municipal Hospital of
      Badalona has given a total of 300 discharges of patients with COVID-19, and they have also
      reported about 180 infections in their health personnel in this period.

      Due to the high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential severity, several
      healthcare workers at HUGTiP decided on their own to take empirical primary prophylaxis with
      oral hydroxychloroquine individually as prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
