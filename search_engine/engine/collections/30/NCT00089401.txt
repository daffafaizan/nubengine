      Primary

        -  Determine the response and duration of response in patients with unresectable colorectal
           cancer metastatic to the liver and refractory to first-line systemic chemotherapy
           treated with isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pattern of recurrence (liver vs systemic) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine hepatic progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the time to hepatic and systemic progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate baseline QOL with length of survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a limited laparotomy to determine if extrahepatic disease that was
      not visualized during preoperative scanning is present. Patients found to have peritoneal
      seeding or unresectable extrahepatic metastatic disease not previously visualized on scans do
      not receive isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP). Remaining patients undergo IHP with melphalan
      and hyperthermia therapy. Liver perfusion continues for 1 hour.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and then every 3-4 months for 3 years.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3-4 months for 3 years, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
