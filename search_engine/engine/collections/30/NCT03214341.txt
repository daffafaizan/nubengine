      and grading of malignancy is essential for treatment planning as well as for prognosis .

      MRI presents valuable diagnostic information in assessing the mediastinum. In addition,
      special applications have been developed over recent years diffusion-weighted magnetic
      resonance imaging is one such technique The advent of echo-planar imaging technique has
      rendered diffusion weighted imaging of the abdomen and thoracic cavity possible .

      Quantitative assessment of the mediastinal mass is possible by calculation of apparent
      diffusion co-efficient value ,which is related to the proportion of extracellular and
      intracellular component.

      The apparent diffusion co-efficient is inversely correlated with tissue cellularity. It is
      lower in viable tumor tissue with densely packed diffusion-hindering obstacles than in tissue
      with less densely packed obstacles such as tumor necrosis and benign tissue .
