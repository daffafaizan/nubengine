      given 5% AN2690 Solution. Provided that there is adequate evidence of clinical safety after
      two weeks of dosing with 5% AN2690 Solution, a second group of 30 protocol-qualified subjects
      will be assigned to Treatment Group 2 and given 7.5% AN2690 Solution. A third group of 30
      subjects will be enrolled and assigned the highest safe concentration of AN2690 evaluated in
      this study.
