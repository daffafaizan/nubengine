      randomized to 3 groups: control group, probiotics group and prebiotics group for a 14-weeks
      clinical trail and 12-weeks follow-up period. In addition to probiotics, prebiotic or
      maltodextrin interventions, in the meantime, all participants will also use one of the
      prescribed antipsychotics medications. Clinical efficacy and safety assessment will be done
      at baseline, clinical trail and follow-up period. The specific aims are to evaluate these
      tips: 1) psychotic syndrome; 2) cognition; 3) Gastrointestinal function; 4) inflammatory and
      metabolic related markers. Psychotic syndrome will be measured by the Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale. Cognitive function will be assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive
      Battery. Gastrointestinal function will be assessed by gastrointestinal symptom assessment
      scale (GSRS). Biological samples also will be collected, and stored to research Intestinal
      inflammation, intestinal permeability, intestinal flora and other indicators.
