    
      The primary objective of this multi-center, randomized phase 2 study is to determine the
      response rates, complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery
      (CRi), of glasdegib/DAC5 and glasdegib/DAC10 in patients with newly-diagnosed PrAML.

      There are two secondary objectives for this study. The first secondary objective is to
      evaluate the toxicity and safety profiles of glasdegib/DAC5 and glasdegib/DAC10 in patients
      with newly-diagnosed PrAML. The other secondary objective is to determine the event-free
      survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response,
      bone marrow mutational clearance, and remission clonality of glasdegib/DAC5 and
      glasdegib/DAC10 in patients with newly-diagnosed PrAML.
