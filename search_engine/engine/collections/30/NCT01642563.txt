      physician in charge issues a platelet transfusion request to transfusion service. Transfusion
      service (which knows patient treatment arm) issues a PRT product or a standard product as
      indicated, typically within hours of request receipt; patient's physician identifies unit
      code and intended recipient's code and determines vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, body
      temp). Transfusion is started and completed in 30 min. Adverse reactions are monitored by
      ward personnel and once a day IPTAS local coordinator visits the ward, checks IPTAS patients'
      records, fills IPTAS forms, examines and interviews each enrolled patient and transfers
      filled forms to data coordinating center in Milan.
