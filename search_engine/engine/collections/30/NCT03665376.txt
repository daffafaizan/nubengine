      available from resource poor settings. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility
      and test efficacy of ERAS in reducing length of post-operative hospital stay and the
      incidence of postoperative complications compared to the standard of care as the control
      group.

      33 participants above 18 years of age, undergoing laparotomy, were randomly assigned to an
      intervention (ERAS) arm or to a control (standard surgical care) arm at Mbarara Regional
      Referral Hospital in Uganda. The ERAS and the control arm had 16 and 17 patients
      respectively, followed-up 14 days after surgery.

      Patients in the ERAS arm had 2.4 days (SD 0.7) of post-operative hospital stay shorter than
      those in the control arm, p=0.0025 (4.1±0.2 vs 6.5±0.6 respectively). 18.8% of patients in
      the control arm developed post-operative complications compared to 5.9% in the ERAS arm
      (Statistical insignificance, p=0.34). ERAS patients passed flatus eight hours earlier than
      patients in the control arm, and mobilisation out of bed happened 12 hours earlier in the
      ERAS group p value=0.4.

      ERAS is feasible at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, and it leads to reduced hospital stay
      duration but not post-operative complications in laparotomy cases.
