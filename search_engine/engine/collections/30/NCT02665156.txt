      <5hr. In the last 50 cases of our series (data unpublished) this benchmark was obtained in
      60% of patients (p0), while we expect to improve the time efficiency of the procedure with
      the use of robotic staplers maintaining the total operative time of the procedure <5hrs in at
      least 80% (p1) of cases. According to A'Hern, in order to verify the significance of this
      hypothesis, the estimated sample size is 33 patients with a power of 80% at a significance
      level of 5%. The trial will be successful if the total operative time will be <5hrs in at
      least 25 out of 33 patients.

      The population of this study will include 35 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer
      without contraindications to orthotopic neobladder. The first two cases will be excluded in
      order to provide the entire surgical team the minimal skill necessary for a proper and time
      efficient use of the new surgical device (robotic stapler). The following 33 consecutive
      cases will be enrolled and the outcomes analyzed. The estimated time to complete the
      enrollment is 9 months.
