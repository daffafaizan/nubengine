      treatments for age-related cataract (ARC). Cataract surgery increases visual acuity but may
      lead to complaints after surgery. Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOLs) provide enhanced far
      and near visual acuity, but they can bring about halos and glare, which are caused by design
      deficiencies of the IOLs. Fortunately, most of the halos and glare diminish with time. Niels
      et al noted that neural adaptation (NA) may explain the lower incidence of glare and halos in
      their study. Compared to monofocal intraocular lens, pseudo accommodation in nonphysiological
      state may increase the difficulty of neural compensation reconstruction in patients with
      multifocal intraocular lens implantation.

      In the present study, the investigators evaluated the activity of neurons in the visual
      cortex using fMRI both preoperatively and postoperatively. In addition, the investigators
      evaluated postoperative changes in VF, including visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity
      (CS), straylight values (SVs), and pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP), stereoscopic
      vision, wavefront aberrations at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months postoperatively.In
      this trial, the investigators aimed to specify the time of neural compensation reconstruction
      in patients and to explore the changes of visual function in senile patients with monofocal
      or multifocal intraocular lens implantation.
