      occurred more and more. The best recommend treatment is surgical treatment of intramedullary
      fixation. However, existing methods of intramedullary fixation could not be restored the
      integrated interior support, and it will occur early hip varus. Meanwhile, the varus
      deformity will no longer develop if the two ends contact with wach other. This new
      intramedullary fixation device can overcome the existing shortage of intramedullary fixation
      devices and supporting the inside of the problem. It can prompting the fracture site to
      obtain a stronger initial stability, improve fracture healing rate, reduce the incidence of
      varus and allow patients with early weight-bearing walking.
