      antibody deficiencies for several decades now. Although subcutaneous infusions were
      originally proposed as an alternative to intramuscular injections, more recently, this method
      has been proven as a safe and convenient method for providing immunoglobulin levels in adults
      and children. Subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulins has some clinical advantages
      over intravenous immunoglobulin infusions (IVIG) , including a more benign side effect
      profile, better sustained levels of IgG in the blood and reduced cost. An additional benefit
      is an improvement in the quality of life, which is in part secondary to the feasibility of
      the patients to administer it themselves at home. The most common infections in primary
      antibody deficiency patients involves encapsulated bacteria, mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae
      and Haemophilus influenzae type b. The aim of this study is to verify if patients with
      antibody deficiency receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) infusions keep protective
      antibody levels to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and tetanus
      toxoid.
