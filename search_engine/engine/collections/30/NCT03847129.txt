      tendons of hands to achieve the greatest range of motion. Thus, in conjunction with resistive
      exercises for diabetic hands, such exercises are considered an appropriate home-based
      training method that has positive effects on various diabetic hand problems in terms of
      regaining smooth tendon excursion, preventing joint contracture, and reducing intrinsic
      muscle tightness. Different from the biomechanical approach to deal with hand problems, a
      biofeedback system can be used to provide real-time information on improper movements during
      task-based training intended to enhance either performance quality or accuracy. This study
      aims to analyze the difference in treatment effects between a computerized evaluation and a
      re-education biofeedback system that provides interactive sensorimotor information to shape
      the optimized coordinated pinch pattern of a hand and a home-based tendon gliding exercise
      program in conjunction with resistive exercise with weekly supervision on sensorimotor
      function and quality of life for diabetic patients. The investigators hypothesize the
      task-based biofeedback training using the biofeedback training system could have significant
      effectiveness for restoration of sensory function, precision pinch performance, hand
      dexterity and life quality for patients with diabetic neuropathy.
