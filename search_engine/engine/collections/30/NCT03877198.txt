      titration during respiratory support is vital to prevent these conditions but is very
      challenging. In the investigator's neonatal intensive care unit preterm infants routinely
      receive automatic oxygen titration performed by a controller. The currently used controllers
      are both proven to be more effective than manual titration, however which of the two
      controllers is most effective in keeping oxygen saturation within target range remains
      unclear.

      This randomized crossover trial tests tests both controllers within every study patient to
      determine which controller is most effective and thereby would hopefully reduce morbidity
      associated with hypoxemia and hyperoxemia the most. The primary outcome measure is the
      proportion of time spent within target range, each controller will be tested for 24 hours
      within the same study subject. This is excluding a 1-hour wash-out period after a change in
      ventilator.

      Eligible infants are randomized to start with either the Oxygenie algorithm or CLiO2
      algorithm and will switch to the other study arm after 24 hours of measurement.
