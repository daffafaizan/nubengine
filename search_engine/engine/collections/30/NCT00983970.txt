      medical morbidity associated with adolescent obesity. However, attrition from aerobic
      exercise programs is high in obese children as they do not tolerate it or enjoy it.
      Capitalizing on technology to use TV or video games as incentives to exercise may improve
      adherence to exercise and associated health benefits in obese adolescents.

      Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of interactive video game
      stationary cycling (GameBike Â®) with cycling to music on aerobic fitness, body composition,
      cardiovascular disease risk markers, and exercise behaviour as measured by attendance, energy
      expenditure, duration, intensity and distance pedaled in obese adolescents.

      Method: Twenty six obese adolescents were stratified by gender and randomized to a either
      interactive video game cycling (n=13) or cycling to music serving as controls (n=13). The
      10-week program consisted of twice weekly sessions lasting a maximum of 60 minutes per
      session.
