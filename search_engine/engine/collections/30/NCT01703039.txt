    
      Recent attention has focused on the glutamatergic system as a new, distinct target for
      depression treatment. Riluzole (Rilutek, Sanofi), an oral modulator of glutamate activity
      with neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties, is currently approved by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
      Preliminary studies using riluzole to treat depression in humans are promising, though
      larger, double-blinded controlled trials are needed.

      Overall study population:

      Adult outpatients with a current, untreated major depressive episode.

      Disallowed therapies include: other psychotropic medications, including antipsychotics, mood
      stabilizers, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, other sedative-hypnotics, chronic opiates, or
      additional antidepressants, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, vagal nerve
      stimulations therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy, or phototherapy.
