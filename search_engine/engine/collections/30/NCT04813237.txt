      non-optimal position of the fetus. Initial observations show that such childbirth is
      perceived as difficult by both the women giving birth and the staff. The aim of the study is
      to describe the level of difficulty of this labor, expressed as the experience of the woman,
      as well as all the elements that may affect the difficulty of this labor, for example, slower
      or no progress in labor, disturbances in systolic function, injuries, the need to use
      epidural anesthesia, increased blood loss.
