      iron absorption, and iron uptake in liver and adipose tissue, are regulated through the
      hormone hepcidin. Iron is implicated in microvascular and macrovascular disease pathways and
      therefore hepcidin may represent a biomarker for progression to complications in type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

      Serum pancreatic polypeptide levels correlate with visceral adiposity and may therefore
      contribute to the diagnosis of, and risk stratification in, the metabolic syndrome.

      Hypothesis:

      Measuring iron status, incretin hormones and serum pancreatic polypeptide will facilitate
      discrimination of patients at risk of vascular complications of T2DM and clinically
      significant non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
