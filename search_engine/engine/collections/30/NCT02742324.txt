    
      Part 1 is a dose finding phase 1 trial that assesses the safety of the combination of
      different doses of both ruxolitinib and peg-IFN alpha-2a

      Part 2 is a phase 2 randomized evaluation of the optimal doses found in the first part of the
      study to a total maximal number of 42 evaluable patients.

      It will use the Bayesian Phase 1/2 adaptively randomized design proposed by Yuan and Yin
      (2011) for combined drugs.The trial will examine three doses of ruxolitinib: 10, 15 and 20 mg
      BID and three doses of the peg-IFN alpha-2a: 45, 90, and 135 mcg/week). The starting doses
      for each drug have been selected based on prior monotherapy experience where these doses have
      shown some degree of clinical activity as single agents and pharmacodynamic data supports the
      activity observed. In the interest of patient safety, both of these compounds will start at
      dose levels at or near 50% of their respective maximum tolerated doses.
