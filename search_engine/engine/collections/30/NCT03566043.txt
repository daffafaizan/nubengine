    
      MPS II is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the
      iduronate-2-sulfatase gene (IDS). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant
      idursulfase (ELAPRASEÂ®) is the only approved product for the treatment of Hunter syndrome,
      however, ERT as currently administered does not cross the Blood Brain Barrier and is
      therefore unable to address the unmet need in MPS II patients with CNS (neurocognition and
      behavior) involvement. RGX-121 is designed to deliver a healthy gene to cells in the CNS and
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) where it may be secreted by transduced cells which may
      cross-correct non-transduced cells by taking up the functional enzyme. This is a Phase I/II,
      first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, single arm dose escalation study of RGX-121. Three,
      one time doses of RGX-121 will be studied in approximately 12 pediatric subjects who have
      severe MPS II. Safety will be the primary focus for the initial 24 weeks after treatment
      (primary study period) whereupon, subjects will continue to be assessed (safety and efficacy)
      for up to a total of 104 weeks following treatment with RGX-121.-121.
