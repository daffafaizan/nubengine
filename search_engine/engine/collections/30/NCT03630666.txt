      obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups:

      Experimental group: IADT + IG-IMRT Control group: IADT

      In both study arms, the first injection of IADT will be administered in hospital on the day
      of randomization. The overall duration of IADT will be six months.

      In the experimental group, patients will receive radiotherapy three months after the first
      injection of IADT.

      The overall duration of radiotherapy will be three months.

      The overall duration of IADT will be six months. It will be administered three months, +/- 15
      days prior to the first day of radiotherapy. At the completion of the six-month treatment
      period, a non-treatment interval will start if :

      there is no evidence of clinical disease progression and the PSA level is â‰¤ 4.00 ng/ml If the
      PSA subsequently rises above 0.20 ng/ml and is confirmed by a second measurement at least
      three weeks later, PET/CT imaging will be repeated every 6 months until a clinical failure is
      detected or until the PSA rises above 4.00 ng/ml.
