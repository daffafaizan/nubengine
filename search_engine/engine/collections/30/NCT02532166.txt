      an incidence of 1-2% in 30-70% of cases either at the mucosa of the mouth, or partly in
      combination with infection of the skin, the oral with his known premalignant potential in up
      to 2-3% predisposed to the development of an oral squamous cell carcinoma. In rare cases,
      there is also an manifestation of the lining of the esophagus, which can then be associated
      with symptomatic strictures of the esophagus. In addition, four cases have been reported with
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in patients with esophageal lichen planus.

      The value of moreover increasingly established use of narrow-band imaging (a process for
      improving the detection of early cancers in the gastrointestinal tract by creating a maximum
      contrast between outright and altered mucosa, which could have already shown an improved
      detection rate of early lesions of the esophagus as well as squamous cell carcinoma), or the
      chromoendoscopy has means for example Lugol solution in correlation to the histopathologic
      findings in lichen planus), has not been investigated to date.

      Also, data of the natural long-term outcome in esophageal lichen planus infestation
      especially in view of malignant transformation are currently not available.
