      preventive medicines such as dopamine receptor antagonist, corticosteroid, serotonin receptor
      antagonist, has been developed and used, there is residual nausea and/or vomiting in a
      significant percentage of patients treated for cancer. Serotonin receptor antagonist is the
      most potent antiemetic agent and has been used widely. However, the optimal dose of serotonin
      antagnosit based on individual symptoms is not defined. Therefore, this study was conducted
      to design standardization model for optiomal serotonin antagonist concentration using
      pharmacodynamic study and Rhodes Index as a suggogate marker for CINV.
