      The Colli-Pee study is a sub-study of the Be-PrEP-ared study (EudraCT number:
      2015-000054-37). All participants who participate in the Be-PrEP-ared study will be asked to
      participate in this sub-study.

      Study design:

      Participants who agree to be included in this study will be asked to collect first-void urine
      using the Colli-PeeTM device the day after the baseline, month 6, month 12 and month 18
      visit. They will be asked to send the urine container back to ITM using regular mail. In
      addition they will also be asked to complete a small questionnaire concerning the easiness of
      use and the willingness of future use of the Colli-PeeTM device at the enrolment visit and
      final visit of the Be-PrEP-ared study.
