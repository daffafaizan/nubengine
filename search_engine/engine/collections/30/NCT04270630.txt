    
      A single-center, prospective, un-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Primary objective: To
      pilot a coronary revascularization decision aid in older adults with NSTEMI who are
      candidates for elective LHC in order to determine its effectiveness in lowering decisional
      conflict by the decisional conflict scale (DCS).

      Secondary objectives: To determine decision aid feasibility by measuring time of
      administration and percentage of patients agreeing to use. Also, to assess efficacy of the
      decision aid in decreasing patient feelings of anxiety and depression (by the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale), increasing decision self-efficacy (by the Ottawa Decision
      Self-Efficacy Scale), and increasing medical knowledge.
