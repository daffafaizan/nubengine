      myeloma will receive daratumumab and dexamethasone for 2 months. Patients who achieve a
      partial response or better will continue on daratumumab. Patients who achieve less than a
      partial response will have lenalidomide or bortezomib added to their therapy. Patients who
      experience progressive disease on daratumumab after the initial 2 months of monotherapy or on
      the combination of daratumumab and either lenalidomide or bortezomib will come off study
