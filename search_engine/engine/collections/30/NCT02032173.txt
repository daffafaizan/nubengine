      Group and the Rescue Group.

      Patient's eligibility was assessed during a screening visit (Visit 1) which took place 14
      days maximum before treatment initiation (Visit 2 [Day 0]). All patients were initially
      included in the Main Group and were to receive an initial loading treatment (6 injections
      during the intensive treatment phase i.e. every month from Day 0 to Month 5, followed by 2
      additional injections at Months 8 and 11). Patients were to be followed-up every 3 months for
      18 months (spaced-out follow-up period). Their visual acuity was to be checked at each study
      visit (Months 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, and 23) to assess their response to treatment.
      Patients who responded to treatment were maintained in the Main Group. Patients who did not
      meet pre defined criteria were moved to the Rescue Group and treated at the investigator's
      discretion.

      The trial was terminated before any patient reached month 12.
