      mask airway(LMA) is one of option according to Difficult intubation guidelines. First, insert
      LMA and insert fiberoptic through LMA. Second, insert endotracheal tube using fiberoptic as a
      guide. This process has several problem. Removal of LMA is impossible, so there is a risk of
      dislodging of endotracheal tube.

      Aintree catheter is developed to this problem. Insert Aintree catheter through LMA using
      fiberoptic, and remove LMA, finally insert endotracheal tube throug Aintree catheter. But the
      problem of this method is that the whole process is complex and takes long time. And there is
      a risk of impeding of endotracheal tube at glottis level because the difference of diameters
      between endotracheal tube and aintree catheter.

      Long endotracheal tube could solve the problems mentioned above. Through LMA, insert
      endotracheal tube using fiberoptic as a guide. Tube is long enough to remove LMA without a
      risk of dislodging. And after removal of LMA, tube can be cut for optimizing length.

      So the purpose of this study is comparing the efficacy of Aintree catheter method and Long
      tube method in manikin.
