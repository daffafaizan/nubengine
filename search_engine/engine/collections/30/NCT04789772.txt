      adverse consequences to individuals and the society. Manual or auricular acupuncture have
      been applied in opioid dependence treatment for a long time. Electroacupuncture may also
      alleviate the symptoms of MA addiction such as psychosis, anxiety, and depression during
      abstinence. However, several comorbidities are associated with MA use, such as blood-borne
      infections, decreased the willingness of physicians to perform. The advantages of laser
      acupuncture (LA) include its safety, painlessness, limited time use, and higher
      acceptability, making it suitable for treatment of drug users. To investigate the clinical
      efficacy of laser acupuncture combined with group cognitive behavioral therapy for MA
      addiction treatment. MA users who participated in group cognitive behavioral therapy and met
      the inclusion criteria were referred from psychiatrists to participate. The participants
      received laser acupuncture treatment once a week for 2 months (total eight treatments) on
      selected acupoints (PC6, HT7, LI4, ST36, SP6, and LR3). Laboratory assessment included
      urinalysis for MA and liver function tests aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
      aminotransferase, and Î³-glutamyltransferase (AST, ALT, and r-GT), whereas the objective
      assessment included visual analog scale (VAS) for MA craving and refusal and Pittsburgh sleep
      quality index (PSQI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)
      questionnaires. All data were collected before and at 1 and 2 months after treatment.
      Cognitive behavioral therapy completion rate and rate of relapse to MA use were also
      determined.
