      tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. However, a significant number of non-motor symptoms also
      accompany the unfolding of this disease. In fact, hallucinations are experienced by
      approximately 60% of the patients. The most common and amongst one of the earliest
      hallucinations in Parkinson's Disease, is the Presence Hallucination (PH), i.e., the strange
      sensation of perceiving someone behind when no one is actually there. In the present study
      the researchers aim at investigating the behavioural and neural mechanisms underlying
      symptomatic PH in PD. To do so the researchers intend to induce the PH in a repeated and
      controlled manner in the MRI scanner, with an extensively verified paradigm which gives rise
      to this sensation by means of robotically-mediated sensorimotor stimulation. This setup has
      in fact been shown to trigger the occurrence of symptomatic PH in these patients. The
      possibility to induce PH while the patient is in the MRI will allow the researchers to
      investigate online the brain networks associated with it.

      With analysis on the fine brain connectivity changes during PH-induction, the investigators
      intend to pinpoint the exact mechanism behind the appearance of this hallucination in these
      patients, in a similar fashion to previous work with the PH-induction in healthy individuals.
