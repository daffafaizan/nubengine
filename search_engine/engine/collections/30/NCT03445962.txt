      disharmonies, blood parameters, motor disabilities, heart rate variability parameters
      measured during sleep and during autonomic nervous stimulation by orthostatic test.

      All these factors will be linked to the data obtained by:

        1. polysomnography

        2. by the joint use of seismocardiography

      OSAS lead to many associated disorders, which identified early can be better supported to
      limit the deleterious effects of this OSAS:

      (i) a sudden and repeated activation of the sympathetic nervous system triggered by sleep
      fragmentation (ii) intermittent hypoxia associated with OSAS may increase insulin resistance
      through the involvement of an inflammatory state and oxidative stress.

      (iii) a significant level of diurnal fatigue limiting activities, thus promoting a sedentary
      lifestyle and increasing cardiovascular risk factors.

      Several secondary objectives will therefore be studied:

        1. Can OSAS be predicted by the existence of autonomic dysfunction?

        2. Can OSAS be predicted by specific biological disturbances?

        3. Can OSAS be predicted by the presence of a specific cranial structure?

        4. Can OSAS be predicted by an insufficient level of physical activity?

      Finally does the use seismocardiography make it possible to identify quickly and early these
      risk factors linked to OSAS?
