    
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a relatively rare subtype (3% to 6% (Zhou, 2008) of mature B
      cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), with a median age at diagnosis in mid to late 60's, a male
      predominance (3/1) and typically advanced stage presentation though only about 1/3 of
      patients are truly symptomatic at baseline (Armitage, 1998). Although significant
      controversies remain in the management of MCL, all would agree that the challenges associated
      with MCL, particularly the poor results with standard chemotherapy and frequent
      chemoresistance have pushed the community to be more innovative and active in clinical
      research. Hence the median OS has clearly improved over the last 3 decades (from 2-3y to >5y)
      (Goy, 2011a), thanks to deeper responses obtained with intensive regimens in younger patients
      (an early CR translates into clearly better outcome) and also better salvage therapies with
      now MCL being the only lymphoma with 4 new biologicals approved (3 in the US and 1 in EU).
