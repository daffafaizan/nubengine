      a couple weeks. Some patients do not recover and with time develop chronic cervical pain and
      nerve root compression which may result in cervical radiculopathy.

      Far-infrared (FIR) ray is one of the topics in energy medicine which is tremendously studied
      for the past few years. A variety of FIR applications showed an enhancement of beneficial
      effects on healing therapy, even though there is limited technical approach and systemic
      study placed on the theoretical study of FIR ceramics processing and the emissivity
      optimizing.

      The evident difficulties in finding the appropriate cervical radiculopathy therapy initiated
      the current study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the FIR cervical
      collar in patients with long-lasting cervicobrachial pain; in whom the pain had a
      distribution that corresponded to a specific nerve root compression revealed by MRI or
      electrophysiological study.
