    
      Eligible active duty service members, retired or veterans who participated in rehabilitation
      programs at Department of Defense Advanced Rehabilitation Centers (Walter Reed National
      Military Medical Center, Center for the Intrepid-San Antonio Military Medical Center and/or
      the Naval Medical Center San Diego) will be considered for enrollment in this study. This
      study will look at service members who have undergone transfemoral, transtibial or bilateral
      lower extremity amputation or limb salvage procedures. Participants will receive fall
      prevention training on an instrumented treadmill (6, training sessions). Participants will
      receive three performance assessments:-immediately following completion of the treadmill
      training and at three and six months following the completion of the training. Post training,
      twice per month subjects will receive an email containing a follow up fall questionnaire
      monitoring if they have fallen and the circumstances surrounding their fall. If they do not
      have access to email, or if a timely response is not received from the email questionnaire
      which was sent out, subjects will be contacted by phone.
