      characterized by uncomfortable sensory symptoms relived by voluntary or involuntary
      movements. Objectives -To test our hypothesis that sensorimotor gating is deficient in RLS.
      Methods - In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical study, sensorimotor gating will be
      assessed through the use of validated electrophysiological tests of prepulse inhibition, in
      17 adult patients with RLS and 17 matched healthy controls. Risks and benefits -Risks
      involved in this study are minimal, and deemed reasonable in relation to potential benefits.
      This investigation will lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of RLS.
