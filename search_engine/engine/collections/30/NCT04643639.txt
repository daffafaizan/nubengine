      Sepsis-induced immunoparalysis, increasingly recognized as the overriding immune disorder in
      sepsis patients, attributes significantly to late mortality in sepsis patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that 'blood purification' techniques targeted at the removal of
      excess circulating cytokines, such as the CytoSorb hemoperfusion device, might prevent or
      attenuate the development of immunoparalysis.

      The objective of this trial is to determine the effects of CytoSorb hemoperfusion on the
      development of immunoparalysis in a repeated experimental endotoxemia model in healthy male
      volunteers.

      To this end, 24 healthy male volunteers subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion into one
      of two treatment groups (active or control). Both study groups will undergo two endotoxin
      challenges, separated by seven days. To this end, endotoxin (LPS) will be administered as a
      bolus of 1 ng/kg, followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 ng/kg/hr for three hours. The active
      group will be treated with CytoSorb hemoperfusion during the first endotoxin challenge,
      whereas the control group will receive no additional treatment. During both endotoxin
      challenges, blood samples will be obtained serially to measure levels of circulating
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.
