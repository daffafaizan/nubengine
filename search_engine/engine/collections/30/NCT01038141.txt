      Milligan and C. N. Morgan described a method for operating piles that still is regarded "the
      gold standard" in the treatment of severe haemorrhoidal disease. This procedure is followed
      by a prolonged and painful recovery. To overcome the long recovery often combined with long
      sick leaves, less invasive methods for treating piles have been introduced during the last
      decade. However, few studies have compared patient benefits and the long term outcome of
      these techniques, and the choice of treatment is often based on the skills and experience of
      the individual surgeon. A new and promising mini invasive approach utilizes doppler-guided
      ligation of the haemorrhoidal arteries. All haemorrhoidal arteries are identified and then
      ligated approximately 2 cm above the anal canal. Thereafter the rectal mucosa with the piles
      is repositioned and fixed in the rectum with running sutures. This procedure is termed Recto
      Anal Repair (RAR) and leads to shrinking of the piles and restored anatomy of the anus and
      the rectum. The investigators want to execute a randomized, consecutive, prospective,
      controlled study with long term follow up to compare the RAR procedure to Milligans operation
      for the treatment of severe haemorrhoidal disease.

      The primary goals are evaluation of pain and sick leave 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery and
      reported reduction of pile symptoms after 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition the investigators
      want to compare the overall satisfaction with the two procedures.
