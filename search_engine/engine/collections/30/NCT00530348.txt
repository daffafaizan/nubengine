      qualified were randomly assigned to treatment with either alemtuzumab or SC interferon
      beta-1a at a 2:1 ratio (that is, 2 given alemtuzumab for every 1 given interferon beta-1a).
      Alemtuzumab was administered in two annual courses, once at the beginning of the study and
      again 1 year later. Interferon beta-1a was self-injected 3 times per week for 2 years. All
      participants were required to return to their study site every 3 months for neurologic
      assessment. In addition, safety-related laboratory tests were performed at least monthly.
      Participation in this study ended 2 years after the start of treatment for each participant.
      Additionally, participants who received alemtuzumab might be followed in CAMMS03409
      (NCT00930553) an extension study for safety and efficacy assessments. Participants who
      received interferon beta-1a and completed 2 years on study might be eligible to receive
      alemtuzumab on the extension study.
