    
      This is a multicentre, randomised, Phase III trial with a parallel-group design, consisting
      of a 2 week drug-free run-in period, followed by a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      treatment period.

      During the run-in period, the subject's bowel habit will be documented and the existence of
      constipation confirmed. At the start of this period, all existing laxative medication will be
      withdrawn and subjects will be instructed not to change their diet or lifestyle during the
      trial.

      Subjects will be allowed to take a laxative (DulcolaxÂ®) as a rescue medication throughout the
      trial, but only if they have not had a bowel movement for three or more consecutive days.
      Subjects will enter the double-blind period if constipation is shown to be present during the
      run-in period. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the 4 treatment arms: 1 mg, 2
      mg, 4 mg of R108512 or placebo, with a 25% chance to each treatment group.

      During the double-blind period, subjects will be treated for 4 weeks with either 1 mg, 2 mg
      or 4 mg R108512 or placebo, given once daily before breakfast.
