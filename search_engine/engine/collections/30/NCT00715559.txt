      general population. Despite advances in treatment, about two-thirds of patients fail to
      respond to an initial trial of pharmacotherapy. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a
      neural growth-promoting polypeptide found in the central nervous system, and has been
      implicated in the pathophysiology and potential treatment of MDD. A multitude of studies have
      shown low levels of BDNF in subjects with MDD, which have normalized after treatment with an
      antidepressant. Traditional antidepressants such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors may
      increase BDNF via an indirect intracellular pathway. The current study drug, cysteamine
      bitartrate (Cystagon), is FDA approved for the treatment nephropathic cystinosis and has been
      shown to increase BNDF in neuronal tissue, and to stimulate cell growth. Cysteamine has
      already been investigated in humans as a potential treatment for Huntington's Disease. Given
      the evidence of decreased levels in major depression, and subsequent increase post-treatment
      with antidepressants, BDNF may play a key role in developing novel treatments for patients
      who have failed conventional agents. Therefore, drugs that can demonstrably increase central
      BDNF, such as cysteamine, may have significant potential as novel antidepressant medications.
