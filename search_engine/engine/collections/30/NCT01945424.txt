    
      Pregnant women will be enrolled in the registry prospectively (after exposure to QIV in
      routine clinical settings but before knowledge of the pregnancy outcome). Women exposed to
      QIV with or without adverse events will be recorded in the Global Pharmacovigilance Database
      and medically reviewed. Pregnancy outcomes will be sought via questionnaires sent to the
      reporter at enrollment, estimated time of delivery, and six months after delivery.
      Descriptive statistical methods will be the primary approach for summarizing data.

      No vaccine products will be provided or administered as part of this registry protocol.
