      clinical rehabilitation setting. This study will determine if exercise facilitates recovery
      by improving markers of neuroplasticity and decreasing neuroinflammatory responses. The
      investigators will also determine if variations in genes involved in neuroplasticity, memory
      and inflammation influence the responsiveness to exercise and rehabilitation. Particular
      genetic polymorphisms involved in neuroplasticity and inflammatory responses will be
      evaluated. Recovery will be determined by assessing cognitive function, life quality and
      balance.
