      vulnerable and this is especially true in low-income settings. The decision to enrol may be
      influenced by existing inequalities, a poor healthcare infrastructure and the fear of death.
      Where patients are confused or unconscious the responsibility for this decision falls on the
      relatives. The objectives of this study are to learn from the experience of participants,
      relatives and researchers involved in a randomised controlled trial, AMBITION (ISRCTN
      72509687), which is testing a novel treatment approach for HIV-associated cryptococcal
      meningitis and is recruiting participants from multiple sites across sub-Saharan Africa.

      The investigators will collect data from trial participants and their relatives who provided
      consent on their behalf in Gaborone, Botswana; Kampala, Uganda and Harare, Zimbabwe.
      Interviews will follow a narrative approach and encourage the drawing of timelines. This will
      be supplemented by direct observation of the research process at each of the three recruiting
      hospitals. In addition, interviews will take place with researchers from the African and
      European institutions that form the partnership through which the trial is administered.
      Findings from the interviews will be prospectively fed back to the individual sites and Trial
      Management Group to improve the ongoing trial.
