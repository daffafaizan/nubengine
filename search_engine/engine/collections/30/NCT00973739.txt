      with NF2-related tumors. Lapatinib is a commercially available inhibitor of ErbB2 and EGF.
      Data suggests that abnormal signaling via EGFR and ErbB2 is a major contributor to tumor
      growth and progression in both sporadic and NF2-related VS and that inhibition of this
      signaling pathway can result in decreased tumor growth.

      Demonstrating that Lapatinib produces an objective response to reduce tumor volume or
      stabilize disease will provide additional treatment options for NF patients with multiple
      tumor growth. For patients with VS we expect to see â‰¥ 10 dB improvement in PTA and/or
      improvement in SDS, compared to the audiogram at initiation of treatment. Currently there are
      no available treatment options for NF2 patients with multiple tumors. Depending on tumor cell
      type, lapatinib has cytostatic or cytotoxic antitumor effects, and in a recent study
      assessing the biological effects of Lapatinib on the associated molecular pathways and tumor
      growth in patients with solid tumors, a correlation was seen between tumor response and
      pre-treatment levels of (phosphor)-ErbB2 and (phosphor)-ERK1/2.
