      replaced with pre-osteoblastic, fibrous tissue, yielding skeletal deformities and an
      increased propensity towards fracture, musculoskeletal weakness and bone pain. Despite the
      frequent use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesic strategies, pain in FD
      remains common and frequently debilitating, particularly during adulthood. Moreover, for many
      patients there is a discordance between perceived pain levels and detectable musculoskeletal
      pathology. To elucidate the mechanism underlying pain in FD/MAS patients, investigators at
      the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), National Center for
      Complementary and Integrative Heath (NCCIH) and Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) aim to probe
      three inter-related domains that are projected to underlie pain experience(s) in FD/MAS
      patients. These include (i.) the presence of maladaptive central nervous system processes
      that amplify afferent pain or somatosensory signals, and also facilitate persistent pain;
      (ii.) aberrant interplay between neurological and musculoskeletal systems; (iii.) a mental
      health status shaped by the overall burden of living with FD and (iv.) the influence of
      childhood, FD-related complications on adulthood pain phenotypes. To investigate these four
      domains hypothesized to underlie FD pain as well as inform on the disconnect between pain and
      FD disease burden, the investigators will employ methods that complement routine clinical
      evaluation and diagnostic tests (i.e., 18F-NaF PET/CT or 18F-FDG PET/CT) such as
      neuroimaging, musculoskeletal MRI and such as neuroimaging, musculoskeletal MRI and
      assessment of inflammatory and pain mediator expression in blood samples.
