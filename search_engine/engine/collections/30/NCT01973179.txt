      Primary: Evaluation of late toxicity of re-irradiation with protons, for patients with head
      and neck cancer in a previously (> 50 Gy) irradiated field.

      Secondary: Evaluation of the efficacy (local control) and acute toxicity (after 24 Months) of
      re-irradiation with protons up to a dose of 60 Gy, for patients with head and neck cancer in
      a previously (> 50 Gy) irradiated field.

      OUTLINE This is a single center observational study. In-house standard of care for patients
      (good performance status and with small tumors) with head and neck cancer in a previously (>
      50 Gy) irradiated field is to irradiate the tumor with a hyperfractionated schedule and
      concurrent cisplatin up to a dose of 66 Gy. Dose limiting for this schedule is the incidence
      of acute and late toxicity induced by radiation. The purpose of the study is the evaluation
      of the safety of a treatment schedule based on the use of protons.

      Proton beam treatments will be delivered in 2 Gy fractions, 5 days per week, to a total dose
      of 60-66 Gy equivalent.

      Study visits are performed:

      During proton therapy once per week. Follow-up visits are scheduled every 3 months for the
      first 24 months after proton therapy.

      Primary endpoint is late toxicity 24 months after proton treatment.
