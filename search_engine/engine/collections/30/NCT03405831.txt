      (HTx) due to parasympathetic denervation at the operation.

      Elevated resting HR is generally acknowledged as a negative predictor of outcome in heart
      disease. The impact in heart transplant recipients is not fully understood, however, it has
      been associated with increased risk of developing cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) or
      death.

      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a diffuse vascular disease affecting the entire coronary
      tree. It is the leading cause of death in patients more than 5 years after HTx and it is well
      known that patients with CAV have markedly reduced exercise capacity.

      The association between elevated HR and CAV raises the question whether an intervention to
      specifically lower HR could improve symptoms and prognosis in heart transplant recipients
      with CAV and elevated resting HR.

      Small studies have shown that HR reduction using the If channel blocker ivabradine after HTx
      is safe. However, none of these studies were randomized or blinded, and as such proof of any
      efficacy (beyond HR reduction) after HTx is non-existing. Clearly, there is a need to
      determine if such treatment could improve exercise capacity, graft function and prognosis
      after HTx.
