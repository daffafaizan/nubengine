    
      This is a randomized, controlled and single blinded trial. Fifty-four asthmatic adults will
      be randomly assigned into two groups: DBG (dietary and behavioral support group) or DBE
      (similar to DBG + exercise training). Both groups will complete a weight-loss program based
      on dietary and behavioral therapy. In addition, DBE will perform a training program based on
      aerobic and resistance training whereas DBG will perform a breathing and stretching program.
      Interventions will be performed twice a week for 3 months, 60 minutes each. The data
      normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the variables obtained before interventions
      will be compared with the Student t-test or Mann-whitney U-test. Comparisons of the initial
      and final data on outcomes will be analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate
      post hoc of Bonferroni. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.
