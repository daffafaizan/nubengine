      and related treatments in the identification and intervention of gastrointestinal diseases.
      Many of these treatments using flexible endoscopes have either complimented or replaced
      surgical approaches to these same benign and malignant disease processes with the potential
      of being the standard of care for many of these clinical conditions. The initial primary
      focus of this study will be the use of endoscopic myotomy for achalasia, endoscopic treatment
      of post bariatric weight gain, endoscopic gastro-gastric fistula treatments, and other
      endoluminal therapies for gastrointestinal and post-operative conditions. These treatments
      have been validated by prior surgery studies.
