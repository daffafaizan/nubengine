      two-arm, two-stage randomized trial of 632 adult PWH who smoke cigarettes and receive care in
      one of three health systems. At inception, participants will be randomized to either
      combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, patch + short-acting NRT) or combination
      NRT+contingency management (CM). At 12 weeks, responders (non-smoking participants confirmed
      by exhaled carbon monoxide [eCO]) in both arms will receive 12 more weeks of the same
      treatment. Non-responders (participants with continued smoking by self-report and/or eCO) in
      both the NRT and NRT+CM arms will be re-randomized to 12 weeks of treatment, either with
      medication switch to varenicline (VAR) or intensified level of CM (start CM if no CM during
      first 12 weeks, or CM with higher reward schedule ["CM plus"] if NRT+CM group initially). The
      intervention will be delivered by trained clinical pharmacists. The primary outcome will be
      eCO-confirmed abstinence at 24 weeks post-enrollment. The specific aims of the proposed study
      are to: (1) identify the optimal adaptive approach to promote eCO-confirmed smoking
      abstinence (2) study the effectiveness of various adaptive strategies on CD4 count, HIV viral
      suppression, and VACS index (validated measure of morbidity and mortality risk); and (3)
      grounded in implementation science and using a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Type I
      design, identify barriers and facilitators to delivering our intervention to inform future
      implementation.
