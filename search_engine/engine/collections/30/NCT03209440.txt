      step), stepped-wedge design to compare effects of usual outpatient palliative care (usual
      care) and usual care along with either nurse-led or chaplain-led DT on patient outcomes,
      cancer prognosis awareness. The study team will assign 6 outpatient palliative care sites to
      usual care during the first-step, and randomly assign two sites per step to begin and
      continue DT led by either a nurse or a chaplain during each of the next 3 steps. During the
      usual care steps, 280 patients will complete pretest measures and satisfaction with
      palliative spiritual care services, receive usual palliative care, and complete posttest
      measures. During the experimental steps as part of routine palliative care service delivery,
      280 patients will complete pretest measures, receive nurse-led or chaplain-led DT, and
      complete posttest measures. Using mixed level analysis with site, provider (nurse, chaplain)
      and time (step) included in the model, the study team will compare the usual care and each of
      the DT groups for effects on dignity impact, existential tasks, and cancer prognosis
      awareness and explore the moderating effects of physical symptoms and spiritual distress. The
      study team will also determine the effect of usual care and DT on the patient's satisfaction
      with palliative spiritual care services and the report of the patient's unmet spiritual
      needs.
