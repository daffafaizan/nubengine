      presenting to the St. Elizabeth Boardman Family Health Center. The sample will include
      patients presenting for their scheduled appointment. Following informed consent (see attached
      informed consent form), the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. In
      group A, the sequence of BP measurements will be table position (TP) followed by recommended
      chair position (RCP) and then, after a 30-minutes rest, the BP will be measured again in the
      reverse sequence, RCP then TP. In group B, the sequence will begin with BP measurements in
      the RCP then TP, followed by 30-minutes rest and then measurements will be repeated in the
      reverse order. The assignment of participants to groups A and B will be random. The BP will
      be measured twice in each of the positions described above, according the the accepted
      standard technique, using a digital blood pressure monitor, the OMRON HEM-907 XL.
