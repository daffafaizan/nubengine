      reduction of inflammatory processes and the treatment of cancer to the prevention of
      cardiovascular diseases and stroke. With regard to cognitive decline, rodent models for
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) showed improved learning and decelerated hippocampal
      neurodegeneration after intake of resveratrol.

      Animal and first human studies provided evidence that resveratrol might serve as an easy,
      cost-effective option to develop novel prevention and treatment strategies against
      age-associated cognitive decline. To test this hypothesis, the researchers study general
      brain structure and function on healthy older individuals (> 60years old).
