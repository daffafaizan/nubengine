        1. Primary:

             -  Reduction of 24h BP in obese hypertensives

             -  Reduction in arterial stiffness

        2. Secondary

             -  Drug specific effect on new onset of diabetes

             -  Drug specific effect on reduction in central fat deposition and the leptin to
                adiponectin ratio

      Study design

      Study drugs: Irbesartan 300mg vs. amlodipine 10mg

      Tx duration and follow-up: 12 months

      Collected data:

        -  24h SBP and DBP in time 0, 1, 12.

        -  Pulse wave velocity in time 0,1,12.

        -  Central obesity (total, visceral, abdominal fat) in time 0,1,12.

        -  Leptin/adiponectin in time 0,1,12.

        -  BMI, waist/hip ratio in time 0,1, 12.

        -  Glu, HbA1c, insulin in time 0, 1,12.

        -  K, Na, Cr, BUN, Chol, Tg, HDL, LDL,ALT, AST in time 0, 1,12. Number of patients: The
           reduction in mean SBP expected to be 15 mmHg. Previous studies from our group reported
           an 14mmHg SD for mean SBP. The sample size required at the two sided 5% significance
           level and 80% power is 40 patients (Lehr's formula)

      Number of centers: 1
