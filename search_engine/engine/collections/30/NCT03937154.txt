      treatment of CIT in adult subjects receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, ovarian
      cancer, or breast cancer. Subjects must have a platelet count < 75 x 10^9/L on day 1 of the
      study. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period long
      enough to allow for assessment of 3 planned cycles of chemotherapy, a follow-up visit, and
      long-term follow-up (LTFU). Given that subjects are required to have 3 remaining planned
      cycles of chemotherapy, the chemotherapy cycles may be 3 or 4 weeks in duration, and the
      investigational product dose adjustment guidelines allow for up to 12 weeks of dosing before
      a subject is declared a non-responder, the majority of study subjects will receive
      investigational product for a range of 10-22 weeks.
