      therapy. The prognosis of patients with recurrent disease is poor, with a median survival
      ranging from 12 to 24 months. Most of these patients ultimately develop platinum resistant
      disease (PROC). Current systemic therapy results in a very modest improvement of progression
      free and overall survival. The addition of locoregional, intraperitoneal (IP) therapy may
      improve disease control in recurrent OC. Recently, pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol
      therapy (PIPAC) was added to the therapeutic arsenal. This novel technique allows repeated
      laparoscopy aided aerosol delivery of anticancer drugs to the peritoneal cavity. Abraxane
      (nab-pac, Celgene) is a novel 130 nm, albumin-bound (nab) nanoparticle formulation of
      paclitaxel which has noteworthy single-agent activity and a favourable toxicity profile when
      used systemically in PROC. A recent phase I study showed a significant pharmacokinetic
      advantage after IP instillation of nab-pac in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from
      ovarian or gastro-intestinal (GI) origin.

      In phase I of this study, dose escalation will be combined with
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling which incorporates, in addition to plasma, tumour
      tissue, and peritoneal drug concentrations, biomarkers of toxicity and efficacy.
