      (continuous group) or midazolam plus intermittent bolus injection of propofol (intermittent
      group) for deep sedation. In the continuous group, propofol was continuously administered via
      infusion pump and the doses were determined by sedation assistants monitoring the patients.
      In the intermittent group, a loading dose of 2 mg of midazolam and 0.4 mg/kg of propofol was
      initially injected and repeated bolus injection of 20 mg of propofol was followed according
      to patients' sedation level. Sedation related parameters (total dose of propofol,
      induction/recovery time, patients' cooperation) and adverse events during the procedure were
      evaluated. Satisfaction scores by endoscopist, assistant, and patients and difficulty scores
      of maintaining the sedation by assistants were also graded after the procedure.
