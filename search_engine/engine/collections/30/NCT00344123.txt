    
      This is a prospective, open-label pharmacokinetic study in healthy HIV seronegative adults.
      This study will examine the pharmacokinetic interactions between steady-state TPV/r 500
      mg/200 mg B.I.D. and single dose rosuvastatin 10 mg when the drugs are co-administered.

      Rosuvastatin 24 hour pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on days 1-2 and 12-13.
      Rosuvastatin 48 hr samples will be collected on days 3 and day 14.

      Tipranavir and ritonavir 12 hour pharmacokinetic sampling will be on day 11 and 12.

      Safety assessments (physical examination, vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory
      tests) will be performed at screening, during the study and prior to discharge. Subjects will
      be continuously monitored for adverse events throughout the duration of the study.

      On Day 1, subjects will receive a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin. Beginning on Day 3,
      subjects will receive a combination of TPV 500 mg/RTV 200 mg twice daily for 11 days (Days
      3-13).

      On Day 12, subjects will receive a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin co-administered with
      TPV/r.
