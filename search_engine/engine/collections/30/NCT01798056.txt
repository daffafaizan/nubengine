      the start of a chemotherapy cycle:

        -  The OnChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at the start of a chemotherapy
           cycle,

        -  The PreChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at least 10 days before the
           start of a chemotherapy cycle.

      The protocol summary has been updated following Protocol Amendment 2, August 2014, leading to
      the increase of the enrolment.
