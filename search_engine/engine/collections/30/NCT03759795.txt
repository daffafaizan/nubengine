      role in ameliorating the impact of adverse events in high pressure environments. This project
      will use a randomised controlled trial research design to assess the efficacy of brief
      one-to-one Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACTr), designed to enhance surgeons'
      psychological resilience. According to the model ACTr is based on, psychopathology is
      primarily the consequence of psychological inflexibility i.e. inability to persist or change
      behaviour according to long-term values due to language and cognition skills, which has
      particular significance when an individual is confronted with stress or adversity.

      The main aim of this research is to assess the efficacy of a brief one-to-one Acceptance and
      Commitment Training course. Researchers wish to ascertain whether such a course can increase
      surgeons' resilience by increasing psychological flexibility, valuing and self-compassion
      (all of which are expected to be positively impacted by this training). This research will
      fill a gap in the relevant research literature; namely that no research project as far as we
      are aware has evaluated ACTr as a means to enhance resilience in surgeons. In fact any
      research conducted on resilience training with a surgical population is rare.
