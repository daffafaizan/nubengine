      Casa de Misericordia de Porto Alegre.

      After the selection of patients for eligibility criteria they will be randomized into
      functional electrical stimulation group or control group. First all patients will be
      evaluated, and subsequently the patients in the functional electrical stimulation group will
      be trained three times per week for eight weeks using an electric current called functional
      electrical stimulation through the stimulator device NEURODYN II, IBRAMED mark, Amparo, Sao
      Paulo, Brazil.

      The sessions took place in the first hour of dialysis and will last at least 20 and maximum
      of 34 minutes. The parameters selected in the stimulator will be: 80 Hz frequency, 0.4 ms
      pulse, 10 s time on, 50-20s time off, intensity as patient tolerance. The patient will be
      positioned supine, the knees will be at 60Â° flexion through a foam wedge and ankles
      restrained by a band to make isometric exercise.

      Furthermore, the electrodes used to perform the electrical stimulation will adhesive,
      disposable and hypoallergenic. These will be placed over the motor points of the quadriceps
      muscle of both legs in order to make the most effective contraction.

      At the end of follow-up, both groups will be further evaluated in order to compare.
