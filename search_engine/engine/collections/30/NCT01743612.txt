      currently no test measuring it in clinical practice. Response to humeral occlusion is
      interesting and this response has been studied with laser Doppler flowmetry. More recently,
      laser imaging has been used analysing the granularity of the laser: laser Speckle Contrast
      Imaging which allow combining high temporal resolution to high spatial resolution.

      The investigators proposed, in this study, to compare this imaging at basal and after
      post-occlusive hyperaemia of dorsal and palmar face of hand in 3 groups: healthy subjects,
      primary Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis.
