    
      A prospective non-interventional study to evaluate the performance of EASYCOV IVD as
      point-of-care (POC) test by comparing SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 negative
      controls on paired specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs & saliva samples).

      The operators performing the diagnostic tests will be blinded from the RT-PCR results (i.e.
      participant's group will be anonymized). Participants who have been tested by an
      routineTurkish MOH and FDA EUA approved RT-PCR test using nasopharyngeal swabs will be
      included in the study to perform the EASYCOV IVD tests in a POC setting.

      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the performance of EasyCov IVD as a point-of-care (POC) test performed on
      saliva samples for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing it to a Turkish MOH and
      FDA EUA approved RT-PCR test performed on nasopharyngeal samples.

      Secondary Objectives:

      • Collection and storage of saliva samples, nasopharyngeal swabs at D0 to perform future
      COVID-19 related research projects and validation of future generations of EASYCOV assays as
      well as exploratory studies to find candidate biomarkers for Covid-19.

      160 participants will be included in 1:1 ratio: 80 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 80 SARS-CoV-2
      negative by a Turkish MOH and FDA approved RT-PCR IVD test
