      phytonutrient encapsulated liquid formulation, was prepared using a novel proprietary SK713
      SLP multi-lamellar clustoidal non-GMO phospholipid Prodosome nutrient absorption/delivery
      technology in a state-of-the-art multistep cGMP and NSF-certified manufacturing facility.
      This developmental technology is biodegradable and biocompatible. Preliminary study in our
      laboratory demonstrated the efficacy of Prodovite® VMP35 in Sports Nutrition. We hypothesize
      that Prodovite® VMP35 supplement will enhance athletic performance, lean-body muscle mass,
      increase exercise tolerance, and improve anabolic parameters in healthy human subjects. The
      aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation of Prodovite® VMP35
      on exercise endurance, muscle strength, anabolic parameters and lean body mass in healthy
      human subjects. We hypothesize that Prodovite® VMP35 supplementation will enhance and
      increase exercise performance, tolerance, lean-body muscle mass, improve anabolic parameters
      and blood chemistry parameters in healthy human subjects. Accordingly, 150 healthy male and
      female subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Prodovite® VMP35 or placebo in
      the form of single dose sealed containers for 90 consecutive days and muscle strength,
      endurance, speed, anabolic/catabolic parameters and muscle mass will be evaluated by dual
      energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), hand-grip strength test, cycle ergometer test, spirometer
      assessment and assay of Blood chemistry and serum biomarkers will be evaluated before and
      after intervention.
