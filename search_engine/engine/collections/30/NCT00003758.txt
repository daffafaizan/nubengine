      idarubicin followed by low dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed acute myelogenous
      leukemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive intermediate dose cytarabine IV over 2
      hours twice a day on days 1-5, idarubicin IV over 24 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, and low dose
      cytarabine IV over 24 hours on days 6-15. If patients achieve complete remission by day 35,
      this regimen is repeated once. If patients achieve partial remission by day 35, this regimen
      is repeated, except with an additional day of idarubicin on day 7. If these patients then
      achieve complete remission by day 70, the regimen is repeated. Patients may then undergo stem
      cell transplantation within 6 months of achieving complete remission. Patients who have an
      HLA identical sibling available receive an allogeneic transplant; others receive an
      autologous transplant. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 3 years,
      then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
