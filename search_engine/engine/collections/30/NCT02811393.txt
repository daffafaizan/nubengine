      estimated are 600 million obese worldwide and according to National Health Survey 2010 in
      Chile 67% of the population suffers from some degree of overweight having approximately
      300,000 morbidly obese.

      The first-line treatment for obesity is diet, exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy,
      however, these interventions are not effective enough to control long-term obesity, and so
      bariatric surgery is currently the treatment of choice to control morbid obesity.

      Overall, after bariatric surgery, most patients lose on average 60% of excess weight and
      improve their comorbidities during the first postoperative year, however, the long term
      effects of this weight reduction are not known in detail regarding body composition and
      muscle function.

      The aim of this study is to assess muscle function measured by hand grip strength test in
      women at least 2 years after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass) and to compare with
      control group.
