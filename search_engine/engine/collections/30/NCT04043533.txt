      disorders, and somatic symptoms that could have negative effects on the mother, baby, and
      family.

      In a meta-analysis study including 219 prevalence studies from 56 countries that investigated
      different phases of postpartum using various data collection tools, Hahn-Holbrook et al.
      (2018) found the depression prevalence at the global level as 17.7% (Hahn-Holbrook, 2018). In
      Turkey, 23.8% of women in the postpartum period were reported to be suffering from postpartum
      depression, which underlines the need for health professionals to be concerned about the
      health of the women in the postpartum period.

      Exercises done in the postpartum period are reported to enable psychosocial well-being, less
      anxiety and depression, better cardiovascular adaptation, body fat/weight control, less bone
      loss caused by lactation, and less stress incontinence. Studies have generally indicated the
      importance of regular exercise in the postpartum period. Studies have generally indicated the
