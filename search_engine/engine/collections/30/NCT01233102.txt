      will be infused to patients using interventional method via hepatic artery for one group. The
      catheter will be inserted to proper hepatic artery. After the catheter placement confirmed by
      angiography, umbilical cord MSCs will be infused slowly in 20-30 minutes. Umbilical cord MSCs
      will be infused intravenously slowly in 30-60 minutes in the intravenous infusion group. The
      control group will receive conserved therapy. The levels of serum alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), prealbumin(PA)and albumin (ALB) will be
      examined at re-transplantation, and 3 days to 2 years post-transplantation. The efficacy of
      umbilical cord MSCs transfusion will be investigated. The efficacy of different
      interventional therapies will also be compared.
