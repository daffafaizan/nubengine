      Disorders Unit at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, where care is provided free of
      charge.

      Study procedures will begin after one week of acclimating to the inpatient unit. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to receive either Supportive Psychotherapy (focused on the
      transition to the inpatient unit) or REACH (focused on changing routines or habits that have
      become part of the eating disorder). Each treatment consists of 12-sessions, delivered 2-3
      times per week.

      Before and after treatment, patients will be asked to participate in interviews,
      questionnaires, and a lunch meal.
