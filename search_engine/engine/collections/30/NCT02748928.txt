    
      Up to 120 healthy adult volunteers, seeking noninvasive abdominal fat and circumference
      reduction, male and females, 18 to 60 years of age from 6 investigational sites. Eligible
      subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly treatments (2 weeks interval) with the UltraShape Power
      device utilizing the U-Sculpt Power Transducer according to the study protocol. Subjects will
      return for 3 follow-up visits: four weeks (4wk FU), eight weeks (8wk FU) and 12 weeks (12wk
      FU) after the last treatment (Third Treatment).

      Each subject will be enrolled for total expected study duration of 16 weeks. Subject's
      abdominal fat thickness and circumference will be measured at the measurements points and
      will be assessed at each visit. Additionally, a subject questionnaire will be completed in
      each follow-up visit (4wk, 8wk and 12wk FU). Finally, photography will be performed under
      visible light conditions of the front, right, left and back view. Most of the assessments
      will occur at each of the visits (all treatments and all follow-up visits) to the clinic.
