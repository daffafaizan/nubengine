    
      Alopecia areata is a condition in which hair is lost either from part of the scalp, all of
      the scalp, or the entire body, and it affects 1% to 2% of the population. It is thought to be
      an autoimmune disease and in some cases the disease is hereditary. The Alopecia Areata
      Registry will collect information and blood samples from clinically well-characterized
      patients with these three forms of alopecia areata: alopecia partialis (patchy loss of the
      scalp hair), alopecia totalis (total loss of all scalp hair), and alopecia universalis
      (complete loss of all hair everywhere on the body). This will be a collection of patients in
      multi-generational families, twins, single patients with patchy, persistent transient
      alopecia areata or long-standing alopecia totalis/universalis and with controls (persons
      unaffected and not related to alopecia patients). Information from these patients will be
      used to search the human genome for disease-associated loci and/or genes. Researchers
      interested in doing pathophysiology or treatment studies of this disease will also be able to
      contact patients having the appropriate form of the disease for the studies in question.

      Patients who have been diagnosed with alopecia areata by a dermatologist will be eligible for
      the registry. Patients will fill out an information form online (alopeciaareataregistry.org).
      Patients who have a family history or specific types of alopecia will be invited to
      participate in a more detailed questionnaire and physical exam and have blood samples drawn.
