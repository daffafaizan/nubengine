      of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) deﬁning diagnoses or death. There are limited
      data on the levels of these biomarkers among HIV-infected individuals in sub Saharan Africa
      and on the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on these levels. In addition,
      further work is needed to examine the association between such markers and various
      complications associated with HIV as well as mortality in sub Saharan Africa. The overall aim
      of this study is to develop a cohort of HIV-infected adults who are initiating ART at health
      facilities in Kenya and to establish a sample bank of plasma and urine samples in order to
      further the understanding of the levels of inﬂammatory biomarkers (IBM) and coagulation
      biomarkers (CBM) in African patients and the effect of ART initiation on these biomarkers.
      The study objectives are as follows:

        -  To recruit, establish and follow a cohort of HIV-infected individuals who are eligible
           for initiation of ART through 12 months

        -  To obtain blood and urine samples on all cohort participants at baseline, months 2, 6,
           and 12 for future HIV and related research

        -  To describe the demographic and disease characteristics of cohort participants and
           associations with various biomarkers
