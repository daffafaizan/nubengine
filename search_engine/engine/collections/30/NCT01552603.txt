      Pancreas Control system during an inpatient study. This master controller software is
      designed to be used in conjunction with two subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring
      systems to regulate blood glucose levels as well as two Omnipod pumps, one for administering
      insulin and one for administering glucagon. The sensors communicate wirelessly with two
      sensor receivers which will be interfaced with the APC by wireless USB connection. The
      insulin and glucagon pumps will be controlled by the APC through a wireless USB connection.
      The algorithm included in the APC is an automated version of the Adaptive Proportional
      Derivative (APD) insulin and glucagon control algorithm, which was previously studied as an
      investigational device. The APD has been studied in vivo (in 28 experiments, each 33 hr in
      length, with manual adjustment of pumps) and no serious adverse effects were noted. Manual
      input of the glucose sensor data and insulin/glucagon infusion rates will no longer be
      necessary. The APC will be tested in vivo during 28 hour experiments in an inpatient setting
      in preparation for outpatient testing.
