    
      To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients must receive the first injection of
      Macugen intravitreal in at least one eye for treatment of wet age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). The decision to prescribe Macugen will necessarily precede and will be
      independent of the decision to enroll patient into the study.

      If both eyes of a patient receive injection Macugen, only one eye will be included in the
      study. If both eyes receive first injection Macugen after initiation of the study, only the
      first treated eye will be included in the analysis. If one eye has already received Macugen
      when the study starts and the second eye receives injection after the study initiation, the
      second eye will be included in the analysis.

      The study was prematurely discontinued due to delay in meeting pre-defined protocol
      recruitment milestones on August 30, 2010. There were no safety concerns regarding the study
      in the decision to terminate the trial.
