      impulsivity (DSM-V, 2013). An impairment of inhibitory control has been suggested as the
      primary deficit in children with ADHD, which is thought to cause secondary impairments in
      executive functioning. A few studies investigated executive capacities in adults with ADHD.
      Specifically, an impairment in action inhibition has been reported in ADHD participants.
      Moreover, inhibition of action is often associated with distinctive electroencephalographic
      (EEG) correlates. The present study aim at combining both novel inhibitory control
      measurement techniques and EEG analysis in temporal and frequency domains to assess the
      sensitivity and the specificity of an inhibitory deficit in adults with ADHD. This is part of
      an improvement in the procedures for diagnosing ADHD syndrome and its functional evaluation.

      The study will analyze the EEG activity associated with two stop-signal tasks requiring
      inhibitory capacities. A set of other cognitive skills will also be evaluated during a
      neuropsychological assessment. The results of ADHD patients will be compared with those of a
      control group (healthy volunteers) to assess the sensitivity of an inhibition deficit to the
      disorder. These same results will also be compared with those of a second control group
      (patients with a negative diagnosis of ADHD) to assess the specificity of the inhibitory
      deficit.

      This experimental strategy results in the involvement of three groups of participants (ADHD
      patients and two control groups) in three visits (neuropsychological assessment and two EEG
      sessions).
