      Service (NHS) sites based in England, where the overall patient population demographic
      profile is sufficiently variable to allow for meaningful representation of different
      ethnicities in the analysis of pooled data-sets.

      The study addresses the issue of health inequality and genetic disparity in the United
      Kingdom (UK) by recruiting up to 200,000 patients primarily from the three main ethnic groups
      in the UK; namely White (Caucasian), African-Caribbean (Black), and South Asian (Asian)
      populations on a 1:1:1 ratio.

      Biological samples, medical records, alongside specific questionnaires will be used in data
      analyses to help identify treatment failures in different populations for the 19 disease
      areas under investigation, which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the
      UK.

      Analysis of patient populations may provide real-world evidence around disease prevalence
      between and within different ethnic groups. The data may also support hypothesis driven
      genetic analysis to identify putative bio-markers associated with treatment failure.

      Data from this study will be published, and findings could better inform clinical practice in
      the management of diseases that cause significant poor health and death in the different
      populations that represent the UK.
