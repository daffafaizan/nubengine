      ventilatory support. In patient whose frequency of mandatory support is under 25, the two
      ventilatory modes (SIMV+PSV and NAVA) are delivered by the same ventilator (Servo-I; Maquet
      Critical Care AB, Solna, Sweden) and will set to maintain similar blood gas analysis results.

      Determination of the type of ventilatory mode used is performed using a cluster
      randomization. The randomized order of ventilatory mode will be used during total 9 hours;
      one mode for 4 hours and another mode for 5 hours. To rule out carry-over effects, a 1-hour
      interval for washout was guaranteed between modes. Recordings will be obtained over a total 8
      hours.
