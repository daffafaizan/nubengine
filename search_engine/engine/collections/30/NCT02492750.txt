      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum allowable dose (MAD) of anakinra
      that can be combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. (Phase I) II. To compare the time
      to progression of the standard treatment arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to the experimental
      arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the response rate of the standard treatment arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to
      the experimental arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra).

      II. To compare the toxicity of the standard treatment arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to the
      experimental arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra).

      III. To compare the overall survival of the standard treatment arm
      (lenalidomide/dexamethasone) to the experimental arm (lenalidomide/dexamethasone + anakinra).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of anakinra followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive anakinra subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22. Patients also receive anakinra SC on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone as in Arm A. Patients also receive
      placebo SC on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
