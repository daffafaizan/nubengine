        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intrathecal or intraventricular topotecan in
           patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory leptomeningeal disease.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to disease
      (leukemia or lymphoma vs solid tumor or other malignancy).

      Patients receive topotecan intrathecally or intraventricularly continuously on days 1-7.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose- limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
