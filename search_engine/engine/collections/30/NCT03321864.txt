      techniques can be used to enable anatomical based real-time image registration for guiding
      prostate biopsies. This would lead to the ability to perform free-hand trans-perineal biopsy
      without the need for supporting gantries or a biopsy grid placed over the perineum. This will
      significantly decrease costs of trans-perineal biopsy, reduce the number of puncture sites
      through the perineal skin - reducing pain and bleeding - and reduce the procedure time.
      Alongside locally developed local-anaesthetic transperineal biopsy techniques it will allow
      targeted biopsy to be taken in the outpatient setting, improving patient convenience, and
      helping health services to meet growing demands on targeted biopsies.

      The investigators aim to create a new method of mapping the prostate using free-hand
      ultrasound, without any additional physical equipment. This may require collaborations with
      approved International groups with particular skills in relevant mathematical or engineering
      techniques.
