      responses and frequent relapses. The corner-stones in treatment of FNRFI are education,
      positive motivation, and toilet training. Preparation of children and their parents for a
      long-lasting treatment is mandatory with the expectation of many ups and downs. The main goal
      is to have regular bowel movements and normal continence and this can be achieved by teaching
      the child the importance of regular toilet use and avoid urges.

      Many previous studies, reported the short term effect of TPTNS in treatment of FNRFI.
      However, there are sufficient studies evaluating the long term effect of TPNS and this has
      motivated the authors to conduct of this study The aim of this study is to evaluate the Long
      term outcome and quality of life in children with Functional non-retentive fecal incontinence
      and received Bilateral Transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation therapy.
