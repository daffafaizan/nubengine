      terms of disease response, time to progression, survival and progression free survival in
      patients with stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Assess the
      toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 to 60 minutes on days 1 and 22. Patients
      then receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 43 and 64, then topotecan IV over 30 minutes
      daily for 5 days beginning on days 85, 106, 127, and 148. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months
      and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
