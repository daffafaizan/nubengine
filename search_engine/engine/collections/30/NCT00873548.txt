      geometric proportions than Caucasians, e.g. Japanese woman have shorter femoral necks,
      smaller femoral neck angles and a more anterior bowing of the shaft than white Americans.
      This was one of the reasons for the development of a new PFNA Asia with adapted sizes and
      geometry. No controlled clinical data are available whether the rate of mismatch and
      mismatch-related complications could be reduced.
