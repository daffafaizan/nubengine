      to 40 mg/day. If patients have side effects at the dose of 40 mg/day, the dose may be reduced
      at 20 mg/day. Assessment visits will be conducted at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months of
      treatment. After 6 months, trial's treatment with fluoxetine is discontinued gradually. A new
      assessment will be conducted one month after the end of treatment. The expected results are
      the demonstration of improved scores of the scale UMSARS after 3 and 6 months in the
      fluoxetine group compared to the placebo group.
