      device and a 24-hour on call service by a cardiologist. The hypothesis is that the use of a
      telemetric smartphone application can reduce re-hospitalization in patients after cryoballoon
      pulmonary vein isolation. Secondary endpoints are quality of life measurements, health care
      cost calculations and recurrences of atrial fibrillation after ablation. All patients will
      undergo ablation and will be randomized into two groups: 1) conventional follow up with
      outpatient visits 6 and 12 months after ablation compared to 2) a structured follow up with
      the smartphone application, a mobile ECG device (patients will be able to send in as many
      ECGs as wanted), up to three phone calls with a cardiologist (24-hour on call service) as
      well as outpatient visits 6 and 12 months after cryo-ablation.
