      This study will be conducted using visual steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs).
      Visual SSVEPs are periodic neural electrophysiological activities that arise in response to
      fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS). They will be recorded in response to the periodic
      presentation of faces, according to an oddball paradigm. While pictures of faces will appear
      at a 6 Hz rate, only 1 out of 5 will display an emotion, corresponding to a 1.2 Hz oddball
      frequency. Different emotions will be tested (happiness, sadness, anger, fear and disgust),
      displayed with different intensities (20%, 60%, 100%). SSVEPs at 6 Hz will reflect general
      visual mechanisms (in response to a mixture of low-level (i.e., contrast coding) and
      high-level (i.e., face detection) processes). Importantly, SSVEPs at 1.2 Hz will index the
      visual mechanisms specifically involved in facial expression perception and their sensitivity
      to emotion intensity. Both measures will help determine the underlying brain topographies.

      Alongside, clinical and neuropsychological tests will be conducted. While the clinical tests
      will evaluate the severity of the symptoms, the neuropsychological tests will assess
      different features such as attention, memory, verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. The
      patients' scores will be linked with their cerebral activity in response to facial
      expressions.

      Outcomes:

      To better understand the impairment of facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia and
      22q11.2DS and to improve its care.
