    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the efficacy, safety and feasibility of administration of several dose
           combinations of conventional T cells (Tcon) and regulatory T cells (Treg) in patients
           undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with HLA matched donors
           (related or unrelated) using a T cell depleted graft [CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor
           cells ("CD34+ HSPC")], without immune suppression.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of infused regulatory and conventional T cells
           in the matched donor setting

        -  To determine 1 year event free survival (EFS) post HCT

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the 1 year OS in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT with matched donors.

        -  To measure the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft vs host disease (GvHD)

        -  To measure incidence of serious infections
