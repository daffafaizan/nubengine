      Caucasian population caused by mutations of gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
      conductance regulator (CFTR). New experimental therapeutic strategies for CF propose a diet
      supplementation to affect the plasma membrane fluidity and to modulate the cellular amplified
      inflammatory response in CF target organs. Red blood cells (RBCs) were used to investigate
      plasma membrane, because RBCs share lipid, protein composition and organization with other
      cell types.
