      critical for craniofacial development, several approaches, ie mutation screening of specific
      candidates, association studies and even genome-wide scans have largely failed to reveal the
      molecular basis of NS human clefting. Moreover, the efficiency of Whole Exome Sequencing
      -WES- was proven. The efficiency of WES was proven by the identification of the genes causing
      Freeman Sheldon and Miller's syndrome, followed by several others. In the Picardy region,
      management and follow-up of orofacial cleft patients are well-organised by a
      multidisciplinary team in the university hospital of Amiens. The investigators therefore
      decided to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) on precisely phenotyped non-syndromic CL/P
      patients followed in our center.
