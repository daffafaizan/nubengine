      deficits, such as executive functioning and memory. This study evaluates a combined
      rehabilitation program: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cognitive therapy for
      treatment of patients with bTBI. TMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is
      not painful and does not involve any needles or any form of surgery. It acts by delivering a
      magnetic stimulation to a particular brain region. Half of the study participants will
      receive cognitive intervention with active TMS, and a control group will receive cognitive
      intervention with sham TMS. This study takes place in Boston, Massachusetts: at the VA Boston
      Healthcare System and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
