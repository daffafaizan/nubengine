      in humans, as they do in animals. This hypothesis will be tested by performing chronobiologic
      evaluations on women enrolled in protocol 92-M-0174 ("The central nervous system effects of
      pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without estrogen and
      progesterone") and on men enrolled in protocol 94-M-0037 (The central nervous system effects
      of pharmacologically induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with and without testosterone
      replacement"). Based on the animal literature, we hypothesize that melatonin and sleep onset
      will be phase-advanced in women on estrogen, compared with those on progesterone or in a
      hypogonadal state. We also hypothesize that the amplitude of the activity cycle will be
      decreased in the progesterone, as compared with the estrogen, condition. Based on findings in
      amenorrheic women and in those on oral contraceptives, we hypothesize that the amplitude of
      melatonin secretion will be increased in the hypogonadal state, compared with the other two
      conditions. Finally, based on literature cited below, we hypothesize that mean prolactin
      levels will be higher in the testosterone plus Lupron condition and in the estrogen plus
      Lupron condition than in the other hormonal conditions.
