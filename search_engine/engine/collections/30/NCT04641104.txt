      Pyruvate Dehydrogenase to initiate the Krebs cycle and thus the aerobic metabolism of
      glucose.

      Thiamine deficiency, can be caused by alcoholism or bariatric surgery and is associated with
      severe complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy or Beri-Beri syndrome.

      Thiamine deficiency can also be the cause for an increase in lactate levels due to the
      transformation of pyruvate to lactate. An increase in lactate levels is associated with a
      worse prognostic. A decrease is, on the contrary, associated with an improved prognostic,
      during CPR and also after cardiac arrest.

      Recently, studies have shown that thiamine deficiency is underdiagnosed in ICU patients.

      On top of this, extra-corporeal circulation can worsen this deficiency. This could explain
      why certain on-pump cardiac surgery patients have increased lactate levels post-operatively,
      despite optimal blood pressure, cardiac output, diuresis, peripheral perfusion Donnino et al
      have shown that in a sepsis context thiamine administration improved lactate clearance during
      the first 24 hours of ICU admission and improved mortality rates at 28 days post-ICU
      admission.

      Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that thiamine supplementation improves the
      clearance of lactate in the first 24 hours after cardiac surgery with extracorporeal
      circulation in patients with high lactate concentration.
