      people with schizophrenia. We recruited 92 participants from 3 rehabilitation units in
      Taiwan. Participants were assigned by blocked randomization into an experimental group or
      control group. Those in the experimental group received 60 minutes of Baduanjin three times a
      week for 12-weeks, while those in the control group received physical activity for thirty
      minutes. We assessed five metabolic parameters and body mass index at three timepoints:
      baseline, posttest and 3-month follow up.
