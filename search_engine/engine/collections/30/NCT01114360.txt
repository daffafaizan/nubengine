      trying to see the mechanism of action of melatonin on blood pressure by analyzing data from
      sleep studies to see if melatonin lowers blood pressure by providing a better quality of
      sleep or is that independent of the quality of sleep.

      The investigator is also looking into the effect of melatonin on sympathetic nervous system
      by measuring urinary catecholamines.

      Finally, the investigator is looking into changes in vascular biology markers (P-selectin and
      e-selectin) on melatonin.
