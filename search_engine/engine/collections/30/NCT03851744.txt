      supplemental carbohydrate during steady-state aerobic-type exercise at sea level (SL) and
      following acute (~5 h) exposure to HA (4,300 m) conditions in 10 healthy, recreationally
      active adults between the ages of 18-39 yrs. Following a 48-hr muscle glycogen normalization
      period, volunteers will complete 80-min of metabolically-matched, steady-state aerobic
      exercise on a treadmill, and consume 145 g of glucose (1.8 gÂ·min-1) at SL and HA. Treadmill
      exercise will be performed at the same absolute workload, with speed and grade being the same
      at SL and HA to induce the same absolute workload between phases. SL and HA trials will occur
      in the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) hypobaric chamber and
      will be separated by a minimum 7-d washout period between each protocol day. 6-6-[2H2]
      glucose will be used as a tracer to assess glucose turnover. Indirect calorimetry, breath
      sampling for 13C/12C expired in CO2, and urine collections will be used to determine
      carbohydrate, fat, and protein oxidation during exercise at SL and HA. Serial blood draws
      will be collected during each trial to assess endocrine and circulating substrate responses
      to exercise, carbohydrate, and hypoxia. Muscle biopsies will be collected before and after
      steady-state exercise to examine intramuscular glucose transport expression and
      translocation, glycogen status, and activity enzyme intermediates in aerobic and anaerobic
      energy metabolism.
