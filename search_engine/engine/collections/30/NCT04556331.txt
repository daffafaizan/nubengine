      informed information about the topic of transmitting anxiety) and cognitive-behavioural
      strategies aimed at reducing the transmission of anxiety from parent to young child. The two
      sessions will be delivered online via Microsoft Teams, last 2 hours each and will run one
      week apart. Outcome and acceptability measures will be collected before, immediately after,
      and 6 weeks after the intervention. Feasibility data (e.g. drop-out rate) will be recorded.
