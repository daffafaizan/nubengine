      since 80% of calcium uptake occurs at the end of pregnancy. Passive Physiotherapy has been
      effective in the treatment of osteopenia. Active mobilizations implemented by the baby
      itself, may be more effective than passive, as they cause muscle contraction from the Central
      Nervous System (CNS). Reflex locomotion therapy (RLT), stimulates CNS causing muscle
      contraction so it may be effective in the treatment of osteopenia in premature.

      Objectives: To determine whether RLT is effective for the prevention of osteopenia in preterm
      infants and compare its effectiveness over other physiotherapeutic methods.

      Methodology: Our study is a multicentre randomized clinical trial, with 90 children less than
      34 weeks of gestational age, divided into three treatment groups, one will receive RLT,
      another will be treated with passive joint mobilizations with articular pressure; and last
      one will be done massage techniques. The treatment will last for one month, for the three
      groups. We intend to measure changes in mineralization, bone formation, and bone resorption,
      and anthropometry.
