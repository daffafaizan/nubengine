      minor trauma to the skin. This family of disorders, most of which are inherited, range in
      severity from mild to the severely disabling and life-threatening. TÎ²4 is a
      synthetically-produced copy of a naturally-occurring 43 amino acid peptide that has wound
      healing and anti-inflammatory properties and can up-regulate the expression of laminin-5.
