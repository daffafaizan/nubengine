      mutations in keratin genes (KRT 5/14) are responsible for this condition. Painful blisters
      and keratoderma of the feet are common and the blisters in EBS typically get worse in the
      summer due to sweating and increased environmental heat. Since 2010, also the related
      condition pachyonychia congenita (PC) is included in the study. The primary objective of the
      study is to evaluate the clinical effect of Botulinum toxin A (DysportÂ®), injected in the
      foot, on plantar pain in patients with EBS or PC. Quality of life, pain in feet, effect
      duration, plantar sweating and safety of the treatment will also be studied.
