      schools in Taiwan. We will select Medical School Graduation Questionnaires, obtained from
      Association of American Medical Colleges, AAMC, which has been performed in US for more than
      30 years. These questionnaires will modify with edition with expert opinions of our country.
      We will invite students' representative of each school for survey visit and deliver
      questionnaires to students after complete communication and permission of their schools.
      These surveys include learning resources, student support services, student daily life,
      medical educationâ€¦etc. We expect that these surveys will provide helpful information to
      candidates for selection of medical school before admission, and will also be a useful
      reference guide to improve quality of medical education to our governmental policy makers.
