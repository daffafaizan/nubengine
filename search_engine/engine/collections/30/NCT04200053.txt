      provides homeostasis. During reflexology massage, relaxation music is recommended because it
      contributes to the relaxation of the individual. In the literature, reflexology massage and
      music therapy are used in different pain management, and these methods reduce anxiety and
      improve sleep quality. However, there is no study in which reflexology massage and passive
      music therapy are used to reduce pain, anxiety and sleep problems associated with dressing of
      burn individuals. It is thought that reflexology massage and passive music therapy will
      reduce pain, anxiety and sleep problems in dressing changes of burned individuals.
