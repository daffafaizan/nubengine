      control of malaria. In order to facilitate formulation of effective regional drug policies
      and to provide a database for decision-making on the implementation of combination therapy
      (CAT), it is essential that the in vivo response to CAT be investigated. In the South East
      African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT) evaluation, there is a comprehensive
      evaluation of the phased introduction of combination anti-malarial therapy in Mozambique. As
      a component of this evaluation, in selected Mozambique sites where intensity of malaria
      transmission is high, a direct parallel group comparison of monotherapy (SP) with CAT
      (artesunate plus SP) will be conducted according to this protocol.
