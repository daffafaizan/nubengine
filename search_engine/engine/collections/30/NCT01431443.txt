      preeclampsia is yet available for pregnant women. This is surprising considering the growing
      body of literature that supports the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of dark chocolate
      consumption through the activity of flavanols on the endothelial function and blood pressure
      regulation, to find any clinical data among pregnant women with preeclampsia.

      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the acute and chronic effect of
      consumption of flavanol-rich chocolate on endothelial function in pregnant women at high risk
      of preeclampsia. This 12-week efficacy study will permit us to verify the sustainability of
      the effect of daily intake of flavanol-rich chocolate intake.
