    
      The study will consist of four (4) cohorts with a total of 3 subjects enrolled in each cohort
      to VM202.For each dose cohort, VM202 will be administered as a local intramuscular injection
      in 2 divided doses with a 2-week interval between the injections. Preliminary efficacy
      (hemodynamic assessments), safety and tolerability will be evaluated at Baseline (screening)
      and at designated time points throughout the study.

      After all subjects in the first dose cohort have completed the 30-day (+ 2 days) follow-up
      visit following the first dose of the study drug, an interim safety evaluation will be
      performed with the submission of safety data to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).
      If the DSMC recommends continuing the study, the second dose cohort will be treated. This
      process will be repeated between the second and third dose cohort and between the third and
      fourth dose cohort.

      All four dose cohorts will be followed for up to 5 years from the time of the first dose of
      study drug administration.
