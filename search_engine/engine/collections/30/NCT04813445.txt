      explanation of its intervention effects for acute ischemic stroke currently. The primary
      hypothesis of this trial is that , Compared with the blank control group, Xingnaojing will
      produce serial changes in plasma and urine metabolites and biomarkers at baseline (pre-dose),
      8 days and 11days . The serial changes may be the potential support to explain the
      intervention effect of Xingnaojing. All participants will have a National Institutes of
      Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS)entry score of 4-25. Participants who have planned or already
      received the intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment will be excluded. The primary
      outcome will be determined at 11 days.
