    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with cyclophosphamide,
      vincristine (vincristine sulfate) and prednisone (CVP) and to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory
      CD22+ acute leukemia (B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [B-ALL], mixed phenotype, and
      Burkitt's).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the preliminary activity (response rate: complete remission [CR] + complete
      remission with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) of this combination in the expansion cohort.

      II. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of this combination in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of inotuzumab ozogamicin.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on day 1, vincristine sulfate IV on day
      1, prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5, and inotuzumab ozogamicin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year,
      every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
