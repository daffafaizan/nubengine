      bacteria and other substances, to cause an infection. Although the appearance of HS resembles
      acne or pimple-like-formations, patients with HS have repeated outbreaks, which leads to
      pockets of subcutaneous infection and scarring. These repeated bouts of infection may lead to
      long-term damage and may result in squamous cell cancers.

      Amniotic fluid contains various proteins that support cell proliferation, movement, and
      differentiation. Amniotic fluid also includes collagen substrates, growth factors, amino
      acids, polyamines, lipids, carbohydrates, cytokines, extracellular matrix molecules like
      hyaluronic acid and fibronectin, cells, and other chemical compounds that are needed for
      tissue protection and repair. AMP-001 provides anti-inflammatory properties and tissue
      protective properties, which suggest this might be effective at treating HS. Patients treated
      with AMP-001 within IntegoGen associated clinics, and other regenerative clinics, have
      indicated positive responses. Perinatal products are an important source of growth factors
      and potent immuno-modulators. The allogeneic products show more immune modulation than with
      the autologous products. It is postulated that the positive symptomatic effects are secondary
      to the modulation of the immune system, and specifically the reduction in pathological
      inflammation. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential
      efficacy of AMP-001 for HS.
