      In Cohort 1 of Group 1 (IV) participants received a single administration of tedizolid
      phosphate at 5 mg/kg of total body weight. After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 1
      received study drug, a preliminary analysis of the safety and PK data was performed and
      results were used to select 4 mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 1 and Group
      3, and to select 6 mg/kg as the starting dose for the younger participants, Cohort 1 of Group
      2. After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 2 receive study drug, another preliminary
      analysis of the safety and PK data will be performed and results will be used to confirm 6
      mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 2. Similarly, the Group 4 dose will be
      confirmed after data review of Group 3 results.
