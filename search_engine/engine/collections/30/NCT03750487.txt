      intervention (e-SBI) that will be adapted for use with pregnant and postpartum women in home
      visiting (HV) programs. The e-SBI will be tested in a small randomized trial in two home
      visiting sites, with 10 home visitors and 40 clients. Home visitors will be randomized to the
      control intervention or the e-SBI. Clients will be surveyed at baseline, and 3- and 6- month
      follow-up to track e-SBI impacts on reduction in substance use (measured via self-report),
      associated symptoms (depression and parenting stress), and improvement in home visiting
      retention and substance use treatment engagement.
