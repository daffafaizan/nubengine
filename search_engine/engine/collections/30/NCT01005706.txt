      the potential for the body to reject the newly transplanted organ. The regimens in kidney
      transplantation include tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. This study
      will compare the effectiveness and safety of a regimen including Sirolimus, Prograf, and
      steroids compared to a regimen including Sirolimus, Cellcept and steroids. These regimens
      have already been researched in the Caucasian population, and both drug regimens are FDA
      approved. This study's focus is on the effectiveness and safety of these regimens in
      African-Americans.
