    
      This quantitative, retrospective, cohort study will determine the following: 1) demographic,
      clinical and neurological profile of patients with COVID-19 disease in the Philippines; 2)
      the frequency of neurological symptoms and new-onset neurological disorders/complications in
      patients with COVID-19 disease; 3) the neurological manifestations that are significant
      predictors of mortality, respiratory failure, duration of ventilator dependence, intensive
      care unit (ICU) admission, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay; 4) if there is
      significant difference between COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations compared to
      those COVID-19 patients without neurological manifestations in terms of mortality,
      respiratory failure, duration of ventilator dependence, ICU admission, length of ICU stay and
      length of hospital stay; and 5) the likelihood of mortality, respiratory failure and ICU
      admission in COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations compared to those without
      neurological manifestations.
