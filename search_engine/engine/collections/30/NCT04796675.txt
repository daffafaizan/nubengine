      efficacy in B-cell cancers. However, CAR T cells can induce substantial toxic effects, and
      the manufacture of the cells is complex. Natural killer (NK) cells that have been modified to
      express an anti-CD19 CAR have the potential to overcome these limitations.

      Cord blood(CB) derived NK cells from healthy donor are the source for production of
      CAR-NK-CD19 cells. CB derived NK cells are purified and transduced with a retroviral vector
      encoding the anti-CD19 CAR and interleukin-15.

      This is an investigational study. The objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      CAR-NK-CD19 cells in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies.
