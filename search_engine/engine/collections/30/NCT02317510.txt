      combined (epidural and spinal) anesthesia (CA) for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. General
      anesthesia is a gold standard for laparoscopic cholecystectomy(LC). The use of combined
      anesthesia may offer several advantages over general anesthesia.

      Material and methods : Fifty patients will be randomly assigned to either the CA LC (25
      patients) or GA LC (25 patients). All patients has symptomatic gall stone disease or polyp of
      gall bladder. Intraoperative events related to combined anesthesia : abdominal
      discomfortable, shoulder pain, abdominal pain, nausea, anxiety, dermatomal level of sensory
      blockade, respiratory depression. We compare between two group; shoulder pain, postoperative
      complications, pain score, duration of operation time and length of hospital stay.

      Fifty patients will select prospectively for LC, under low pressure (10 mm Hg)
      pneumoperitoneum and under combined anesthesia and general anesthesia. Spinal anaesthesia was
      performed at L1-L2 interspace using 2 ml of 0.5% (10 mg) hyperbaric Bupivacaine mixed with
      0.5ml (25 micrograms) of Fentanyl. Epidural catheter was inserted at L1- L2 interspace too.
