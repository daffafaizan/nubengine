      postural instability during daily activities.Recently, postural instability is suggested as
      the underlying mechanism of falling in patients with PD. Therefore, how to improve postural
      stability by balance training is an important issue for these patients.

      Basal ganglia have been regarded to be predominantly involved in postural control. Several
      studies suggested that the dysfunction of basal ganglia in patients with PD might play a
      major role in postural instability. Furthermore, patients with PD might have impaired
      utilization of sensory information by the basal ganglia.Computerized dynamic posturography
      (CDP) has the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), which provides an objective assessment of the
      main sensory systems (i.e., vision, proprioception and vestibular system) involved in balance
      and stability. The role of sensory information under six conditions (i.e., eyes open, eyes
      closed, sway vision, eyes open sway support, eyes closed sway support, and sway vision sway
      support) has been studied in patients with PD by the SOT of computerized CDP. Their study
      indicated that patients with PD demonstrated a significant reduction in sensory integration
      of proprioception and vision, but no significant difference in vestibular function, as
      compared to age-matched controls. One study showed that patients with PD had visual
      dependence as an adaptive strategy partly compensating for the impaired proprioception.
      However, the other study suggested that the cerebellum might be important for sensory
      integration in patients with PD.
