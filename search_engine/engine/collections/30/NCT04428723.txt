      hypoglycemia, diagnosis can be challenging, as the physiologic, and molecular mechanisms are
      incompletely understood. Additionally, treatment options are relatively limited, and often
      incompletely effective and/or not well tolerated. Investigating the causative factors and
      mechanisms of hypoglycemia is important therefore in improving our understanding in order to
      develop new and more effective approaches to treatment.

      The current study aims to:

        1. more fully characterize clinical history and demographics in patients with diverse forms
           of hypoglycemia by creating and analyzing a patient database;

        2. for a subset of patients, characterize metabolic and hormonal responses to a standard
           meal;

        3. analyze DNA variants in individuals with hypoglycemia;

        4. analyze differences in the intestinal microbiome in individuals with hypoglycemia.
