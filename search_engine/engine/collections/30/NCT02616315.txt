      hydrochloride (NB). NB is being tested to determine its effect on weight loss in obese
      participants post bariatric surgery.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Naltrexone HCl 32 mg/bupropion HCl 360 mg extended-release tablet

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will start on 1 tablet a day and will increase their dose by 1 tablet per
      week for 4 weeks to reach the optimal dose.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 59 weeks maximum. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, plus a final visit 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
