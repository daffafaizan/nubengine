      prospective donors have become less selective, allowing previously ineligible patients to
      donate kidneys. One donor group that has become increasingly more utilized is the overweight
      patient. There is substantial evidence that overweight individuals are more susceptible to
      the development of renal disease either as a direct result of their weight or as a
      consequence of their obesity-related co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. In
      addition, it appears that even mild renal dysfunction can increase the risk of developing
      CVD, which is already more common in this population. Despite these findings, very little is
      known about the individual and interactive effects of obesity and donation on the overall
      health of kidney donors. Our study addresses some of these questions by examining the effects
      of obesity on long-term renal function and development of cardiovascular risk factors such as
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in patients who donated a kidney at the
      University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) more than 5 years ago (1967-2006). The control
      group will comprise of all potential kidney donors at UCSF during this period who passed an
      initial medical screening evaluation but did not donate because they were found to be ABO- or
      crossmatch incompatible. The investigators believe that the results of the proposed study
      will be important in developing more precise guidelines for the selection and long-term
      health care maintenance of kidney donors.maintenance at all.
