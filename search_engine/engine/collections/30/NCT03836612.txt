    
      Objective We aim to provide an accurate and contemporary measurement of the current
      healthcare resource utilisation in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); namely
      ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). We also aim to provide estimates of
      infection incidence in this population and the prevalence of common mental health conditions.

      Method We will identify UC and CD using algorithms validated for accurately identifying these
      conditions from primary care records in the United Kingdom (UK). We will identify a prevalent
      cohort of adults with IBD with the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and
      Surveillance Centre (RSC) network over the last decade. We will identify a matched cohort of
      people without IBD; matched on age, gender and primary care practice. Across these cohorts we
      will compare healthcare resource utilisation (primary care attendances, number of primary
      care prescriptions for antidepressant and anxiolytic medications, number of primary care
      prescriptions for medications used in IBD, recorded secondary care attendances, and issue of
      statements of fitness for work), incident infections (any common infection, any viral
      infection, or any gastrointestinal infection), and common mental health conditions
      (depression and anxiety).
