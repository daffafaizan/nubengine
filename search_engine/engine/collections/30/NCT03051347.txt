      common chronic diseases affecting children: asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD, or eczema). The
      Investigators propose to directly validate patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures in a
      large cohort of itch-specific pediatric skin conditions, with a primary focus on AD. The
      Investigators propose to examine the ability of PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information Systems) instruments to detect meaningful and clinically significant change in
      disease status, as well as to create a pediatric itch item pool and PRO model for signs and
      symptoms of skin disease. The Investigators will also examine the ability of a modified
      Neuro-QOL stigma instrument to assess the severity and type of stigma experienced in AD and
      across various dermatologic or other potentially stigmatizing conditions. Lurie Children's
      Hospital will only be involved in the AD and stigma portions of this project
