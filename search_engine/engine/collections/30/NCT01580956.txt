      for 24 h each in a randomized crossover order. The ventilatory parameters, ventilator/patient
      asynchrony, gas exchange effects, sleep quality and ventilatory comfort produced by the two
      ventilation modes will be compared. Before randomisation, a sequence of VARIABLE-PSV will be
      performed with different level of variation setting to better define the future behavior of
      the patient under this mode during the 24 h of Variable-PSV.
