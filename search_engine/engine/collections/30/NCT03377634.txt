      physical functioning and quality of life, with the unfavorable effects worsened by both
      obesity and sedentary behavior. The annual cost of pain in the United States is nearly 30%
      higher than the combined costs of cancer and diabetes. In 2016, the NIH called for a National
      Pain Strategy to: 1) expand non-pharmacological treatment options in older adults, who are
      particularly susceptible to the side effects of opioid and other pain medications; 2) develop
      accessible treatments that are tailored to individuals; and 3) increase the development of
      self-management programs for chronic pain. The purpose of this R-21 is to develop and test
      the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, patient-centered intervention to reduce chronic
      pain and improve physical functioning in older adults, leveraging the combination of
      telecoaching and individually-adaptive mHealth tools to decrease both body mass and sedentary
      behavior. A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to provide initial evidence
      for effect sizes (pain and physical function) associated with the proposed intervention, and
      to estimate the sample size needed for a full scale randomized controlled trial design that
      compares the effects of the intervention versus usual care on pain ratings and physical
      function in overweight/obese older adults with chronic pain.
