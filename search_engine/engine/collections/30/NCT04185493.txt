      atherosclerosis in coronary bifurcations, as larger angles have been associated with
      increased plaque burden. Data from computational fluid dynamics studies have confirmed this
      finding by demonstrating that even in the absence of alterations in the amount of branch
      flow, a wide angle between the side branches intensifies flow perturbations, increases the
      spatial endothelial shear stress (ESS) variations in the bifurcation region and the low ESS
      in the lateral walls, thereby augmenting the atherosclerosis-prone environment. The magnitude
      of reversed flow, the extension of the recirculation zone and the duration of flow separation
      during the pulse cycle comprise other haemodynamic parameters which are important in
      atherogenesis and are amplified by an increased bifurcation angle.
