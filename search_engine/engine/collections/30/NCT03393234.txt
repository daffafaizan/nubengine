      for the treatment of very low rectal cancer. Nowadays, preoperative criteria for Lap ISR were
      the patients whose diagnosed with clinical stages T1-2 and N0_1, which only a few patients
      with early stages can benefit from it. However, intra-operative radiotherapy with low energy
      X ray applied by Intrabeam is becoming an accepted radiotherapy technique for treatment of
      cancers. The purpose of this study was to research on the safety and feasibility of ISR
      combined with low energy X ray intra-operative radiotherapy for the patients with local
      advanced rectal cancer.
