      supplementation (ONS) in persons with malnutrition and other clinical conditions. The
      effectiveness will be evaluated by comparing the intervention group having ONS vs a control
      group only with nutrition advice. The effectiveness and resource use will be collected using
      quality of life assessment tools, body mass index, change in malnutrition state, number of
      hospital admissions, medical visits...

      Unitary costs for Spain will be extracted from databases and official publications and will
      be applied to the number of resources used in order to calculate the costs in each of the
      groups. Finally, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be estimated and presented.
