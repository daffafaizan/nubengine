    
      This is a randomized phase II neoadjuvant study comparing neoadjuvant therapy with PD-1
      inhibitor Dostarlimab (TSR-042) to the PD-1/TIM-3 inhibitor combination Dostarlimab
      (TSR-042)/TSR-022 in patients with resectable regionally advanced or oligometastatic
      melanoma.

      Patients with stage III B/C/D or oligometastatic stage IV A melanoma with lymph node (LN)
      and/or in-transit and/or oligometastatic disease who have yet to undergo definitive surgery
      are eligible to enroll.

      Suitable patients will be identified pre-operatively. Patients will undergo screening
      evaluation consisting of systemic/CNS staging scans, tumor biopsy, blood studies to confirm
      suitability. Subjects will receive neoadjuvant therapy (Dostarlimab (TSR-042) or Dostarlimab
      (TSR-042)/TSR-022 combination for 6 weeks prior to planned surgery (pre-operative phase).
      Surgery will occur 1-4 weeks after completion of pre-operative therapy. After recovery from
      surgery subjects will receive Dostarlimab (TSR-042) (Post-Operative phase) for approximately
      48 weeks; for a total of 54 weeks of study drug(s) administration in total.
