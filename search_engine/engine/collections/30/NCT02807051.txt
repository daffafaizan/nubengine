      subjects received a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib. On Day 8 through the morning of
      Day 12, following a 7-day washout period, 500-mg oral doses of clarithromycin were
      administered twice daily (BID), 8 to 12 hours apart. It was anticipated that steady-state
      concentrations of clarithromycin would be achieved by Day 12. On Day 12, a single oral 400-mg
      dose of pacritinib was co-administered with the final 500-mg dose of clarithromycin.
