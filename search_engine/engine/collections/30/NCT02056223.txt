      for PDA treatment in a population of preterm newborns of gestational age (GA) <31+6 weeks
      with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and HsPDA:

        -  Group A: experimental boluses of paracetamol at 15 mg/Kg four time a day for three
           consecutive days.

        -  Group B: standard boluses of ibuprofen at 10-5-5-mg/Kg/dose once a day for three
           consecutive days.

      The primary objective of the study is: to evaluate the efficacy of paracetamol versus
      standard ibuprofen regimen, by comparing the rate of ductal closure after the first and
      second course of pharmacological treatment. (PDA diagnosed by ECHO criteria)

      The secondary objective of the study is: to evaluate the safety of the above 2 therapeutic
      regimens in term of incidence of transient renal impairment, intraventricular hemorrhage
      (IVH) or other bleeding disorders, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and isolated bowel
      perforation (without signs of NEC), incidence of sign of liver toxicity.
