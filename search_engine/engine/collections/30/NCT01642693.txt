      root resorption, different methods have been suggested to control that changes as the use of
      the low power laser. The objective of this study is to evaluate the low power laser effect on
      the inflamatory pulpar change and inflamatory external root resorption in maxillary premolars
      with intrusive orthodontic movements of 4 ounces during 12 weeks. Total sample were 34
      healthy teeth, 16 were used to evaluate the normal standar and 18 were divided in two groups,
      the experimental group with the low power laser effect had a dose of 18 joules after
      activations of the orthodontic intrusion and the control group had a simulated effect in the
      same orthodontic movement. Teeth were extacted after 12 weeks and histological changes were
      evaluated in the dentinal-pulp complex and the pesence of external inflamatory root
      resorption. Findins suggest that low power. Laser decreased the inflamatory changes of the
      dentinal - pulp complex and the severity of the external inflamatory root resorption.
