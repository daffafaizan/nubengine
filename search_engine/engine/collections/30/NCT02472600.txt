    
      In recent years a certain family of bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) that colonizes the human
      gastrointestinal tract but can also cause severe infections has increasingly become resistant
      to antibiotics by acquiring enzymes that can inactivate a wide array of these valuable drugs.
      Depending on the class of beta-lactam antibiotics that these enzymes can inactivate, these
      bacteria are either designated as extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) or carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).

      The R-GNOSIS project which is financed by the European Commission combines five separate
      international clinical studies (work packages 2 to 6) that examine intervention strategies to
      reduce carriage, infection and spread of these bacteria. This study (work package 3 of
      R-GNOSIS) will be conducted in 4 centers in 3 European countries (Switzerland, France, The
      Netherlands) and Israel. The study will examine whether it is possible to eradicate
      intestinal carriage with ESBL-E and CPE by administering a 5 day course of oral nonabsorbable
      antibiotics (colistin sulfate and neomycin sulfate) followed by administration of "healthy"
      stool flora obtained from a healthy volunteer donor ("fecal microbiota transplantation" or
      FMT). The "healthy" stool flora for this procedure will be obtained from carefully selected
      healthy volunteers that have been tested for a wide variety of infectious diseases and do not
      show any risk factors or risky behavior for transmittable diseases. Once the fecal material
      has been processed it will be frozen at -80Â°C for up to six months until administration to
      patients (via capsules or via a nasogastric tube). FMT has been successfully used to treat
      recurrent infections with a specific pathogen (Clostridium difficile) and has proven safe and
      effective for this indication but has never been studied with the aim of eradicating
      multidrug-resistant organisms.
