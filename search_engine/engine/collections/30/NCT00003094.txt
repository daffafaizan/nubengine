      the regression of disease in patients with grade I or II cervical intraepithelial dysplasia.
      II. Determine whether the regression of disease in this patient population is reflected in
      the modulation of intermediate biological markers (viral genome copy number of human
      papilloma virus (HPV) and HPV E6/E7 expression).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive dietary counseling and eat 5-10 servings of
      carotenoid rich fruit and vegetables each day for a year. Arm II: Patients receive no
      counseling and maintain their normal diet. Carotenoid levels, HPV status, progression of
      cervical dysplasia, and diet (by food frequency checklist and food diary) are monitored in
      both groups.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
