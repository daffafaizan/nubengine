      for more than 6 million office visits each year by children younger than 15 years of age.
      Approximately 30% of cases is of bacterial etiology and group A beta-hemolytic
      streptococci(GABHS) are responsible for most bacterial cases, although other pathogens, such
      as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia
      pneumoniae, may be the causative agents in sporadic cases. An accurate diagnosis of GABHS
      infection is important because it is the only common form of acute pharyngotonsillitis for
      which antibiotic therapy is definitely indicated. Effective antibacterial treatment can
      shorten the clinical course of GABHS pharyngotonsillitis, reduce the rate of transmission,
      and prevent suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, such as peritonsillar abscess and
      acute rheumatic fever.

      This study enrolls patients who will present with acute fever and clinical signs of
      pharyngotonsillitis at three primary pediatric ambulances. A rapid A beta-hemolytic
      streptococcus (GABHS)-detection test will be performed in these patients. In one office,
      additional throat cultures are obtained of all patients, and blood is taken in a subgroup of
      60 GABHS-positive and 60 GABHS-negative cases. In GABHS-positive patients, a second blood
      sample will be obtained at day 7th and day 28th, and stored until specific antibody response
      to GABHS will be measured.
