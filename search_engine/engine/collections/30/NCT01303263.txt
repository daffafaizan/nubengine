      awareness among residents about how their decisions impact the costs of inpatient medical
      care; and 2) to improve the cost-effectiveness of care provided by residents without
      adversely affecting patient outcomes. We hypothesized that a brief intervention in which
      residents receive bills for patients they recently cared for, followed by a discussion on
      approaches to reducing unnecessary inpatient costs, would reduce costs without adversely
      affecting patient outcomes.
