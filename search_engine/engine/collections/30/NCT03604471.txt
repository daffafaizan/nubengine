      risk of cardiovascular diseases, a leading death cause in industrialized countries. There
      exists considerable inter-individual variability in response to statins, reflected by
      differences in lipid-lowering effect or risk of presenting adverse drug reaction; mainly
      myotoxicity. A plethora of different factors (demographic, genetic, physiopathologic,
      environmental...) have been tested to explain this variability but it lacks of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) data and/or replications of observations are rare and results remain
      inconclusive, probably because of non-adapted designs and no-clear driven-hypothesis but also
      due to a lack of scientific rationale and deep mechanistic understanding. This clinical study
      will explore individual factors influencing statin PK in a cohort of 150 patients treated
      with atorvastatin. The collection of meticulous clinical PK data and a rigorous statistical
      analysis will allow quantifying the effect of each identified parameter on statin PK and
      eventually, defining a population-based PK model taking into account the combined effect of
      all covariates in a quantitative approach. This innovative prospectively designed clinical
      study will ultimately allow predicting atorvastatin PK fluctuations and anticipating any
      inadequate dosing in clinical care.
