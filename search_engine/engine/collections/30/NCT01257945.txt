      interventions for people in early and mid-stages of Parkinson's disease. Two different
      approaches to exercise are compared to standard of care. The two exercise programs consist of
      supervised interventions, administered for four months, with emphasis on patients adopting
      exercise habits to continue to exercise for an additional 12 months. The standard of care
      program consists of a home program in which participants exercise in a group setting once a
      month with an exercise trainer. Functional outcomes are measured at the completion of the
      supervised exercise at 4 months as well as 10 and 16 months. This study is the first long
      term exercise study for people with Parkinson's disease PD of which we are aware and is the
      most comprehensive examination of exercise for people with PD to date. Results of this study
      will provide definitive information regarding the best approach to exercise for people in
      early and mid stages of PD, both in terms of immediate 4 month and long term 16 month
      effects.
