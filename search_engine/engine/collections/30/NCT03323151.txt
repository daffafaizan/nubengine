    
      MCL is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is considered incurable with conventional
      therapy. For relapsed patients, Ibrutinib, lenalidomide, and bortezomib are all approved by
      the FDA but are not curative. Novel approaches are required to improve outcomes for patients
      with relapsed/refractory MCL.

      This is an open-label study that will be done in 2 phases. Phase I will test different doses
      of ixazomib and ibrutinib to determine the maximum safe and tolerated dose. In Phase I,
      patients who have already received ibrutinib, may participate if they meet certain criteria
      (i.e., have not received ibrutinib for at least 3 months).

      Phase I was completed November 25, 2019. Dose Level 2 (Ixazomib 4 mg and Ibrutinib 560 mg) is
      the recommended Phase II dose.

      Phase II will find out the effects, good and/or bad, of ixazomib in combination with
      ibrutinib. In Phase II, patients will be separated into 2 groups, patients who have never
      received a Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor and patients who have received a BTK
      inhibitor. This study is designed to examine the effectiveness of this drug in treating
      patients with MCL.

      Patients will be treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 3 months for the first year of
      treatment, then every 6 months until progression.

      Mandatory bone marrow and tumor tissue samples (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or
      biopsy) are required at baseline. Mandatory research blood samples will also be collected.

      8/7/2020: Enrollment stopped to patients who have already received a BTK inhibitor. Total of
      two patients enrolled.
