      increase at twice the rate of the population itself . So we need adequate understanding of
      the best surgical method for treating apical POP which is accepted worldwide and also must be
      cost effective with least perioperative complications. Abdominal sacropexy is considered now
      the gold standard operation for treatment of apical pelvic organ prolapse. In this technique,
      the mesh is ﬁxed to the anterior longitudinal ligament at the sacral promontory. It is used
      either with uterine preservation (sacrohysteropexy) or after hysterectomy (sacrocolpopexy)
      for treatment of vault prolapse .However , many intraoperative complication can occur
      including hemorrhage or transfusion or both occurred in 4.4% , intestinal injury or rectal
      injury in 1.6% (0.4% to 2.5%),and ureteral injury in 1.0% of cases. Postoperative
      complications include paralytic ileus in 3.6%.transient femoral nerve injury and vertebral
      osteomyelitis . Also, despite that sacropexy provide good apical support, but the high
      prevalence of cystocele and urinary tract symptoms in patients reaches up to 8% .
      Consequently, it is not surprising that the majority of failures following sacrocolpopexy
      occur in the anterior compartment. Lateral suspension with mesh was ﬁrst reported by
      Dubuisson in 1998 for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse . The lateral suspension avoids
      both the risk of vascular injury and nerve damage of sacrocolpopexy with success rate up to
      88% of cases.
