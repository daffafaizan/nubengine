      should be observed when an increased central drive occurs. In theory, according to the
      central regulation model of effort, an increased performance could be due to the elevation on
      Central Nervous System excitability and activity, since exercise is not peripherally limited.
      Conversely, the absence of muscle performance improvement to the increased central drive
      promoted by caffeine would be an evidence for a peripherally localized neurophysiological
      limit and would indicate the absence of reserve. Therefore, if present, this reserve could be
      verified by using peripheral and central measures derived from electric-stimulation, evoked
      twitch and interpolated twitch techniques, associated to measures of EMG and peripheral
      metabolism, when caffeine is manipulated during closed- and opened-loop exercise.

      In addition, there should also be possible to access the reserve without stimulant substance
      manipulation (placebo effect). By teleological argument derived from the central regulation
      model of effort, a neurophysiological reserve would be a natural mechanism to protect the
      cellular integrity. Therefore, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that, if present, a
      reserve would be observed by an increase in performance promoted by an elevation in central
      drive when placebo is perceived as caffeine. Unfortunately, however, no study utilized this
      experimental approach, including measures of central and peripheral activity during closed-
      and opened-loop exercise, to consistently respond the reserve question.
