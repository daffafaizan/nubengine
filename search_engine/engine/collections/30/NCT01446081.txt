      treatment requires multiple cycles of intensive chemotherapy. The first cycle, induction, is
      the most intense and intended to achieve complete disease remission (CR). Induction therapy
      requires 4-6 weeks of inpatient admission and is associated with extended bed rest and
      multiple toxicities, leading to physical deconditioning. Regular exercise during induction
      may reduce declines in physical fitness, leading to improved quality of life (QOL), reduced
      fatigue, improved tolerance of chemotherapy, and potentially greater survival. Four prior
      studies of exercise in AML patients undergoing induction have suggested improvements in QOL,
      fatigue, physical function, and treatment tolerability. However, all 4 studies suffered from
      major limitations including small sample sizes, design limitations, generalizability
      concerns, and limited safety information. The investigators conducted a pilot non-randomized
      study in 35 AML patients and demonstrated feasibility, safety, and potential improvements in
      QOL, fatigue, and physical fitness outcomes. The investigators now propose a rigorous
      evaluation of the intervention in a phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Primary objectives include: (1) To determine the efficacy of a supervised mixed-modality
      exercise program during induction chemotherapy on QOL and fatigue; (2) To determine the
      efficacy on physical fitness. Our secondary objective is to determine the efficacy on AML
      treatment tolerability (hospital length of stay, development of sepsis, intensive care unit
      (ICU) admission, delays in consolidation chemotherapy).
