      fractional ablative carbon dioxide is beneficial in improving symptoms in women with a
      history of early breast cancer. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either
      active laser treatment or inactive "sham" laser treatment (setting of close to zero)

      Participants will receive the 3 treatments approximately 4 weeks apart. Participants will
      then be followed up at twelve weeks post completion of treatment and twelve months post
      completion of treatment. At the twelve week follow up visit, after completion of study
      procedures, patients will be unblinded and those who received "sham" treatment will be
      allowed to crossover to "active" treatment if they wish.
