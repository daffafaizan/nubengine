      pylori (H. pylori) therapies have been declined. Recently, 10-day sequential therapy was not
      sufficient to overcome tough situation for H. pylori eradication.

      Thus, in this study, the investigators evaluated the efficacy of H. pylori eradication
      between a 7 days tailored therapy (7 day PPI based triple therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy
      or moxifloxacin contained triple therapy) for H. pylori infection based on the results of
      antibiotics resistance by using H. pylori culture and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
      and the 10 day sequential therapy for the first eradication of H. pylori infection, and the
      investigators analyzed the prevalence of the antibiotic resistance in the tailored therapy
      group.
