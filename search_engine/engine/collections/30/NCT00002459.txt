      in patients with completely resected, stage I or II, high-grade uterine sarcoma treated with
      adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy vs observation alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, tumor histology (leiomyosarcoma vs mixed mesodermal sarcoma vs endometrial stromal
      sarcoma), and surgical procedure (total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with or without
      bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) vs TAH and BSO with pelvic and para-aortic node
      sampling and random biopsies). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I:
      Beginning within 6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy 5 days a week
      for 5.6 weeks. Arm II: Patients undergo observation alone. Patients are followed every 2
      months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
