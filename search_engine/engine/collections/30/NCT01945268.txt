      that infection due to influenza may precipitate vascular events such as myocardial
      infarctions and strokes. There is some evidence that influenza vaccination may prevent such
      events but the data are inconclusive. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial
      to assess whether influenza vaccination will prevent vascular illness. Adults with clinical
      heart failure will be randomized to inactivated influenza vaccine or saline placebo. This
      pilot study will provide needed data to establish the feasibility of a larger study.
