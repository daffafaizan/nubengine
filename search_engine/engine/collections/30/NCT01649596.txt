      warming and standard intra operative temperature management in patients undergoing general
      surgery. It compares short term outcomes in patients for whom warming is expanded by
      commencing in the pre operative area and is maintained through post operative recovery versus
      patients receiving the standard warming at time of induction. Patients were randomly assigned
      to either a warming blanket device or standard warming procedures. The study tested for
      differences in the rate of hypothermic events between the two groups. A secondary goal was to
      test for differences in the complication rate and patient satisfaction between the two
      groups.

      This study is testing the hypothesis that expanded warming significantly reduces rates of
      hypothermia and complications over standard warming used only during surgery.
