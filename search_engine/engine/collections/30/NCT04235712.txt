    
      The study is a longitudinal, observational pilot study that will assess the utility and value
      displaying the harmonized outcomes data to clinicians in the clinical workflow using an
      open-source, SMART on FHIR app. The app will connect with the site EHR, aggregate EHR and PRO
      data, calculate the outcome measure results, and return the results to the EHR so that they
      are viewable within the clinician workflow. Baseline data on patient characteristics,
      treatments, and symptoms will be combined with longitudinal data on outcomes during the study
      timeframe. All data will be collected from institution electronic medical records (EMRs), PRO
      portals, and other existing data sources, as needed.
