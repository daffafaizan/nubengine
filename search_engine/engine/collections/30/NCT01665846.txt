      effective antiretroviral therapy may be, in part, secondary to the failure of current
      antiretroviral regimens to eradicate the pool of HIV-infected and activated monocytes within
      the bloodstream. Trafficking of such HIV infected and activated blood monocytes into the
      brain parenchyma is believed to introduce HIV into the brain and precipitate immune
      activation and inflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal degeneration.

      Ferumoxytol is an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron-oxide (USPIO), which is FDA-approved for
      intravenous iron-replacement therapy in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease. The
      paramagnetic properties of ferumoxytol also allow it to be used as a MRI contrast agent.
      Ferumoxytol is avidly taken up by circulating monocytes and reactive astrocytes, microglia,
      and dendritic cells within the brain, making it potentially a novel biomarker for
      HIV-associated cognitive impairment given the role of monocytes in its pathogenesis.

      This proposal intends to investigate the possible use of ferumoxytol (a new MRI contrast
      agent) as a biomarker for HIV-associated cognitive impairment and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of ferumoxytol in HIV-infected individuals.

      Hypotheses to be tested:

        -  HIV-infected subjects with undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels and detectable levels of
           HIV DNA in CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and impairment on
           neurocognitive testing will demonstrate ferumoxytol contrast enhancement in the
           perivascular regions of the brain consistent with monocyte/macrophage infiltration in
           these regions.

        -  Ferumoxytol can be safely administered to HIV-infected subjects.
