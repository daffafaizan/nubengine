    
      Objectives:

      The main objective of this study is to document the growth and feeding tolerance of healthy
      term infants consuming an infant formula supplemented with HMOs for 8 weeks (56 days), in a
      real-world setting.

      Main endpoints:

        1. Growth documented via monitoring the anthropometric parameters including weight, length,
           head circumference, BMI and their corresponding z-scores (i.e., z-scores for
           weight-for-age, length-for-age, weight-for-length, head circumference-for-age, and
           BMI-for-age) calculated using the 2006 WHO Growth Standards

        2. Feeding tolerance assessed via monitoring parent-reported overall GI symptom burden
           measured by the Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire (IGSQ) index score
           (13-item summary score)

      Additional objectives:

      To describe the following outcomes in infants fed an infant formula supplemented with HMOs:

        1. Formula acceptability

        2. Despite there are no expected safety concerns, standard Adverse Events (AEs) monitoring
           will be implemented during the study

      Additional endpoints:

        1. Formula acceptability assessed by the Study Formula Satisfaction Questionnaire

        2. Reported AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) including type, incidence, severity,
           seriousness and relation to study formula consumption as well as concomitant medications
           and non-pharmacological treatments.

             -  Select morbidities of interest (i.e., respiratory illnesses, GI illnesses, and
                fever) will be collected as part of AE reporting and specific corresponding AE
                guidance forms will be used to standardize reporting of such AEs

      Trial design:

      Uncontrolled, single arm, open-label, prospective study in infants (enrolled at postnatal age
      7 days to 2 months) fed the study formula for 8 weeks (56 days)

      A group of exclusively breastfed infants (BF) will serve as a reference group in parallel to
      the study arm. For the BF group, Infants must have been exclusively consuming breast milk
      since birth, and their parent(s) must have made the decision to continue exclusively
      breastfeeding until at least 4 month of age

      Trial population:

      Healthy, male and female, term infants, 7 days postnatal age to 2 months of age at the
      enrollment

      Treatment duration:

      Total study participation/intervention up to approximately 8 weeks
