    
      A Totally Implantable Venous Access Device (TIVAD) or so called implantable port that is no
      longer in use for intravenous therapy, should be removed or flushed at established intervals
      to promote and maintain patency. The maintenance procedure consists of a 10 ml 0.9% sodium
      chloride pulsatile flush. No consensus has been established regarding the optimal duration of
      the interval between 2 maintenance sessions. In het university hospitals Leuven the current
      interval is 3 months. Studies confirmed the safety and efficacy of an extended maintenance
      interval to once every 4 months. Many patients have relatively poor compliance with their
      regular port flushing procedure.

      Clinicians tend to prolong the recommended interval or even to omit the maintenance
      procedure. Therefore in clinical practice, intervals vary widely among institutions. To the
      best of our knowledge, a comprehensive investigation of the risks related to catheter
      patency, bacterial colonization and catheter integrity, has never been performed in patients
      whose port is electively removed using a 3 months flushing maintenance regimen. To assess the
      impact of the maintenance interval, patients will be included in the study if the patient's
      TIVAD is not being used for regularly therapy for a total period of at least one year.

      This exploratory study will focus on catheter function and colonisation, tip position and tip
      thrombosis, sleeve formation, removal problems and also patient experiences at elective
      planned TIVAD removal therapy.
