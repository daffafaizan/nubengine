      mithocondrial toxicity. As it is still largely used in developping countries,the evaluation
      of reducing dose is of importance.

      A single-arm open pilot 48 weeks study to evaluate the capacity of a switch from d4T 40 mg to
      30 mg bid in patients with body weight > 60kg to maintain full viral load suppression.
      Clinical and biological evaluations were carried out at baseline, W24 and W48. Primary
      end-point is viral load suppression (<400 coies/ml) at W24.

      Secondary end-points are : Evolution of CD4 count at W24 and W48, neurological examination at
      Baseline, W24 and W48, metabolic parameters and stavudine PK at W24.
