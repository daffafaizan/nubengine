      group through remote blood pressure management platform realizes functions such as automatic
      upload of patient measurement data, intelligent analysis, and early warning reminders;One
      group is distributed a set of electronic sphygmomanometers , and the blood pressure is
      recorded by themselves following routine community hypertension management; one group follows
      routine community hypertension management. For 24 months, observe the patient's blood
      pressure level and blood pressure compliance rate,Risk assessment, etc. The main technical
      difficulties and problems to be solved: Widely popularize remote blood pressure based on
      "Cloud Sharing Smart Cabinet" Management mode. Innovation point: Provide primary hospitals
      with an intelligent, simple and efficient innovative tool for the management of residents
      chronic diseases, and improve the management level of chronic diseases in my country
      promotly; adopt intelligent terminal equipment to realize automatic data collection and
      transmission to ensure patient real blood pressure data timely and continuously, providing
      data reference and basis for academic research and the prevention and treatment of chronic
      diseases, and promoting scientific research in the prevention and treatment of chronic
      diseases in my country.
