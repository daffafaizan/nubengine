      included into the study the morning after the index event. Patients get dual platelet
      inhibition using cangrelor as P2Y12 (purinergic G protein-coupled receptors-12) inhibitor
      plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASS). Patients are treated with therapeutic hypothermia according
      to the local Standard operating procedure for 24h and rewarming is performed within an
      additional 5 to 20h. Platelet function is measured every morning and ASS mediated as well as
      P2Y12 mediated platelet function inhibition is recorded. All relevant clinical data including
      APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment score) scores are collected.

      The degree of platelet inhibition over time (4 days) and differences between the three drugs
      tested will be evaluated by optical aggregometry and by using the commercial VerifyNow test
      system.
