      pick-up procedure in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment due to
      unexplained infertility. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in these cells will be evaluated
      by comet assay. The quality of oocytes retrieved during the oocyte pick-up procedure will be
      graded by particular criteria (zona pellucida thickness, granulation, vacuolization, etc).
      Fertilization rates, embryo quality by grading, and transfer rates will also be assessed.
      Implantation and clinical pregnancy rates, and pregnancy outcomes including gestational age
      at delivery, route of delivery, and birthweight will be recorded as well as demographic data
      such as age, body-mass index, smoking, alcohol use, employment, coexisting chronic disease,
      infertility duration, etiology of infertility, treatment protocol, and hormone levels on day
      3. Implantation will be evaluated by determination of serum human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG) at day 12 following an embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy will be diagnosed upon
      presence of gestational sac on ultrasound examination. DNA damage of granulosa cells will be
      compared between unexplained infertile group and control group. The effect of DNA damage of
      granulosa cells on fertilization, quality of oocyte and embryo, implantation, and clinical
      pregnancy will be also evaluated.
