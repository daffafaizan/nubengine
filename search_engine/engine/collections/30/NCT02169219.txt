    
      The primary aim of this pilot study is to examine whether an 8 week course of
      glucocorticoids, in combination with rituximab, is effective in inducing and maintaining
      disease remission for up to 6 months in a subset of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis
      (AAV) who have a more favorable prognosis.

      This pilot study will enroll 20 patients with active AAV. Close patient follow-up will insure
      that any patients who require courses of glucocorticoids longer than two months will receive
      longer therapy, if appropriate for their well-being.
