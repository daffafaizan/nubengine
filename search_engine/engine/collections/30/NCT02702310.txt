      I. To assess the skin-related quality of life using an established method (Skindex-29), with
      comparisons made between pre-treatment and each of follow-up post-treatment skin assessments.

      II. To assess the durability of response using an established method (modified
      Severity-Weight Assessment [mSWAT] tool), with comparisons made between pre-treatment and
      each of follow-up post-treatment skin assessments.

      III. To determine side effect profile for low dose total skin electron therapy (TSE) for
      mycosis fungoides administered via rotisserie technique.

      OUTLINE:

      The investigational portion of this research study involves collecting quality of life (QOL)
      questionnaire data and objective measurements of patients' skin responses, which are obtained
      by the radiation oncologist during the patient's standard of care radiation treatment
      planning. Patients will also undergo standard of care low-dose total skin electron therapy
      for under 1 hour daily on days 10-21.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
