      type gastric cancer. Currently, the histological assessment of gastric intestinal metaplasia
      still relies on the biopsies took from five sites that the updated Sydney System recommended.
      However, the updated Sydney System biopsy protocol needs more biopsy number and procedure
      time, for it is unable to satisfy the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. I-scan is a
      novel image-enhanced endoscopy system based on the post processing of reflected light without
      optical filters. Targeted biopsy protocol based on i-scan with magnification will be possible
      for the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. This study aims to compare the diagnostic
      yield of gastric intestinal metaplasia from i-scan with magnification targeted biopsies and a
      standard biopsy protocol and assess whether i-scan with magnification can reduce the biopsy
      number needed per patient for the detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia without the loss
      of corresponding diagnostic yield.
