        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of irinotecan in
           children with refractory or progressive solid tumors.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug and its metabolites (SN-38, SN-38G, and APC)
           administered with and without concurrent anticonvulsants in this patient population.

        -  Determine the benefit this drug offers this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are accrued into stratum 1
      initially and into stratum 2 if stratum 1 closes due to dose-limiting toxicity of
      myelosuppression or diarrhea. Patients on anticonvulsants will be accrued into stratum 3 and
      must meet the eligibility criteria for the stratum that is open (stratum 1 or stratum 2).
      (Stratum 1 closed as of 2002-09-15).

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) with and without anticonvulsants is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
