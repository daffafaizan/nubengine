      methods questionnaire and interview to obtain data. Based on statistical power analyses, all
      high schools in Oslo and Akershus County will be asked to participate in the study. After the
      schools have responded, consenting schools will be stratified (by size and geographical
      affiliation) and randomized to the intervention or the control condition. To minimize
      contamination biases within schools, the investigators prepare a cluster-randomized
      design.The population should contain 17-20 schools (1400 students at 2nd year). Data
      collection is conducted through pre-test and post-test 1, 2, and 3 (acute, 3, and 12 month
      post-intervention). At post-test 1, a selection is invited to participate in an interview
      about feasibility in addition to the questionnaire. It is an intervention for students
      containing interactive lecturers with discussion, team work, discussions and home
      assignments.
