      acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. Multiple studies state that patients
      with chronic wounds were colonized with one or more resistant bacteria, and that the presence
      of a chronic wound or decubitus ulcer was associated with a statistically increased
      likelihood of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
      ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli (GNB),colonization and infection with
      ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

      Recently, a newly formulated gauze dressing impregnated with an antiseptic agent has become
      available. This product offers the promise of a combined benefit of wet-to-dry mechanical
      debridement, while providing high local concentrations of a potent antiseptic to prevent
      colonization and infection of the wound by resistant microorganisms, potentially enhancing
      wound healing.

      This study proposes to determine if use of the antimicrobial gauze in routine wound care
      results in a lower rate of chronic wound colonization with resistant microorganisms and
      prevalent microorganisms as compared to standard wound care (with non-antimicrobial gauze).
