      single-center study of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy adult volunteers.
      Canagliflozin (a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor) is currently under development to
      lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients in Cohort
      1 will be randomized to receive Treatment A (one 300-mg tablet orally, by mouth [PO] once
      daily for 5 days) followed 10 days later by Treatment B (one 50-mg and one 100-mg tablet PO
      twice daily for 5 days) or Treatment B followed by Treatment A. Patients in Cohort 2 will be
      randomized to receive Treatment C (one 100-mg tablet PO once daily for 5 days) followed 10
      days later by Treatment D (one 50-mg tablet PO twice daily for 5 days) or Treatment D
      followed by Treatment C.
