      million cells/kg of Prochymal or 8 million cells/kg of Prochymal) using a stratified block
      design. The stratification factor is acute GVHD grade. For the purpose of stratification, the
      GVHD grades are II and III-IV. Treatment with investigational agent was administered on study
      Days 1 and 4. Patients were followed for safety and efficacy until Day 28 after initiation of
      treatment with the investigational agent, or until withdrawal or death, whichever occurred
      first.
