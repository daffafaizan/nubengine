      treatments. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, has been recently approved for
      patients on functional class II and III showing hemodynamic benefits after 12 weeks of
      treatment. Long term hemodynamic evaluation after sildenafil treatment has not been
      evaluating in pulmonary arterial patients on functional class II to IV.

      The protocol has been designed to evaluate patients on functional class II to IV from
      baseline conditions and after 6 months of sildenafil treatment (50 mg po TID). Clinical
      (functional class), functional (walked distance-6 minute walking test) and Hemodynamic
      evaluation is planned to be performed at baseline and after 6 months of treatment.
