      blood borne virus The most common modes of infection are through exposure to small quantities
      of blood, through injection drug use, unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, and the
      transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products.

      An estimated 71 million people have chronic hepatitis C infection. A significant number of
      those who are chronically infected will develop cirrhosis and or liver cancer. the treatment
      of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been difficult, particularly in patients with HCV
      genotype 1. Reasons for the difficulty include the inherent toxicity and limited efficacy of
      interferon-based therapy, which has been the cornerstone of anti-HCV efforts during the past
      2 decades.

      Newly available direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have the potential to dramatically
      improve HCV eradication rates. Despite these new drugs has been characterized by a very low
      adverse events rate in the published clinical trials Few data are available on pulmonary
      adverse events based real life studies
