    
      This protocol is designed to examine those growth potentiating and inhibiting factors which
      regulate mast cell number and survival in patients with mastocytosis, and to explore the
      molecular basis of the disease process in hopes of improving therapy. Patients will carry the
      diagnosis of mastocytosis based on abnormal bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, abnormal skin
      biopsy, presence of urticaria pigmentosa, and if available, elevated serum tryptase level >
      20 ng/ml and the presence of aberrant mast cell morphology and surface markers of CD2 and
      CD25. Mastocytosis patients will include children and adults from two years to 80 years of
      age. Unaffected relatives (age 2 to 80 years) may also be enrolled. The protocol is
      designated for up to a 1-year enrollment period; with only a small number of enrolled
      patients that will stay on study for more than one visit, based on investigator assessment of
      contribution to study objectives. Participants will undergo standard physical exam, medical
      history review, and blood collection for clinical and research laboratory evaluations. We
      will collect clinical data and biological specimens for research evaluation from individuals
      undergoing clinically indicated diagnostic procedures. Some patients may participate in
      research evaluations including buccal swab collection, dietary intake assessment, stool
      collection, exercise challenge, microbiome studies, and activity tracking. These studies are
      optional. Patients may be asked to re-enter this protocol at a later time for further
      follow-up.
