      prostaglandin (PG) excretion between indomethacin and ibuprofen in extremely low birth weight
      (ELBW) infants. We enrolled one hundred and ten ELBW infants who had clinically significant
      and echo-evidence patent ductus arteriosus were assigned into 2 groups, 56 received
      indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg in 24 hours interval) and 54 received
      ibuprofen (10 mg/kg, 5mg/kg and 5 mg/kg in 24 hours interval). Serum electrolytes,
      creatinine, renal function (urine output, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), fractional
      excretion of sodium and potassium, osmolar clearance and free water clearance), urinary PG
      excretion, pulmonary outcome and mortality were all evaluated.
