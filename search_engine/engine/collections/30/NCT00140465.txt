      to 600 mg loading dose. In the CREDO trial it was shown that a 300 mg loading dose results in
      a reduction of ischemic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if given 6
      hours prior to the procedure. An antiplatelet effect similar to that achieved by chronic
      therapy with 75 mg/day is reached within 2 hours when the high 600 mg loading is
      administered. The 600 mg loading dose has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing
      thrombotic events following coronary stent implantation. Recently, it was shown that in
      patients with stable angina and administration of the 600 mg loading dose at least two hours
      prior to PCI concomitant therapy with a GP IIb/IIIa antagonist does not result in a further
      reduction of the incidence of thrombotic events. In contrast to a number of investigations
      with different loading doses, no trials have been performed comparing different clopidogrel
      maintenance doses. Recently, it was shown that administration of a 600 mg loading dose in
      patients already on chronic clopidogrel therapy (75 mg/day) results in an additional
      significant increase in inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP-) induced platelet
      aggregation. Therefore, it is possible that an increase of the clopidogrel maintenance dose
      in patients with chronic clopidogrel therapy also results in a more pronounced inhibition of
      platelet aggregation.
