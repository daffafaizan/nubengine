    
      Massed PE will be conducted by doctoral-level therapists. Participants will meet with their
      providers for individual, 90-minute sessions. They will then be asked to complete
      out-of-session treatment assignments throughout the rest of the day. Between the individual
      therapy session and out-of-session treatment assignments, participants will engage in
      approximately four to six hours of treatment per day, Monday through Friday, for two weeks.
      The stellate ganglion block injection will be administered between the first and second
      massed PE session by qualified medical personnel as per standard operating procedure for the
      placement of a stellate ganglion block. A research nurse will be in attendance during the
      procedure and for an hour recovery period following the block administration.

      During PE treatment, participants will complete interim assessments of their PTSD symptoms,
      mood symptoms, trauma-related cognitions, and suicidal ideation proceeding sessions 6 and 10.
