      be assessed through a set of tests and questionnaires to register data regarding: physical
      activity; functional capacity; muscle strength; health-related quality of life; symptoms
      (dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety and depression); lung function; sociodemographics and
      anthropometrics. Data collection will occur at baseline (at discharge from hospital or at
      patients' home), at 12 weeks and 6 months.
