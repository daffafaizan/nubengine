      could show similar clinical outcomes to in-person programs at a low cost in a large
      population of patients. Investigators will also assess the feasibility of tailoring a virtual
      CR program to a small sample of COPD participants who also stand to benefit in the absence of
      an established pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.

      This is a non-randomized clinical trial of participants at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs
      Medical Center with an applicable diagnosis for cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation versus
      usual care during the study period. We will evaluate the outcomes related to
      smartphone-enabled home base cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in those who choose the
      intervention and those who opt into home-based CR, traditional CR, or those who decline. Data
      from the past 5 years will also be evaluated to obtain a baseline event rate.

      Investigators seek to address the following:

        1. Determine whether a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered
           through smartphones is feasible and improves functional status.

        2. Determine if education and lifestyle counseling lead to increased adherence with
           prescribed follow-up, pharmacotherapy, quality of life, self-efficacy and lifestyle
           changes.

        3. Determine if a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program reduces health
           system utilization, including ED visits and readmission rates.
