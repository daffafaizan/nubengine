      ligands, endogenous major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. This is a
      Phase 1, first in human, open label, multicenter, dose escalation clinical trial to determine
      the safety, tolerability, MTD and RP2D of JTX-8064 when administered as a single agent and in
      combination with JTX-4014 or pembrolizumab to adult subjects with advanced refractory solid
      tumor malignancies. Additionally, the study will seek to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity of JTX-8064.
