      patient care and is associated with many adverse events such as impaired coagulation,
      increased risk for wound infections and patient discomfort among others. The intention of
      this study was to evaluate the current S3 guideline on the avoidance of perioperative
      hypothermia published in 2014 concerning it´s implementation in the clinical routine. In a
      first phase the current status should be recorded. If this reveals an inappropriate high
      incidence of perioperative hypothermia training arrangements shall be taken for non-physician
      personnel in the PACU in a 2nd phase of the project. The third phase is intended to evaluate
      the effect of the training arrangements on the incidence of hypothermia.
