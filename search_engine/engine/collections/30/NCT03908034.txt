      potentially cause a disease in the future. When a controllable risk factor (say, X) is the
      only factor that causes a disease, the decision to remove it may simply depend on the
      probabilistic relationship between X and an outcome, as well as the cost of removing X.
      However, little is known when other factors that are out of the decision-maker's control are
      also present. The main question being asked here is how does the presence of such
      uncontrollable factors change people's decision to remove X.

      Specifically, the investigators consider two cases: a disease caused by a single controllable
      risk factor (say X) and a disease caused by two risk factors -- a controllable factor (X) and
      an uncontrollable factor (Y). In both cases, the removal of X can result in a meaningful
      reduction in overall disease risk. It is hypothesized that even when the magnitude of overall
      risk reduction brought by the removal of X is the same in the two cases, people would have a
      lower motivation to remove X in the latter case.

      The investigators also examine how the presence of an uncontrollable risk factor interacts
      with the respondents' regret anticipation to influence their decision to remove X. In the
      context of the current research, regret anticipation could take one of the following forms:
      (a) feel regretful if one decides not to remove X and later develops the disease (b) feel
      regretful if one decides to remove X but still develops the disease. The investigators expect
      (a) to moderate the effect of uncontrollable risk factor on motivation to remove X.
