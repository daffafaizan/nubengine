      CT-scan obtaining the anatomy of the heart and torso, hereby able to reconstruct local
      electrograms, activation and recovery times. In recent research, ECGI provided numerous extra
      insights into normal cardiac electrophysiology, but also electrophysiological disorders and
      disease. The results strongly suggest that ECGI can play a pivotal role in further
      characterizing arrhythmia mechanisms, therefore could do so for polymorphic VT or idiopathic
      VF leading to diagnosis and treatment improvement. Moreover, ECGI seems to have the potential
      to detect arrhythmogenic substrate in individuals before their first event, offering the
      possibility to diagnose and treat patients before sudden cardiac arrest occurs.

      In the VIGILANCE study:

        1. ECGI will be used to noninvasively characterize the epicardial electrophysiological
           substrate and triggers of:

             -  Patients with unexplained polymorphic VT and VF,

             -  Index patients of family cohorts with a specific genetic mutation related to
                arrhythmogenesis, at high risk for unexplained polymorphic VT and/or VF.

             -  Family members,

             -  A control cohort. Results will be evaluated for risk stratification.

        2. All unexplained polymorphic VT and/or VF patients and their family members will be asked
           to participate in a National Dutch registry, and these date will be analysed to
           determine their prognostic value in terms of arrhythmia risk
