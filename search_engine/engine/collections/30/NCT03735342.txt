      recorded discharge instructions to patients discharged from an inpatient cardiology service
      using a two-arm randomized controlled design. Specifically, this pilot study aims to: 1)
      Determine whether providing audio recorded discharge instructions as a supplemental discharge
      communication tool is feasible for cardiology providers and patients to use during the
      inpatient discharge discussion, 2) Determine whether it is acceptable for patients and
      families to use audio recorded discharge instructions after hospital discharge to self-manage
      care, and 3) Explore the impact of audio recording on patients' understanding of discharge
      instructions, ability to self-manage care and ability to adhere to prescribed medications.

      On the day of discharge, enrolled patients will be randomized to a usual care arm, which
      includes bedside discussion and review of written discharge instructions with the discharging
      provider, or to an intervention arm, which includes bedside discussion and review of written
      discharge instructions with the discharging provider and an audio recording of that bedside
      discharge discussion using block randomization at the provider level. All participants
      randomized to the intervention arm will receive a portable, electronic recording device with
      audio playback that contains a recording of the bedside discharge discussion, and will also
      have the option to record the discharge discussion on a smartphone or receive access to the
      recording online, via the Open Recording Automated Logging System (ORALS). The hypothesis is
      providing audio recordings of discharge instructions will be feasible and acceptable to
      cardiology patients and providers.

      One week after discharge, all enrolled patients (both arms) will be contacted via telephone
      to complete an interview about the use of written discharge instructions and a survey about
      understanding of discharge instructions, confidence and ability to self-manage care, and
      medication adherence. In addition, patients in the intervention arm will be interviewed about
      how the audio recording of the discharge discussion was used.
