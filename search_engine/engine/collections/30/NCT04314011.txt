      enhanced vulnerability to endogenous or exogenous stressors, exposing individuals to an
      increased risk of adverse health-related outcomes. The human umbilical cord (HUC) is a
      promising source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), compared to embryonic stem cells, HUC-MSCs
      are noncontroversial with a painless collection procedure and faster self-renewal properties.
      HUC-MSCs can differentiate into the different germ layers and modulate immune responses. One
      possible mechanism for the onset and development of aging frailty is the depletion of stem
      cells. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against aging frailty.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The participants from
      two centers (n = 30) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The HUC-MSCs Group (n =
      15) will receive intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells twice over a month (30 days
      interval), the Control Group (n = 15) will receive the same protocolized intervention with
      normal saline. Follow-up duration is 6 months after first intervention. The reported serious
      adverse events（SAEs）will be observed within one month post infusion. The short-item from
      health survey（SF-36), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Fried phenotype scale
      will be evaluated. Short physical performance battery (SPPB) and plasm biomarkers will be
      assessed.The assessments will be performed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.

      The intent of this study is to explore domains of efficacy of HUC-MSCs through the reduction
      of signs and symptoms of aging frailty and to evaluate the safety of HUC-MSCs in subjects
      with aging frailty.
