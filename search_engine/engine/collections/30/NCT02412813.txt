      chrome femoral components as part of their LEGION revision procedure. The objective of this
      study is to assess a lower serum metal ion concentration level in at least one of the three
      major mLTTs (Co, Cr or Ni) over 5 years in subjects receiving OXINIUM versus Cobalt Chrome
      femoral components as part of the LEGION Revision Total Knee System.
