    
      This is a prospective observational study, conducted in Italian cancer centers located
      Nationwide.

      The investigators plan to consider for validation 21tumor sites, which correspond to the
      conditions for which a specific EORTC module has been produced, plus all remaining cancer
      types classified as "other setting".

      The study will take place during two planned visits, one the first the day of enrollment, the
      second after 3-6 weeks. Enrolled patients will be asked to complete a subset of the PRO-CTCAE
      items based on cancer type, and the following instruments used as anchors to measure
      psychometric properties:

        -  EORTC Quality of Life disease-specific module, if a linguistically validated Italian
           version exists, or the General QLQ-C30, if the Italian version is not available.

        -  the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)

        -  The Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale
