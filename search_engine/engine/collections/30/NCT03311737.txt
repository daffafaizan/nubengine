      thoracic surgery. The uniportal VATS lung surgery have advantages of minimal invasive
      surgical incision, less postoperative pain, and so on. Whether general anesthesia can become
      an alternative method of combining epidural with general anesthesia in uniportal VATS lung
      surgery, investigators thus plan to make a comparison on intraoperative stress response,
      postoperative pain, immune function of patientsï¼Œand hospital expenses.
