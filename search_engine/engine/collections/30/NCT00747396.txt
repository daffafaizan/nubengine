      care as an intervention for children abandoned at or around the time of birth and placed in
      one of six institutions for young children in Bucharest, Romania (Zeanah et al., 2003). The
      PI (Nelson) and Co-PIs (Zeanah and Fox) conducted this study beginning in the fall of 2000
      from baseline assessments and implementation of the intervention in the spring of 2001.

      The BEIP began with comprehensive assessments of 136 institutionalized children and their
      caregiving environments prior to randomization. Half the children were randomly assigned to
      high-quality foster care and the other half to remain in institutional care. The average age
      at foster care placement was 22 months (range=6-31 months). All children were initially seen
      prior to randomization and again for follow-up assessments at 30 months, 42 months 54 months,
      8 years and 12 years of age. The development of children in foster care was compared to the
      development of children in institutions and to a group of never institutionalized children
      (community controls). These children are being assessed at age 16 years.
