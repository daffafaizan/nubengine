    
      Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGi) is an emerging technique to image cardiac electrical
      activity through inverse reconstructions from body-surface ECGs. After 40 years of active
      research, the potential of ECGi as a noninvasive adjunct to catheter mapping is gaining rapid
      attention in the clinical community.

      A total of 40 consecutive post-infarction VT patients will be prospectively enrolled and
      recruited from those who have been referred for catheter ablation of scar-related VT. Within
      7 days before the ablation procedure, these patients will undergo noninvasive cardiac CT or
      MRI imaging and noninvasive programmed stimulation (NIPS) study with simultaneous 120-lead
      body- surface ECG mapping (pre-ablation NIPS). MRI will be performed for patients with
      implantable defibrillators for whom it is considered safe to do so. CT imaging will be
      performed for those with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) which are not MRI
      compatible.

      At the time of scheduled ablation, all patients will undergo standard catheter mapping and
      ablation procedure as a part of standard care. Within 7 days after the ablation procedure,
      the patients will undergo cardiac MRI imaging and noninvasive programmed stimulation (NIPS)
      with simultaneous 120-lead body-surface ECG mapping (post-ablation NIPS). For patients who
      cannot undergo MRI, CT imaging will not be repeated.

      At 6 months after the procedure, a follow-up will occur as a part of standard care where
      outcome data regarding the chronic success of the ablation procedure will be collected and
      ICD interrogation will be performed. No imaging or mapping is planned at the follow-up.
