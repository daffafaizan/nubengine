    
      This is an open-label, randomised (effectiveness) study (ie. comparison of active treatments)
      to identify genetic markers, brain function, brain structure, and psychological and cognitive
      indicators (or a combination of markers) in MDD subjects versus healthy controls.
      Approximately 2,016 subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) across multiple
      international sites (USA, Canada, UK, South Africa, New Zealand, The Netherlands and
      Australia) will be randomised to one of three approved and effective treatment arms:

      Treatment A Escitalopram. Treatment B Sertraline. Treatment C Venlafaxine XR.

      A group of matched healthy controls (n = 672) will also be enrolled.

      Subjects will be asked to attend the testing facility on two separate occasions; for
      Pre-treatment (Pre-Tx) and at 8 weeks post initiation of treatment. The
      assessments/procedures at Pre-Tx and Week 8 include: Baseline a clinical work-up, blood
      collection for genetic analyses, cognitive testing and electrical brain functioning
      (EEG/ERP). Structural and functional data MRI data will be collected in ten percent (10%) of
      participants.

      On Day 4 and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 24 and 52 Subjects will be contacted by phone and asked
      to complete 2 questionnaires via the internet.
