      subjects who are on stable abacavir-containing regimen will be randomized into two arms. In
      arm A maraviroc will be added to their regimen at baseline, while study subjects in arm B
      will continue their abacavir-containing regimen. After 8 weeks, cross-over of the study arms
      will be performed. Subjects in arm A will then stop maraviroc, while in subjects in arm B
      maraviroc will be added to their regimen (for 8 weeks again). The total duration of the study
      will be 16 weeks.
