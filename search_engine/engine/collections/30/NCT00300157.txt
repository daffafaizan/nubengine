      With the advancements of technology and particularly drug-eluting stents, in-stent restenosis
      has dramatically decreased and now it is possible to extend indications of complexes lesions
      such as left main coronary artery stenoses. In these particular situations,some centers
      performed percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) with drug-eluting stents with acceptable
      results in terms of safety and efficacy. However, these procedures are performed at isolated
      sites and are not evaluated in multicenter trial.The aim of this study is to assess the
      safety and efficacy of this PCI with Taxus-stent in a french multicenter trial and to
      evaluate clinical and angiographic outcome of these patients at long-term follow-up.
