      I. To determine the recommended stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) dose for each of
      the metastatic locations being treated given the individual and overlapping fields when
      multiple metastases are treated with SBRT in a national clinical trials network setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate rates of >= grade 3 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),
      version (v.) 4.0 adverse events other than a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) which is possibly,
      probably, or definitely related to treatment and which occurs within 6 months from the start
      of SBRT to multiple metastases.

      II. To estimate the rates of long-term adverse events occurring up to 2 years from the end of
      SBRT.

      III. To explore the most appropriate and clinically relevant technological parameters to
      ensure quality and effectiveness throughout radiation therapy processes, including imaging,
      simulation, patient immobilization, target and critical structure definition, treatment
      planning, image guidance and delivery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 3-5 fractions of image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy to all
      existing metastases over 1-3 weeks with at least 40 hours between treatments for an
      individual metastasis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 35-45 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
