    
      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with paired evaluation of conventional
      FNA needle versus FNB needle stratified by lesion location (pancreas head tumor versus
      pancreas body/tail). A minimum of 4 passes ( 2 with each needle) will be performed from all
      the lesions. After each pass of needle, the on-site cytopathologists will evaluate the
      adequacy and the degree of the pathological changes in the obtained material. Based on the
      information provided by the onsite cytopathologists, the endosonographer will repeat the FNA
      until enough histological material is obtained to confirm a diagnosis. Patients will be
      assessed immediately after procedure and during the first 30 days with a follow-up.
