    
      -  Principal Objective: To show that IPV ventilation can decrease the duration of transient
           respiratory distress as well as the risk of complications.

        -  Secondary Objective: Comparison between the two groups regarding: Length of oxygen
           therapy, complications (pneumothorax, pulmonary infections), need for intensive care
           hospitalization

        -  Study design: Open, prospective randomized trial.

        -  Inclusion criteria: Neonates with gestational age ≥ 35 weeks and weight ≥ 2000g,
           caesarean section, respiratory distress syndrome (modified Silverman score > 5, SpO2 <
           90%), management within 20 minutes after birth.

        -  Exclusion criteria: clinical thoracic retraction, congenital lung malformation, meconium
           aspiration, neonatal infection, other congenital malformations.

        -  Study plan: After the screening evaluation and written consent document, neonates will
           be randomized into two groups: nCPAP ventilation or IPV. During the 6 hours after
           randomization, clinical data will be monitored: cardiac and respiratory frequency (CF
           -RF), saturation (SaO2), oxygenotherapy, Silverman Score. Then, neonates will be
           supervised 3 days after normalization of the respiratory distress.

        -  Number of subjects: 100 (50 in each group)
