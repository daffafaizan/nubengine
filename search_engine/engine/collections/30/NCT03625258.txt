      virus replication. Mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) regions of the
      HBV genome are known to have an impact on viral replication. The aim of the present study was
      to assess the correlation of mutation profiles in the BCP and PC regions with the viral load
      in HBeAgnegative chronically infected patients. The HBV genotype, BCP/PC mutations, serum HBV
      DNA levels, and associated serological markers were analyzed in 92 HBeAgnegative chronically
      infected patients.
