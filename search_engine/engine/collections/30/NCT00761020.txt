      infected mosquitoes. In one group, volunteers will be given several doses of a drug called
      mefloquine, known to prevent the development of malaria symptoms. The other group will not be
      treated with any drug that could prevent symptoms or infection. After exposure, both groups
      will be monitored for a period of approximately 6 months to see if they develop symptoms of
      malaria. Any subjects who do so will be treated with appropriate medications. Subjects in
      both groups will have their blood checked regularly during this period for the presence of a
      certain malaria antibody called Merozoite Surface Protein 1, or Anti-MSP-1 for short, using a
      special blood test (also known as an assay). At the completion of the study, the results of
      all assays will be analyzed to determine if this test can be used to diagnose malaria
      infection in persons without symptoms.
