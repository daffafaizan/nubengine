      outcomes for hospitalized older patients and can help inform the design and evaluation of
      interventions designed to improve sleep in hospitalized older patients. This work can also
      form the foundation for understanding the longer term health effects of inpatient sleep loss
      for older patients that are potentially modifiable.
