    
      This is an observational study aimed at gathering sufficient number of cases of rCTDs
      patients who will receive COVID-19 vaccination that will help in better understanding of both
      safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this population. The study will be promoted both in ERN
      ReCONNET Full Members and Affiliated Partners as well as in other centres treating and
      managing rare and complex connective tissue diseases.

      Study Objectives

        1. To promote a harmonised data collection approach on COVID-19 vaccination in rare and
           complex CTDs patients;

        2. To evaluate the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccination in rCTDs patients and to
           highlight possible disease-specific adverse events;

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in rCTDs patients and to highlight
           potential variables that prevent an effective immunization against COVID-19;

        4. To evaluate differences in term of efficacy and safety among different types of vaccines
           in rCTDs patients

        5. To depict the ideal patient's profile that would mostly benefit from COVID-19
           vaccination
