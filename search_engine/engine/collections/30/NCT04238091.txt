      AA patchy is associated with well-circumscribed patches of hair loss, commonly on the scalp
      or face, while alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU) are two severe types of AA
      characterized by 95% or more hair loss on the scalp (AT) or body (AU). Although the exact
      underlying mechanisms that cause AA are unknown, T lymphocyte cells are implicated, as they
      release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines around the hair follicles, triggering a
      cascade and ultimately resulting in hair loss.

      Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) involves the transfer of stool (feces) from a healthy donor
      to an AA recipient. Research suggests that changing the type of bacteria in an individual's
      intestine may carry the potential to alter (increase or decrease) the recipient's potential
      for certain conditions, even autoimmune conditions.
