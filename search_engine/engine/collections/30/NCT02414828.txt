      time from the start of TB treatment, into the 'on-TB-treatment' stratum (TB treatment started
      between 1 and 4 months prior to Study Day 0) or the 'post-TB-treatment' stratum (TB treatment
      started at least 12 months before Study Day 0). In the on-TB-treatment stratum, 36 subjects
      were randomized to receive AERAS-402 or placebo as follows: 1 or 2 doses of placebo (N=5); 1
      dose of AERAS-402 at 3 x 10^8 vp (N=5) or 3 x 10^9 vp (N=10), or 2 doses of AERAS-402 at 3 x
      10^10 vp (N=16). In the post-TB-treatment stratum, 36 subjects were randomized to receive
      AERAS-402 or placebo as follows: 1 or 2 doses of placebo (N=6); 1 dose of AERAS-402 at 3 x
      10^8 vp (N=5) or 3 x 109 vp (N=10), or 2 doses of AERAS-402 at 3 x 10^10 vp (N=15).
