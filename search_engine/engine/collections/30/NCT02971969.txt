      factor IX (FIX) gene. FIX is produced in the liver and is critical for fibrin clot formation.
      Hemophilia B is characterized by frequent, spontaneous internal bleeding that can lead to
      chronic arthropathy (joint damage), intracranial hemorrhage, and even death. In patients with
      moderate/severe to severe hemophilia B, the majority of bleeding episodes occur in the joints
      and, if not treated, lead to debilitating damage and a decreased quality of life.

      Study 101HEMB02 is a long-term follow-up study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of AAVrh10-mediated gene therapy of human FIX in subjects with moderate/severe to
      severe hemophilia B. The primary objective of the study is to determine the long-term safety
      and efficacy of DTX101 following a single IV infusion (administered during Study 101HEMB01)
      in adults with moderate/severe to severe hemophilia B.

      This study was previously posted by Dimension Therapeutics, which has been acquired by
      Ultragenyx.
