    
      This is an open label, phase I evaluation of a single dose of an investigational inactivated,
      subunit influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine in subjects who were previously
      vaccinated with a vaccine made from an antigenically distinct variant of H5N1. The study is
      designed to determine whether immunization with an antigenic variant can prime for responses
      to a single dose of vaccine representing the current pandemic threat. The primary objective
      is to determine the ability of a priming dose of rec H5 HA 1997 vaccine administered 7 years
      previously to result in booster responses to an inactivated subunit influenza
      A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine. The secondary objectives are to 1) determine the safety
      of a booster dose of intramuscular inactivated subunit influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1)
      vaccine in healthy adults, previously vaccinated with rec H5 HA 1997 vaccine and 2) evaluate
      the relationship between priming, levels of antigen-specific memory B and T cells , and the
      response to reactivation. The study will be performed at a single site, and will enroll as
      many previously vaccinated subjects as are available and eligible, up to a maximum of 117.
      Subjects will receive a single intramuscular dose of 90 mcg of the inactivated subunit
      influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) vaccine. Blood for assessment of antibody responses will
      be obtained before and at time points after vaccination. Subjects participating in the
      optional sub study will also have blood obtained for enumeration of memory B and T cells.
      Subjects will be followed for solicited adverse events for 7 days by memory aids and for 56
      days for unsolicited adverse events. This study is linked to DMID protocol 08-0059.
