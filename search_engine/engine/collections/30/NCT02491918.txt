    
      This prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial compares visual axis obscuration as
      well as intra and postoperative complications in children undergoing cataract surgery with
      IOL implantation using one of two techniques :

        1. in the bag IOL with limbal anterior vitrectomy

        2. posterior optic capture of IOL optic through the posterior capsulorhexis without any
           vitrectomy.

      The aim is to evaluate whether avoiding anterior vitrectomy is a feasible option,
      particularly younger children, where anterior vitrectomy has become an integral part of the
      routine surgical strategy.

      All children will be evaluated at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively.
