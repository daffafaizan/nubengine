      critical illness, requiring intensive care. This study will use two activity monitors
      (accelerometers) to measure physical activity and sedentary variables from patients
      recovering from a critical illness in a single tertiary hospital on three occasions during
      their acute hospital admission. Accelerometer derived measures will be obtained from
      continuous 24 hour monitoring periods once patients are sufficiently awake and attentive
      within the ICU, at ICU discharge and again at acute hospital discharge. Measurements of
      patients muscle strength and physical function will also be made at the time of
      accelerometry.
