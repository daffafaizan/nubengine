      the USA. Bariatric surgery is the most effective and durable weight loss treatment, with
      long-term cardiometabolic health benefits. Among different types of bariatric procedures,
      sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become the most commonly performed in USA. While SG is expected
      to result in a 50-60% excess weight loss, inter-individual differences in weight loss are
      large and approximately 25% of patients can be considered poor weight-loss responders who
      either do not lose a substantial amount of weight or regain the lost weight afterwards. The
      mechanisms underlying this clinical variation remain unknown and interventions to improve on
      these outcomes critically lacking. Of interest, altered daily dietary habits are experienced
      by a substantial proportion of bariatric surgery candidates, raising the question whether
      such alterations may contribute to inter-individual differences in weight loss success.
      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to test how dietary habit interventions affect
      patients with poor weight loss outcomes after bariatric surgery. Since this is a single blind
      study, the details of the dietary interventions cannot be released during recruitment stage,
      but will be made public once enrollment closes.
