    
      POWERS (Personalized Online Weight and Exercise Response System) platform is a novel,
      multifocal-centered tailored intervention utilizing an innovative online tool designed to
      facilitate improvements in physical activity and nutritional behaviors. Aim 1 of this
      protocol is to customize the POWERS platform, demonstrated effective in previous research,
      for adults with intellectual disability (ID) and their caregivers to be referred to as
      POWERSforID. The POWERSforID intervention is designed to achieve weight loss and improve
      specific health markers while respecting and supporting the needs of the participants with ID
      as well as their caregivers. Aim 2 of the project is to conduct a pilot study to assess the
      usability and feasibility of the POWERSforID system and intervention with 5 adults with ID
      and their caregiver and improve the system based on pilot data. Aim 3 of the protocol is to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effect of POWERSforID on educating
      and coaching caregivers about nutrition and exercise and thus improving health status and
      reducing body weight in obese adults with ID. The investigators hypothesize that the obese
      participants in the intervention group (POWERSforID) will evidence significantly greater
      weight loss and improved health status (i.e. lower waist circumference, blood pressure,
      decreased body fat percentage, and improved blood lipids) compared to a control group. The
      investigators also hypothesize that both adults with ID and their caregivers will demonstrate
      improved knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy related to diet and exercise.
