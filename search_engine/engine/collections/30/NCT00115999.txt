      occlusion (PAO). Currently used plasminogen activators can result in increased circulating
      levels of plasmin that result in a systemic "lytic state" that does not distinguish between
      physiologic and pathologic thrombosis. In general, mean plasminogen activator infusion
      durations of greater than 24 hours in order to achieve successful thrombolysis are
      problematic in a disease where delayed restoration of arterial flow can lead to irreversible
      ischemic damage. A direct thrombolytic agent like alfimeprase, with a rapid mechanism of
      action and a potentially safer bleeding risk profile, could facilitate a rapid restoration of
      arterial flow and avoidance of open vascular surgery.
