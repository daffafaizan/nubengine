      efficacy of biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting coronary stent system(HELIOS) in patients
      with coronary artery disease . The HELIOS (Kimley Medical, Shenzhen, China) completed
      biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) is a novel polylactic-co-glycolic acid
      (PLGA),polymer cobalt-chromium DES with titanium oxides (TiO) film as the tie-layer.In total,
      we plan to recruit 3000 patients (HELIOS)in real world setting. The patients will be followed
      clinically at 1-, 6- month and 1-, 3-, 5-year. All clinical data will be collected and
      managed by statistical center, clinical endpoint adjudication committee.
