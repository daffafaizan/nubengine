      Coagadex, in a post-marketing environment, for peri-operative hemostatic cover during major
      surgery in patients with moderate or severe hereditary factor X (FX) deficiency.

      The secondary objective is to review safety data on Coagadex through the collection of any
      Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from the first dose of Coagadex in the hospital prior to the
      surgical procedure until the first follow-up after discharge (i.e., follow-up completed) and
      Serious ADRs up until the post-operative care follow-up has been completed. Data on any
      deaths and pregnancies reported within this time period will be collected.
