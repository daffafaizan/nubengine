      uveitis, and is also one of the important causes of permanent vision loss in uveitis. The
      pathophysiological mechanism of UME remains unclear, but was thought to be caused by damages
      of internal/external blood-retinal barrier mediated by inflammatory factors, including
      interleukin-2, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor Î±, prostaglandins and vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Current treatments of UME include local or systemic
      glucocorticosteroids (GCS), immunosuppressants and biological agents. Although large dose of
      systemic GCS combined with immunosuppressants lead to quick resolution of ME in most of the
      cases, UME often relapse with tapering of GCS, and the side effects can be significant.
      Periocular or intraocular injection of GCS is effective in short term, but repetitive
      injections often lead to high intraocular pressure and cataract. Intravitreal injection of
      anti-VEGF agents is a huge advance of medical treatment in ophthalmology in recent years.
      Since 2007 till now, there have been a number of reports on the effectiveness of intraocular
      Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab injection in UME, but none about Conbercept. Besides, as the
      target of anti-VEGF agents, intraocular concentration of VEGF and its changes might be
      correlated to the sensitivity and responsiveness of UME to anti-VEGF agents, but has not been
      monitored. As a primary exploratory study, this study aims to evaluate the short-term
      effectiveness of intravitreal Conbercept injection in UME, and to explore the correlation
      between inflammatory factors like VEGF and the responsiveness to treatment.
