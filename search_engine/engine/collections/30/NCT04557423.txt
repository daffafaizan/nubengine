    
      Aim 1: Compare rates of providing a self-collected sample vs. obtaining clinic-based
      screening among 800 Asian American women. It is hypothesized that the proportion of women in
      the HPV self-sampling program who provide a self-collected sample will be higher than the
      proportion of women in the clinic-based program who obtain clinic-based screening.

      Aim 2: Examine mediators of participation. The investigators will examine both individual-
      and social/environmental-level factors associated with participation across both programs. It
      is hypothesized that higher levels of perceived self-efficacy, lower levels of embarrassment,
      and fewer barriers will be associated with higher rates of participation in both conditions.
      Further, it is hypothesized that women in the HPV self-sampling program will report greater
      self-efficacy, less embarrassment, and fewer barriers compared to women in the clinic-based
      program.

      Aim 3: Assess the relative cost-effectiveness of HPV self-sampling vs. clinic-based
      screening. The investigators will conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from a
      societal perspective incorporating trial-based direct medical and participant-borne costs
      associated with HPV self-sampling vs. clinic-based screening. It is hypothesized that the
      self-sampling program will be less costly to implement and achieve a higher participation
      rate.
