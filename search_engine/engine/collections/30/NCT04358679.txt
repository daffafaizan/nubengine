      channel of nerve signals within the brain and spinal cord. It contains grey and white matter.
      The grey matter consists of cell bodies of different sensory and motor neurons and white
      matter consists of oriented spinal tracts.

      By 2007, a prospective observational study had been conducted after a disaster occurred in
      Pakistan which was the most cataclysmic natural disaster in country's history as a result
      73000 people were lost their lives and 126000 were harmed. There was no Spinal Cord Injury
      (SCI) registry existed in the country but according to different estimates 650-750 had been
      effected of SCI.

      In United States SCI incidence mainly due to higher percentage of violence-related SCIs
      (18%)which is higher compared to the western Europe (8%) Australia (2%). In Pakistan the most
      common traumatic cause of SCI was falling from different cause followed by road traffic
      accident (RAT) (25.2%) and functional aerobic impairment (FAI) (8.4%). The way that SCI is
      associated with fantastic expenses and human sufferings , yet careful statistics of SCI are
      not accessible in dominant of developing countries including Pakistan.

      Total lung capacities become abnormal in chronic spinal cord injury patients. Changes in
      chest wall compliance and decreased respiratory muscle strength leads to abnormal changes in
      overall lung capacities.
