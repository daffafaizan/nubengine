      anesthetist. Most of the intravenous induction agents have a negative effect on arterial
      blood pressure and cardiac output. Theoretically, the "ideal" emergency induction intravenous
      anesthetic should achieve rapid hypnosis and maintain the hemodynamic stability.

      Ketamine has been reported as an induction anesthetic with a sympathomimetic activity. In
      patients with intact autonomic nervous system ketamine increases heart rate, cardiac output,
      and arterial blood pressure (ABP). Despite its sympathomimetic activity in hemodynamically
      stable patients, the hemodynamic response to ketamine in unstable cardiovascular conditions
      is not clear. No studies to the best of our knowledge compared Ketamine-based and
      opioid-based protocols in rapid sequence induction of anesthesia in hemodynamically unstable
      patients.

      In this study, patients with severe sepsis or septic shock scheduled for surgery will be
      assigned to receive either ketamine or fentanyl for induction of anesthesia. After induction
      of anesthesia, endotracheal tube will be inserted aided by succinyl choline. Invasive blood
      pressure will be monitored through a transducer connected to arterial catheter. Electrical
      velocimetry (cardiometry) device will be used for non-invasive monitoring of cardiac output
      and stroke volume.
