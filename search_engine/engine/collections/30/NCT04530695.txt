      causes significant morbidity and mortality. Chemotherapy disrupts oral and intestinal mucosal
      barriers, facilitating bacterial translocation to the bloodstream.

      Baseline periodontitis is associated with higher risk of BSI during chemotherapy. In AML
      patients, since baseline screening and treatment of asymptomatic periodontitis is currently
      not a standard practice, the researchers are hoping to (i) personalize supportive care
      according to patient-specific risk factors; (ii) promote an interdisciplinary approach to
      supportive care by bringing periodontists into the treatment team; (iii) improve quality of
      life by reducing hospitalization length; (iv) decrease the incidence of re-hospitalization
      during future phases of treatment; (v) decrease early treatment related mortality (TRM); and
      (vi) decrease healthcare costs.
