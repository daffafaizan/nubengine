      either 100 or 200 mcg thrice weekly for four weeks while monitoring them at regular, timed
      intervals for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels and immunological responses to HCV antigens.
      Patients with chronic hepatitis C will be eligible if they have failed to have responded to a
      previous course of alpha interferon and ribavirin and have raised serum aminotransferase
      levels, HCV genotype 1 and HCV RNA in serum in levels greater than 10,000 copies/ml. The 20
      patients will include 10 patients who were treated and did not become HCV RNA negative during
      therapy (Group A: non-responders) and 10 who were treated and became HCV RNA negative during
      therapy but relapsed thereafter (Group B: relapsers). After a medical evaluation and
      monitoring for HCV RNA levels, patients will be randomized to receive either 100 or 200 mcg
      of gamma interferon 1b (provided by InterMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc) subcutaneously three
      times weekly for 4 weeks. Patients will have blood tested for HCV RNA levels at 0, 6, 12, 18,
      24, and 48 hours after the initial injection and then weekly during treatment, followed by 2
      and 4 weeks thereafter. T cell responses to HCV antigens will be assessed before treatment,
      after 4 weeks of therapy and again 4 weeks thereafter. Patients will also be monitored for
      side effects and changes in routine liver tests and complete blood counts.

      This is a pilot study in a small number of patients which is aimed at assessing whether gamma
      interferon has antiviral and immunological effects against hepatitis C, whether these effects
      appear to be dose related, and whether they are similar in timing and degree to those of
      alpha interferon. Demonstration of an antiviral effect would lead to more extensive trials in
      larger numbers of patients, treated for longer periods.
