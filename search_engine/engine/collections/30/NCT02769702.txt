      the consent form to read. Patients interested in enrolling will be screened and if eligible
      will be enrolled in the study. The screening visit and the baseline visit may occur on the
      same day. Patients enrolling will be instructed in self-administering Acthar 80 IU twice a
      week. Patients will keep an injection log which will be inspected at each visit (4, 8, and 12
      weeks). Ophthalmology data will be collected at each visit and recorded on the case report
      form by the ophthalmology technician working with the sub-investigator at the time of each
      visit. Patients will come to the Center for Clinical Studies each visit for blood draw, blood
      pressure recording, and recording of adverse events.
