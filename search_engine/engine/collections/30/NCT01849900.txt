      women 18-44 years old. Teams of nursing students and community health workers will administer
      the 12-month intervention. In addition to 10 home visits during which women will receive
      information on the female reproductive system and the expected monthly cyclical changes,
      PREKNOP will consist of use of ovulation test kits, a 12-month menstrual calendar, a digital
      thermometer, and educational brochures covering: the female reproductive anatomy, hormones
      and menstrual cycle, how to recognize ovulation period, various methods of birth control and
      how they work, and early pregnancy symptoms.
