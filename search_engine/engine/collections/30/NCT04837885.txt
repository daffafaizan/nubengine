      most limiting factors of patient survival. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with
      radiolabeled somatostatin analogs (SSA) such as LUTATHERA速 represents now a major therapeutic
      option. As far as these metastases are mainly perfused by the hepatic artery, it could be
      relevant to deliver the treatment by intra-hepatic route, in order to achieve a maximized
      dose to the tumour when compared with a systemic conventional administration, while also
      reducing kidney and bone marrow toxicity. By using radiolabeled SSA for imaging and therapy,
      the present project aims to compare the uptake of 68Ga-DOTA-peptides after intra-hepatic
      versus intravenous injections for targeted liver metastases, as well as for dose limiting
      organs (kidney, spleen, healthy liver, bone marrow) and extra-hepatic lesions if present. We
      will also evaluate whether the intra-hepatic infusion of one treatment dose of LUTATHERA速
      after conventional treatment by 4 intravenous administrations, is safe.

      Following 4 intravenous administrations of LUTATHERA速 in GEP-NET with dominant liver
      metastases, patients who gave informed consent will be enrolled for 2 PET-scans, the first
      one after intra-hepatic injection of 68Ga-DOTA-peptides and the second one after intravenous
      injection for purpose of uptake comparison by 5 liver metastases chosen by radiologists on
      MRI.

      In 10 patients who meet a predefined enhancement ratio of 3, a 5th dose of LUTATHERA速 will be
      administered by intra-arterial hepatic injection. (Based on literature data, an average
      enhancement ratio of 3.75 is expected from intra-arterial injection compared to intravenous
      results; Kratochwil 2010). Those 10 patients will be evaluated for 177Lu-DOTA-peptide
      activity and residence time by SPECT/CT imaging.

      Follow-up through 18 months will include clinical examination, MRI and CT scan, as usually
      performed in these clinical settings and progression
