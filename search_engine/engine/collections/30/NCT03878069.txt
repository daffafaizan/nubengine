    
      Patients with ADA-SCID who require treatment with Revcovi as Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)
      will be enrolled during a 24-month period and each will be followed for 24 months after
      starting Revcovi or until undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or
      hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSC-GT), whichever occurs first. Patients undergoing
      HSCT or HSC-GT will be followed one month after last Revcovi dose and again at six months to
      assess adverse events (AEs) and survival. Throughout the duration of the study, patients will
      be assessed continually for AEs.

      Patients/Parents/Caregivers will self-administer weekly intramuscular (IM) dose(s) of Revcovi
      and will be followed according to the Suggested Schedule of Assessments for trough dAXP and
      ADA activity. Treatment dosing and monitoring will be individualized per provider and patient
      characteristics in adherence with each study sites' standards of care.

      Participants in the STP-2279-002 trial will be given the opportunity to enroll in this
      registry study and proceed to the Treatment Month 6 Visit per the Suggested Schedule of
      Assessments for Adagen-Transitioning Patients.

      An interim analysis will be performed approximately two years after study initiation.
