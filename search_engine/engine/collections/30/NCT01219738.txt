      attacks. This practice is based on the fact that glucocorticosteroids by themselves do not
      cause rapid bronchodilation. However, the acute inhibition of adrenergic agonist disposal by
      the non-genomic action of glucocorticosteroids could lead to bronchial vasoconstriction by
      locally released norepinephrine thereby decongesting the airway wall, and potentiate the
      bronchodilator effect of a concomitantly administered beta-adrenergic agonist through the
      same mechanism. The purpose of this study is to assess the vasoconstrictive effects of single
      and repetitive high-dose budesonide inhalations in moderate to severe asthmatics who use
      inhaled glucocorticosteroids regularly. As a secondary endpoint, airway inflammation and
      airway function will also be measured with the expectation that acute improvements in airflow
      might be detectable as a result of airway decongestion, notably in subjects with moderately
      severe asthma who have lower baseline lung function.
