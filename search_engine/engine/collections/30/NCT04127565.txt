      was developed and general feasibility as well as impact on guideline adherence were
      evaluated. Feasibility and general safety were demonstrated. These results allowed stepwise
      implementation into medical routine care during a one year phase. During implementation
      positive effects on guideline adherence were found. Despite positive results there are many
      barriers that prevent implementation of research projects into routine medical care.
      Therefore, the current study evaluated and interpreted all steps and milestones from the
      research idea to implementation and evaluated them descriptively. Using a pre-post
      intervention analysis the systemic effects of the implementation on change in emergency
      medical resource utilization were analyzed. Resource utilization of physician staffed
      emergency medical service units was compared between a pre-implementation period (12 months,
      April 2013 - March 2014) and a post-implementation period (12 months, April 2015 - March
      2016). During the pre-implementation period only standard care was available.

      Inclusion criteria: All emergency medical service (EMS) missions in both periods.

      Data sources: Electronic health records of the EMS missions (data pseudonymity) and database
      of the regional EMS dispatch center.
