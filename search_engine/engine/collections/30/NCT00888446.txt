      antibodies at the time of vaccination on the safety and immunogenicity of tgAAC09. Since the
      prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV2 capsid is high (IAVI and Targeted
      Genetics, data on file), this protocol amendment adds Group G which is composed of volunteers
      who have documented pre-existing anti-AAV2 capsid neutralizing antibodies titers â‰¤ 1/8. This
      will assure that there are sufficient numbers of volunteers with and without antibodies for a
      useful comparison.
