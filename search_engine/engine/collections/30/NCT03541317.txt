    
      This study seeks to develop an effective and efficient sequence of implementation strategies
      for encouraging delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) by school professionals in
      high schools across Michigan. In the run-in phase, all schools will receive support and
      training from REP for three months. After three months, schools will be randomized to either
      (1) continue with REP; or (1) augment REP with a minimum of 12 weeks of coaching. Eight weeks
      after this first randomization, schools will be evaluated to determine whether they might
      also benefit from an augmentation of their current strategy with Facilitation. Schools that
      could benefit from facilitation (defined as delivering 3 or more CBT modules to less than 10
      students or reporting 3 or more organizational barriers to delivering CBT) will be
      re-randomized to either (1) continue with their current strategy (REP or REP + Coaching); or
      (2) have their current strategy augmented with facilitation. All implementation support will
      be discontinued 12 months after first randomization; outcomes will be assessed through 18
      months after study start.
