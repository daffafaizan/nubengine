      patients. The operation indication includes non-absorbed vitreous haemorrhage, dense bleeding
      in front of the macular, proliferative vitreoretinopathy traction macular, tractional retinal
      detachment combined break, severe progressive fiber vascular proliferation and vitreous
      haemorrhage combined with early iris neovascularization.

      Due to VEGF levels rise in vitreous cavity of PDR patients, some inflammatory cytokines
      involved in, make easy bleeding during surgery and heavier inflammatory reaction
      postoperation,thus affecting the curative effect of the operation.

      Ranibizumab as angiogenesis inhibitors, has widely applied in the treatment of age-related
      macular degeneration, won the recognition of ophthalmologists.

      Some scholars try to expand the application in diabetic macular edema, also obtained the good
      curative effect.Some scholars also applied the angiogenesis inhibitors to the diabetes
      retinopathy before surgery in the hope to reduce the occurrence of intraoperative
      bleeding.Compared with bevacizumab, the short half-life of lucentis, and thus reduce the
      inhibition of VEGF system risk.

      In this project, the investigators will inject lucentis into vitreous cavity before surgery
      of PDR, and observe the effect and complications of the operation, compared with
      triamcinolone acetonide group(the control group); At the same time the cytokines level of
      VEGF, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), Transforming
      Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin 6 (IL - 6) and interleukin 8 (IL - 8) will be
      detected before and after pretreatment with lucentis or triamcinolone acetonide, and the
      cytokines concentration change will be compared between two groups, the mechanism of PDR will
      be further clarified and theoretical basis for looking for treatment strategies will be a
      set.
