      assess the safety and efficacy of the iTind procedure at three to five years following
      treatment as demonstrated by reduction of symptoms measured by IPSS and QoL and improvement
      of functional parameters as measured by peak urinary flow and PVR. Sexual and erectile
      function will also be assessed alongside the incidence of any related late occurring adverse
      events.
