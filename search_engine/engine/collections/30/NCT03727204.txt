    
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a frequent and important complication to cardiac surgery. The
      pathophysiology is multifactorial, but renal functions in this setting is determined by a
      complex interplay between renal perfusion, fluid status, cardiac output, mean arterial
      pressure and back pressure to venous outflow.

      Renal perfusion may be quantified with novel ultrasound techniques. Ultrasonography of the
      kidney and renal vasculature allows for assessment of renal afferent flow and renal venous
      flow and, together with venous flow patterns of the portal vein and liver veins, may identify
      patients in risk of AKI.

      The study is observational and will describe the diagnostic accuracy of the ultrasound
      measures in predicting postoperative AKI. Patients will be examined with ultrasound of kidney
      and liver flow along with echocardiography on on the day before surgery and on the 1st and
      4th. In addition, patients are followed with markers of kidney function, fluid balance and
      invasive measures of mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure.
