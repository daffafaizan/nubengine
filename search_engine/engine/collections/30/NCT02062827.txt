      replication competent; that is, similar to G207, a first generation oHSV, it can replicate in
      tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this
      process. Replication of M032 in the tumor itself not only kills the infected tumor cells, but
      causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are
      released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the
      vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic
      activity, the virus carries a therapeutic payload--acting as a gene therapy vector, too--and
      causes the tumor cell to synthesize and secrete an immunity-stimulating protein called
      Interleukin-12 (IL-12) before it is killed. This IL-12 is released and promotes an immune
      response against surviving tumor cells, which increases the antitumor effect of the therapy.
      The IL-12 that is expressed can also produce an anti-angiogenic effect, by interfering with
      the production of new tumor blood vessels necessary to allow tumor growth. Anti-angiogenic
      therapies potentially starve the tumor of necessary oxygen and nutrients. Thus, the M032 oHSV
      produces three different potential mechanisms for antitumor effects. The virus has also been
      genetically-engineered to minimize the production of any toxic effects for the patient
      receiving the therapy.
