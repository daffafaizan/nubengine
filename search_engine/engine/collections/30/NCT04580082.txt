      mindfulness-based techniques through online lessons to combat loneliness, anxiety, and
      depression among people living with HIV who are over the age of 50 and enrolled in ADHOC
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04311554). The intervention consists of 14 mindfulness
      audio lessons, each approximately 20-minutes long. The mindfulness lessons are designed to
      develop three core skills: concentration (the ability to maintain focus on present-moment
      experiences), clarity (the ability to pinpoint exactly what you are experiencing in each
      moment), and equanimity (openness to experience).
