      function of the infarcted and uninfarcted myocardium. Remodelling begins minutes after acute
      myocardial infarction and may continue for months or years, leading to dilation of the left
      ventricle (LV) and an increased LV volume. As studies show, LV volume strongly correlates
      with long-term mortality. Reperfusion after a period of ischaemia (through medication or
      PTCA) leads to so-called 'reperfusion injury'. This results in myocardial dysfunction and
      damage, which can lead to LV remodelling.

      In a study where atorvastatin was administered at the onset of reperfusion infarct size was
      reduced. Atorvastatin led to protection of the reperfused myocardium, independently of its
      effects on cholesterol.

      The objective is to measure the effect of atorvastatin, administered orally before
      reperfusion therapy by PTCA, on infarct size and microvascular reperfusion.
