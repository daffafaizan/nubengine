    
      SC-43, has been shown to enhance the activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing
      phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), leading suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and tumor growth
      inhibition. SC-43 enhances SHP-1 activity by impairing the association between the N-SH2
      domain and the PTP domain of SHP-1, triggering a conformational change of SHP-1 and relieving
      its autoinhibition. SC-43 treatment leads to cancer cell death in multiple cancer cell lines.
      SC-43 also exhibits anti-cancer activity in a variety of nonclinical xenograft tumor models.
