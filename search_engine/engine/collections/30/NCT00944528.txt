      of acute toxicity and wound healing complications in three dose cohorts.

      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 8 patients starting at dose level 1 (15 Gy). If 2 or
      more dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed at dose level 1, the trial will be stopped
      for evaluation and consideration of revision. If at most one DLT is observed then escalation
      continues to the next dose level. The cohorts will escalate by 3Gy up to 21 Gy of
      irradiation.
