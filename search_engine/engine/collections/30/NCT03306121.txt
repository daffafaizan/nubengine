      DNAâ‰¥1500copies/ml are randomly assigned to receive TPF(paclitaxel
      liposome+cisplatin+5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      (investigational arm) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus PF (cisplatin+5-fluorouracil)
      adjuvant chemotherapy (control arm). Patients in both arms receive intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy(IMRT), and cisplatin (100mg/m2) every three weeks for three cycles during
      radiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive paclitaxel liposome (135mg/m2 on
      day 1), cisplatin (25mg/m2 on day 1-3) and 5-fluorouracil (750mg/m2 civ 120h) every three
      weeks for three cycles before the radiotherapy. Patients in the control arm receive adjuvant
      cisplatin (80mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000mg/m2 civ 96h) every four weeks for
      three cycles after the radiotherapy. The primary end point is progress-free survival (PFS).
      Secondary end points include overall survival(OS),locoregional failure-free survival(LRRFS),
      distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), overall response rates after treatments and toxic
      effects(short-term and long-term). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the
      intention-to-treat population.
