      myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, relapsed AML/MDS is the
      most significant single cause of treatment failure, and the majority of relapsed patients
      ultimately succumb. Alloreactive T cells in the donor graft can kill residual leukemia cells,
      mediating the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect. Consistent with this, recipients of T
      cell-depleted grafts have higher rates of relapse. GVL is more potent against chronic
      leukemias than acute myeloblastic diseases, and the higher incidence of relapse in patients
      with AML/MDS reflects a failure in GVL.

      The central goal of this pilot trial will be to explore whether IFN-γ in this setting is safe
      and whether it has the desired biological activities on malignant blasts in vivo. IFN-γ will
      be tested in relapsed patients as monotherapy and in conjunction with donor leukocyte
      infusions (DLI). The clinical and biological information from this study is essential to
      design a phase II trial with a therapeutic endpoint.

      Treatment will be initiated at 100mcg (almost equal to the dose of 50 mcg/m2 for an adult)
      three times a week, with the potential to deescalate the frequency of injection for
      unacceptable toxicity. To explore whether this dosing regimen is sufficient to activate
      myeloblasts, pre- and post-treatment bone marrow specimens will be harvested to analyze for
      IFN-γ action (upregulation of HLA class I; HLA class II, ICAM-1 and phosphorylation of
      STAT1). The primary safety concern is the development of GVHD, which is routinely monitored
      for all alloSCT patients.
