        1. Determine whether intensive lifestyle modification vs usual care reduces risk of T2D
           (primary endpoint) amongst South Asians with i. central obesity; ii. prediabetes and
           iii. overall (with central obesity and / or obesity).

        2. Investigate secondary endpoints, including health gains in family members. Identify
           social, demographic and environmental factors influencing primary and secondary
           endpoints.

        3. Carry out a health economic analysis of lifestyle modifications vs usual care for
           prevention of T2D on the Indian subcontinent and Europe. Quantify the cost-effectiveness
           of screening by waist circumference vs HbA1c.
