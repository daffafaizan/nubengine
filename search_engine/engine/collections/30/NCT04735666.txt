      defined in 5.4. of the current study protocol. Participants will be told to call whenever the
      slightest signs of the mentioned criteria are observed or in any case of unusual or suspect
      indisposition. If the call gives indication for CIED infection, adverse events or incidents
      the participant calling will be examined in the ward by a cardiologist or cardiac surgeon
      with expertise in rhythm surgery. Decision on presence of CIED infection, adverse event or
      other incident will be made according to the respective examination results and the clinical
      criteria defined.
