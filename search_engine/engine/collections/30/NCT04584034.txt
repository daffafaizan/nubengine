      wheezing (Matricaldi et al. 2008; Mallol at al. 2010; Martinez et al. 1995). Currently, there
      is no evidence to underpin the management of these children. National Belgian and Dutch
      primary care professional guidelines propose 'a trial of treatment' with short acting
      bronchodilators (i.e. salbutamol) for wheezing children below the age of six years and to
      evaluate treatment effect after 1 to 2 weeks, but convincing evidence is lacking (Chavasse et
      al. 2002).

      The effect of salbutamol has been studied well in children with proven asthma and is
      considered the first-line treatment in all patients in international asthma guidelines.
      However, trial findings of children with asthma are not applicable to primary care infants
      and young children with acute wheeze for several reasons; the anatomy and physiology in
      younger children differs significantly from those in older children and many infants and
      young children with an acute episode of wheezing do not experience further wheezing episodes
      later in life. As a result, it is at present unclear whether salbutamol inhalation therapy
      confers any benefit in young children who wheeze.

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of salbutamol inhalations (4x200Î¼g for 7
      days) versus placebo in children aged 6-24 months presenting to their primary care physician
      with wheezing.

      DESIGN: A primary care based, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel group
      trial in 40 general practices and community paediatric practices in Belgium and the
      Netherlands.
