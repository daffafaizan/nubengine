    
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. Compound 111427 was the first administration of
      compound 1278863A to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of single oral doses up to 300 mg in healthy adult subjects. This study,
      PHI112842, will be the first administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of repeat oral doses up to 300 mg for 14
      days in healthy adult subjects. At least 6 subjects will complete each cohort. Multiple blood
      samples for pharmacokinetic analyses will be obtained post-dose in each cohort. Safety will
      be assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse event
      assessments and laboratory safety tests. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacodynamic
      analyses.
