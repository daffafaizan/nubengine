      oil-in-water emulsion of vinorelbine tartrate composed of an oil phase and emulsifier
      dispersed in an aqueous solution. ADVENTRX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of San Diego, California,
      developed ANX-530 as a vinorelbine tartrate formulation to be used in clinical settings where
      Vinorelbine Tartrate Injection (NAVELBINE) is indicated. Nonclinical toxicology studies
      suggest either equivalent or less toxicity of ANX-530 compared to Reference Product. In
      particular, ANX-530 caused less vein toxicity in a rabbit vein irritation model, suggesting
      ANX-530 could potentially cause less venous irritation than NAVELBINE in a clinical setting.
      ADVENTRX is investigating whether ANX-530 could substitute for NAVELBINE in these settings.
