      or III multiple myeloma treated with arsenic trioxide. II. Determine the overall and
      relapse-free survival rates of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the safety
      profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks after the last treatment dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
