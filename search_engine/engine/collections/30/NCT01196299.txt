      serve as a prognostic marker in the evaluation and management of traumatic brain injury
      patients.

      Magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing (when possible) will be performed in the
      acute (within 10 days following injury), and recovery stages (about 1 month, about 6
      months,and about 18 months). The relationship between the advanced magnetic resonance imaging
      markers and the clinical condition of the patient will be evaluated at each time point to
      determine which combination of imaging markers best describe the current clinical status of
      the patient and which markers best predict a patient's outcome status.
