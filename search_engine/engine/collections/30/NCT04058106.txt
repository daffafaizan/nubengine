      effective site-controlled infusion (TCI). For this, TCI continuous infusion pump will be used
      with Schnider pharmacokinetic model for propofol and Minto pharmacokinetic model for
      remifentanil. Propofol and remifentanil will be initiated with target effective site
      concentrations of 3 Î¼g.ml-1 and 3 ng.ml-1, respectively, and controll these concentrations
      considering patient's consciousness loss and vital signs. And then 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium for
      muscle relaxation will be administered for intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained with BIS
      level 40-60 and vital signs will not be more than 20% of the baseline or less. In order to
      prevent the sudden movement of the patient during surgery, rocuronium will be infused
      continuously about 50% of TOF until the end of intraoperative neuromonitoring.
