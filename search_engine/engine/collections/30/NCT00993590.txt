      care visit or hospitalization in the last twelve months, will be recruited through their
      managed care organization (MCO). They will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms and
      will participate in a 12-month intervention plus a 12-month follow-up period. Subjects in the
      control group will receive a smartphone with internet access & text messaging service. These
      devices will provide the ability to collect smartphone use data electronically. The
      experimental group will also receive the same smartphone devices (with internet access and
      text messaging service and ability to collect usedata. In addition the experimental group
      will have access to the Mobile CHESS (M-CHESS) interface. The M-CHESS smartphone interface
      features an interactive, internet based asthma education program, peer support mechanisms and
      automated reminders for asthma control medicines and data collection.
