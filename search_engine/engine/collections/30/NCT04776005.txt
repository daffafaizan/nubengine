      The patients participating in this prospective cohort will benefit from all standard care
      his/her condition requires.

      Clinical and biological data will be collected as part of the usual follow-up. Clinical data:
      pathology, stage, treatment line, type of current treatment and date of the last treatment
      administered, previous treatments, radiotherapy, concept of radiation lung disease, history
      of pneumonectomy, comorbidities, performance status, history of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19).

      Laboratory data: pre-vaccination polynuclear neutrophil count, lymphocyte counts, plasma
      protein electrophoresis or Ig weight dosage (routine care in hematology), lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), albuminemia in the previous month.

      Vaccination data: type of vaccine, date of the 1st injection, date of the 2nd injection,

        -  Antibody levels

        -  Adverse effects related to vaccines

        -  Levels of the anti-S IgG antibodies in AU / ml
