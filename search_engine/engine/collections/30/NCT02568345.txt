      determine the minimum effective dose in 90% of patients (ED90).

      The following doses were chosen: 2.0 mg.kg-1, 2.2 mg.kg-1, 2.4 mg.kg-1, 2.6 mg.kg-1, 2.8
      mg.kg-1.

      The complete reversal of moderate rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB) considered
      a T4/T1 ratio â‰¥ 0.9 with the peripheral nerve stimulator and accelerometer (monitor of
      sequential electric stimuli) "train-of-four" (TOF).

      After induction of general anesthesia and the calibration of the peripheral nerve stimulator
      and accelerometer, rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1 was injected.

      Continuous intravenous infusion of the anesthetics propofol and remifentanil, and
      intermittent bolus of rocuronium were offered throughout the procedure.
