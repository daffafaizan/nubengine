      in elderly patients below 80 years of age. The value of plasma BNP assays as diagnostic tools
      has not been determined in very elderly populations because the plasma BNP increases with
      age. This large, multicenter, prospective, observational, study in 300 participants is aimed
      to prospectively test the usefulness of measuring plasma BNP for diagnosis of HF in dyspneic
      patients aged 80 and older.
