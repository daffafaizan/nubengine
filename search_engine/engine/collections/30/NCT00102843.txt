      However, it remains uncertain whether homocysteine per se, low status of folate, or other
      factors related to methionine metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
      disease. Previous studies have shown that a high concentration of homocysteine in blood is
      related to an impaired vascular function in the arteries, an indicator of cardiovascular
      disease risk. Virtually all intervention trials used folic acid as a homocysteine-lowering
      agent, which may however affect vascular function through mechanisms not related to
      homocysteine. We investigated whether lowering of fasting homocysteine concentrations via
      supplementation with betaine or folic acid improves vascular function in healthy volunteers,
      in order to distinguish between effects of folic acid and of homocysteine-lowering per se.

      Comparison: We compare the effects of supplementation with folic acid to the effects of
      betaine, and to the effects of a placebo on plasma homocysteine concentrations and vascular
      function in healthy humans.
