      morbidity and mortality in several of the world's tropical and subtropical regions. The
      rDEN2/4delta30(ME) vaccine is a live attenuated dengue virus vaccine that may be protective
      against dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN2). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of the rDEN2/4delta30(ME) vaccine in healthy adults.

      This study will last approximately 5 to 7 months with 25 study visits. Participants will be
      randomly assigned into one of two cohorts. Participants in Cohort 1 will receive an injection
      of rDEN2/4delta30(ME) or placebo vaccine at Days 0 and 180. Participants in Cohort 2 will
      receive an injection of rDEN2/4delta30(ME) or placebo vaccine at Days 0 and 120. Participants
      will be asked to record their temperature in a diary for 16 days after each vaccination. At
      each study visit a physical examination, symptom history, and blood and urine collection will
      occur.
