      Health System (UPHS) CHF clinic, PennChart (electronic medical record system) resources for
      identifying eligible patients, and the Way to Health (WTH) platform to launch a pilot study
      that will inform a randomized controlled trial; (2) to evaluate the feasibility of the
      enrollment processes and intervention roll-out to inform a randomized controlled trial; (3)
      to estimate the readmission rate of participants; and, (4) to assess if and how managing
      physicians respond to weight gain alerts entered into participant charts in PennChart. In
      this pilot study, no randomization will occur and all participants will receive the
      intervention.
