      under the control of electrocardiography (ECG), the correct position of the PICC catheter tip
      will be subsequently verified X-ray imaging.

      Conducting this study should allow us to see the feasibility of using real-time ECG
      navigation, its accuracy comparing to the chest X-ray method. Â´ The second goal is to
      eliminate chest X-ray as an obsolete method, Also the advantages and disadvantages of both
      methods will be assessed.
