      risk for serious morbidity and mortality. In order to provide oxygen during the apneic
      period, it is common practice to provide pre-oxygenation prior to the start of the procedure
      with high flows of oxygen. Different methods of pre-oxygenation have been studied by taking a
      single breath end-tidal oxygen (EtO2) measurement with higher levels indicating more complete
      pre-oxygenation. However, there has not been any research examining methods of determining
      the quality of pre-oxygenation in real time. This study examines the performance of a nasal
      cannula EtO2 measurement as compared to the gold standard of single breath end-tidal oxygen
      measurements in healthy volunteers.
