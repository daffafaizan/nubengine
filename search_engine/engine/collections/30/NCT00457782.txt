      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or B-cell Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma who have no established therapeutic alternatives. Up to 42 patients will be enrolled
      at up to six investigational sites over a period of approximately 12 months until an MTD is
      reached. An additional 12 patients may be enrolled at the MTD in an expanded cohort of one or
      more of the eligible conditions.
