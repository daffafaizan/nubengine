      oral high-dose Vitamin D (VD) is planned for either 3, 4 or 5 weeks; patients will be
      sequentially enrolled into 3 groups (A, B or C respectively) in a manner such that no more
      than two patients may have treatment-limiting toxicities (TLTs).

      After the group with the optimal duration of VD therapy to achieve a "favorable response" is
      determined, phase II will begin enrollment.

      Patients must be scheduled to have surgery performed within 2- weeks of the last dose of VD.
