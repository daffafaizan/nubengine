      participants (n=10) will all participate in a tele-yoga class using an iPad loaned to them by
      the study. They will attend this treatment session from the comfort of their home or a
      location of their choice. Yoga treatment will last 12 weeks. At the end of treatment,
      veterans will provide feedback by completing a satisfaction questionnaire to rate various
      aspects of the teleyoga (e.g. technical challenges, ability to perform yoga through the
      video-conferencing platform, problems that occurred, and recommendations to improve the
      class, etc). The teleyoga protocol will be modified on the basis of this feedback and will be
      tested on a second group of participants (n=10). The second phase of the study will involve
      randomization of a further group of participants (n=30) to either the teleyoga developed in
      phase one, or in-person yoga.
