      Primary end point:

      Need of transfusion post-op (yes/no, how many)

      Patient will be transfused if :

      Hg < 80 g/L plus if patient is symptomatic: orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia (pulse>
      100/min, hypotension (< 90/60), hx : CVA, CAD)

      Secondary end point:

        1. Efficacy (during hospital stay)

             -  Pre-op and post-op Hg (> 100; 80-100; <80)

             -  Hemovac blood drainage (ml)

             -  Per operative bleeding (ml)

        2. Safety (Follow up: 6wks, 6 ms, 12 ms, 24 ms)

             -  Post-op complications: infection, pain, oedema, allergic reaction.

             -  Functional outcomes: Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster
