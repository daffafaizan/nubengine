    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD are usually treated with steroids and/or antibiotics.
      Currently this conventional therapy has significant side effects including osteoporosis,
      cataracts and suppression of the immune system (from the steroids) and increasing bacterial
      resistance and other side effects from the use of antibiotics. During an acute exacerbation
      of COPD, the inflammation in the airways increases.

      AQX-1125 represents a new type drug that based current data is thought decrease the
      inflammatory process and therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of
      COPD.
