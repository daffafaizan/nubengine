    
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective Registry to be conducted at a minimum of 12
      study centers. Approximately 150 patients with severe emphysema undergoing Zephyr Valve
      treatment will be enrolled and followed out to 3 years. Assessments will be performed at
      45-days, 6-months, 12-months, 24-months and 36-months post-procedure.

      Patients prescribed the Zephyr Valve treatment will be consented and will be enrolled only
      after determination of little to no collateral ventilation between target and ipsilateral
      lobes. Safety and effectiveness of the Zephyr Valve treatment will be evaluated
      post-treatment based on data collected out to 3-years post-treatment.
