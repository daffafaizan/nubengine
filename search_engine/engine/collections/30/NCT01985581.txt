      (EF) (Findling et al, 2009; Hale et al. 2011), little has been documented about the effect of
      INTUNIV extended release on EF in children. The manifestation of clinical symptoms related to
      impairment in EF often leads to the search for additional treatment options and in many cases
      to adjunct therapies to the traditional stimulant medication treatment regimen. Demonstrating
      that the addition of INTUNIV extended release to usual stimulant therapy is effective for
      symptom control as well as in improving EF may influence clinical treatment algorithms and
      the need for health care resources to effectively manage patients. Since EF deficits
      negatively impact academic achievement and behavior at school and because children spend a
      large number of daytime hours at school, the concordance of any reported improvement in the
      school and the home environment will be examined. Overall improvement in quality of life with
      the addition of INTUNIV extended release will also be evaluated.
