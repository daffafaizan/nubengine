      the hemodynamic stability provided by our study drugs during laryngoscopy and intubation in a
      patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In addition to that this study will assess
      the perioperative complication and postoperative recovery in these patients. Laparoscopy has
      now become the standard technique of choice for cholecystectomy which results in
      pathophysiological changes characterized by an increase in arterial pressure and heart rate
      (HR). Many types of research have been done in an attempt to minimize adverse effects by
      adding adjuvants to the conventional method of general anesthesia. Our research is also based
      on this aim. The objective of this study to determine the hemodynamic stability during
      laryngoscopy and intubation, peri-operative complication and post-operative recovery. The
      patients will be divided into two groups randomly and will be given the desired drugs via
      intravenous line by on floor consultant anesthetist who will be blinded to the drug. The
      study subjects' hemodynamics will be observed until 10 minutes of intubation. Any
      perioperative complication will be noted. The subjects will also be followed postoperatively
      in recovery to check there sedation score and recovery (Aldrete score) will be noted after 10
      minutes after the patient shifted to recovery.
