      mass index (BMI)-matched male controls will be participated in this cross-sectional study.
      Functional performance will be assessed by 6-minute walking distance (in meter). The Foot and
      Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) will be used for the assessment of the symptoms and the functional
      limitations of the foot and ankle. The health-related quality of life of the subjects will be
      evaluated with Short Form-36 (SF-36). Subjects' talar cartilage, tibialis anterior and
      gastrocnemius muscle thickness measurements will be performed using musculoskeletal
      ultrasound.
