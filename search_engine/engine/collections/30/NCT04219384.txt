      there are important differences in population characteristics and aetiology. The National
      Cardiac Arrest Audit (NCAA) was established to audit resuscitation teams in response to IHCA,
      and collects information about patient characteristics, resuscitation processes, and patient
      outcomes. However, it does not audit IHCAs that are not attended by the resuscitation team.

      Critically ill patients managed in ICUs are experiencing failure of one or more organs and
      therefore more intensive and invasive therapies are needed to support these failing organs.
      As a result, ICUs have higher nursing and medical staffing ratios, and monitoring is usually
      continuous. Moreover, the skill mix of the multidisciplinary team is geared to advanced life
      support. Thus, the risk of cardiac arrest occurring, the involvement (or not) of the
      resuscitation team, and the probability of return of spontaneous circulation are all likely
      to be different to other IHCAs.

      Accurate data on cardiac arrests in ICU are lacking and the investigators do not know how
      many IHCA occur in ICU in the UK, nor is the impact of an IHCA in ICU on outcome known. In
      addition, it is not known if these IHCAs in ICUs represent an unavoidable consequence of
      critical illness or, more importantly, whether they can be predicted and/or prevented.

      CIRCA is a prospective, multi-centre observational cohort study nested in the Case Mix
      Programme (CMP) and NCAA national clinical audits. The investigators aim to determine the
      incidence and outcomes of IHCA in UK ICUs and explore associated risk factors with ICU and
      hospital survival and quality of survival following hospital discharge.
