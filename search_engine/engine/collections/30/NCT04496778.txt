      up of three domains. First, a neuro-psychological domain encompassing those deficits of
      cognitive function such as amnesia (memory loss), aphasia (language disturbance), apraxia
      (the inability to carry out motor tasks despite intact motor functions) and agnosia (the
      inability to recognize people or objects despite intact sensory functions). Second, a group
      of psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disturbances, which have been termed neuro-psychiatric
      features, non-cognitive phenomena, or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
      Alzheimer's disease is substantially increased among people aged 65 years or more, with a
      progressive decline in memory, thinking, language and learning capacity. Alzheimer's disease
      should be differentiated from normal age-related decline in cognitive function, which is more
      gradual and associated with less disability. Diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and
      dyslipidemia have all been found to increase risk as well a history of brain trauma,
      cerebrovascular disease, and vasculopathies.

      Dementia affects approximately 5%-8% of individuals over age 65, 15%- 20% of individuals over
      age 75, and 25%-50% of individuals over age 85. Alzheimer disease is the most common
      dementia, accounting for 50%-75% of the total, with a greater proportion in the higher age
      ranges Dementia is expensive. The financial costs of managing Alzheimer's disease are
      enormous. The cost of illness is high in terms of both public and private resources. Families
      and caregivers who are required to provide care and patients affected by dementia also pay a
      high price in terms of their quality of life The primary goals of treatment are to maximize
      the patient's ability to function in daily life, maintain quality of life, slow the
      progression of symptoms, and treat depression or disruptive behaviors Low level laser therapy
      is a safe, non-invasive, and non-thermal modality that is based on a strong body of research
      dating back to the 1960.It involved in treating several conditions, the mechanisms of action
      involve the stimulation of mitochondria by the absorption of photons in cytochrome c oxidase,
      resulting in increased adenosine triphosphate production, reduced oxidative stress,
      anti-inflammatory effects, and increased focal cerebral blood flow
