      metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol) that have been shown to reduce mortality in heart
      failure patients with systolic dysfunction, with recommended target doses. However, Pharmacy
      Benefits Management (PBM) data indicate that prescribing for beta-blockers in heart failure
      patients that is not in accordance with guidelines is substantial, both in terms of the agent
      selected and the dose. Sites will be recruited and randomized to two different intensities of
      intervention to promote adherence to guidelines.
