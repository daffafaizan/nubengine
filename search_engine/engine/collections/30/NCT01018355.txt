      labour this connection often closes. About 10-15 % these connections remains open. This
      phenomenon is called patent foramen ovale or PFO, and is in most cases unsymptomatic.

      The prevalence of PFO in patients with crytogenic (without known causes) stroke is much
      higher (about 40%)than the general population (about 10%). This has led to the theory that
      the presence of PFO can lead to stroke, by the passage of emboli from the peripheral venous
      circulation through the PFO to the brain by right-to-left shunting of the blood.

      There are no existing data from prospective randomized studies focusing on the effect of
      device closure PFO in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Some observational retrospective
      studies have shown a beneficial effect in the reduction of recurrent stoke in patients
      younger that 50 years with cryptogenic stroke when PFO has been closed with a percutaneous
      device closure(PCD). Some studies have reported an 0% to 3.4% annual recurrence rate of
      stroke or TIA in patients treated with PDC. The recurrence rate of stroke or TIA in patients
      with crytogenic stroke or TIA in ordinary antithrombotic treatment is about 5-15 %.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether percutaneous device closure of
      patent foramen ovale is superior to conventional antithrombotic treatment in preventing
      stroke recurrence in elderly patients above 50 years of age.
