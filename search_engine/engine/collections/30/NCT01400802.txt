    
      The aim of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of two insulin analog mixtures: Listro
      Mix75/25® and Humalog Mix75/25® in healthy subjects based on the pharmacokinetic parameter
      (PK)AUC (INS-LIS 0-20h) and the pharmacodynamic parameter (PD)AUC (GIR 0-20h) and also assess
      the safety and local tolerability of the two insulin preparations.
