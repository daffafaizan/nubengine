    
      A prospective observational clinical study to be conducted in Hospital Israelita Albert
      Einstein, a large open-access, private tertiary referral center.

      Consecutive eligible patients with suspected post OLT biliary complications referred to
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) will be considered to SpyGlass as
      follows.

      In those patients with confirmed biliary stricture, SpyGlass direct choledochoscopy will be
      performed prior to endoscopic treatment with stents.

      After final stent removal, choledochoscopy will be repeated to evaluate biliary ductal
      mucosa.
