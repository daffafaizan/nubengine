      mortality, and confers an increasing risk of stent thrombosis even when dual antiplatelet
      therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) is administered. Recently, we demonstrated that patients
      with severe CKD or end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) exhibited higher
      platelet reactivity to clopidogrel than did those with normal renal function. One of good
      option to overcome high platelet reactivity in ESRD patients would be ticagrelor which has
      been already shown improved clinical outcomes. But little is known the antiplatelet effects
      of ticagrelor in ESRD patients on HD. The present study was designed to determine the
      antiplatelet effect as well as the onset and offset action of ticagrelor compared with
      clopidogrel in patients with ESRD undergoing maintenance HD.
