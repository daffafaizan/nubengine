    
      This Phase 1 study is comprised of dose escalation and cohort expansions for FPT155
      monotherapy and for FPT155 in combination with pembrolizumab. Monotherapy dose escalation is
      designed with initial accelerated titration followed by a standard 3+3 dose escalation;
      combination dose escalation uses a standard 3+3 design. Patients will remain on study
      treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other specified reason for
      discontinuation.
