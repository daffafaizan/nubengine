      migraine without aura patients. Apart from migraine without aura patients healthy female
      controls are also included as a control group. Over the course of a single day these females
      (migraineurs and healthy controls) were scanned three times on fixed time slots: before GTN
      infusion (baseline), 90 minutes and 270 minutes after start of GTN infusion. Scans are
      acquired on a 7 tesla scanner (Philips, Cleveland, USA) on software release 3 using a 32
      channel receive array using single-volume proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS)
      with a volume of interest in the visual cortex glutamate, in which glutamate, GABA and other
      metabolites will be assessed. The primary endpoint; glutamate level changes towards the
      pre-ictal and ictal state with other metabolite (e.g. glutamine and GABA) changes as
      secondary endpoints.
