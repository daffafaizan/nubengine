    
      The Consulta CRT-D is an investigational bi-ventricular device that provides atrial and
      ventricular tachyarrhythmia detection and therapy, cardioversion, defibrillation and cardiac
      resynchronization therapy.

      The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter clinical study, conducted in
      approximately 18 centers.

      To allow for sufficient experience with the device, a maximum of 80 subjects may be implanted
      with the Consulta device. Data will be collected at baseline (enrollment), implant, 1-, 3-,
      and 6- months post implant and every 6 months thereafter or until study closure (whichever
      occurs first), unscheduled follow-up visits, System Modifications, Technical Observations,
      Study Deviations, Study Exit, upon notification of new or updated Adverse Events and in case
      of death.
