      treat. The co occurrence of the two disorders leads to greater severity and worse long-term
      outcome, including suicide. Although a number of treatment strategies have been implemented
      for depressed patients with alcohol dependence the controversy concerning best treatment
      options for those patients persists.

      The clinical relationship between depression and alcohol dependence suggests some common
      mechanism underlying both disorders. It has been hypothesized that medications that block
      presynaptic nAChR may be effective in the treatment of alcoholism and depression.
      Mecamylamine (Inversine Â®) is a noncompetitive, high affinity nAChR antagonist with low
      selectivity for the alpha-7 receptor. Mecamylamine has never been investigated as an
      effective adjunct treatment for dually diagnosed patients with depression and alcohol
      dependence. Methods: Thirty participants with a current diagnosis of depression and alcohol
      dependence will be recruited for this 12-week treatment study. Fifteen participants will be
      randomized to mecamylamine and fifteen to placebo. Participants will be included in the study
      if: they meet current DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression and Alcohol Dependence and have
      been on a stable SSRI dose for 2 weeks. All participants will come weekly to take their
      medications and complete weekly assessments. Weekly assessments will consist of questioners
      that will assess depressive symptoms and alcohol consumption over the entire treatment
      period. Significance: This study is the first to evaluate the efficacy of mecamylamine as an
      augmenting agent for treatment of depression and alcohol dependence.
