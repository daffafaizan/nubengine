      Primary

        -  Define the molecular and biochemical profiles of airway epithelium of smokers with no
           disease, smokers with airflow obstruction and abnormal sputum cytology, and non-smokers.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the occurrence of abnormalities in non-smokers, smokers with no disease, smokers
           with various grades of dysplasia, and smokers with lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker) and
      disease (no disease vs airflow obstruction and abnormal sputum cytology vs various grades of
      dysplasia vs lung cancer).

      Biological samples are collected and analyzed for future research studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study.
