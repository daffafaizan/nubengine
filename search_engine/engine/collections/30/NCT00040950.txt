        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of subcutaneous and IV CpG 7909 when administered
           with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of CpG 7909. Patients are sequentially
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group A: Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-5 hours followed by CpG 7909 IV over 2
           hours on day 1. Courses repeat weekly for 4 weeks.

        -  Group B: Patients receive rituximab as above followed by CpG 7909 subcutaneously on day
           1. Courses repeat weekly for 4 weeks.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CpG 7909 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-48 patients (3-24 per treatment group) will be accrued for
      this study.
