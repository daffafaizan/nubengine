      nasal process (MNP) and maxillary process (MXP) during embryonic development. Alveoloplasty
      may be classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary depending on the age of the patient.
      Literature defines primary when the alveoloplasty is performed at the same time as soft
      tissue repair. If performed at the age of 8 to 9 years before the eruption of the permanent
      canine, it is classified as secondary; it is classified as late secondary or tertiary if
      performed in the elderly. For patients with cleft lip and palate, secondary alveolar bone
      grafting (SABG) of the cleft alveolar ridge is performed when the patient has mixed
      dentition; SABG is a procedure that aims to create a bony bridge that restores dental arch
      continuity, repair the oronasal fistula, provide support to the structure of the alar base,
      facilitate subsequent orthodontic treatment, and promote tooth eruption. Autologous bone
      grafting is the gold standard for treating alveolar clefts, with the iliac crest bone being
      the most widely accepted donor site. Other materials such as growth factors, combinations of
      improved scaffolds and cell treatment/growth factors, biocomposites, and hemostatic agents
      can be used to regenerate bone and have been the subjects of intensive research.
