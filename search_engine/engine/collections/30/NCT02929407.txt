    
      The trial aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of IV FE 204205 in cirrhotic
      patients with portal hypertension and was planned in 2 parts:

      Part 1 of the trial was open-label where six subjects were planned to receive three ascending
      doses of FE 204205, given as infusion over 2 hours on three consecutive days.

      Part 2 was planned as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind investigation evaluating
      the effects of a single dose of FE 204205 on portal haemodynamics in 20 subjects who would
      have received either the maximum tolerated dose (as defined in Part 1) of FE 204205 (n=16) or
      placebo (n=4).
