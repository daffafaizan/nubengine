    
      PROMISE is a 2 year post-authorization study of patients taking adalimumab for Psoriasis.
      Patients who volunteer to participate will be asked to provide information about their
      medical history and experiences with adalimumab. No study specific testing will be performed.
      Patients will be asked to provide data on their experiences with adalimumab approximately
      every 6 months, or as determined by the study doctor. No drug will be provided as a result of
      participation in the registry. All treatment decisions are independent of participation in
      the registry. A total of 547 subjects were enrolled: 532 in the ITT population were analyzed
      for efficacy (excluding 15 for lack of follow-up visits (n=8), non-fulfillment of the
      criteria of moderate to severe PS (n=6) and failure to initiate treatment at the baseline
      visit (n=1)); 542 were analyzed for safety (excluding 5 due to lack of evaluable safety
      data).
