      collaborative effort among seven centers across the US with the goal of reaching 10 sites
      globally. PRIME explores all aspects of advanced peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and
      critical limb ischemia (CLI) care including the collection of comprehensive clinical,
      diagnostic, procedural, and follow-up data for three years following an index endovascular
      procedure. Data collection activities began in January of 2013 with the goal of collecting
      data on 1500 subjects. Analysis of this multi-site registry will produce generalizable
      findings that describe the clinical epidemiology and management practices of advanced PAD and
      CLI patients.
