    
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying fluorine F18-EF5 and fludeoxyglucose F18 positron
      emission tomography in assessing hypoxia and glycolysis in patients with stage I, stage II,
      or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.Detailed DescriptionOBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether there is an association between Akt activation and hypoxia as
      determine by 18F-EF5 PET scanning in patients with NSCLC.

      II. To determine whether there is an association between Akt activation and increased
      glycolysis as determined by 18F-FDG PET imaging in patients with NSCLC.

      OUTLINE: Within 6 weeks prior to surgery, patients undergo fluorine F18 (18F)-EF5 PET at 10
      minutes and 90 minutes after injection of 18F-EF5. Patients also undergo fludeoxyglucose F18
      (18F-FDG) PET at 1 hour and 3 hours after injection of 18FFDG.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
