    
      This is a Phase â…¢, randomized, blinded, and active controlled study of SYN023 compared with a
      China licensed HRIG for PEP of patients who have been confirmed to have met all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for their treatment group.

      1000 patients aged 18 and above with WHO Category III rabies exposure should be enrolled as
      planned and randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group based on a
      ratio of 3: 1 through on-site stratification as part of PEP.

      All subjects should receive wound infiltration injection of SYN023 or HRIG on Study Day 0
      (wound conditions should be described and recorded before injection, including diameter,
      depth, expansion treatment, etc.), and should also simultaneously receive intramuscular
      injection of one dose of the freeze-dried rabies vaccine for human use (Vero cells) into the
      deltoid muscle. In accordance with the Essen Scheme, each subject also needs to receive one
      dose of the freeze-dried rabies vaccine for human use (Vero cells) on Study Days 3, 7, 14,
      and 28 respectively.

      3.0 mL of venous blood samples should be collected 8 times from each subject prior to
      administration and on Study Day 3, 7, 14, 42, 98, 182, and 364 post administration of study
      drug. Relevant information should be collected from the subjects through follow-up visits,
      such as occurrence of rabies and survival conditions.

      RVNA should be assayed through rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT).

      Local adverse events related to the SYN023 injection sites and injection sites of the first
      dose and second dose of rabies vaccine, and systemic adverse events (AE) other than injection
      sites should be collected within 7 days after administration; local adverse events related to
      the injection sites of the third dose, fourth dose and fifth dose of rabies vaccine, and
      systemic adverse events (AE) other than the injection sites should be collected 7 days after
      administration. In addition, all adverse events occurring within 42 days after administration
      should be collected, and pregnancy conditions in 6 months after administration and all
      serious adverse events (SAE) occurring during the study period should be collected.
