      be randomized into 2 groups. In the experimental arm, patients receive DA induction regimen
      with intermediate dose of cytarabine at at a dose of 100mg/㎡/d on day 1-4 and 1g/㎡/Q12h on
      day5-7. In the control arm, patients receive DA regimen with standard dose of cytarabine at a
      dose of 100mg/㎡/d on day 1-7. Patients receive consolidation therapy containing high-dose
      cytarabine after achieved complete remission. Stem-cell transplantation is permitted for
      patients with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. The efficacy of induction therapy
      containing intermediate dose of cytarabine is evaluated and adverse events associated with
      treatment are recorded.The primary end point is overall survival.
