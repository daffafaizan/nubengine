    
      The IMMEDIATE study is a multi-centre, randomized controlled, open-label, two-phase
      cross-over study evaluating the effectiveness of a flash glucose monitor device to increase
      the proportion of time spent in target glucose range (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) among adults with
      type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with non-insulin antihyperglycemic therapy compared
      to a control group not using a flash glucose monitor device. The study will consist of two
      phases; each 16 weeks long. In Phase 1, study participants who meet eligibility criteria will
      be randomized to receive a flash glucose monitor device combined with diabetes
      self-management education, or diabetes self-management education alone. In Phase 2,
      participants initially assigned to receive education alone will crossover to receive a flash
      glucose monitor device while participants initially using the flash glucose monitor will
      continue using their device. No diabetes self-management education will be provided during
      Phase 2.
