      patients with diabetes develop kidney disease. The benefits of omega-3 fatty acids have been
      shown in animal models of kidney injury. Mechanistic studies of omega-3 fatty acid
      supplements support biological plausibility: omega-3 supplements have been shown to improve
      vascular reactivity, lower oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and have beneficial effects
      on the metabolism of eicosanoids favoring synthesis of vasodilatory prostaglandins and
      thromboxanes. However, in spite of overwhelming evidence for a potential benefit of dietary
      omega-3 fatty acids at preventing or slowing progression of kidney disease for adults with
      NIDDM, clinical trials providing evidence to support recommendations of supplementation are
      lacking.

      The current recommendation for omega-3 intake for adults, one gram/day of DHA+EPA, is based
      on evidence for cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) reduction. Whether omega-3 fatty acid
      prevents or slows progression of diabetic kidney disease, whether the current recommended
      dose is adequate to modify disease, or whether a higher dose should be recommended, needs to
      be determined.

      In this setting, we propose to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over clinical
      trial to determine the effects of a daily dose of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (4.0
      g/day) compared with placebo on urine protein excretion and biomarkers of kidney injury and
      function in adults with diabetes and proteinuria.
