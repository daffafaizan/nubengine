      patients with COVID-19. There are no studies in the literature evaluating the effectiveness
      of telerehabilitation program after COVID-19. In particular, the importance of the first
      eight weeks after the disease was emphasized.

      It is thought that the telerehabilitation program will improve the functional capacities and
      quality of life of patients in order to adapt to the daily life after the infection more
      easily, to cope with the symptoms brought about by the disease more easily and to prevent the
      respiratory distress, intensive care stay and inactivity due to muscle weakness.
