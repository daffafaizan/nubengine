      analgesia in the treatment of long bone fractures. The traditional pain control regimen
      following fracture fixation typically involves a course of narcotics on an as-needed basis
      for pain relief. Recent data has shown that adding NSAIDS to the pain regimen as part of a
      bimodal approach to pain control, improves the efficacy of pain management and reduces
      narcotic use. Laboratory research on NSAIDs as it pertains to bone healing, however, has
      shown in animal models that there may be a positive association between NSAIDS and non-union
      rates. In other words, NSAIDS may prevent or delay bone healing. These results, however, have
      not been tested prospectively in humans.

      The purpose of this study is to look at the combination of NSAIDS and narcotics post long
      bone fracture and monitor the effects on narcotic use and healing rates to ultimately and
      conclusively establish the risk or benefit of NSAIDS after long bone fracture.
