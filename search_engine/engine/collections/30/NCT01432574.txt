      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine immunogenicity in men, aged 27-45 years, in which the men will
      receive Gardasil. Gardasil was administered at 0, 2, and 6 months. Blood was drawn at 0 and 7
      months to provide a quadrivalent HPV antibody serologic profile. Participants also completed
      surveys via computer-assisted interviews (CASI) at Day 1 and Month 7 to record sexual
      behavior.

      Our overall goal is to test the efficacy of Gardasil to reduce HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 persistent
      infection among men at the external genital epithelium, anal canal, and oral cavity, and to
      reduce lesions caused by these HPV types at the external genital epithelium and anal canal.
      The purpose of this Phase II trial is to establish the immunogenicity of Gardasil among
      mid-adult men and to establish the infrastructure with which to build the larger Phase III
      trial in the future.
