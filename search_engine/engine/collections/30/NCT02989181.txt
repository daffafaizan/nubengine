      patients with heart failure (HF), and is associated with poor prognosis in these individuals.

      Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common type of cardiomyopathy and is defined as the
      presence of the left ventricle dilatation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction without
      concurrent valvular or coronary artery disease. Its etiology is unclear, but a genetic
      component is present in at least 25% of cases. In younger individuals, the etiology is more
      heterogeneous, where a rare type of cardiomyopathy may occur in women in connection with
      pregnancy, s.c. peripartum cardiomyopathy. Other underlying causes include alcohol, drugs,
      pharmaceuticals, endocrine disorders, systemic diseases and general muscle. These factors
      account for approximately half the cases of DCM in younger and other half designated as
      idiopathic (IDCM).

      The relationship between cardiomyopathies and OSA is insufficiently studied so far. In a
      smaller population of 20 individuals with DCM, sleep apnea (OSA or CSA) had 16, ie 80% of
      patients. The first-line treatment of OSA is continues positive pressure breathing mask
      (CPAP) during sleep in patients with daytime sleepiness. Effect of CPAP therapy in patients
      with DCM and OSA is completely unknown, because many of them do not report daytime
      sleepiness. The fact that patients with heart failure and reduced pumping function usually
      have symptoms of including fatigue, it becomes difficult to distinguish what is fatigue due
      to heart failure and what is related to sleep apnea. Interpretation of the Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS) is thus difficult and possibly unsure why all patients with DCM and OSA will be
      randomized to treatment with CPAP.
