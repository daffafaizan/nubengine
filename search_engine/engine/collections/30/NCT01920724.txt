      (TBW) content was calculated. Then, fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) was calculated.

      Weight and height of all children were using a standard technique. Body mass index and
      nutritional status was calculated using World Health Organization (WHO) growth standard for
      children 0-5 years.

      Dietary intake of children was assessed using 2 non-consecutive 24 hour dietary recalls. The
      1st and 2nd recall was about 2 weeks apart. Nutrient intake was calculated using the
      INMUCAL-Nutrients WD. 4.0 (Institute of Nutrition, 2010).
