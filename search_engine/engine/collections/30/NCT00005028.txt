    
      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the onset, duration, and degree of response in patients with hormone-refractory,
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with paclitaxel and bryostatin 1.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the overall
      survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1
      hour on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.
