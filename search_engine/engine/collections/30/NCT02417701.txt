    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the overall response rate of the TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor sapanisertib (MLN0128
      [TAK-228]) in stage IV squamous cell lung cancers or KRAS mutant lung cancers harboring
      NFE2L2 or KEAP1 mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the median progression free survival of patients in each cohort. II. To
      explore the feasibility of performing reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) in paired
      snap-frozen core biopsies from patients in this study prior to MLN0128 (TAK-228) dosing and
      during week 2 of treatment.

      III. To describe the effectiveness of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in suppressing activation of mTOR and
      PI3K signaling through the exploratory RPPA analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
