      infertility. Prior studies have shown a variety of health benefits with bariatric surgery,
      including an improvement/resolution in diabetes and a significant improvement in serum
      testosterone levels. Based upon preliminary data from the literature, the investigators
      hypothesize that bariatric surgery is associated with a transient decrease followed by a
      robust long-term improvement in semen parameters including DNA fragmentation and oxidative
      stress. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose a prospective observational study
      examining changes in hormone and semen parameters over the 12 months following Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass surgery. The investigators will correlate these changes to weight loss,
      changes in subjective sexual function, and advanced semen parameters including DNA
      fragmentation. If successful, this study will conclusively identify a new modifiable cause
      for male infertility and suggest an additional medical indication for bariatric surgery in
      obese infertile men.
