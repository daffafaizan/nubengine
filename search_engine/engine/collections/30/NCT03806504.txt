      progression of thromboembolism obstructing pulmonary arteries as an organized tissue.
      Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a treatment option for chronic thromboembolic
      pulmonary disease. However, PTE is associated with specific postoperative complications, such
      as pulmonary edema and right ventricular failure due to reperfusion injury, with a
      significant mortality rate of 7% to 24%. Some strategies have been proposed to reduce lung
      injury after PTE, such as rectification maneuvers and high PEEP. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effect of intraoperative lung protection high PEEP maneuver in patients
      undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy for ischemic reperfusion injury.
