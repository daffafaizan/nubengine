      States. It has become a major nuisance in school children resulting in many lost school days
      and frustrated parents. Lice and nit resistance to current OTC products is being widely
      reported. Compliance with product instructions is thought to be low. Therefore a safe and
      effective alternative to these products is desirable.

      Spinosad (the active ingredient in NatrOVA) and its formulations have been approved as
      agricultural insecticides in the US, Canada and Australia, and has received provisional
      approval in the UK, Spain and several other European Union countries.

      Spinosad is being formulated into a creme rinse product (NatrOVA) using excipients that are
      widely used and are "generally regarded as safe" (GRAS)

      This study is intended to measure the absorption (or lack thereof) of Spinosad through the
      scalp of infants aged 6 to 24 months, as well as to observe any adverse events related to use
      of the study drug. A validated method for determining the levels of Spinosad in plasma will
      be utilized.
