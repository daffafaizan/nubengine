      social and emotional capacities of older adults. (1) These losses will contribute to increase
      the risk of falling, so much that most falls occur during the performance of a dual-task (DT)
      (2).

      The lack of balance, strength and poor body composition are seen as causes of falls, and
      should therefore be considered in the prevention programs of these events in older adults.
      (3-5) A psychomotor exercise program uses the body and movement as mediators, relying on the
      prevention of cognitive, sensory, perceptive, emotional and affective deterioration,
      exploring the neuroplasticity. (6,7) Therefore, this sensorimotor and neurocognitive program
      may prevent falls, but it is important to analyze its real impact in reducing either falls or
      the risk factors for falls in the older adults. No studies focusing on this subject were
      found.

      The intervention through the whole body vibration (WBV) is referred in the literature as
      promoting the improvement of balance, mobility and agility, and preventing falls in the older
      adults.(8,9) WBV will have long-term therapeutic effects promoting the increase of muscle
      strength and increased bone mineral density. (10) Being two intervention methods with
      potential good results on falls prevention, it is not known whether there will be additional
      benefits in an intervention that combines both methods.
