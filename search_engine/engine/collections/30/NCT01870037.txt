    
      This is a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the safety and activity of
      2 escalating doses of hMaxi-K gene transfer by direct injection into the bladder wall in
      female participants with OAB/DO.

      The safety parameters to be monitored include: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms, and physical examinations.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of multiple intramuscular injections of
      hMaxi-K compared to the control group. Efficacy parameters that will be evaluated are: number
      of micturitions per 24 hours, volume per micturition, incontinence episodes, pad weight
      measurement of accidental bladder leaks, uninhibited contractions during cystoscopy and other
      cystoscopic evaluations, and general and bladder-specific quality of life assessments (Kings
      Health Questionnaire, SF-12 Health Survey, and International Consultation on Incontinence
      Questionnaire [ICIQ-SF]).
