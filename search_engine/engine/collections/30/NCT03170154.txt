      Clareon IOL. Subjects attended 7 study visits over a period of approximately 13 months,
      including 1 preoperative screening visit (Visit 0), 1 operative visit (Visit 00), and 5
      postoperative visits (Visits 1-5). Visit day calculations for Visits 1-5 were based off of
      the day of surgery (Visit 00). Primary endpoint data was collected at the final visit (Month
      12). Some sites/subjects participated in a Rotational Stability sub-study. For the non-study
      eye, the investigator followed standard of care regarding the follow-up, surgery, and
      intraocular lens choice (as applicable). The non-study eye (fellow eye) was not implanted
      with the Clareon IOL.
