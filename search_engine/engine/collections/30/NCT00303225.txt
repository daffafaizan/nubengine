      World Health Organization declared the global eradication of smallpox which was achieved
      through a surveillance and vaccination program using live virus vaccine. In spite of its
      eradication, the deliberate use of smallpox as a bioterrorist agent remains a threat. While
      there is an effective vaccine, there have been concerns regarding vaccine complications which
      have prevented universal vaccination in the absence of disease exposure. In addition, in the
      event of a smallpox outbreak vaccination may be ineffective in immunocompromised individuals
      and in those who were exposed to the virus more than 3 days prior to vaccination. Antiviral
      therapy may be able to supplement a vaccine, however, there are limitations of the currently
      available drug options. SIGA-246 is an oral medication that has been shown to be highly
      active against variola virus and has demonstrated safety in animal models. The primary
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SIGA-246 at various doses
      with a secondary objective of evaluating the pharmacokinetics of the drug. To achieve these
      objectives, 30 healthy volunteers will be enrolled into one of three dosing groups (500 mg,
      1000 mg, or 2000 mg) to receive an oral, single dose of SIGA-246 or placebo. In each of the
      three ascending dosing groups there will be 8 active drug recipients and 2 placebo
      recipients. Safety of the study agents will be assessed by history, physical, and laboratory
      evaluations. Pharmacokinetic endpoints include C(max), T(max), t(1/2), AUC, CI and urinary
      excretion. Urine will be collected in 3 8-hour intervals and serial blood samples will be
      obtained after study agent administration.
