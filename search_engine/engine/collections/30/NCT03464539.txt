      Valentino Vascular Screening Project (SVVSP). Sixty patients with history of colonic
      diverticulitis (CD) and occult obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) were recruited. All
      subjects were following a Standard Management (SM) protocol consisting of diet and lifestyle
      modifications, and were freely choosing to be treated with polyglucosamine (PG) or to follow
      the SM only. Two groups of 30 cases each were formed and followed for 3 months.

      Diet was controlled three times (baseline and during the first and third month), through the
      Food Intake Assessment (FIA) which consisted of the weekly analysis of 25 different servings
      (e,g fruits, vegetables, pulses, first dish, meat, processed meat, cheese). The lifestyle
      modification consisted of physical exercise (9 MET (Metabolic Equivalents) -h/week of brisk
      walking) and oral hygiene.

      The main variable was OGIB, that was measured using Hemoccult Sensa Fecal Occult Blood
      Procedure.

      Ancillary variables where the hs-CRP (high sensitivity C Ractive Protein) and the daily
      gastrointestinal discomfort (GID) measured thorough a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to
      10.

      All variables were taken at baseline, after one and three months with the exception of GID
      that was measured also after one week of treatment.
