      young adults. Common treatment options are surgical excision or, more recently, CT-guided
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA). RFA is less invasive, but it still requires drilling from the
      skin through muscle and soft tissue into bone. It also exposes the patient and operator to
      ionizing radiation.

      Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) provides precise and
      controlled delivery of focused ultrasound energy inside a lesion using an external
      applicator, without the need for a scalpel or needle. MR-HIFU has been successfully used to
      treat painful bone metastases in adult clinical trials and one recent report suggests that it
      can also be used to treat OO.

      MR-HIFU ablation of OO may provide a better alternative to surgical resection or RFA as it is
      completely non-invasive and does not require ionizing radiation. These two qualities of
      MR-HIFU are especially beneficial in growing children and young adults. Furthermore, MR-HIFU
      OO ablation is quick, with expected total procedure time of less than two hours. Such short
      treatments offer additional safety benefits from reduced anesthesia / sedation requirement
      compared to surgery and RFA
