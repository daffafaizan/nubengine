      to ongoing patient difficulties. Severe acute pain after surgery is one of major risk factors
      for developing persistent postsurgical pain. Subsequent physiological stress caused by this
      severe pain may negatively influence the immune response leading to a worse prognosis.

      Regional anesthesia is very effective in management of peri- and postoperative pain. Epidural
      block, paravertebral block and intercostal nerve blocks have been proven over time to be
      effective in preventing postoperative pain. However, their widespread use has been hampered
      by technical difficulty and inherent risks.

      Unlike the aforementioned blocks, novel thoracic wall blocks, namely modified pectoralis
      block (PECS II) and pecto-intercostal fascial block (PIFB) are safe, simple and effective.

      Efforts to prolong and improve analgesia following single shot blocks has led to the
      introduction of adjuvants into the local anesthetic. Dexmetomidine is a superselective Alpha
      2 agonist with a proven ability to prolong the duration of neuraxial, peripheral nerve and
      interfascial plane blocks.

      Chronic inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for initiation, progression and further
      spread of malignant growth. Surgical insult leads to inflammatory response which facilitates
      the development of a metastatic disease. Many inflammatory markers were proven to be
      independent prognostic factors in breast cancer patients.

      The investigators propose to study the impact of novel thoracic wall blocks with
      dexmetomidine on simple inflammatory markers obtained from full blood count (NLR, PLR, NPR,
      PDW, MPV, RDW) after breast cancer surgery.
