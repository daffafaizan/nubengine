    
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multisystemic disease, also affecting
      extrahepatic organs (1,2,6). According to former data, not only the prevalence of chronic
      hepatic disease, chronic cardiovascular diseases, but also the prevalence of chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) is higher in NAFLD (4,7). A strong association has been shown between diabetes
      mellitus (DM) and NAFLD as well (3,5,10).

      Many genetical factors have been studied in the background of NAFLD. Many studies have proved
      the effect of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 gene (PNPLA3) (8,9).
      Effect of numerous genetical polymorphisms has been suggested behind oxidative stress
      responsible for NAFLD (8).
