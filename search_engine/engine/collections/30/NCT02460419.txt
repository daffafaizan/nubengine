      palliative chemotherapy with taxol,cisplatin and capecitabine. After disease controlled, they
      will be randomly assigned to maintenance capecitabine plus best supportive care(BSC) or BSC
      alone. The primary end point is progression-free survival, the secondary end points are
      overall survival, duration of response, objective response rate, adverse effects and quality
      of life.
