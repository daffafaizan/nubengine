      treat patients suffering from Calcified Aortic Stenosis. CARDIAWAVE's Valvosoft device is a
      new ultrasound therapy based on a disruptive technology involving delivering an extremely
      precise and focused ultrasound beam to perform a reparative effect on the aortic valve
      leaflets, softening the valve's tissues, restoring leaflet mobility, and therefore improving
      the overall clinical status related to the aortic valve stenosis. This is a FIM study
