      surgical treatment or endovascular treatment. They will be followed for at least 2 years and
      up to 4 years and 2 months after treatment to primarily assess survival and major adverse
      limb events in the index or treated limb, and secondarily, to determine clinical and cost
      effectiveness outcomes after treatment. These outcomes (survival-free of major limb events
      and clinical, functional and cost effectiveness) will be compared within two cohorts of
      subjects: those with an available single-segment great saphenous vein, and those with an
      alternative conduit. The null hypotheses for both cohorts is that there will be no difference
      in MALE-free survival between best endovascular therapy and best surgical therapy.
