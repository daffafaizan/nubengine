      of oat bran (40g per day) in lowering cholesterol, glucose profile and anthropometric
      parameters of subjects in secondary prevention, evaluate the quality of the diet and the
      intake of processed foods and ingredients added.

      Methods: A randomized block, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial lasting 90 days.
      Inclusion criteria: individuals aged greater than 20 years, both genders, with LDL-c equal or
      higher than 130mg/dL fasting lipemia. Eligible individuals were considered using oral
      lipid-lowering, since the dose reported in the early nutritional intervention was maintained
      during the study. Exclusion criteria: patients requiring reduction in daily fluid intake,
      supplement use in dietary fiber and gestation / lactation. Data collected: gender; age;
      education; drugs; body mass (BM), height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC),
      neck circumference (NC); blood pressure; dietary surveys, total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C,
      HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), triglycerides (TG), fasting glucose (GLU), fasting insulin (INS),
      HOMA-IR and QUICK. The diet quality was evaluated at baseline and end of study through the
      Diet Quality Index Revised (IQD-R). The sample size calculation was performed from a pilot
      study. It came to the need for 63 subjects for each group, oat bran group (GFAV) and placebo
      group (GPL). The level of statistical significance was 5% (p <0.05).
