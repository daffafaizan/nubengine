      and biological endpoints (PMP22 mRNA, skin biopsy histology and plasma biomarkers) will be
      assessed. Standard laboratory tests and drug plasma concentrations will also be measured.
      Because of the slow progression of the disease and the nature of the observed symptoms, a
      minimum duration of 12 months of treatment is required in order to observe a potential
      improvement in any of the efficacy parameters.
