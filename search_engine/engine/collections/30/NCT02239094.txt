      episode of major depression.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), recordings of brain electrical
      activity (EEG), and psychological testing to explore possible predictors of lurasidone
      treatment response will be conducted. Blood samples will be collected for a future study of
      blood protein predictors of response. After testing, participants will receive an open-label
      8-week trial of lurasidone (Latudaâ„¢) at approved dosage levels. Participants who attain
      remission of their major depressive episode will be eligible for a six-month continuation
      phase to explore predictors of sustained response to continuation treatment. Data analyses
      will use statistical testing to explore potential biological predictors of lurasidone
      response. This will provide a framework for clarifying which patients are best suited to this
      treatment and begin to develop a model for precision treatment of this difficult-to-treat
      disorder.
