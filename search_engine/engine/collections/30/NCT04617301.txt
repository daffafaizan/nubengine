      the axial classification of root resorptions using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).

      A total of 43 teeth of external cervical resorption (ECR) (n=27), external replacement
      resorption (ERR) (n=4) and internal root resorption (IRR) (n=12) were identified from 34
      patients. The volume of resorption and total tooth, the widest lengths of these resorptions,
      and the amount of thinnest dentin thickness around them were measured and compared according
      to age and sex. Additionally, the eight regional axial classification was performed and the
      percentages in these regions were evaluated. Significance was set at p=0.05 for statistical
      analysis.

      More accurate management of resorption can be achieved thanks to the three-dimensions
      volumetric and linear analysis, and the axial classification presented in this study.
