    
      This is a prospective, multi-centre, trial designed to investigate the he feasibility and
      efficacy of microwave radiometry thermometry for non-invasive diagnosis of CLI in diabetic
      patients with tissue loss. The study included 80 patients, equally divided in four groups.
      Group N: normal subjects; group DN: diabetic patients with verified neuropathic ulcers
      without vascular involvement; group DC: diabetic patients with CLI and group NDC:
      non-diabetic patients with CLI. All patients underwent MWR with the RTM -01-RES device
      (University of Bolton, UK) to record the mean internal tissue temperature of the foot. MWR is
      based on the principle that the intensity of radiation is proportional to tissue temperature.
      The specific device is not commercially available and has been developed to detect
      temperatures from internal tissues at microwave frequencies. Foot temperature measurements
      were performed as near as possible at the site of ulceration in patients of groups DN, DC and
      NDC and in various sites in subjects of control group N.
