      pragmatic effectiveness trial to test whether self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) is
      superior to nurse-administered sedative therapy in day-to-day intensive care unit (ICU)
      practice. This efficacy trial is powered for the investigators primary, clinically relevant
      endpoints (anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and delirium presence), and examines
      patient outcomes adversely affected by sedative administration practices, such as prolonged
      ICU stays, altered mental status, and diminished post-ICU quality of life. This randomized
      clinical trial with a total of 190 mechanically ventilated patients enrolled and maintained
      on protocol will address the following Specific Aims.

      The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of SMST compared to nurse-administered sedative
      therapy on anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and presence of delirium in
      mechanically ventilated patients (MVPs).

      The secondary aim is to compare level of arousal and sedative exposure in mechanically
      ventilated patients (MVPs) randomized to SMST to those MVPs receiving nurse-administered
      sedative therapy. The investigators hypothesize that SMST patients will be easily arousable,
      more alert, and exposed to less sedation than those who receive nurse-administered sedative
      therapy.

      Exploratory aims are to compare post-ICU outcomes (physical/functional status, psychological
      well-being, and health-related quality of life) and recall of ICU experiences between MVPs
      randomized to SMST and those receiving nurse-administered sedative therapy.
