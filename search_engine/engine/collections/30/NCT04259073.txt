      hundred thirty eight participants were included, with American Society of Anesthesiologists
      physical status classification of I to II, with pregnancies of at least 36 weeks of gestation
      who were scheduled for elective caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. One hour before
      induction of anaesthesia participants received a capsule containing sugar placebo (placebo
      group), pregabalin 150 mg or pregabalin 300 mg. Data related to surgical history,
      pre-existing medical problems, indications for cesarean and peroperative hemodynamic changes
      were analyzed. The primary outcome was first analgesic request. Secondary outcomes included
      maternal pain scores at rest and during movement, rescue analgesics consumption, sedation,
      nausea, vomiting, pruritus and Apgar scores. All maternal secondary outcome variables were
      recorded 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after delivery. Common side effects linked to
      pregabalin such as somnolence, blurred or abnormal vision, or fetal distress were collected.
