      China, an effort that will involve implementation of novel exposure assessment methodologies
      simultaneously with the ability to execute key surrogate outcome measures of importance in
      cardiovascular risk with CM diseases. In Aim 2, the association between functional
      cardiovascular risk variables [insulin sensitivity, Blood Pressure, endothelial function] and
      acute and sub-acute variations in personal black carbon and ambient particulate matter 2.5
      levels among 50 individuals with the chronic cardiometabolic syndrome will be investigated.
      In Aim 3, the investigators will examine potential biologic pathways of importance in the
      proposed functional outcomes. Specifically the investigators will determine the association
      between ambient particulate matter 2.5 levels and alterations in adipocytokines/inflammatory
      variables and autonomic nervous system balance.
