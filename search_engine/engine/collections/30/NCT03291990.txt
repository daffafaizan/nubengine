      in clinical trials, and across the United States one year survival is reported in the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry to be only 35%. Radiation
      treatment related lymphopenia has been associated with poor tumor outcome in Glioblastoma and
      a variety of other tumor types. As this lymphopenias is prolonged, it may also reduce
      efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor lymphocyte mediated immune therapies now approved by the
      FDA for an increasing number of indications. Modeling and clinical studies suggest that
      administering radiation over 5 or fewer days (rather than standard 30 days of treatment) may
      reduce the incidence of lymphopenia.
