    
      This is a Fleming-A' Hern, single arm, multicenter, no-profit, phase II study of radiotherapy
      and Vismodegib in adult patients with high risk or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma not
      amenable to radical surgery cell carcinoma (BCC) (comparator: not applicable).

      The recruitment period is expected to be approximately 24 months. The trial will consist of a
      Screening/Baseline period (Day -28 to -1), a Treatment Period when patients will be treated
      with radiotherapy (4 weeks) followed by Vismodegib 150 mg/die continuously for six cycles (24
      weeks).

      The study will end 14 months after start of treatment of the last patient enrolled and
      evaluable according to primary end point.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the activity of the study therapy (radiotherapy followed
      by six cycles of Vismodegib 150 mg/d continuously) in terms of proportion of patients
      progression free at 12 months.

      The secondary objectives are: to evaluate the efficacy of the study therapy in terms of
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); to assess the response in terms of
      overall response rate (ORR) (complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
      (SD), progressive disease (PD)); to assess duration of response (DoR); to assess the safety
      in terms of incidence, type, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events
      (SAEs) ;to measure the effects of skin disease on quality of life (QoL) of patients under
      therapy (Skindex-16)
