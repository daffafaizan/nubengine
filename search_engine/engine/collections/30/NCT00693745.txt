    
      Approximately 200 adults presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) / hospital with acutely
      decompensated HF will be enrolled. EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples will be collected for
      measurement of blood NGAL levels (using the Triage NGAL Test) at the point of care in all
      subjects at up to 8 different time points from presentation until discharge.

      The results of these NGAL assessments will be blinded to the medical team during the study
      and will not impact the medical management of the subject.

      Blood samples for unblinded assessment of both serum creatinine (analyzed at the hospital's
      laboratory) and whole blood BNP (analyzed with the Triage BNP Test at the point-of-care or
      laboratory) will also be obtained at some of the same time points.

      Dialysis, emergent outpatient visits for HF, hospitalizations and mortality will be recorded
      through Day 30 and Day 90. If an additional serum creatinine has been obtained as standard
      care near Day 30, it will also be recorded.
