      nontoxic and effective in long-term use. However, previous studies in both adults and
      children have shown that 3TC combined with AZT reduced HIV load in blood and increased white
      blood cells. Additionally, 3TC has demonstrated a favorable safety profile.

      Patients are randomized to receive oral 3TC/AZT, ddI/AZT, or ddI alone for at least 24
      months. PER AMENDMENT 4/29/96: NOTE: Randomization to ZDV+ddI arm was terminated in Spring of
      1996 based upon the results of ACTG 152. Patients on that arm will continue on blinded study
      drug and will be followed until the end of the study.
