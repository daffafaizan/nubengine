    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated doses of tremelimumab
      (administered intravenously every 12 weeks) and CP- 870,893 (administered intravenously every
      3 weeks).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I To seek preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of tremelimumab and
      CP-870,893, including objective response rate at MTD.

      II. To determine the immune pharmacodynamic changes associated with the administration of the
      combination of tremelimumab and CP-870,893.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 and CD40 agonist monoclonal
      antibody CP-870,893 IV over 30 minutes on days 2, 22, 43, and 64. Treatment repeats every 12
      weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
