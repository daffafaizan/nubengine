      organs, peritoneal lavage will be performed followed by immunological examination. After
      performing the surgical intervention, the patient will undergo intraoperative intra-abdominal
      chemotherapy with mitomycin C. Further, lavage of the abdominal cavity will be repeated,
      followed by immunological examination.

      In the control group (40 patients), after laparotomy and revision, peritoneal lavage will
      also be performed, followed by immunological examination. Patients of this group will not
      receive intraoperative intra-abdominal chemotherapy. After performing the surgical
      intervention, the patient will perform irrigation of the abdominal cavity with physiological
      saline. Further, lavage of the abdominal cavity will be repeated, followed by immunological
      examination.
