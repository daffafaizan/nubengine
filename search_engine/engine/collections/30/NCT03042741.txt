      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial in men and women with baseline
      waist diameter over 90 and 80 cm respectively. The effect of V6 will be assessed by changes
      in lipid profile, i.e., LDL, HDL, TG and TC; anthropomorphic indices, i.e., circumference of
      waist, mid-arm, and hips; arterial blood pressure and fasting glucose levels at baseline
      versus post-treatment timepoint.
