    
      This study includes a screening visit with several assessments, followed by an open-label
      medication trial of Allopregnanolone for 12 weeks and an end-point evaluation to assess for
      changes. Assessments include blood draws for genetic and safety laboratory testing,
      neurological and physical exam and medical history, cognitive testing, and motor testing.

      Study record was updated in October 2018 to include adverse events and outcome measure
      reporting. Study record was updated in November 2018 in response to requests to (1) specify
      time frame of reported outcome measures, (2) clarify that the RASS was a safety monitoring
      tool, not a prespecified outcome measure, and as such will not be reported as an outcome
      measure, and (3) upload a version of the study protocol and statistical analysis plan with
      the required title page and statistical analysis plan information.
