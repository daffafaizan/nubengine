      depressive symptoms and cognitive function, and a website to deliver pre-recorded mindfulness
      sessions. The clinical trial will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy with
      respect to depressive and cognitive symptoms, in a population of older adults at least 65
      years of age with a current, active major depressive episode. This online, internet-delivered
      mindfulness meditation course is termed "Mindful My Way", consisting of 10 approximately
      one-hour classes consisting of mindfulness content (e.g., meditations) that a participant can
      watch on his or her computer or mobile device.

      Assessment measures include a baseline diagnostic and screening assessment conducted by
      phone, plus:

        -  Pre-mindfulness and post-mindfulness : (a) (1) 4 weeks of cognitive testing delivered
           via app (brief game-like tests delivered up to 4 times daily); and (2) 4 weeks of
           depressive symptom surveys (8 depressive symptoms delivered 4 times daily) end of study,
           (b) a MADRS via phone interview (brief clinical interview of depressive symptom
           severity).

        -  During the mindfulness class: questions on participant preferences in order to evaluate
           the feasibility and acceptability of the mindfulness course, delivered via app.

      All of these remote smartphone-based assessment techniques have been previously used in Wash
      U IRB-approved studies. (IRB # 201612089, IRB # 201709118).
