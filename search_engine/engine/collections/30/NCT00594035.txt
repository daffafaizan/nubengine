      spinal cord. If the dural incision is not properly repaired and watertight closure is not
      achieved cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can escape presenting a risk for significant morbidity.
      The most frequent complication of CSF leak is recurring headache complicated with symptoms of
      nausea and vomiting. Furthermore fluid collection under skin prevents proper wound healing
      and may lead to wound breakdown and infection of the incision or both. Persistent CSF leak
      has also been associated with the development of cerebellar hemorrhage and subdural hematoma.
      Primary repair and watertight closure are paramount to minimizing risk and sequelae
      associated with CSF leak.
