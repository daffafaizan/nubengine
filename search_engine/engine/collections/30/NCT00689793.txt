           several studies pointed out the high prevalence of iron deficiency after a blood
           donation. Furthermore, some clinical trials showed that non-anaemic women with
           unexplained fatigue may benefit from iron supplementation.

        -  The purpose of this study is to determine the subjective response of iron substitution
           (TardyferonÂ®) on fatigue in women blood donors with a mean serum ferritin < 30ng/ml and
           to assess variation of ferritin and hemoglobin after a blood donation.

        -  We will measure blood count, ferritin level and C-reactive protein at the time of the
           blood donation and then after a week, a month and 3 months.

      A week after the blood donation, donors with a ferritin level <30 ng/ml and hemoglobin >
      120g/l (non anaemic) will be included in the study and randomised. A one-month iron treatment
      vs placebo will be introduced. To assess the subjective response on fatigue, the donors will
      fill in different questionnaires at the time of the blood donation and then after a week, a
      month and 3 months.
