      inward air leak decreasing its effectiveness. We assume that noninvasive ventilation could
      cancel the effect of the leak.

      We planned an experimental study with healthy volunteers (residents in anesthesiology).

      Healthy volunteers are randomised in cross-over between preoxygenation through spontaeous
      breathing or noninvasive ventilation pressure support preoxygenation in the presence or
      absence of a calibrated leak on the inspiratory circuit. The inspiratory fraction of oxygen
      is 100%. The exhaled gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide) are monitored.The subjects breathed
      through a mouthpiece (with a nose clip) connected to an anesthetic ventilator.

      The primary endpoint is the time to achieve end expiratory fraction of oxygene of 90% or
      more.

      The secondary endpoint is the proportion of subject with end expiratory fraction of oxygen of
      90% or more after a 3 min period (recommended in clinical guidelines).
