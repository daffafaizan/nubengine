      with women of color most vulnerable to their detrimental effects. Individually focused
      interventions have not demonstrated lasting success, possibly due to the lack of focus on
      sustainable social and physical environment factors. Health Is Power (HIP) was a
      transcultural, community based, randomized controlled trial that investigated the
      effectiveness of a group cohesion intervention to increase physical activity in African
      American and Hispanic or Latina women in Houston and Austin, Texas and then tested whether
      women living in more supportive areas maintained their physical activity over time.
      Intervention development was guided by group dynamics principles anchored within an ecologic
      model. Women participated in three health assessments and a six month face to face
      intervention that included evidence-based behavioral methods - integrated into strategies to
      promote group cohesion - framed to account for environmental factors contributing to health
      disparities. Women participated in team building activities, environmental mapping exercises,
      and supervised walks or taste tests. Neighborhood contextual and environmental measures were
      measured to test ecologic factors that may contribute to behavioral maintenance.
