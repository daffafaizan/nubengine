      groups from newborn to adolescence in order to prevent the anxiety and movement of the
      patients during the imaging. It was aimed to compare the capnograph and pulse oximeter used
      for early detection of hypoxia in patient follow-up and to monitor the depth of sedation with
      the sedation score in the recovery room.
