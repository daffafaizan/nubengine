      transgender individuals already enrolled in CCTG 595 will be offered participation in the
      sub-study at Week 24 of the main study. All subjects enrolled into the sub-study will be
      provided Vitamin D 4000 IU/day supplements in addition to their PrEP at Weeks 24 and 36;
      clinic visits will proceed normally per main study protocol. Upon completion of the sub-study
      subjects will continue on the main study.

      The primary endpoint, bone turnover markers, will be measured from Week 24 to Week 48 via
      plasma samples collected through the main study. Concurrent controls who are not enrolled in
      the vitamin D substudy who are reporting supplementation with < 400 IU of vitamin D/day will
      be matched 1:1 by randomization arm in the CCTG 595 main study (text messaging arm vs.
      standard of care), age (± 5 years), race/ethnicity, season of study entry, and BMI (± 3
      kg/m2).
