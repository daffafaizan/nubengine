      prosthetic titanium ribs (VEPTR©, Synthes GmbH®) to stimulate thoracic and spinal growth.
      With these implants children's symptoms and conditions can be slowed, halted or even
      reversed. Because of the dynamic character of the deformity and the growth of the children,
      the implants have to be lengthened about every half a year. With each operation there is a
      small risk of infection, which might increase with number of previous surgeries. Implant
      associated infections are often not clinical apparent and only found in microbiological
      analysis. To objectify the infection rate, identify potential precursors of infections and
      the relevance of asymptomatic infections in children with these implants a prospective study
      is conducted.
