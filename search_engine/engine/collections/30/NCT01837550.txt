      Education is widely regarded as an integral part of rehabilitation, but the effect of the
      delivery method of an educational program on the experience of hearing problems has rarely
      been investigated in controlled trials. Internet as a complement to aural rehabilitation has
      been tested in different studies with promising results. Though, until now not applied
      clinically as a part of an aural rehabilitation, focusing on hearing aid users with
      persistent self- reported hearing problems.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an internet-based aural
      rehabilitation for hearing aid users from a clinical population.

      Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention
      group followed a five-week program that consisted of reading material, home training
      assignments, online and telephone interaction with an audiologist, and participation in a
      discussion forum. The control group only had access to reading material.

      The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale (HADS) and the Communication Strategies Scale (CSS) were used to measure the outcomes
      of this study; and were recorded before and directly after the intervention as well as 6
      months post-intervention.
