      with inhaled nitrix oxide. In this clinical trial investigators will randomized patients to
      receive inhaled nitric oxide or sham (nitrogen + oxygen) for 24 hours. Patients must have a
      submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and evidence of right ventricular (RV) heart dysfunction.
      Investigators hypothesize that the administration of inhaled NO + oxygen to patients with
      severe submassive PE will improve RV function, reduce RV strain and necrosis and improve
      dyspnea (difficulty breathing) more than sham oxygen treatment.
