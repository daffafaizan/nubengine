      dose of nonradiolabeled AHN-12 (from 0.20 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg). If a favorable biodistribution
      is not achieved and the patient remains negative for HAMA, the infusion may be repeated up to
      two more times (with a one level increase in nonradiolabeled AHN-12 each time) in an attempt
      of achieving favorable biodistribution.

      In order to achieve the primary objective of identifying the optimal nonradiolabeled dose of
      AHN-12 antibody for all patients, if the first patient at the current antibody dose does not
      achieve favorable biodistribution, the next patient(s) will be treated at the next higher
      dose level.

      Patients achieving favorable biodistribution and remaining negative for HAMA will be eligible
      for the therapeutic component of this trial. Those not meeting these requirements will be
      taken off study and followed.
