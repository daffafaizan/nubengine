      catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation and endoscopy. If any signs of esophageal injury are
      seen on endoscopy the patients will be treated with omeprazole and sucralfate and they will
      have repeat endoscopy in two weeks. Patients who do not have any esophageal injury will be
      contacted by telephone in two weeks to be assessed for GI symptoms.

      Specific Aims: The specific aims of the study are to:

        1. Assess the incidence of visible transmural esophageal injury following extensive
           ablation in the posterior left atrium as measured by endoscopy1

        2. Assess whether early detection of esophageal injury by endoscopy and treatment will
           prevent development of more serious injury such as left atrial-esophageal fistula

        3. Identify predictors of esophageal injury. In particular, to assess if esophageal
           temperature rises during ablation correlate with development of esophageal injury and if
           the absence of esophageal temperature rise during ablation correlate with the absence of
           esophageal injury.
