      tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia from June 2013 to April 2014. A total of 55 patients
      had previously received standard triple therapy and/or sequential therapy in the period from
      2011 to 2014 and failed to eradicate the infection. The rescue treatment was given for ten
      days consisting of levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, and
      esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily. Urea-breath-test (UBT) was done at a minimum of 6 weeks after
      completion of the treatment to confirm the H. pylori eradication. Compliance and tolerability
      of the regimen were also assessed.
