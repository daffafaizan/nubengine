    
      2nd International Survey on Interventional Strategies is a web-based platform.

      The survey contains specific questions and dedicated case presentations on two major topics.

      The first part queries the characteristics of the participants, including overall experience
      in interventional cardiology, annual volume of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and
      duration of experience with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA), intravascular ultrasound
      (IVUS),optical coherence tomography (OCT), fractional flow reserve (FFR) and non-hyperaemic
      pressure ratios (NHPR). The survey uses here predefined categories and single-choice
      questions.

      The second part investigates personal strategies for evaluating angiographically intermediate
      stenoses in the catheterization laboratory. Here, participants are asked to evaluate 5
      complete coronary angiograms. All cases are characterised as stable angina without relevant
      changes on resting ECG. No information about non-invasive testing is known or provided.

      Here participants are asked to (1) localise all relevant stenoses by indicating the involved
      segment; (2) define percent diameter stenosis (%DS) by visual estimate; and (3) determine the
      significance of the stenosis of interest. In cases of angiographic uncertainty, the preferred
      diagnostic tool is asked to be selected from the arsenal available in the catheterisation
      laboratory, namely QCA, IVUS, OCT, FFR or NHPR. Participants are asked to make their
      decisions assuming ideal world conditions, without considering any financial restrictions or
      local regulations, but only after the best clinical practice achievable in this virtual
      catheterisation laboratory.
