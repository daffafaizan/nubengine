      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) will develop NEC as compared with controls.

      Preterm neonates, <1750 gm birth weight will potentially be candidates for study. They will
      be randomly assigned to receive one of two milk additives from the time enteral feeds are
      begun until 35 weeks post-conceptual age: prebiotics (GOS) or placebo (water). All infants
      will be followed prospectively for signs of feeding intolerance and/or development of NEC.
      These will be compared between the two groups.
