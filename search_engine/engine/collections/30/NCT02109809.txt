      I. To determine the safety of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) in cohorts of a selected
      population of refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) patients, given to cohorts
      with a total cumulative doses of TLI of 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 centigray (cGy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (failure free survival [FFS] at 6 months) of this therapy in the
      study population.

      II. Approximate the efficacy at different dose levels using the GvHD summary scores.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of this therapy on relevant subpopulations of immune cells in an
      attempt to elucidate a mechanism of action.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo LD-TLI daily for 1-2 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 45, at 3 and 6 months,
      at 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
