      participants with cutaneous melanoma that has not spread to other areas of the body
      (non-metastatic) and can be removed by surgery (resectable) but has a higher risk of coming
      back after surgery (high-risk). Cutaneous melanoma in its earliest stages before it has
      spread to other areas of the body can usually be cured with surgery alone. Unfortunately,
      some cutaneous melanomas have a greater likelihood of coming back after surgery. Your immune
      system is normally your body's first defense against threats like cancer. But sometimes
      cancer cells produce signals that allow them to hide from attack by the immune system. One
      such signal is called programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Atezolizumab is a drug that
      blocks PD-L1. By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab may boost your immune system to keep your
      cutaneous melanoma from coming back after surgery.
