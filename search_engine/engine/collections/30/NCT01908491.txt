      control leads to develop postoperative pulmonary complications, such as hypoxia, atelectasis
      and pneumonia. Additionally, hospital length of stay could be prolonged. Therefore,
      successful pain management is mandatory to improve clinical outcome, to decrease
      postoperative morbidity and to shorten the duration of hospital stay. Various methods of pain
      management have been introduced. Current typical methods for pain management include thoracic
      epidural analgesia and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA). Epidural analgesia
      has shown superior pain control effects. However, there may be rare but serious
      complications, such as spinal cord and nerve root lesions, epidural hematoma, or infections.
      IV PCA is a well-established method of postoperative pain management. However, the systemic
      side effects of opioid, such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, or respiratory depression may
      occur. Continuous wound infusion of local anesthetics through ON-Q catheters is another
      method for pain management. It has been used for various surgical procedures. However, the
      effect is not well evaluated in pectus surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effects of opioid-based IV PCA and continuous wound infusion using a catheter.
