      who are going to receive stem cell transplantation but without available treatment to achieve
      complete remission prior to the transplant. In addition, some patients who enroll to other
      CD19-CAR-T cell therapy trials might be eligible for this trial if their CD19-CAR-T cells
      cannot be produced successfully because they have insufficient T cells to allow the
      CD19-CAR-T cells to be made; their T cells are inefficiently transduced with CAR viruses; or
      their CAR-T cell expansion is failed.
