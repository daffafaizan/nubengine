    
      Mindfulness meditation and mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to improve many
      aspects of psychological functioning in individuals with mental health problems.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in
      improving mental health of brief mindfulness practices in adults currently in treatment for
      mental health concerns. The entire study will be administered online. From online
      instructional videos, each participant will learn a thirty-second or three-minute mindfulness
      practice that is to be performed at least three times daily over two weeks. A
      delayed-treatment control group will begin the intervention after a two-week waiting period.
