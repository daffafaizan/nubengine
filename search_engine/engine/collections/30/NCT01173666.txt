      ventricular mass and function. Whether renal revascularization can improve cardiac function
      and structure in patients with RAS is not known.

      The Stenting of Renal Artery Stenosis in Coronary Artery Disease (RASCAD) study was planned
      to test whether renal artery revascularization, compared with medical therapy, affects left
      ventricular hypertrophy progression and clinical outcomes in a high-risk population such as
      patients with evidence of coronary artery disease and RAS.

      Incidental patients affected by ischemic heart disease,undergoing cardiac catheterization at
      a single institution, are also evaluated for the presence of RAS by renal angiography at the
      end of coronarography. Patients with RAS >50% and â‰¤80% are randomly assigned to stenting
      angioplasty plus medical therapy (angioplasty group) or to medical therapy alone (drug
      therapy group)and followed up. Patients, randomly assigned to the angioplasty group, are
      revascularized by stenting. All randomized patients receive antihypertensive, statin or
      antiplatelet drugs according to clinical indications. The planned duration of follow-up is 5
      years.

      The health profile of patients is described in full at study entry. Cardiovascular events
      (AMI, re-PTCA, cardiac heart failure, stroke,peripheral vascular disease),death,
      hospitalizations and medications are carefully registered throughout the study.

      Standard echocardiography and renal ultrasound studies are performed at baseline and repeated
      every year. Echocardiography is performed following American Society of Echocardiography
      guidelines. LV mass is estimated using the Devereux formula and indexed to body surface area.
