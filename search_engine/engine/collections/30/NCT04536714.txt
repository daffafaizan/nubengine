      Peristeri, department of the Psychiatric Hospital of Attica, Greece, from December 2018 to
      January 2020. The study protocol was approved by the School of Medicine, National and
      Kapodistrian University of Athens (Protocol n. 1718038002/30/07/2018) and the center's
      directorate and was consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants were
      enlisted in the study only after being fully informed by the researcher about the aims and
      procedures of the research and submitting written consent.

      Procedures Patients eligible for the above mentioned criteria were randomized in two groups:
      the intervention group, receiving PSAI, and the control group, receiving the usual care
      provided by the center for patients with MDD, namely medical treatment and counselling.
      Randomization was conducted based on random numbers generated by an online random number
      generator (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists). This study was
      non-blinded, as patients and researchers were aware of the group assignment.
