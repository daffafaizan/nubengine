      routine pregnancy training, a 90-minute psychodrama study was conducted to the experimental
      group. The experimental group was divided into 6 subgroups and trained (min = 9, max = 14).
      The control group was divided into 6 subgroups and trained (min = 11, max = 14). Prenatal
      psychodrama is held by psychodrama psychotherapists in individual and group therapy sessions.
      In these sessions the pregnant mother encounters herself, her baby, her partner, her mother,
      her fear of childbirth and the moment of birth; she may act as protagonist in some scenes and
      in this way she closes any unfinished business from the past and rehearses the future in a
      safe therapeutic environment.Data were collected using the information form, Wijma Delivery
      Expectancy/ Experience Questionnaire Version A (W-DEQ), Wijma Delivery Expectation /
      Experience Questionnaire Version B (W-DEQ), City Birth Trauma Scale and Edinburgh Postpartum
      Depression Scale. The data obtained were assesment using the SPSS (Version 21.0) package
      program on the computer.
