      49.9% of which are male. Diet is assessed by repeated dietician-administered validated
      food-frequency questionnaires (2540 assessments) in 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. Nutrient
      intakes including spermidine are calculated using USDA standard databases. Clinical events
      (all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality) are recorded from 1995 to 2015.

      The primary endpoint of all-cause mortality is related to the exposure of long-term average
      spermidine intake by Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates. Additional
      analyses employ the Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model and flexible
      Royston-Parmar spline-based models. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses are performed to guard
      against potential biases associated with nutritional epidemiology.
