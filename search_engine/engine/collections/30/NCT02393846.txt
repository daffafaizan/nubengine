      24 hours, pain intensity lower than 40 mm, allergy to the study drug, drug alcohol abuse and
      pregnancy or breastfeeding are the exclusion criteria. The study interventions are 2 gr of
      2.5% ketoprofen gel versus placebo applied to the sprain area. The study drugs are identical
      in colour, form and smelling. After an eligible patient presented to the ED, the drug number
      from an opaque bag is determined by a nurse and then another nurse applies the study drug to
      the patient. Physicians, nurses and patients are blinded to the study drug. Pain intensity of
      patients is measured by visual analogue scale at baseline, 15th and 30th minutes after the
      administration.
