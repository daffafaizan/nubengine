    
      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group, Phase 2 study in subjects
      with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa.

      The study is multicenter and will consist of three subject groups. Subjects will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to a treatment of 10mg avacopan twice daily, 30 mg avacopan twice daily or
      placebo twice daily for 12 weeks.

      Following the 12 weeks double-blind treatment period, subjects on placebo will be
      re-randomized 1:1 to receive 10 mg or 30 mg avacopan twice daily for additional 24 weeks.
      Subjects treated with avacopan will continue to receive the same dose (either 10 mg or 30 mg
      twice daily) for additional 24 weeks.

      Subjects will be on study treatment for 36 weeks and will be followed for 44 weeks for
      assessment of safety and efficacy.

      Primary efficacy analysis will be at 12 weeks.
