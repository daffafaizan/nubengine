      unresectable thymoma and thymic carcinoma.

      All patients received four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each of
      1 day's duration, combined with thoracic radiotherapy of 66 Gy/22 fractions. Meanwhile they
      received weekly thymosin a1(1.6mg) during and within 2 months after the end of
      chemoradiotherapy.
