    
      This is a phase I/II study of interleukin-1, G-CSF and high dose ICE chemotherapy with
      autologous bone marrow transplant in patients with relapsed breast, testicular and lymphoid
      cancers. The initial goal of this study was to define the toxicity of interleukin-1
      administered for 7 days prior to ICE chemotherapy. A total of 22 patients have been treated
      with IL-1 and ICE and results showed a more rapid engraftment (4.5 days) with IL-1. A second
      cohort of 18 patients also received G-CSF and engraftment was further shortened in some
      subgroups. Overall, the median time to engraftment was 16 days with both IL-1 and G-CSF.
      Accrual will continue to further define the toxicity and efficacy of this regimen.
