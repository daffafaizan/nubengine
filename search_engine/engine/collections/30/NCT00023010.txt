    
      Patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency or LAD have a deficiency of the leukocyte
      integrin CD18 on their leukocyte cell surface and suffer from severe bacterial infections.
      Two patients with LAD were enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial conducted at the University
      of Washington School of Medicine in 1999 to determine the safety and potential efficacy of
      using retroviral vectors containing CD18 to transduce and correct their CD34+ peripheral
      blood stem cells. This protocol aims to continue the long-term follow-up of these patients at
      the National Cancer Institute where Dr. Hickstein is now a Senior Investigator. Blood samples
      will be collected at the follow-up visits on the yearly anniversary of the treatment date
      (either locally or off-site by the patients' personal physicians) for archiving for potential
      testing for replication competent retrovirus, and for complete blood counts. Patients will
      also undergo a history and physical examination at these visits. Results from these tests
      will be forwarded to the investigators who will report to the NIH and FDA.
