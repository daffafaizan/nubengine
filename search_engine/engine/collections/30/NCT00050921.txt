      levels. However, some patients continue to have low CD4+ counts (< 350 cells/mm3) despite
      adequate viral suppression. The purpose of this study is to determine whether administration
      of GH will increase naïve CD4+ production. Further, the study will assess whether an increase
      in naïve CD4+ production will lead to increases in antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

      Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized to one of two groups. Patients in both
      groups will continue their present HAART regimen for the duration of the study. Group A
      patients will receive daily subcutaneous injections of GH for 48 weeks. Group B participants
      will receive no additional therapy for 24 weeks, and will then receive daily subcutaneous GH
      injections during Weeks 24-28 of the study. Both groups will receive immunocyanin
      (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin) injections at Weeks 16 and 20 and hepatitis A vaccination at
      Weeks 40 and 44. At the conclusion of Week 48, all patients will discontinue GH therapy while
      maintaining their HAART regimen. Patients will then be followed for an additional 24 weeks.

      Patients may be asked to participate in a substudy to measure the size of the thymus in
      people taking GH. Patients in the substudy will have a noncontrast CT scan of the chest
      before beginning GH therapy and again after 24 weeks of GH therapy.
