      calprotectin are associated with lower rates of relapse. We performed an open-label,
      randomized controlled trial to investigate whether increasing doses of mesalamine reduce
      concentrations of fecal calprotectin (FC) in patients with quiescent UC.

      We screened 119 patients with UC in remission on the basis of Simple Clinical Colitis
      Activity Index scores, FC >50 µg/g, and intake of no more than 3 g/day mesalamine.
      Participants taking mesalamine formulations other than multimatrix mesalamine were switched
      to multimatrix mesalamine (2.4 g/day) for 6 weeks; 52 participants were then randomly
      assigned (1:1) to a group that continued its current dose of mesalamine (controls, n = 26) or
      a group that increased its dose by 2.4 g/day for 6 weeks (n = 26). The primary outcome was
      continued remission with FC <50 µg/g. Secondary outcomes were continued remission with FC
      <100 µg/g or <200 µg/g (among patients with pre-randomization values above these levels).
