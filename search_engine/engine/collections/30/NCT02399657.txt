      mellitus. Laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy, intravitreal steroid injection and intravitreal
      antiVEGF (anti vascular endothelial growth factor) injection are being used as treatment of
      DME. Sustained releasing intravitreal dexamethasone implant has been known to be effective in
      reducing the central retinal thickness and gain of vision for DME. Although hard exudate at
      macula is important pathology of DME, impact of intravitreal dexamethasone implant on hard
      exudate are not studied yet. Therefore the investigators designed the descriptive study to
      reveal the hard exudate change in DME eyes treated with intravitreal dexamethasone implant.
