      policies and procedures. They will only be marked on the outside at the water level every 2
      hours for the first 6 hours. Once ready to be discarded will be collected for laboratory
      testing Once in the laboratory, nebulizers will be weight on a precision scale without
      liquid, then they will be filled with normal saline to the first mark (6th hour) and
      re-weight. The nebulizers will be filled to next mark and re-weight until 200 mls. of total
      volume are achieved. Solution output will be calculated as the weight difference between the
      2 hour periods.
