        -  To acquire experience in the marker implantation process for mediastinal lymph nodes and
           primary lung tumors in patients with stage I-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To characterize the potential side effects involved in the use of markers in these
           patients.

        -  To analyze the positional stability of lung markers in these patients over a
           radiotherapy series.

        -  To acquire experience in the use of markers for treatment planning and radiotherapy in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo implantation of ≥ 1 small radio-opaque Visicoil™ marker into or
      close to the primary lesion and affected lymph nodes by bronchoscopy. Patients then undergo
      x-rays to document marker location, detect potentially dropped markers, and diagnose
      operation-related side effects (i.e., pneumothorax). After marker implantation, patients
      undergo stereotactic or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for 30-33 daily fractions.
