      [E7727] or decitabine) so that decitabine exposure after oral administration would be
      comparable to exposure after IV decitabine at the approved daily dose of 20 mg/m^2. The main
      objective of Phases 1 and 2 was to establish and confirm the doses of the 2 components to be
      used in the final fixed-dose combination (FDC) product (ASTX727) using mainly
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as endpoints.
