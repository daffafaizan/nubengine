      six weeks will have any impact on overweight/obese individuals in terms of risk factors used
      to define metabolic disease.

      Oat beta-glucan has been incorporated into a novel oatcake product manufactured by Nairn's
      Oatcakes Ltd. Consumption of the oatcake products will deliver enough oat-beta glucan to the
      diet to meet European Food Safety Authority health claims for lowering blood cholesterol and
      reducing post-prandial glycaemic responses.
