      (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)to 90% (biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch) of cases;
      most of the remainder achieve better glycemic control, even if they regain weight. The
      current consensus supports bariatric surgical treatment for diabetic patients with BMI as low
      as 35kg/m2 but it has questioned that lower body mass patients might benefit of the surgery
      as well.

      Actually, many clinical researchers worldwide would consider a lower limit BMI of 30kg/m2,
      i.e., any grade of obesity.

      This study is proposed to describe the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Fobi-Capella
      technique, adapted to create a larger gastric pouch, about 80ml)in mild obese (BMI 30-35)
      human volunteers on incretins, insulin production and sensitivity and its clinical (diabetic
      chronic complications) and metabolic impact.
