      be modulated by drugs such as metformin which is widely used worldwide to treat diabetes.
      This study is monocentric, prospective, one-arm type and interventional. The main objective
      isto evaluate the impact of metformin on the transport of leptin into the CSF of obese
      patients.

      We propose to show a variation of CSF leptin / serum leptin before and after metformin
      treatment and study its association with changes in hypothalamic metabolic activity,
      cognitive and appetite-related behaviors and ratio of other metabolic signals. This would
      support the hypothesis of modulation of resistance to peripheral leptin by metformin and thus
      uncover a new indication for metformin treatment towards the management of obesity.

      For this purpose, volunteers will be subjected to blood sampling via venipuncture, CSF
      collection via lumbar puncture, MRI assessments and questionnaires (cognitive tests, food
      survey and feeding behavior) before and after a 3-month metformin treatment.
