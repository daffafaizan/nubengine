      the ten patients will be randomly assigned to one month of treatment with oral
      n-acetylcysteine 500mg or placebo twice daily for thirty days in addition to their regular
      therapy. At enrolment the patients will be educated and counselled about the trial and the
      intervention medication. Patients will also have a blood test (serum creatinine) that will
      allow the calculation of their renal function by use of the Cockroft Gault equation. Blood
      samples will also be frozen and stored. Patients will also undergo an ultrasound test of the
      function of their arm blood vessels. Both the blood test and the ultrasound test will be
      repeated at the completion of the thirty day trial period. Again the blood test sample will
      be frozen and stored. Subjects will then cross over to the other treatment arm for a further
      one month period, with the same testing at the end.
