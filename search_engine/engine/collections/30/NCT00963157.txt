      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many
      countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on
      June 11, 2009. Data from several cohorts in different age groups that received licensed
      trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these vaccines are unlikely to provide
      protection against the new virus. Adults are more likely to have measurable levels of serum
      hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) or neutralizing antibody than are children. These
      data indicate the need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1 strain and suggest that
      different vaccine strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for adjuvant) may be appropriate
      for persons in different age groups. This protocol will explore antibody responses following
      vaccination with an inactivated influenza H1N1 virus vaccine at 3 different dose levels
      combined with AS03 adjuvant and at 2 different dose levels administered without adjuvant.
      This study will assess the immune response following a single dose of vaccine with or without
      AS03 adjuvant, to assess whether individuals have any pre-existing 'prime' immunity, such
      that the initial H1N1 vaccination serves as a boost, thus conferring a more rapid time to
      protection with the need for fewer doses. Antibody responses will be assessed at 8 days after
      each dose to evaluate the development of an anamnestic response. In addition, antibody
      responses will be assessed 21 days after each dose. The primary objectives are: safety, to
      assess the safety of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at the 3.75 micrograms (mcg),
      7.5 mcg, or 15 mcg dose combined with AS03 adjuvant and at the 7.5 mcg or 15 mcg dose
      administered without adjuvant; and immunogenicity, to assess the antibody response at Day 21
      following a single dose of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75 mcg, 7.5 mcg,
      or 15 mcg dose combined with AS03 adjuvant and at the 7.5 mcg or 15 mcg dose administered
      without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient. The secondary objective is immunogenicity,
      to assess the antibody response following 2 doses of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when
      administered at the 3.75 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 15 mcg dose combined with AS03 adjuvant and at the
      7.5 mcg or 15 mcg dose administered without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient.
      Participants will include up to 800 healthy adults who have no history of novel influenza
      H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized,
      double-blinded, Phase II study. Subjects will be randomized into 5 groups, stratified by age
      (150 subjects per dose group with 100 subjects in the 18-64 years of age stratum and 50
      subjects in the greater than or equal to 65 years of age stratum), to receive intramuscular
      inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine at 3.75 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 15 mcg combined with AS03
      adjuvant (Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) or at 7.5 mcg or 15 mcg without adjuvant (Groups
      4 and 5, respectively). The vaccine, with and without adjuvant, will be administered at Day 0
      and Day 21. Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events
      (AEs) through 21 days following the last vaccination (Day 42 for those receiving both doses
      and Day 21 for those who do not receive the second dose), serious adverse events (SAEs) and
      new-onset chronic medical conditions through 12 months post final vaccination (Day 365 after
      second vaccination), and reactogenicity to vaccine for 8 days (Day 0-7) following each
      vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will include HAI and neutralizing antibody.
