      oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or, more recently, treatment with XELOX (Roche) (capecitabine +
      oxaliplatin) has been the main approach for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma
      (mCRC), but with the advent of targeted therapies, biologic treatments are becoming an area
      of intense interest. Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by upwards
      of 85% of mCRCs.
