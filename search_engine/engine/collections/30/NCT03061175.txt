      I. To develop a feasible web-based decision aid (DA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary data on the impact of the contralateral prophylactic mastectomy
      (CPM)-DA on preparedness to make the CPM decision, decisional conflict, CPM knowledge,
      psychosocial factors, perceived risk for cancer in the healthy/breast/metastatic disease,
      cancer recurrence/metastasis worry, cancer distress and intention to have CPM.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I (PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING): Patients attend an interview and are asked
      questions about experiences with CPM, reasons they chose and did not choose CPM, and CPM
      satisfaction for 60 minutes. Patients then receive access to web-based CPM-DA and attend an
      interview over 90 minutes to provide feedback on module and to complete a prototype
      evaluation.

      PHASE II (CPM-DA FEASIBILITY TRIAL): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo usual care (UC) available to patients considering CPM and receive
      information from a medical oncologist about CPM.

      ARM II: Patients receive a website address, a secure username and password, and instructions
      for using the web-based CPM-DA.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and 6 months.
