    
      Phase 1, single-center, open-label study in subjects receiving SRS for brain metastases.

      The study will consist of 4 principal cohorts (n=3 in each cohort). Each cohort will receive
      an escalating dose of ascorbate-meglumine as an MRI-detectable adjunctive therapeutic to SRS.

      Subjects will complete a planning MRI for SRS with gadolinium- diethylenetriamine
      penta-acetic acid (GD-DPTA) per standard of care for SRS. Forty-eight hours after the
      planning MRI, the subjects will complete the study MRI with ascorbate-meglumine contrast
      agent. Each cohort will receive an escalating dose of ascorbate-meglumine by intravenous
      administration over 1 hour during the MRI. The total dose of ascorbate-meglumine-will
      escalate from the first cohort to the next cohort in a sequential manner. During
      ascorbate-meglumine infusion, MRI scans will be performed to evaluate the contrast effect and
      PK blood draws will occur at defined time points.

      Patients will return for the SRS procedure within 1 week following the planning MRI per
      standard of care. During SRS, subjects will receive a second dose of ascorbate-meglumine as
      an adjunctive therapeutic.

      Patients will enter into a follow up phase within 2 weeks after the SRS procedure per
      standard of care.

      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety of parenteral ascorbate-meglumine as a
      MRI-detectable adjunctive therapeutic to SRS.
