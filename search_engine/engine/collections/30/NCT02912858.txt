      Blood flow will be measured after each device has been activated for 10 minutes with a 10
      minute rest between devices to allow blood flow to return to baseline. The order the devices
      will be fitted is determined randomly. Activation of the device for 10 minutes before
      measurement is deemed appropriate as previous studies have demonstrated significant increases
      in blood flow following as little as five minutes use of the devices.

      In this short study the standard of care (typically compression bandaging), will be suspended
      temporarily to allow the fitting of the gekoTM plus R-2 and IPC devices in order to measure
      blood flow. This is not seen as a risk to the patient as the device is only in operation for
      30 minutes plus 10 minutes rest within the care pathway.
