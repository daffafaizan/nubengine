      radiotherapy (CIRT) in the treatment of localized Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma with
      respective to toxicity and tumor control. Participants will be treated with CIRT with
      escalating dose regimens based on the tumor location to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose
      (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 3 months after the
      completion of CIRT. Primary endpoint is toxicity, second endpoint is progression-free
      survival, overall survival and tumor response.
