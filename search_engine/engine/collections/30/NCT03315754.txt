      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the absence of biopsy detectable Gleason
      grade 4 or 5 prostate cancer tumors anywhere in the prostate gland on 12-month,
      post-treatment biopsy following TOOKAD速 Soluble-VTP. Men with Gleason score 7 (3+4) prostate
      cancer on one half of the prostate will receive TOOKAD速 Soluble VTP under general anesthesia.
      Treatment will consist in hemiablation procedure designed to destroy the lobe of the prostate
      gland that contains the Gleason score 7 (3+4) cancer. Afterwards, patients will be followed
      for 5 years (60 months) with clinical evaluation, questionnaires on QOL, erectile and urinary
      functions, and PSA testing. In addition, treatment outcomes will be assessed based on
      prostate biopsy results at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the TOOKAD速 Soluble
      treatment. All patients will undergo biopsy at 3 and 12 months. If the Month 3 biopsy is
      positive for any cancer, patients will be allowed a single re-treatment by TOOKAD速 Soluble
      VTP to one or both lobes.
