      comorbidities including sarcopenia and diabetes, effective and safe treatment options
      tailored to the needs of older adults are imperative. While medication and lifestyle
      interventions generally fail to achieve sustained large-scale weight loss, bariatric surgery
      is the most effective long-term weight loss treatment for obese patients and improves many of
      the medical complications associated with obesity. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) results in
      substantial weight loss and may be more appropriate for older adults due to its low rate of
      complications and mortality. Therefore, SG has been proposed as a reasonable primary
      treatment modality in older obese individuals, with a substantial recent increase in the
      number of interventions performed. Despite the potential benefits, very little is known of
      the physiologic and metabolic effects of bariatric surgery, including SG, on glucose
      homeostasis and muscle physiology in older adults. A fundamental understanding of the effects
      of excess adiposity and weight loss interventions is of profound importance, especially with
      emerging evidence that earlier treatment of obesity may delay/prevent many comorbidities. An
      underlying inflammatory state has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and
      insulin resistance and may provide an important connection to the age-related declines seen
      in older obese patients. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the modifying effect of age
      and inflammation on the SG-induced changes in body composition, muscle physiology, and
      insulin sensitivity. This protocol will be conducted in two age cohorts (greater than 60 and
      less than 50 years old).
