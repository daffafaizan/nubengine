      of exercise) on sleep and daytime impairment in samples of adults who meet diagnostic
      criteria for insomnia. In response to the current literature, the investigators aim to better
      understand the short-term clinical benefit of adopting exercise training in insomnia.
      Including multiple bouts of exercise in a short time span while measuring sleep with
      objective and self-reported measures may be more reflective of capturing true acute effects
      of exercise implementation on insomnia. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized
      parallel design to compare the effects of short-term moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on
      insomnia severity and measures of sleep in a sample of adults who meet diagnostic criteria
      for insomnia. This project will address prior limitations in the area of acute exercise
      research by utilizing a sample with diagnosed insomnia, assessing multiple nights of sleep,
      and implementing multiple bouts of exercise stimuli. This project will examine the following
      aims:

      Aim 1: To examine if implementing 1 week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise improves
      objective and subjective sleep compared to 1 week without exercise in a sample of adults who
      meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia.

      Aim 2: To examine if implementing 1 week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise reduces
      severity of daytime impairment compared to 1 week without exercise in a sample of adults who
      meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia.
