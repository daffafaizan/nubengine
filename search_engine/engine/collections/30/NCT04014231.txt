      I. To determine the relationship between insulin resistance (delta omega) as measured by the
      single wave application and inflammation markers associated with insulin resistance and
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) in cancer patients, and to estimate the mean and standard deviation
      (sd) of delta omega in cancer patients with and without MetS for designing future, larger
      studies.

      II. To determine the degree of agreement between the single wave measure of left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) in cancer patients and that measured by the routine 2-dimensional
      (2D) echocardiography (standard of care).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo placement of a single wave application near the carotid region of the neck.
