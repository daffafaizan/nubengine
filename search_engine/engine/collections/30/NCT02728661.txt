      total knee replacement (TKR) during their lifetime. Of patients who need a TKR, 80-95% are
      overweight or obese. While patients are encouraged to lose weight, limited, if any, guidance
      is provided to achieve recommended weight loss. Many patients perceive that TKR is a
      necessary precursor for the initiation of weight loss. Yet, 66% of patients actually gain
      weight by 2 years after surgery. Patients undergoing TKR not only face unique barriers (i.e.,
      pain, mobility limitations, motivation) to weight loss, but also have to balance pre- and
      post-operative concerns from physicians, surgeons, and rehabilitation specialists. To best
      accommodate the needs of both patients (pre- and post-TKR) and healthcare professionals
      (i.e., surgeon, physical therapist), patient and stakeholder engagement and activation is
      imperative in the development of a patient-centered weight loss intervention. Investigators
      completed 20 interviews with patients pre- and post-TKR and identified weight loss barriers,
      preferred intervention components (e.g., delivery method, contact frequency, self-monitoring
      modality) and patient-reported outcomes (e.g., physical function, pain) viewed as critical by
      patients. Investigators developed a patient-centered weight loss program (PACE) guided by
      these results and additional input from stakeholders to meet the needs of patients and
      healthcare professionals. PACE is a randomized pilot study comparing weight loss and
      patient-reported outcomes between PACE (program starting up to 6 weeks pre-TKR to 12 weeks
      post-TKR) and Delayed PACE (program starting 12 weeks post-TKR to 26 weeks post-TKR).
