      patients after a single usual dose (70 mg i.v.). Blood samples are drawn just before
      administration and 0.25, 0.5,1 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after
      administration. Caspofungin plasma concentrations are measured by liquid-chromatography
      spectrometry mass tandem.The primary end-points are :

        -  area under the curve of caspofungin plasma concentrations over 24 hours

        -  mean peak level and trough concentration (24 hours after dosing)

      The secondary end-points are :

        -  mean total clearance

        -  mean distribution volume These parameters will be compared to those usually observed in
           non burn patients. The optimal dose in burn patients is the dose achieving an exposure
           similar to that in non burn patients.
