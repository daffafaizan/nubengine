      sigmoidoscopy. All patients will be age 18 or older with a known history of UC that has been
      confirmed by biopsy and an extent of disease of at least 20cm proximal to the anus. Clinical
      data will be collected on the patient's age, disease duration, family history of IBD, smoking
      status and history, as well as current medications for IBD through a questionnaire. Data will
      also be collected regarding current vitamin D supplementation (if taking) and dose. Prior to
      the endoscopic procedure, peripheral blood will be drawn into two 10ml red top tubes. At the
      time of endoscopy, five standard size mucosal pinch biopsies will be obtained from 20cm
      proximal to the anus. . A bar-coded unique identifier label will be applied to each sample.
      One biopsy will be placed in formalin. Paraffin samples will be maintained at room
      temperature. Following to the endoscopic procedure, the patient's physician will complete a
      Mayo score based on the patients current symptoms and endoscopic disease severity. Comparison
      will be made between disease activity, serum serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D level, and mucosal
      expression of tight junction proteins as well as proinflammatory cytokines.
