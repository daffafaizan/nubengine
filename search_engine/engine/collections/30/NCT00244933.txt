      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage IV breast cancer treated
           with gemcitabine hydrochloride and genistein.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate plasma genistein levels with response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral genistein once daily on days -7 to 1. Patients also receive
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8 and oral genistein once daily on days 1-21.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
