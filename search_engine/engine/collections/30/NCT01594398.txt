    
      This is Phase 1, randomized, open-label, study of entinostat. The study is designed to
      evaluate any food effect on the pharmacokinetics of entinostat.

      Patients will be randomized to receive entinostat with or without food on Cycle 1 Day 1
      (C1D1). Patients randomized to receive entinostat with food on C1D1 will receive a second
      dose of entinostat without food on Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15). Patients randomized to receive
      entinostat without food on C1D1 will receive a second dose of entinostat with food on C1D15.
      Each cycle in the study will be for 28 days duration. Blood samples will be obtained pre-dose
      and serial blood samples will be taken after each dose to assess pharmacokinetics. For Cycle
      2 and all subsequent cycles, all patients will continue to receive entinostat on Days 1 and
      15 of each cycle. Those with breast cancer will also receive exemestane orally once daily
      starting on Cycle 2 Day 1. Those with NSCLC will also receive erlotinib starting on Cycle 2
      Day 1.

      Patients will be assessed at screening and at pre-prescribed times during study enrollment
      using standard assessments. Patients will also be assessed for tumor response after each 2
      cycles. Patients will continue receiving study treatment until tumor progression or adverse
      events occur which necessitate discontinuing therapy as determined by the Investigator.
