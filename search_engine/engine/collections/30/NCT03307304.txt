    
      Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten Disease, CLN3) is a recessive, fatal,
      lysosomal storage disease that results in progressive neurodegeneration. In aggregate, the 13
      disorders of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis are considered the most common neurodegenerative
      disorders in children with incidence estimates ranging from 1/12,500 to 1/100,000 in European
      and USA populations. Neurological symptoms of CLN3 typically manifest between 4 and 7 years
      of age. The initial clinical presentation is progressive vision loss and cognitive
      impairment, followed by insidious progression of motor dysfunction and onset of seizures.
      Affected individuals generally succumb to the disease in young adulthood. There is no
      effective treatment for CLN3. A major impediment to the testing of potential therapeutic
      interventions is the lack of well-defined outcome measures. The purpose of this protocol is
      to obtain both baseline and rate of progression data on clinical and biochemical markers that
      may later be used as an outcome measure in a clinical trial, and to establish a biorepository
      of samples from CLN3 participants. For comparisons, focused clinical data and relevant
      evaluations and biospecimens will also be collected from individuals with Neuronal Ceroids
      Lipofuscinosis (NCL) of other types and from family members of all affected individuals.
