      vascular fraction, to treat 8 osteoarthritic knees in 6 patients of grade I to III (K-L
      scale) with initial pain of 4 or greater on a 10 point scale, under IRB-approved protocol.
      Evaluation of the safety of intra-articular injection of the stromal vascular fraction cells
      was the primary objective of the study. Adipose-derived stromal vascular cells were obtained
      through enzymatic disaggregation of lipoaspirate, resuspended in 3 ml of Lactated Ringer's
      Solution, and injected directly into the intra-articular space with a mean of 12 million
      viable nucleated SVF cells per knee.
