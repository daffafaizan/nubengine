      selected 10 subjects from patients with a recent history of upper-gastrointestinal symptoms
      who met the indication of taking sucralfate suspension gel, and another 10 subjects from
      healthy volunteers.

      Procedures were performed by the NaviCam magnetic capsule guidance system. To enhance
      discrimination, the sucralfate gel dyed with 0.3 ml methylene blue. The subjects swallowed
      the capsule with water in the left lateral position. When capsule enter stomach cavity,
      subject was asked to sit up and ingested 4 g aerogenic powder with 5 ml water to distend the
      stomach, and performed gastric baseline examinations to identify the lesions. After baseline
      examination, subjects ingested dyed sucralfate gel and performed the first-time examination.
      The examination was repeated at 30 min intervals, until dyed sucralfate gel disappeared
      completely. When study completed, the capsule was detached from string and continued into the
      small bowel for further examination.

      The endoscopists recorded the adhesion and dissipation times of dyed sucralfate gel,
      calculated the efficient time, and selected the images of six primary anatomic landmarks from
      each examination to measure the distribution area (%) . Any complication or discomfort during
      the procedure was evaluated. The discomfort was scored on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no; 1 =
      mild/minimal; 2 = moderate; 3 = sever/very difficult).
