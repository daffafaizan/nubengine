      I. Determine the safety, tolerability, and toxicity of oral 3-AP in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of this drug in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of this drug. IV. Assess tumoral
      expression of genes involved in response and resistance to 3-AP.

      V. Observe and record any tumor response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive a one time dose of 3-AP IV over 2 hours on day -7. Patients then receive
      oral 3-AP twice daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of oral 3-AP until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis are collected periodically
      over 8 hours after the IV dose of 3-AP and after the first oral dose of 3-AP during course 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
