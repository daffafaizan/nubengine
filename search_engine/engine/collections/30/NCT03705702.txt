      assessments. Forty-six moderate or severe patients with asthma under optimized medication
      will be randomly assigned (computer-generated) into either Control Group (CG) or Intervention
      Group (IG). Both groups will receive similar educational program. However, only the IG will
      be submitted to the behavioral intervention through physical activity counseling program
      combined with a monitoring-and-feedback tool aiming to increase physical activity levels
      (total of 8 weekly goal-setting consultation, face-to-face, each lasting 40 minutes). Before
      and after the interventions, clinical control of asthma, physical activity levels,
      health-related quality of life, asthma exacerbation, levels of anxiety and depression
      symptoms and anthropometric indices will be assessed. Data about onset of asthma,
      comorbidities, lung function and asthma medication will be collected from the patient's
      medical record. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and a two-way
      ANOVA with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc of Holm-sidak will be used to compare
      inter and intra-groups differences. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.
