    
      This is a pragmatic randomized trial of renal nerve denervation for treatment resistant
      hypertension. This is part of a ministry sponsored MaRS-EXCITE program, to conduct early
      market health technology assessment, in order to determine appropriateness for provincial
      funding. We will assess the effectiveness, safety, economic attractiveness and feasibility of
      implementation of renal nerve denervation for treatment resistant hypertension. This will
      involve a new model of care which will include a multi-disciplinary team approach to these
      patients. Treatment resistant hypertension is defined as patients with uncontrolled
      hypertension despite being on optimal doses of 3 or more anti-hypertensive medications.
      Patients will be randomized to either standard treatment or renal nerve denervation and
      followed for 6 months to determine impact on blood pressure.
