      that with the compression and distraction that this device makes possible, the investigators
      can achieve a higher union rate than with other forms of treatment, using a percutaneous
      approach, with a decreased complication rate, and can dynamically modulate the healing
      response when needed. The primary safety endpoint is the occurrence of adverse events from
      the time of treatment.

      During the healing process an external remote controller (ERC) will be used to continually
      compress or distract the fracture as needed. The surgeon will monitor healing and decide,
      clinically based on sequential radiographs during subsequent office visits, whether the
      fracture needs additional compression or distraction, an accordion technique, or no
      additional external manipulation via the ERC. Participants will be followed for 12 months.
