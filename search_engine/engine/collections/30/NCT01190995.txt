      damage or described in terms of such damage (note that the inability to communicate verbally
      or non verbally does not negate the possibility that an individual is having pain and is in
      need of appropriate pain relieving treatment)

      HISTORICAL BACKGROUND- we as clinicians have emerged from a period of relative neglect of
      neonatal pain and are now recognizing the immediate and long term impact of pain on the
      neonatal development as well as the need to alleviate pain effectively. Neonatal pain has
      been acknowledged and Paediatric societies such as American Academy of Paediatrics and
      Canadian paediatric society (2000) have adopted specific guidelines on pain relief in
      neonates .

      LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CHRONIC PAIN -Early repeated procedural pain in NICU has been proposed
      as one of the factors that may contribute to altered development of cognition ,motor function
      and behaviour in infants and children born preterm.The vulnerability of preterms is well
      established due to their lower pain threshold ,sensitization from repeated pain and immature
      systems for maintaining homeostasis .For infants with extremely immature physiological and
      neurobehavioural systems ,continual adaptation to repeated challenges induces long term
      alterations in pain sensitivity, might affect generalized stress arousal systems and
      potentially affect the developing cytotexture of the brain. The physiologic perturbations
      associated with early prolonged exposure to episodic pain appear to contribute to altering
      the rapidly developing stress systems .Exposure to painful procedures in early neonatal
      period affects the long term neurobehavioural outcome.

      SCALE USED TO ASSESS SHORT TERM NEUROBEHAVIOUR

      NAPI (NEUROBEHAVIOURAL ASSESSMENT OF PRETERM INFANT) -The NAPI is appropriate for infants
      between 32 weeks post conceptional age and term. It assesses the relative maturity of
      functioning of preterm infants,with higher scores reflecting higher maturity , and can
      differentiate 2 weeks PCA . The clinical validity and sensitivity of NAPI were established
      using an index of medical complications based on a 1-5 classification range of degrees of
      complications21 The items in the motor development cluster include ventral suspension, prone
      head raising ,the crawling reflex ,forearm recoil ,power of active movements , and vigor of
      spontaneous movements .The alertness and orientation items include percent of time in an
      alert state ,duration and quality of alertness , quantitative response to inanimate and
      animate visual and auditory stimulation and qualitative ratings that express the nature of
      response.

      LACUNAE IN KNOWLEDGE -Preterm infants are more prone to undergo multiple painful procedures
      due to their prolonged stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and their typical vulnerable
      clinical profile.It has now been proved that painful procedures lead to long term changes in
      the pain reactivity and also affect the long term neurobehavioural outcome in these preterm
      infants.When a medline search was carried out on the subject it did not return any
      result.Currently there is no study which has tried to explore the short term neurobehavioural
      outcome in preterm babies >32 weeks - <37 weeks of gestation who undergo multiple painful
      procedures during their NICU stay.The present study was thus planned to evaluate the role of
      sucrose analgesia in alleviating the pain caused by the routine NICU procedures over a period
      of 7 days and to assess the early neurobehavioural outcome in these babies with the help of a
      well designed double blinded randomized controlled trial.
