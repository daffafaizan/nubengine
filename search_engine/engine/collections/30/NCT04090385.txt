      recruited from the reference centers in neurology and physiotherapy in Jo√£o Pessoa. After
      recruitment of participants, they will be randomized into three groups: Group 1 - tDCS over
      Primary motor cortex (M1) + Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); Group 2 - tDCS over
      Primary motor cortex + Frontal polar area (FPA); Group 3 - tDCS over Primary motor cortex. In
      each condition, an initial baseline assessment (T0) will be performed after 15 treatment
      sessions (T1) and 30 days after the end of the protocol (Follow-up Assessment - T2), during
      which time participants will not receive any type of treatment. The outcomes evaluated will
      be: Motor and cognitive function, executive functions, attention and planning, balance, gait
      speed an quality of life. For all analyzes, the statistical software SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago
      IL, USA) for Windows, version 20.0, will be used and considered significant, an alpha value
      of 5% (p <0.05 ).
