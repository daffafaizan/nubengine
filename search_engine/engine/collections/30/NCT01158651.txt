      procedures to find out if you can be in the research study. These tests and procedures are
      likely to be part of regular glioma care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not
      take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently,
      they may or may not have to be repeated.

      A medical history, which involves questions about your health history, any medications you
      are taking or plan to take, and any allergies.

      A physical exam, during which you will be asked about any problems that you might be having.
      Additionally, your clinician will check your vital signs (body temperature, heart rate,
      breathing rate, and blood pressure) and bodily systems (respiratory, nervous, digestive,
      etc). The doctor will also evaluate your performance status, which indicates how much your
      illness affects your activity level.

      Blood tests, including tests to measure any effects of your disease. Approximately 1-2
      teaspoons of blood will be drawn for these tests.

      Urine test, which will be done to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly.

      An assessment of your tumor using scans of the brain. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will
      be used to look at and evaluate the tumor.

      An Electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of your heart

      A pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential. A small amount of blood (about half a
      teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for this test.

      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will
      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able
      to participate in this research study.
