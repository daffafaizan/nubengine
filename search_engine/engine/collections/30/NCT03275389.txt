      circulating virus strains.

      However, influenza viruses constantly change their surface glycoproteins that are the targets
      of most immune responses, allowing them to escape pre-existing immunity, a process called
      antigenic drift. Therefore, seasonal influenza vaccines have to be reformulated and
      re-administered on an annual basis. In addition, novel viruses can appear at irregular
      intervals and cause influenza virus pandemics that can claim millions of lives.

      GSK Biologicals is now developing a new influenza vaccine that contains modified inactivated
      influenza viruses. The purpose of this approach is to elicit an immune response that would
      protect against all current and future circulating influenza strains without having to
      administer the vaccine each year.
