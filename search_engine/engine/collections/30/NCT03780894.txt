    
      A pilot, non-randomized, open-label study of two intervention arms and controlled with the
      standard treatment in which 60 patients affected with acute hemorrhage due to severe trauma
      will enter the study with the main objective of evaluating the feasibility and the efficacy
      of early treatment during the pre-hospital care phase with packed red blood cells, fibrinogen
      concentrate and tranexamic acid (experimental arm) compared to the standard treatment based
      on crystalloids administration and tranexamic acid (control arm). The secondary objectives
      are to evaluate the safety and clinical evolution of the patients. Prior to the
      administration of the treatment, 2 blood samples will be extracted in both groups in order to
      compare the coagulation status and to be able to perform the pre-transfusion tests. On
      arrival at the hospital, another sample will be taken to compare changes in coagulation after
      the administration of the experimental or standard treatment and also between both groups.
      The assessment of the coagulation status will be made using the values provided by the
      viscoelastic test (TEG6s). The experimental and standard treatment will be administered
      endovenously. After treatment, patients will be evaluated up to 30 days.
