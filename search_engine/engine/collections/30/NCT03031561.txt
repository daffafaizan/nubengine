      I. Evaluate MicroPure relative to grayscale ultrasound imaging for the identification of
      microcalcifications with mammography as the reference standard.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate MicroPure compared to grayscale ultrasound imaging and mammography for the
      characterization of breast abnormalities associated with microcalcifications using biopsy
      results as the reference standard (sensitivity and specificity will be calculated).

      II. Evaluate MicroPure relative to specimen x-ray imaging for the identification of breast
      microcalcifications with pathology as the reference standard.

      III. Estimate the improvements in patient care that may be achievable if MicroPure guided
      core needle biopsy procedures can replace some surgical excisions for the evaluation of
      breast abnormalities.
