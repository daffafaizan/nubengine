      is also very high worldwide. In the United States, about one third of 800,000 stoke patients
      became disabled; while in Taiwan, 13,000 out of 68,000 stroke patients died each year.

      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) characterizes the three-dimensional distribution of water
      diffusion, which is highly anisotropic. Previous studies utilized DTI derived mean
      diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) have found correlation between pathological
      changes of white matter and prognosis of stroke. However, the result was not specific due to
      the reason that any change at either axon or myelin sheath resulted in FA reduction. DTI, on
      the other hand, differentiate morphological change at axon and myelin sheath with axial and
      radial diffusivity, respectively. With this data, we hypothesized that the prognosis might be
      more relevant to pathological change with axon post-stroke when compare to Diffusion-Weighted
      imaging (DWI)/Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC).

      Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a newer technique which use fully velocity
      compensation gradient echo sequence to receive magnitude and phase imaging. SWI can be used
      to detect early phase bleed, intra-arterial thrombus, cerebral venous thrombosis, thus
      evaluate the prognosis of patients by detect leptomeningeal collateral circulation and
      intravascular deoxygenation changes. We hypothesized that the prognosis is better in
      post-stroke patients with preserved leptomeningeal collateral circulation and venous
      circulation of large blood vessel. Therefore, we conduct the study to use DTI derived axial
      diffusivity and SWI to evaluate the severity and to predict the functional outcome in acute
      ischemic stroke patient.
