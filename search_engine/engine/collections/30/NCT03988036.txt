      rather than analysis of the overexpression/amplification status of only HER2. As this
      subgroup is often correlated with a high expression of TILs and PD/PD-L1, immunogenic therapy
      strategies seem very promising. The pCR highly correlates with the overall outcome of
      patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [7]. Therefore, the pCR rate after neoadjuvant
      treatment has been adopted as a surrogate endpoint and, more recently, as a basis for
      accelerated drug approval [38].

      Due to the high number of patients achieving a pCR after standard treatment of anti-HER2
      therapy combined with chemotherapy, de-escalated strategies seem promising and designing a
      chemotherapy-free trial regimen is therefore modern, justifiable and of high scientific
      value. Therefore, we designed a prospective phase II, single arm, hypothesis-generating trial
      investigating the rate of pCR in patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer receiving four
      cycles of dual anti-HER2 blockade in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab.
      Further translational research will be added to gain further insight into the tumor response
      or resistance to this treatment approach. The addition of standard chemotherapy after this
      study treatment will be at the discretion of the investigator. In case of a non-pCR after
      study treatment, continuing treatment with chemotherapy and antihormonal therapy in case of
      HR positive disease is highly recommended.
