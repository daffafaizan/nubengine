      I. To evaluate the safety profile of HSPPC-96 (vitespen) administered concurrently with
      temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

      II. To evaluate survival in patients treated with an autologous tumor-derived heat shock
      protein peptide-complex (HSPPC-96) with concurrent temozolomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) from date of surgical resection. II. To
      evaluate the immunologic response to vaccine treatment in a subset of evaluable patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Approximately 2-5 weeks after standard radiation therapy and temozolomide completion,
      patients receive vitespen intradermally (ID) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Beginning 2 weeks
      after the 4th dose of vitespen, patients receive a 5th dose of vitespen ID and maintenance
      temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5 (of 28 day courses). On day 21 of course 1, patients
      receive the 6th dose of vitespen ID and continue vaccinations monthly. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of vaccine depletion, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
