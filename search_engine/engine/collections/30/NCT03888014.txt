      green) and using that and a near infrared mode on a standard operating room microscope to see
      the information provided for vascular or neoplastic (tumor related) neurosurgical problems.
      The technique uses the data from the microscope and using ICG with augmented reality
      overlaying the data into the microscope view (this is the new process). The technique is
      called GLOW800.
