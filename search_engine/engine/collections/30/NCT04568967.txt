    
      To investigate the effect of an expanded TB screening strategy among HIV-positive patients
      admitted to hospital (including sputum Ultra, urine FujiLAM and urine Ultra assay) on the
      proportion of microbiologically-confirmed TB cases starting treatment within 72 hours of
      enrolment compared to Ultra (on sputum/any tissue) on symptomatic patients only and AlereLAM
      (on urine) in those fulfilling WHO testing recommendations.

      to assess the impact of this screening strategy on 2-month all-cause mortality.

      â€¢ to assess the feasibility of multiple specimens' collection for TB diagnosis within 72
      hours of enrolment.
