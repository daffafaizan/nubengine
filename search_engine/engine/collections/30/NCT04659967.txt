      of hearing loss treatment for older adults with hearing loss, with a particular interest in
      adults that have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Age-related hearing loss (ARHL)
      in persons with MCI or dementia may exacerbate dementia-related symptoms such as depression,
      apathy, agitation/aggression. Moreover, engagement and activity participation are recognized
      as critical aspects of dementia care management, but those individuals who also experience
      ARHL are at a disadvantage. A pilot testing of behavioral communication intervention will be
      completed at multiple Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) sites in New
      England. A multicomponent hearing care intervention will be tested that includes staff
      training and non-custom personal amplification use with older adults in a group care setting.
      This feasibility study will lead to the refinement of the intervention protocols to be used
      in a future grant application that will test the real-world efficacy of the intervention.
