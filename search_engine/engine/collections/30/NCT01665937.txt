      once weekly for the first 3 weeks of each cycle and no treatment on the fourth week. STA-9090
      will be given by intravenous (IV) infusion. IV infusions occur through an IV catheter (or
      tube) placed in the vein. Each infusion will last about 60 minutes.

      During each cycles patients will have blood tests, pregnancy test, and EKG. Twenty to thirty
      days after the last dose, patients will return for a physical exam, blood tests, urine test,
      EKG, and CT or MRI of chest and abdomen.
