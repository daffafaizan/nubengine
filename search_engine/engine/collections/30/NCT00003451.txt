      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interferon alfa when preceded by a single dose of
      interleukin-12 in patients with recurrent or metastatic melanoma or other advanced
      malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive interleukin-12 IV push on day 1, followed by escalating doses
      of interferon alfa by subcutaneous injection at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. Courses repeat
      every 2 weeks for 6 months (12 courses total) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and
      disease progression. Patients achieving partial response or stable disease at the completion
      of 6 months of therapy may receive additional courses of therapy for up to 24 months. Dose
      escalation of interferon alfa continues in subsequent cohorts in the absence of dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT). If 1 of 3 patients experiences DLT at a dose level, then 3 additional
      patients are entered at that dose level. If 2 of 6 patients experience DLT, then dose
      escalation stops. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as 1 level below that dose at which 2
      or more of 6 patients experience DLT. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
