      decompensate personality disorder patients in hospitalization. The study is structured as a
      pilot study, thus will enroll 20 patients only. Patients, upon being hospitalized and after
      signing the consent to participate in the study, will be randomized to two groups: The first
      will be treated by the novel, LOOP, concept' the other will be TAU, as routinely done with
      PersDis patients in the investigators facility. The outcome parameters will be changes in
      series of questionnaires filled upon being enrolled and at the end of the intervention.
      Another outcome parameter will be readmission rates in the post-intervention period (3
      months).

      The LOOP conceptualizes the psyche by a three-dimension structure: the space (the potential
      of experiencing, the "place" where the investigators experiences occur), the content (the
      experiences themselves; action, thoughts, feelings, experiences and being) and the order (the
      relationship between the various contents). The LOOP intervene with these three dimensions by
      a structures scheme, aimed at allowing the patient to quickly reclaim the responsibility on
      his psyche, stabilize and initiate long-term rehabilitation processes.
