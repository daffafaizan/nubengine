      fibromyalgia, despite the lack of larger randomized controlled trials (RCT) supporting an
      effect.

      LDN has antagonistic effect on both opioid receptors and on toll-like receptors in glia
      cells. Mediated via those receptors, LDN can potentially reduce neuroinflammation and induce
      homeostasis in the endorphin system in patients with fibromyalgia.

      The aim of the trial is to investigate whether treatment with LDN has a superior effect
      compared to placebo on pain among female patients with fibromyalgia, evaluated after 12 weeks
      of treatment. The study is also exploring secondary aims regarding a possible improvement of
      other fibromyalgia core symptoms and a possible improvement of global assessment, daily
      functioning and health-related quality of life. Among the exploratory secondary objectives
      are changes in muscle exhaustion, physical fitness, pain sensitivity, inhibition of pain,
      augmentation of pain, and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
