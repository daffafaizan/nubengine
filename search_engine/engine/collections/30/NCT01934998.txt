        1. Parkinsonism and other non-ataxia symptoms are more commonly present in SCA6 patients
           than we used to think.

        2. Parkinsonism is associated with the loss of DAT in striatum.

        3. Parkinsonism and other non-ataxia symptoms are also associated with the expanded allele
           repeat number, the disease duration, and the severity of ataxia, in addition to DAT
           loss.
