      combination of a Bifidobacterium adolescentis strain and the prebiotic galactooligosaccharide
      (GOS) in a human clinical trial. The synbiotic combination was selected based on a novel in
      vivo selection; specifically, the strain (BD1) is an human autochthonous gut organism that
      was enriched in an individual by GOS. Our experiments will test the efficacy of this
      synbiotic compared to a conventional synbiotic. We hypothesize this rationally selected
      synbiotic will improve intestinal barrier function in obese adult subjects, thereby
      preventing endotoxemia and metabolic inflammation, physiologically relevant functions that
      are increased in obese individuals. Our objectives are to: (1) compare the ability of the
      test and control synbiotic preparations to alter the gut microbiota in obese individuals; (2)
      test if GOS supports colonization and metabolic activity of test and control strains in the
      human gut; (3) compare the ability of the two synbiotic preparations to improve intestinal
      permeability and endotoxemia in obese subjects; and (4) assess associations between the gut
      microbiota and the test strain with biomarkers for translocation and endotoxemia.
