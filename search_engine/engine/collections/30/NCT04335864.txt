      pregnancy loss following IVF. A meta-analysis demonstrated that the implantation rate and
      clinical pregnancy rate decreased by 50% in patients with hydrosalpinx. The negative
      consequences could be due to embryotoxic properties, a decrease in endometrial receptivity,
      and hydrosalpinx fluid mechanically flushing the embryo from the uterus.

      Although laparoscopic salpingectomy and laparoscopic proximal ligation increase ongoing
      pregnancy rates in women with hydrosalpinges, those interventions are invasive and carry
      anaesthetic and surgical risks, especially in the presence of extensive adhesions, often seen
      in women with hydrosalpinges. In view of the possible adverse effects of laparoscopic
      surgery, an alternative less-invasive treatment for hydrosalpinges prior to IVF would be
      useful.

      The effectiveness of hysteroscopic tubal occlusion when compared with salpingectomy has not
      been established. Randomized clinical trials comparing both procedures prior to IVF are
      lacking.

      The present study was designed to compare hysteroscopic tubal occlusion and laparoscopic
      salpingectomy in the treatment of hydrosalpinges prior to IVF.

      This study hypothesized that in women scheduled for IVF/ICSI hysteroscopic proximal occlusion
      of hydrosalpinges would be non-inferior to laparoscopic salpingectomy in terms of ongoing
      pregnancy rates following IVF/ICSI.
