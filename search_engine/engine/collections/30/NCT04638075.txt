      separation of mother and neonate and/or complex medical issues that make direct breastfeeding
      difficult. The Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) is utilized infrequently in the NICU and
      there is little data available to compare breastfeeding outcomes of mothers who supplement by
      bottle compared to SNS. The aims of this study are to understand whether supplementation by
      SNS improves breastfeeding outcomes compared to neonates supplemented by bottle. From
      December 1, 2018 - November 30, 2019 there were 195 neonates admitted to Children's Hospital
      Colorado (CHCO) with a primary diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia who were born at 37 weeks or
      greater. This makes up approximately 13.7% of all admissions during that time frame. This is
      a population of mothers at risk for cessation of exclusive breastfeeding due to the necessity
      of supplementation. These neonates are frequently supplemented because the mother's milk
      typically is not yet in to support adequate nutritional intake. These neonates are not often
      medically complex or have any factors that would bias the results of this study.
