      zurich. Patients planned for surgery in general anaesthesia with intubation, aged 0 to 16
      years and with a body length suitable for the emergency tapes can be included in this study.
      Patient and parental information is performed during the pre-anaesthetic visit. After written
      consent the patient will be included. PatientÂ´s length and weight will be measures earliest
      one day before data collection. Data collection during anaesthesia has no influence on the
      daily anaesthesia routine and has no impact on patient safety and anaesthesia. Patient's data
      is made anonymous for further inspection.

      Data is documented in Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis calculated with SPSS. 500
      patients are needed for a power of 80%. Primary outcome parameter is length-based weight
      estimation, secondary outcome parameters are length-based age estimation and the correctness
      of recommended anaesthesia material (endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask, oropharyngeal mask
      and face mask). Both tools (algorithm and pediatric emergency tape) will be compared with
      eachother regarding primary and secondary outcome parameters.
