      an improved version of the FFM, named DexTrain, for the rehabilitation and specific training
      of the fingers in subjects suffering from stroke. In this study the investigators will
      compare the effect of conventional therapy with that of the DexTrain method, particularly on
      the function of the hand and its spontaneous use at home (ecological condition). To better
      understand the mechanisms involved, the investigators will also study brain plasticity using
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (SMT) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
