      two months chronological age with the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine,
      regardless of birth weight and gestational age. However, several investigators, employing
      historical controls and subjective observations, have reported an increased incidence in
      prolonged apnea and bradycardia in preterm infants following immunization. Consequently, many
      primary care providers do not adhere to recommended AAP guidelines. The purpose of this study
      is to reexamine the relationship between receipt of DTaP and the occurrence of prolonged
      episodes of apnea and bradycardia in preterm infants, while employing a random control study
      design and an objective assessment of cardiorespiratory events.

      Ten participating hospitals will enroll infants < 37 completed weeks gestational age into the
      study when they are 56-60 days chronological age. Infants are randomly assigned into one of
      two groups: One group receives DTaP immunization and the control group does not (until study
      is completed). Physiological event recording monitors are used continuously during the next 2
      days to document the incidence of prolonged apnea (respiratory pause of ≥20 sec in duration
      or >15 sec in duration if associated with bradycardia for ≥5 sec) and prolonged bradycardia
      (heart rate <80 bpm that lasted ≥10 sec) in all infants. The presence and number of episodes
      during the 48-hour period will be compared between the 2 groups.
