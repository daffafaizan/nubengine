      increased attention to improve patient recovery and quality of life. Narcotic analgesics are
      frequently utilized in postoperative pain management, but these have risks including nausea,
      sedation, constipation, and dependence. Multimodal analgesia can reduce narcotic use and
      improve recovery, but medical comorbidities may contraindicate the use of certain
      medications. Non-pharmacologic measures for postoperative pain control may provide novel and
      cost-effective strategies to confront this complex issue.

      Patients undergoing head and neck surgery will be randomly allocated to participate in an
      immersive experience in VR, or to participate in a similar experience on a two-dimensional
      screen using a smartphone.
