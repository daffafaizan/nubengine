      relatively rare and the evidence base is limited. This prospective non-randomized controlled
      intervention study aimed to evaluate hospital-based home care for children with cancer.

      A hospital-based home care program was conducted August 2008 - December 2009. Participants
      were children with cancer and their parents. The intervention group received part of their
      therapy, such as intravenous chemotherapy and antibiotics, as home care by a hospital-based
      home care nurse with paediatric-oncology experience. Children in the control group received
      all their treatment at the hospital.

      Fifty-one children between 0 and 18 years were included in the home care program, and 47
      children were included in the control group. After each home visit the parents answered a
      questionnaire. The results from 657 questionnaires showed that 100% were very satisfied or
      satisfied with home care and all would choose home care again, if offered as an option. There
      were no deaths or adverse effects of intravenous chemotherapy or antibiotics. A cost analysis
      based on the expenses associated with home care in correlation with standard cost of
      inpatient admissions and outpatient visits showed that the hospital-based home care programme
      was economically equal. The children's and the families' quality of life may be enhanced. The
      results indicate that the hospital-based home care program is safe, economically neutral and
      the parents' satisfaction with the program is major.
