      UE training in these patients through brain image, motor control and clinical measures; 2. to
      determine the maintaining therapeutic effects; 3. to elucidate the most optimal treatment
      protocols; 4. to determine the neuro-motor control mechanism underlying clinical improvement;
      5. to determine the clinimetric properties of the brain imaging and motor control measure
      that are responsive and valid for detecting changes after treatment protocol intervention,
      and 6. to identify clinical predictors influencing the outcome for treatment protocols.

      The research will offer valuable motor control biomarkers for outcome prediction and
      targeting patients who benefit from new protocols. This project is significant for the
      translational and evidence-based medicine on stroke neurorehabilitation.
