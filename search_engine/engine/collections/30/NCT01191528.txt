      status to a combination of pulse SpO2 monitoring and EtCO2 nasal cannula monitoring with
      Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI). Using combination monitor, each subject will serve as their
      own control with repeated measurements of respiratory rate, SpO2, EtCO2 and IPI at 5 second
      intervals. Patients will be monitored for a minimum of 8 hours after admission to the acute
      care unit and through the first night.

      Subjects for this study will be a convenience sample post-operative in-patients admitted to 2
      East after surgery at Allenmore Hospital/Multicare Health System a 75 bed community facility.
