    
      This is a controlled, randomized, 3-treatment, 3-period crossover study in subjects with
      self-reported dry mouth symptoms as determined by subject responses (as determined by the
      response to "relieving the discomfort of dry mouth" question from the modified Product
      Performance and Attributes Questionnaire I/ Moisturization and Dryness (PPAQ I/ MD)) compared
      to water. Subjects enrollment is based on the responses to the Dry Mouth Inventory (DMI). A
      sufficient number of volunteers will be screened to ensure enrollment of up to 30 subjects at
      Acclimation. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will continue into the treatment
      phase of the study. Safety will be assessed by Oral examinations at Baseline/Day1 and Day 4.
      Subjects will complete questionnaires at Baseline (before product use Day 1 only), after
      immediate use, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours after supervised product use on Day 1
      and Day 4 of each period. The PPAQ II questionnaire will be completed in the morning of Day 4
      of each period. Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment sequences at the Baseline
      visit of Period 1. The treatment and washout periods will be repeated until all three
      treatment periods have been completed.
