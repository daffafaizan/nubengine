    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limited toxicities (DLTs) of
      venetoclax in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy in patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Phase I).

      II. Evaluate the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + CR with inadequate count
      recovery [CRi]) of the regimen after 2 cycles. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate other clinical efficacy endpoints (minimal residual disease [MRD] negativity,
      duration of response [DOR], event-free survival [EFS] and overall survival [OS]).

      II. Determine the safety of the combination regimen.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate apoptotic protein expression and Bcl-2 dependency on response and resistance
      to the combination regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax, followed by a phase II
      study.

      CHEMOTHERAPY AND VENETOCLAX:

      CYCLE 1: Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, vincristine
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 7 and 17, cyclophosphamide IV twice daily (BID)
      over 3 hours on days 7-9, and dexamethasone IV over 30 minutes or PO QD on days 7-10 and
      17-20. Patients may also receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days 7 and 17 per physician
      discretion.

      CYCLES 2, 4, 6, and 8: Patients receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21, methotrexate IV over
      24 hours on day 1, and cytarabine IV BID over 3 hours on days 2 and 3. Patients may also
      receive rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days 1 and 8 per physician discretion.

      CYCLES 3, 5, and 7: Patients receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21, cyclophosphamide IV BID
      over 3 hours on days 1-3, vincristine IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 11, and dexamethasone
      IV over 30 minutes or PO QD on days 1-4 and 11-14. Patients may also receive rituximab IV
      over 4-6 hours on days 1 and 11 per physician discretion.

      T-CELL ALL: After the first 4 cycles, patients receive nelarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5
      and pegaspargase IV over 2 hours on day 5. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 2 cycles (after
      cycle 4 and 5) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients may receive prednisone PO QD on days 1-5, vincristine IV over
      15 minutes on day 1, and venetoclax, PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 2
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      T-CELL ALL (MAINTENANCE THERAPY): After the first 5 cycles of maintenance therapy, patients
      who received nelarabine and pegaspargase will receive nelarabine IV QD over 2 hours on days
      1-5 and pegaspargase IV over 2 hours on day 5 during maintenance cycles 6 and 7 instead of
      prednisone, vincristine, and venetoclax.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
