    
      Each consented patient will have a single administration of [F-18]HX4 and will immediately
      undergo one list mode PET/CT imaging session lasting 60 minutes followed by three additional
      list mode PET/CT acquisitions from 90 to 110 minutes, 150 to 170 minutes and 220 to 250
      minutes after administration. The start times of the last three image acquisitions are
      permitted to be within Â± 5 minutes. Venous blood samples will be collected throughout the
      initial scan sequence and at the time of each subsequent acquisition for calibration and
      metabolite-correction of the image-derived input function. On the day of administration
      (Visit 2) blood for clinical safety evaluations will be drawn pre- and post-dosing after all
      imaging is complete.

      The pre-surgery [F-18]FDG PET/CT clinical scan performed prior to the [F-18]HX4 procedure,
      and the surgery at Visit 3 are standard of care for the consented patients.
