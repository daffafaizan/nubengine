    
      There are 3 parts to the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive ZL-2102 or matching
      placebo (3: 1 ratio) in Parts 1 and Part 3 of the study. Subjects in Part 2 will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive ZL-2102 in each possible treatment sequence (fed/fasted or
      fasted/fed).

      In Part 1 (ZL-2102-SAD), the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the study drug or
      placebo will be tested after a single dose in the form of a capsule when given after an
      overnight fast. There will be 7 groups. Groups 1 to 7 will have a total of 8 participants in
      each group, with 56 participants total in all 7 groups. Each group will receive a different
      dose of the study drug or placebo in the following order of strength: 5, 20, 60, 150, 300,
      500, 750 mg. Plasma samples will be collected in
      0H,0H30M,1H,2H,3H,4H,5H,6H,8H,10H,12H,16H,24H,48H and on Day 8. Urine samples will be
      collected at 0-4,4-8,8-12,12-24,24-28H intervals. Subjects will be confined to the unit for 3
      days and the follow-up observation period is 7 days after the administration.

      Part 2 of the study (ZL-2102-FED) will test the effect of a high-fat meal on safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the study drug after a single dose in 12 healthy male
      subjects. Choice of dose of ZL-2102 will be made based on review of the blinded preliminary
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics data in Part 1. No subjects will receive placebo in
      Part 2. Two single doses separated by at least a 7-day wash-out period. One dose will be
      given under fed (standardized high-fat breakfast) and one will be under fasted conditions.

      Part 3 of the study (ZL-2102-MAD) will test the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      the study drug after repeated doses of the study drug. Three dose level groups (9 active and
      3 placebo) with 12 healthy male subjects will be enrolled.Choice of the actual daily ZL-2102
      doses will be made based upon a review of the blinded preliminary safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics data in Part 1. Three ascending once-daily repeated doses of ZL-2102 or
      placebo for 14 days or, alternatively, twice daily for 14 days if indicated by
      pharmacokinetics parameters from Part 1 (ZL-2102-SAD). If the dose needs to be twice daily,
      the total daily doses will be given half in the morning and half in the evening 12 hours
      later. Dose will be administered either under fed or fasted conditions depending on blinded
      Part 2 (ZL-2102-FED) results.

      The trial will be conducted in Linear Clinical Research Ltd.by Principle Investigator Janakan
      Krishnarajah,MD and his team.
