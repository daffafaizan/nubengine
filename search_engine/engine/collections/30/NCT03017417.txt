      with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There is an unmet clinical need for
      interventions which can improve quality of life, functional capacity and cancer related
      fatigue. Adjunctive exercise therapy could be a potentially effective treatment for these
      men. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated numerous benefits in physiological and
      psychosocial outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer. Further, there is observational
      evidence linking physical activity with reduced disease specific mortality after a diagnosis
      of cancer. Observational data also indicates that preserving skeletal muscle mass can improve
      responses to chemotherapy. The proposed study will assess the feasibility of an exercise and
      dietary intervention in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer with secondary outcomes
      assessing improvements in physical functioning, fatigue, quality of life, and body
      composition.
