      function, work conditions and work ability and consume substantial public resources. An often
      overlooked fact in this context is the relationship between musculoskeletal disorders and the
      importance of a normally functioning visual system. People who have a visual impairment in
      adulthood often experience reduced health and life satisfaction. Many people lose their faith
      in order to continue with the activities previously carried out as to cope with their life,
      their work, and in some cases,personal care. Rehabilitative efforts to reduce the negative
      effects often involve the prescription of various visual aids which, in turn, often leads to
      unfavourable ergonomic and static postures with further increased risk of musculoskeletal
      problems. A prevention of such disorders is likely to allow them to continue their work,
      which is important from both an individual and a society perspective. The overall objective
      of the project is to evaluate the effects of an intervention program and develop a
      theoretical model for the relationship between near work, eye disorders and musculoskeletal
      disorders. The intervention is to be evaluated in a randomized trial on people with impaired
      vision and pain in the neck and scapular area. An intervention based on development and
      adaptation of an established physiotherapy practice in order to increase body awareness, body
      control and movement patterns will be evaluated. The effects of the intervention will be
      measured by a variety of outcome measures derived from WHO's ICF-model. An innovative
      solution for establishing proprioception and eye-hand coordination in everyday activities,
      the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool, will be used.
