      with low sodium(10mEq), in randomized order. Twenty-four hour urine sodium and urine
      creatinine levels verify diet compliance. Blood pressure measurements are recorded during
      each diet week by automated blood pressure monitoring system. Each blood pressure is taken in
      the right arm 3 times while the subject is sitting quietly for 45 minutes .
