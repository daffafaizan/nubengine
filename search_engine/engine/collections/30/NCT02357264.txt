      the lungs in patients with pre-eclampsia vs pregnant patients without pre-eclampsia. Patients
      admitted to the obstetrical service will be recruited for study enrollment. We will divide
      our patients into two groups. In the study group, we will include patients with pre-eclampsia
      with or without shortness of breath, and in the control group, we will include otherwise
      healthy pregnant patients. We will exclude patients who are in labor or who are undergoing
      induction. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the study.

      Study subjects will then undergo an ultrasound of the chest, performed by a member of the
      Emergency Medicine Ultrasound Division, who have experience in performing lung ultrasounds.
      Both hemithoraces will be divided into 4 zones: anterior inferior, anterior superior, lateral
      inferior, and lateral superior. Each zone will be assessed for the presence of B-lines. For a
      zone to be considered "positive" for pulmonary edema, there should to be a minimum of 3
      B-lines. To diagnose a patient with pulmonary edema, at least two zones in both hemithoraces
      must be positive. The study investigator will document the presence of B-lines in each
      particular zone on the data collection sheet. Brief representative video clips will be
      recorded for each zone.

      After completing the sonographic examination, the images will be transmitted wirelessly from
      the ultrasound machine to a secure web based cloud (Q-path) and will be subsequently
      interpreted by expert reviewers who will be blinded to any clinical information about the
      patient. They will also document their findings on a separate data collection sheet.
