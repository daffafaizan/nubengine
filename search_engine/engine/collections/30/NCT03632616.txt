    
      This is a multicenter prospective cohort study assessing the impact of endoscopic
      interventions on patients with chronic pancreatitis. Patients with chronic pancreatitis
      referred for endoscopic treatment, including pancreatic duct dilation and stenting,
      pseudocyst drainage, celiac plexus blocks, and pseudocyst drainage/necrosectomy will be
      enrolled in this study. They will receive a baseline evaluation using the PANQOLI, a chronic
      pancreatitis-specific quality of life instrument, in addition to a visual analog scale to
      measure their pain. Demographic and endoscopic features will be collected in addition to pain
      medication use. Patients will receive follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months post-intervention
      consisting of the PANQOLI, visual analog scale for pain, and pain medication use.
