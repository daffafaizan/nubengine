      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pegol-Sihematide versus ESPO. Study included a
      period of 4 weeks for screening, 16 weeks for dose adjustment, 8 weeks for evaluation, and 28
      weeks for extensional treatment period. Eligible patients were centrally allocated in a 2:1
      ratio to receive Pegol-Sihematide subcutaneously once every 4 weeks, starting at 0.04 mg per
      kilogram of body weight, or ESPO once every 1 week or 2 weeks, starting dose of 6000 IU per
      week. Doses of both drugs were adjusted to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between
      10.0 and 12.0 g per deciliter for 52 weeks or more. The primary efficacy end point was the
      mean change from the baseline hemoglobin level to the mean level during the evaluation
      period; non-inferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence
      interval was -1.0 g per deciliter or higher. Cardiovascular safety was evaluated on the basis
      of an adjudicated composite end point.
