      order to develop individualized smoking cessation aids. The intranasal insulin administered
      is an investigational drug and has been granted IND status by the FDA (IND#129432). During
      the times of drug effects, the investigators will evaluate a biomarker using computerized
      tasks. Non-smokers and smokers will participate in two testing sessions where the biomarker
      will be critically evaluated after administration of intranasal insulin and compared to the
      cognitive processes elicited by placebo administration.
