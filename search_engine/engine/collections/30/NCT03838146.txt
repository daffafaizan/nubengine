      What offspring metabolome markers are altered with regular maternal exercise? The
      investigators will use a randomized design of 160 women to either exercise intervention
      (aerobic training, resistance training, or both) or usual care (controls). Infant cord tissue
      and blood will be sampled at birth while blood will be sampled at 1 month of age. Similarly,
      infant neuromotor and morphometric examinations will be performed at 1 month. and at 1-month
      of age via blood sample, neuromotor, and morphometric examinations. The rationale for the
      project is to elucidate the effects of maternal exercise on offspring health outcomes and
      determine specific metabolic targets predictive of offspring long-term disease risk.
