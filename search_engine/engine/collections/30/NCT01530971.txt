      about desaturation. However, the evidences for giving oxygen was not strong, and the
      condition nowadays can be detected immediately with pulse oximeter which is a standard
      monitoring.

      After this study finished, we will set a safety guideline for supplemental oxygen for healthy
      parturients undergoing elective cesarean section.
