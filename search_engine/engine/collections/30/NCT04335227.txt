      number generator) to participate in randomized, single blind randomized controlled, study.
      Recruited patients with 128 female with PCOS will be randomly divided into four groups, yoga
      therapy (YT) group, aerobic exercise (AE) group, combined YT and AE (cYTAE) group and control
      group. Duration of the intervention will be 60 minutes in one session for 6 days/week for 12
      weeks. Thus, each women with PCOS will receive 72 sessions in total, except in control group.
      Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) and other biochemical markers such as, Follicle-stimulating
      hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), Testosterone, Prolactin, Thyroid-stimulating hormone
      (TSH) Ultrasensitive, Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), insulin fasting, glucose
      fasting, HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) and the lipid profiles
      which includes, total cholesterol, High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and serum triglycerides. In addition to the above biochemical
      markers, transvaginal ultrasound to estimate antral follicle count (AFC) will be recorded at
      baseline and at the end of 12-week post-intervention period. Following the 12-week
      intervention, follow-up of another 12-week will be carried out to determine the retention of
      treatment effects.
