      chronic disease management through the WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework.

      These projects emerged from the observation that the rich country model of care
      (patient-centered, hospital-centered and specialist approach with regular clinical and
      paraclinic follow-up) was not transferable to developing countries, The limitation of human,
      technical and financial resources.

      A paradigm shift is needed to improve cardiovascular disease control in a more cost-effective
      manner.

      The SPICES project plans to integrate the current knowledge of new studies to improve the
      prevention and control of cardiovascular disease in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.

      Rich countries and developing countries will therefore be involved in the study: the selected
      sites are France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, South Africa and Uganda.

      This study is a stage of observation in the different countries which will make it possible
      to make an inventory of the places and to target the most adapted interventions.

      The main objective is to define the representations on cardiovascular prevention and the
      follow up of patients with cardiovascular disease or FDRCV.

      The secondary objectives are to identify:

        -  the brakes in the management of patients with CVD or FDRCV

        -  the institutional care network for these patients

        -  Identify the "informal" care network, that is, family and community caregivers and
           within them the potential barriers and facilitators to their care.
