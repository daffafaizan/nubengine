      to the combination of Carboplatin plus Pemetrexed plus Bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with stage IV non-squamous,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with
      a historical control of carboplatin plus pemetrexed plus bevacizumab.
