      that will determine whether the negative effects of combined oral contraceptive (COC) therapy
      on bone turnover are dependent on the route of administration such that an attenuation of
      these effects is observed when a comparable dose of non-oral contraceptive therapy, such as
      vaginal contraceptive (CVR) therapy is also tested. Millions of women use COC therapy for
      birth control purposes or regulation of menstrual cycles. CVR therapy is a relatively new
      FDA-approved contraceptive alternative to COC. The purpose of the proposed project is to
      investigate whether oral ethinyl estradiol (EE) may negatively impair bone turnover when
      compared to vaginally-administered EE in young physically-active women.

      A novel calcium tracer technology suitable to rapidly assess changes in net bone calcium
      balance in a small sample size will be applied to evaluate the effects of COC and CVR therapy
      on bone turnover. The radioisotope Calcium-41 (41Ca) demonstrates increased sensitivity when
      compared to dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and increased specificity for bone mineralization
      and precision when compared to biochemical markers of bone turnover. This study will be the
      first study to examine how the route of estrogen administration affects bone turnover in
      young physically active women by assessing changes in net bone calcium balance with different
      forms of contraceptive therapy.

      The overall purpose of this study is to explore the effects of oral versus vaginal
      contraceptive therapy on bone turnover in young exercising women using 41Ca technology. In an
      effort to expose the route-dependent effects of oral versus non-oral contraceptive therapy on
      bone turnover, the investigators will examine 1) the effects of ethinyl estradiol on bone
      calcium balance using the 41Ca technology and 2) the underlying physiological mechanisms
      associated with the effects of oral versus vaginal contraceptive therapy on net bone calcium
      balance.
