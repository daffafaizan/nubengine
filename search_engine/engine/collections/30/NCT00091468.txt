      loss in some people experiencing mild memory problems (referred to in this study as "mild
      cognitive impairment" or MCI). The study will last approximately 12 months and will be
      conducted at 3 clinical sites in the United States.

      Recent studies have suggested that one of the causes of memory disorders may be a reduction
      in a particular chemical substance in the brain. This chemical substance, acetylcholine, is
      thought to act on certain brain cells in a specific way that helps us to remember and use
      memories as well as affect our mood. In MCI (and Alzheimer's disease), the level of
      acetylcholine may be changed, and this may impair brain functioning. Preliminary studies have
      suggested that short-term administration of nicotine appears to improve memory in patients
      with mild memory loss and early Alzheimer's disease. Nicotine imitates many of the actions of
      acetylcholine. By administering nicotine over a longer period of time to patients with MCI,
      this study could lead to a better understanding of whether nicotine can act to improve memory
      loss symptoms over the longer term and whether it can help delay the progression of memory
      loss symptoms. The amount of nicotine in each patch used in this study is the same level
      found in patches that are used in people who are trying to quit smoking.

      This study will include up to twelve visits.
