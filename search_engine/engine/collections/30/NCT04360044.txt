      attacks with 4 different treatments. Inhaled cannabis will be administered using a portable
      vaporization system (Mighty Medic; Storz & Bickel) based on a validated Storz & Bickel system
      and using a standardized inhalation approach. Subjects will self-administer inhaled cannabis
      as early as possible in the course of a migraine (see Procedure), taking 4 puffs of 1) THC,
      2) THC/CBD mix, 3) CBD, or 4) placebo. Patients will treat each of the 4 distinct migraine
      attacks with a different cannabis sample. Outcomes measured will include pain freedom and
      pain relief as well as presence or absence of photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea at 1 hour,
      2 hours (primary outcome), 24 hours, and 48 hours.
