      Tele-home health care, which providers for video interactions between home-based veterans and
      home care nurses, is a potentially useful adjunct to home care services. However, few
      randomized trials have been conducted of this technology.

      Objectives:

      The primary objectives were to determine if tele-home health care patients, compared with
      patients receiving usual home care, have:1) higher levels of health related quality of life
      and home care satisfaction; 2) fewer inpatient admissions, hospital stays, and outpatient and
      emergency room visits; and 3) higher levels of home care access, in terms of the total number
      of contacts between HBPC nurses and patients.

      Methods:

      Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or to the control group. Video
      tele-health units were installed in patient homes for the intervention group, and control
      group patients received usual home care services. Baseline and six month follow up surveys
      included questions on perceived health related quality of life and home care satisfaction.
      T-tests were used to compare intervention and control group members in terms of six month
      changes in health related quality of life and satisfaction with home care. Multivariate
      analyses were used to assess group differences in six month health care service use, with
      prior service use and survival included as covariates.

      Status:

      The study is completed, with a final enrollment of 37 patients. Three study manuscrip[ts have
      been completed (two published and one under review).
