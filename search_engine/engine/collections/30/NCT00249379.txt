      and has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an effective
      therapy for alcohol dependence. In the past ten years, drug court programs have been
      implemented as one possible solution to reduce the burden placed on state and federal
      correctional systems. These programs are generally focused on non-violent drug dependent
      offenders and are offered as an alternative to incarceration. However, the use of acamprosate
      has never been examined for alcohol relapse prevention among a drug court population, or
      among those on probation or parole.

      Comparison: Alcohol-dependent criminal justice supervisees who receive acamprosate, compared
      to participants who do not receive acamprosate.
