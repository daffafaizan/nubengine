    
      (1) Objective: a. (Phase 1) Assess the safety of fixed dose or, as needed, de-escalated
      ibrutinib/pembrolizumab in patients with MCL (Cohort A) and CLL (Cohort B) to determine
      recommended phase 2 dosing.

      b. (Phase 2A): Assess CR rate of combination ibrutinib/pembrolizumab therapy, in comparison
      to historical data of ibrutinib monotherapy, in patients with MCL (Cohort C) and CLL (Cohort
      D).

      Hypothesis:

      This is an open-label Phase 1/2A study, which consists of Phase 1 (Safety Assessment Cohorts)
      utilizing a 3+3 dose de-escalation design and Phase 2A (Expansion Cohorts) utilizing a single
      arm one-stage design.

      All patients receive a 28 day lead-in of ibrutinib and thereafter, a treatment 'cycle' is
      defined as a course of treatment of 21 days starting with the intravenous administration of
      pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each cycle along with once daily oral intake of ibrutinib on all
      days.

        1. The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will be safe and well tolerated.

        2. The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will result in higher CR rates compared
           to historic data of ibrutinib monotherapy in cohorts of CLL and MCL.

      Secondary Objectives & Hypotheses

      (1) Objective: (Phase 2A): Assess duration of response, overall response rate, and duration
      of stable disease, compared to historical data of single agent ibrutinib, in patients with
      MCL (Cohort C) and CLL (Cohort D).

      Hypothesis: The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will increase duration of
      response, overall response rate and duration of stable disease when compared to historical
      data of single agent ibrutinib.
