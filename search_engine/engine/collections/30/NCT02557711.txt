      tools for spasticity assessment. But these clinic methods cannot reveal the architecture and
      stiffness of muscles. In recent years, ultrasound elastography and acoustic radiation force
      impulse (ARFI) are used in musculoskeletal disorders, including spasticity. There are no
      studies about the correlation between spasticity and ultrasound elastography /ARFI imaging in
      stroke patients. The investigators will enroll 50 stroke patients with hemiplegia and biceps
      brachii muscle spasticity. One physical therapist will measure MAS and MTS for spasticity of
      biceps brachii muscle. Two physiatrists will perform ultrasound elastography and ARFI for
      intra-rater and inter-rater reliability evaluation. The evaluations of B-mode ultrasound,
      elastography and ARFI included Heckmatt scale, biceps brachii ratio, strain ratio, dynamic
      sonoelastography score, color intensity, and shear wave velocity. After performing all
      assessments, the investigators will analyze the correlation between the clinic tools and
      elastography/ ARFI imaging and evaluate the reliability of elastography/ ARFI imaging in
      spasticity evaluation.
