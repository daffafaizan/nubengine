      obstetric clinic in a regional hospital will be recruited for the study. The obstetric
      department is a tertiary referral center in the region and part of a university teaching unit
      which catered to an annual delivery of around 10,000 women. A group of first trimester
      pregnant women with nearly the same age is recruited as controls.
