      has a high probability of containing cancer. During the procedure, a scalpel is used for the
      skin incision and a traditional electrosurgical device is used to cut away the breast tissue
      from the chest and control bleeding. Once the breast tissue is removed the remaining skin
      edges are brought together with sutures.

      Following mastectomy, the most common complication is persistent serous wound drainage and
      seroma, a collection of fluid in the closed surgical space. To help prevent this complication
      a tissue drain is used to remove serous fluid from the surgical space via bulb suction. The
      rate of serous fluid collection is used to determine the time the drain remains in place.
      Although suction drains help reduce seroma formation, prolonged use may delay healing, cause
      injury, and increase the risk of infection and patient discomfort.

      The PEAK PlasmaBladeâ„¢ uses pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy to enable precision cutting and
      coagulating at the point of application, without the thermal damage to surrounding tissues
      that is normally seen with traditional electrosurgery. The PlasmaBlade has received FDA
      clearance for use in plastic, general, and ENT surgery, and has demonstrated significantly
      reduced serous drainage in tissue reduction surgeries, like mastectomy.

      This multi-site study was granted IRB approval and conducted between June 2009 and January
      2011. Potential subjects were screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the
      study protocol and were then required to provide informed consent prior to enrollment.
      Following enrollment, subjects were prospectively randomized to the SOC or PlasmaBlade (PB or
      PEAK) study groups and scheduled for mastectomy with or without same day reconstruction.
