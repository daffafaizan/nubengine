      rapid (after 4 weeks) and early (after 12 weeks) virologic responses according to serum HCV
      RNA level PCR data. In patients without virologic response after 12 weeks, AVT was
      discontinued, and they were withdrawn from the study. Patients with EVR were enrolled in a
      follow-up period. During the follow-up period, patients of the first and the second group
      will receive Algeron in the selected therapeutic dose in combination with ribavirin, patients
      of the third group - PegIntron in combination with ribavirin during 12 or 36 weeks (depending
      on a genotype of the virus), afterwards they will be followed up without therapy for 24
      weeks.
