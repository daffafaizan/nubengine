      safety and efficacy of the Previvo System in the recovery of embryos.

      This study will recruit up to 500 healthy premenopausal volunteers. Subjects will undergo
      either natural cycle (NC)/intrauterine insemination (IUI), or controlled ovarian
      hyperstimulation (COH)/intrauterine insemination (IUI) and have the lavage procedure
      performed 4-6 days post IUI. It is anticipated that embryos recovered will be cryopreserved
      for future use or donated for future use.

      Subjects will be followed up with for up to 30 days after the lavage procedure. All data will
      be collected on paper CRFs and analyzed by the Principal Investigator and Study Sponsor.
