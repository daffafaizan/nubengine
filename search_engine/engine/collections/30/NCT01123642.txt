      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) OEF/OIF Veterans over time
      and to identify potentially malleable resilience factors associated with higher levels of
      functioning. A total of 300 returning OEF/OIF Veterans will be followed for a one-year
      period. Veterans will complete a baseline assessment, followed by three follow-up assessments
      (two self-report assessments mailed at 4- and 8-months post-baseline and a one-year in-person
      follow-up assessment that repeats many of the baseline clinician-administered assessments).
      Multiple functional outcomes will be evaluated, including occupational, family, social, and
      physical functioning. The specific aims include: 1) identifying whether a "dose-response"
      relationship exists between level of exposure to stressors (pre-deployment,
      deployment-related, and post-deployment) and functioning over time; 2) examining whether
      potentially malleable resilience factors predict higher levels of functioning in returning
      Veterans over time; 3) examining whether psychopathology predicts lower levels of functioning
      in returning Veterans over time; 4) testing the theoretical model that psychopathology
      partially mediates the effects of stress, social support, coping, and neurocognition on
      functioning over time; 5) examining whether changes in the use of healthy coping strategies,
      social support, post-deployment stress, and psychopathology predict changes in functioning
      over time; and 6) exploring whether stress, social support, coping, neurocognition, and
      psychopathology have differential effects on specific aspects of functioning (e.g.,
      occupational, family, social, and physical functioning) over time. The long-term aim of this
      research is to develop evidence-based early intervention and treatment programs designed to
      assist returning OEF/OIF Veterans with achieving optimal functioning when reintegrating into
      civilian life. In keeping with the VHA's goal of operationalizing principles of recovery and
      rehabilitation in treatment planning, this research should provide a platform of empirical
      data to assist with the further development of meaningful early intervention and treatment
      programs to assist OEF/OIF Veterans with the post-war readjustment process over time.
