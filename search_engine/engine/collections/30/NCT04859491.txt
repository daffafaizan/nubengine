      placebo-controlled between-subject design to examine the effects of carbohydrate (CHO) and
      carbohydrate-protein (CHO-P) supplementation on short-term recovery following aerobic
      interval exercise (INT) and time to exhaustion (TTE) testing in maters class athletes. After
      completing the informed consent and screening process (Visit #1), each participant will be
      assessed for their anthropometric measures as well as body composition and will complete a
      graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a cycle ergometer to determine VO2peak.
      Forty-eight to 72 hours after Visit #1, or VO2peak testing, participants will return to the
      lab for familiarization with the INT exercise protocol and TTE test (Visit #2). Within
      forty-eight to 72 hours after familiarization (Visit #2), participants will return to the lab
      for Visit #3 to complete INT exercise and TTE, a 2-hour passive recovery period including the
      consumption of one of three treatments (CHO, CHO-P, PLA), followed by repeated INT exercise
      and TTE, heart rate variability and sweat rate determination. Participants will also complete
      the Nutritional Recovery Practices, Knowledge, and Beliefs of Australian Triathletes survey
      during the 2-hour recovery period. Participants will be asked to complete the ASA24Â®, an
      automated self-administered 24-hour dietary assessment tool during the 5-9-day period between
      familiarization (Visit #2) and the experimental protocol (Visit #3).
