      is termed null responders. Null responders are the most treatment refractory population.
      Treatment for null responders is currently limited: retreatment with SOC results in
      approximately 5% sustained virologic response (SVR).

      CTS-1027 may facilitate the activity of interferon by preventing MMP-induced cleavage and
      deactivation in both phases of clinical response to therapy. In addition, CTS-1027, like
      ribavirin, alone does not significantly affect viral replication, but both CTS-1027 and
      ribavirin are likely to impact response to therapy during the second and slower phase of the
      clinical response.

      The potential of MMP inhibition to facilitate the action of interferon, together with
      ribavirin-driven up-regulation of interferon stimulated genes, has the potential to yield a
      potent host immune response in this highly resistant null-responder patient population.
      Again, since MMP inhibition is thought to target the second slower phase kinetics, the
      initial treatment duration in this trial will be 24 weeks.

      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTS-1027 combined with SOC in patients
      who did not previously respond to SOC therapy.
