      exercise capacity predicts death in patients with CF and is also associated with a steeper
      decline in lung function and more lung infections. A critical barrier to improving exercise
      tolerance in patients with CF is the investigators lack of knowledge regarding the different
      physiological mechanisms which contribute to their lower exercise capacity. We have
      compelling data to indicate that the blood vessels may contribute to the low exercise
      capacity in CF. The impact of this proof of concept investigation will test Phosphodiesterase
      Type 5 inhibitors (PDE5) inhibitors as a potential therapy in CF and will explore blood flow
      and endothelial function as potential mechanisms which contribute to exercise intolerance in
      CF. Improvements in exercise capacity will not only contribute to a better quality of live
      for patients with CF, it will also increase longevity in these patients.
