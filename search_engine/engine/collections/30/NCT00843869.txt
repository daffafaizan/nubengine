      biomarker of exposure to tobacco smoke, we will attempt a more objective study to examine the
      association between tobacco smoke and chronic rhinosinusitis. (CRS) Likewise, zinc deficiency
      is documented in numerous animal and human studies to decrease resistance to infectious
      diseases and is especially common among smokers. We will explore our hypothesis that SHS
      exposure and zinc deficiency contribute to CRS. To accomplish this, we will measure serum
      zinc and hair nicotine levels in CRS patients and correlate them to a variety of CRS
      diagnostic indicators. A second objective of this study is investigating alterations within
      the epithelium lining the sinonasal cavities in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The
      alterations may be one or a combination of anatomic, genetic, inflammatory, or infectious
      etiologies. To further investigate these possibilities we plan on taking residual clinical
      material from endoscopic sinus surgery specimens and performing various in vitro
      investigations including but not limited to microarray analysis, northern and western blot
      analysis, ciliary beat frequency analysis, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and
      propagation of tissue with tissue culture techniques. Tissues taken from non-sinusitis
      patients undergoing sinonasal surgery will serve as a non-chronic rhinosinusitis control
      source of sinus mucosa.
