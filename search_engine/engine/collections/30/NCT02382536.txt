    
      This is a single center, open label study.

      Each subject is to receive up to 4 basal/bolus diluent infusions in the abdomen with the BD
      Scarlett and the Medtronic Quick-setÂ®; 2 Scarlett infusion sets and 2 Quick-set infusion
      sets. The order of device placement will be randomized.

      After insertion, insulin diluent will be delivered at a rate of 0.01 mL/hour (equivalent in
      volume and rate to 1.0 unit/hour of U-100 insulin) via the insulin pump for a minimum of 3
      hours. After 3 hours of basal infusion, a bolus of 0.1 mL (equivalent to 10 units) will be
      delivered via the insulin pump and basal infusion continued for a minimum of 1 additional
      hour.

      At the end of the final basal infusion period, the infusion set tubing will be clamped to
      mimic an occlusion event and allowed to run until either an occlusion alert ("no delivery")
      is signaled by the pump, or a minimum of 30 minutes, whichever comes first. Infusion pressure
      data will be collected during the entire infusion period, including the time the tubing is
      clamped. After removal of the device from the body, the presence of fluid on the application
      site skin (Leakage) will be determined by visual assessment then measured using gravimetric
      analysis, if applicable.
