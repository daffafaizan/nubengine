      research study evaluating the single-use plaque removal efficacy of a new children's
      battery-operated toothbrush and a marketed children's manual toothbrush. This study will
      accept up to 60 juvenile subjects, 5-8 years of age, in anticipation that 50 subjects will
      complete the study. Qualified subjects with sufficient plaque, according to Rustogi Modified
      Navy Plaque Index (RMNPI) will be randomly assigned to one of two sequence treatment groups.

      After the pre-brushing plaque evaluation at each of the evaluation visits, subjects will
      brush with the assigned toothbrush and toothpaste provided for timed brushing under
      supervision, in front of mirror.
