      removal due to cardiac device infections, (ii) a bridge to heart transplantation, (iii) in
      the early post-myocardial infarction period with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (LVEF
      <30%), (iv) and a recent coronary revascularization with LV dysfunction (LVEF < 30%). There
      is no current comparator to LifeVest. In France, patients at high risk for sudden cardiac
      arrest (SCD) and waiting for heart transplant or ICD are hospitalized or discharged home
      without any particular ECG monitoring. LifeVest has been demonstrated to automatically detect
      and terminate rapid ventricular arrhythmias. Introduction of LifeVest into the current
      patient management would definitely improve the clinical outcomes and benefit the patients
      with temporary risk of SCD. The use of LifeVest was shown to be effective in protecting
      patients against SCD in the United States. However, the clinical impact of using LifeVest in
      France remains unassessed. Therefore we are planning to conduct a post-market study in France
      to provide efficacy and safety data for the reimbursement dossier renewal before April 2017.
