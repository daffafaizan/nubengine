    
      This is a prospective, Phase 3, multi-center, open-label study designed to assess the use of
      18F-mFBG PET imaging in subjects with known or presumed neuroblastoma. Eligible participants
      will have either histopathologically established diagnosis of neuroblastoma or a presumed
      diagnosis based on signs, symptoms, physical examination, imaging findings, and laboratory
      and genetic test results.

      Subjects will only be administered 18F-mFBG if they have undergone or are scheduled to
      undergo a 123I-mIBG or 18F-FDG scan within 30 days of the date of the 18F-mFBG scan. Subjects
      should not have received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy between the clinical
      and 18F-mFBG imaging studies.

      18F-mFBG PET studies and clinical 123I-mIBG scans will be evaluated off-site by 3 independent
      radiologists and/or nuclear medicine physicians who are blinded to all subject information.
      Blinded readers will record whether findings on 18F-mFBG and 123I-mIBG scans are consistent
      with presence of neuroblastoma (Disease +) or absence of disease (Disease -).

      Subject-level diagnostic performance will be assessed on the basis of positive and negative
      percent agreement (PPA and NPA) between the blinded 18F-mFBG scan interpretations and disease
      status (+ or - for neuroblastoma) as independently assessed by an Expert Panel of pediatric
      oncologists.

      Secondary efficacy analyses will compare PPA and NPA between 18F-mFBG and 123I-mIBG
      interpretations provided by the blinded readers.
