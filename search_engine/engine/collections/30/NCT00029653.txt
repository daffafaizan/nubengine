      stimulation (TMS) on free will to select movement. There have been debates that most of human
      voluntary movements are reflexive rather than volitional in nature, although most people feel
      that their movements are freely chosen. This issue is illuminated by previous TMS studies
      showing external bias of freely chosen movements by TMS. Recently, we tried to confirm these
      observations using a more reliable method with subthreshold TMS, but failed. Thus, in this
      study, we are planning to use suprathreshold TMS to test whether this type of stimulation on
      different motor areas influences free selection of movements or not.
