    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will assess the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of 2 dose levels of COR388 oral capsules in subjects with probable
      AD dementia according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA)
      criteria. The study will enroll approximately 573 generally healthy male and female subjects
      ≥55 and ≤80 years of age. Enrolled subjects must have a documented diagnosis of mild to
      moderate AD dementia. The subject should not have other conditions or brain imaging
      abnormalities that can explain the symptoms of dementia. All subjects will be encouraged to
      have LPs (during screening, week 24 and week 48) in the absence of medical conditions that
      can increase the risk of the procedure in the opinion of the Investigator. Cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF), saliva, and blood will be analyzed for measurements of biomarkers of AD and
      neuroinflammation, and for the presence of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of
      Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis [Pg]). A subset of sites will monitor subjects for
      clinical evidence of periodontitis at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks.

      The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a treatment phase of
      up to 48 weeks, and a safety follow-up phase of 6 weeks.
