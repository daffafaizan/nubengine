      affecting motor neurons, resulting in progressive weakness. Currently there is no known cure
      and a specific cause has not been identified. Creatine is a nutritional supplement that
      improves mitochondrial function and has been shown to protect motor neurons in animal models
      of ALS. Preliminary research indicates that creatine may also improve strength in patients
      with ALS. This study will determine the effect of creatine treatment on short-term muscle
      strength and long-term muscle deterioration in patients with ALS.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either creatine or placebo.
      Participants will be enrolled in the study for 9 months. Quantitative muscle testing will be
      done weekly for the first 3 weeks; participants will then be followed monthly for the next 4
      months and bimonthly for the remainder of the 9-month study. The study will also monitor
      purposeful exercise to determine if this enhances the benefit of creatine usage on muscle
      strength. Pulmonary function testing will accompany the muscle testing to determine if
      creatine strengthens respiratory muscles, thereby enhancing pulmonary function.
