      age with fragile X syndrome (FXS), funded by a National Fragile X Foundation Grant. It is a
      controlled trial of minocycline, an antibiotic commonly used in children for infection or for
      treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. We are investigating its use in FXS because it
      lowers matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels, which are high in FXS, and it also
      strengthens brain connections in the animal models of FXS. We hypothesize that minocycline
      will likely be helpful for language, behavior and/or cognition in fragile X patients.

      The aim of this study is to carry out a double-blind placebo controlled trial of minocycline
      treatment in children with FXS who are 3.5 to 16 years of age. At baseline, we will assess
      behavior and perceptual and cognitive development. After the children have been treated for 3
      months with either minocycline or placebo, they undergo the same baseline testing. They will
      then cross over and be treated for a second 3 months. We will carry out testing again at the
      end of the second 3 month period. We will also assess the side effects of minocycline
      treatment throughout the study.
