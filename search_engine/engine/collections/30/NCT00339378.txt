      cancer. The Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a prospective cohort study of pesticide exposure
      among 51,000 pesticide applicators in North Carolina and Iowa, provides an opportunity to
      study childhood cancer incidence and mortality among the children of pesticide applicators.
      Name and dates of birth for 21,985 children were previously provided by adult participants in
      the AHS. The current study seeks to identify cases of cancer among these children through
      record linkage to state cancer and death registries. Cancer incidence and mortality within
      the cohort will be compared with national data through standardized incidence and mortality
      ratios. A limited case-cohort comparison of pesticide exposures will also be performed.
      Approximately 44 cases of childhood cancer are expected to be identified. No follow-up or
      contact with cases is anticipated. It is anticipated that the study results will provide
      insight into the relationship of pesticide and other farm exposures to the pathogenesis of
      childhood cancer.
