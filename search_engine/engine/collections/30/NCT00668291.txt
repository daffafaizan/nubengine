      the primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) in patients with CNC, isolated
      PPNAD or carriers of PRKAR1A and PPNAD1 (PDE11A4) germline mutation (Cohort CNC-PPNAD). In
      this cohort genotype/phenotype correlation will be studied. A second aim is to determine the
      frequency of PRKAR1A germline mutation in patients with isolated cardiac myxoma or isolated
      lentiginosis (Cohort L-MC).
