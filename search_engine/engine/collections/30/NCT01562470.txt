    
      Twenty subjects will be recruited through advertisements in local newspapers. Eligible
      subjects will be asked to visit the lab, where they will sign an information/consent form and
      answer a series of questions to determine their eligibility. If eligible, each subject will
      be asked to have their upper leg cellulite photographed, and thigh circumference will be
      measured. They will be given two containers of cream, labelled R (for right thigh) and L (for
      left thigh) which have been pre-weighed in their containers, and they will be instructed on
      how to apply the cream. They will record their perception of the amount of cellulite on a
      weekly basis, and they will also record any adverse events. At the two and four-month
      time-points, they will return to the lab with their diaries and cream. The cream in its
      container will be weighed to ensure compliance, and the diaries will be examined and returned
      to the participants. Thighs will again be photographed and circumference measured. At the
      four-month visit, subjects will return any remaining product for weighing, as well as their
      diaries for analysis.

      Photographs from each subject will be coded and cellulite marks assessed by arranging the
      photographs chronologically, i.e. timepoint 1, timepoint 2 and timepoint 3. They will also be
      assessed by a (blinded) trial researcher, who will assess cellulite appearance on a
      precisely-measured upper leg area in the photographs. The subjects' own perception of
      cellulite appearance, from their diaries, will be numerically coded, and all three measures
      will be collated and analysed statistically.
