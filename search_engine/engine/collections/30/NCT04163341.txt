      the adapted CETA intervention. Enhanced usual care will include provision of feedback about
      psychiatric diagnoses to the HIV provider and the clinic's behavioral health team for
      follow-up according to the clinic's standard care. Participants randomized to the adapted
      CETA arm will initiate CETA with the trained counselor. The number of CETA sessions will
      depend on the patient's presentation but will range from 7-13 weekly in-person 1-hour
      sessions.Before randomization, enrolled participants will complete a baseline assessment
      including sociodemographic information; self-reported health; standardized assessments of
      depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and substance use; and key related
      structural and psychosocial factors including housing stability,intimate partner violence
      (IPV), other violence in the home, coping, social support, and experiences of stigma related
      to mental health.

      Participants in the Enhanced Contact arm will complete a follow-up research assessment at 3
      months post baseline.Participants in the adapted CETA arm will complete this assessment after
      the final CETA session,also expected to be at approximately 3 months post-baseline. All
      participants will complete a final research assessment at 9 months post-baseline
      (approximately 6 months post-treatment exit for those in the adapted CETA arm). These
      follow-up assessments will assess the same domains as the baseline assessment.
