      laparoscopic approach for repair of paravaginal defects associated with anterior vaginal wall
      prolapse .fifty participants with cystocele of lateral type offered laparoscopic paravaginal
      repair. the investigator used a 10mm laparoscope, with video camera, was introduced through
      the umbilical trocar. Another 5 mm in suprapubic area and two 10 mm trocars in right and left
      lateral abdominal sides were introduced. The larger trocar was needed to accommodate the
      passage of needles into the abdomen. Spacing of trocars sufficiently from each other was
      needed to facilitate laparoscopic suturing. Transperitoneal approach to retropubic space was
      used. Two to four polypropylene sutures were applied on each side. Sutures were tied with
      intracorporeal . The study evaluated the following outcomes Operative time, intra-operative
      blood loss, hospital stay , post-operative urinary symptoms, post-operative pain, fever,
      haematuria, post-operative vaginal wall prolapse .
