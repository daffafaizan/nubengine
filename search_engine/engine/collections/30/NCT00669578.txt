    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Phase I:

      Primary

        -  To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of CC-4047 in the treatment of Primary, Post
           Polycythemia Vera, or Post Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (PMF, post-PV MF, or
           post-ET MF).

      Phase II:

      Primary

        -  Best overall response as determined by International Working Group Criteria over the
           first 6 cycles (168 days) of study treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Safety (type, frequency, severity [National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
           Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0] of adverse events (AEs), and
           relationship of AEs to CC-4047.

        -  Duration of response.

        -  Time to response.

        -  Best overall response as determined by International Working Group Criteria over the
           first 12 cycles (336 days) of study treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CC-4047. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then every 6 months
      for up to 3 years.
