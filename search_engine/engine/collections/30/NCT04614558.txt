      monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) develop renal disease and the
      reason for abnormal deposition of immunoglobulin in renal parenchyma remains unclear in these
      disorders. The proposed research will be conducted as a part of clinical trial which intends
      to prospectively evaluate the effect of anti-plasma cell therapy on renal outcomes in
      patients with monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). The study specifically
      intends to sequence the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes to determine any
      abnormalities that could lead to production of a misfolded immunoglobulin thus leading to
      deposition in renal parenchyma.
