      proprioceptive feedback during post-stroke walking. The sensory information available to
      participants will be augmented by providing vibration of the hip abductor musculature that is
      scaled to the near-real-time mechanical state of their body. The central hypothesis is that
      augmented proprioception will improve participants' perception of their body's motion, thus
      increasing the mechanics-dependent modulation of step width, an important gait stabilization
      strategy. This clinical trial will establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a
      rehabilitation intervention centered on repeated exposure to sensory augmentation during
      gait. Specifically, participants in the experimental group will complete training sessions
      twice a week for four weeks in which they receive sensory augmentation during ~30 minutes of
      treadmill walking. Participants in the activity-matched control group will perform the same
      task, except the hip vibration will be randomly delivered, not linked to the body's actual
      mechanical state. Changes in walking balance and foot placement accuracy will be quantified
      over the course of the intervention.
