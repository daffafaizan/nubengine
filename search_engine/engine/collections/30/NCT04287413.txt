      implementing a new physiotherapist-led primary care model for people with low back pain
      (LBP).

      The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of integrating a
      physiotherapist (PT) within primary care teams for people with LBP and making them available
      to patients as the first point of contact. The specific aims of the research are to
      determine:

        1. Whether a PT-led primary care model for LBP is effective at improving function (primary
           outcome), pain intensity, quality of life, global rating of change, and adverse events
           in comparison to usual physician led primary care.

        2. The impact of a PT led primary care model for LBP on the healthcare system and society
           (healthcare access, primary care physician workload, healthcare utilization, missed
           work, and cost-effectiveness). A process evaluation will assess the healthcare
           delivered, potential mechanisms, context of implementation, and perspectives of patients
           and primary care providers towards the PT-led primary care model.
