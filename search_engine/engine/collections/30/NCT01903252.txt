    
      This is a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority
      trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 3.2 g of TP05/day compared to 3.2 g/day of
      Asacol™ with an open label extension to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of TP05
      administered over a 26 week period. A total of 817 subjects with mildly to moderately active
      UC were evaluated. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 3.2
      g/day of TP05 (administered once daily(OD)) or 3.2 g/day of Asacol™. The primary efficacy
      outcome was assessed at Week 8. All subjects who respond to TP05/Asacol™ (response or
      remission) continued receiving blinded study treatment for up to 12 weeks. After that,
      subjects could enroll in an Open Label Extension (OLE) for 26 weeks duration to receive TP05.
      Subjects failing to respond to study drug at the Week 8 visit could enroll in the OLE at week
      8 and received 4.8 g/day of TP05.
