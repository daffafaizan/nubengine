      of influenza over the decades. However, two major hurdles remain in the global approach to
      influenza prevention. First, recent epidemiology research has demonstrated that immune
      response and protection in elderly populations are suboptimal resulting in significant
      seasonal influenza disease in this population every year. Second, while preparations for the
      emergence of pandemic influenza strains have progressed, current egg-based manufacturing
      methods have not provided sufficient global capacity. Furthermore, the genesis and scale-up
      of other manufacturing platforms will not rapidly solve this problem. Thus, safe and
      effective ways are needed to improve protection in the elderly as well as reduce the antigen
      dose in younger populations in preparation for global needs of pandemic vaccines.

      Historically it is known that presentation of antigens in particulate form, for a wide range
      of pathogens, has clear advantages over the presentation of soluble antigen alone. A novel
      approach using highly uniform particles has been developed which utilizes size, shape, and
      composition to control the delivery and presentation of the vaccine antigen(s) to the immune
      system. Production of these highly uniform particles is possible because of a proprietary
      manufacturing approach called Pattern Replication in Non-wetting Templates (PRINTÂ®).

      The proposed approach is to use the PRINT process to make bioabsorbable particles to improve
      the immune response and efficacy of the seasonal influenza vaccine. It is proposed that
      mixing properly sized and charged particles with commercial trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV)
      will increase vaccine effectiveness and/or decrease the amount of antigen necessary to induce
      an immune response.
