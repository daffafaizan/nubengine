    
      The overall goal of this research study is to estimate the sex-specific incidence of
      hospitalization or emergency department visit for severe complications of urinary tract
      infections, defined as pyelonephritis and urosepsis, in patients who are prescribed
      dapagliflozin compared to patients prescribed other specific oral antidiabetic drugs.
      Dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Because of the mechanism of action for dapagliflozin and results from small safety monitoring
      studies, there is interest in further evaluating the safety of dapagliflozin in large
      populations.

      The study will be implemented in three administrative health care data sources in two
      countries: in the United Kingdom, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); and in the
      United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare databases and
      the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM). Individuals in the databases will be
      included in the study if they meet the following age criteria; 18 years and older (CPRD and
      HIRD), or 65 years or older (Medicare); and if they did not have type 1 diabetes, are new
      users of one of the study drugs and meet the criteria of at least 180 days of electronic data
      before their first prescription of the study drug. The study period starts July 1, 2013 in
      CPRD, January 1, 2014 in PHARMO and January 9, 2014 in the United States data sources, and
      will end at the latest available data at each database at the time of analysis
