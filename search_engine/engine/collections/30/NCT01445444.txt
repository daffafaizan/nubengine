    
      The purpose of this research study is to further investigate how well Habit Reversal Training
      (HRT) works to reduce hair-pulling symptoms in children and adolescents with trichotillomania
      (TTM).

      All children will have the option to receive 8 weekly HRT sessions. Half of all children will
      be chosen at random to receive these sessions immediately following the pre-assessment and
      the remaining half will receive them after eight weeks (TAU condition). These sessions will
      focus developing skills for managing TTM and to decrease hair pulling. Such skills may
      include teaching your child to replace hair-pulling with another behavior. In the TAU
      condition, participants will seek the treatment in the community, with the option of
      receiving HRT treatment sessions at the end of the study.

      Participants in both groups will undergo four assessments in total (1) Pre-Assessment; (2)
      Post-treatment Assessment; (3) One-month Follow-up; (4)Three-month Follow-up. These
      assessments will involve several interviews that ask about different psychological symptoms
      that your child experiences such as sadness, anxiety, and TTM.
