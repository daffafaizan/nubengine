      myocardial ischemic conditions, even at the expense of a loss of specificity. Myocardial
      infarction type 2 is due to an imbalance between needs and oxygen supply to cardiomyocytes at
      the time of an increase of the first and / or a decrease of the second and is favored by an
      underlying cardiovascular field fragile. Syncope, because of the low flow that they imply,
      can be the cause of a type II myocardial infarction on fragile cardiovascular ground.

      The study is prospectively conducted in all patients admitted for syncope to assess the
      actual diagnostic performance of hypersensitive troponin in the syncope risk stratification.
      The primary benefit is to identify patients at risk of serious cardiac events in the short
      term. The secondary benefits expected from the study are a decrease in unjustified
      hospitalizations of patients admitted to the emergency for syncope and thus a decrease in the
      cost of care.

      The validation of the indication of the troponin assay in the stratification of the risk
      after a syncope passes by its prospective evaluation in a prognostic study.
