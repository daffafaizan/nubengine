      innovative telemedicine services using a patient-centred approach and a common rigorous
      assessment methodology. In 9 European regions in the implementation of health-related
      information and communication technologies service solutions are already operational at local
      level for the remote monitoring and the treatment of chronic patients suffering from
      diabetes,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular diseases. The services are
      designed to give patients a central role in the management of their own diseases, fine-tuning
      the choice and dosage of medications, promoting compliance to treatment, and helping health
      care professionals to detect early signs of worsening in the monitored pathologies. Every
      area will designed its own real-life trial with certain common elements.
