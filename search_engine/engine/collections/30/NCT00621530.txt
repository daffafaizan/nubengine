      subset of patients, also results in chronic pain. The purpose of the study is to test whether
      intrathecal ketorolac, by selectively and effectively blocking cyclooxygenase in the spinal
      cord, will reduce hypersensitivity surrounding the surgical wound in patients with high risk
      for developing chronic pain after surgery. We have chosen to study patients having total hip
      arthroplasty (THA) because chronic pain seems to be a significant problem after surgery. We
      will sample cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prior to injection of the study medication for
      subsequent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) analysis in each patient. We will also assess each patient
      at 48 hours after their surgery for hypersensitivity at their surgical site.
