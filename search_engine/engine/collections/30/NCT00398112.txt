      I. Assess the response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response) in patients with
      relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma treated
      with sunitinib malate.

      II. Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Assess duration of response,
      time to progression, overall survival, and CR rate in patients treated with this drug.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate if known risk stratification parameters (i.e., immunoglobulin mutational status,
      ZAP-70 status, fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] defects, and/or CD38 status) are
      related to clinical response to sunitinib malate.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically for translational and pharmacological studies,
      including IgVH gene mutation status and ZAP-70 status. Samples are examined by fluorescent in
      situ hybridization (FISH) and other assays.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
