      SC-48334, which has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since SC-49483 causes significantly less
      gastrointestinal toxicity than SC-48334, the combination of SC-49483 with AZT may improve the
      benefits of both drugs in patients with HIV infection.

      Patients are randomized to receive AZT alone or in combination with one of two doses of
      SC-49483, administered three times daily. Treatment continues for 16 to 24 weeks. Per
      07/19/94 amendment: At the end of 24 weeks, blinded treatment continues for an additional 4
      weeks, at which time patients may receive open-label drug on an optional basis for 90 days.
