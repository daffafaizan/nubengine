      surgery (open-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma, age and gender matched) with age
      and gender-matched controls (healthy patients undergoing cataract surgery). For this the
      investigators will collect plasma, urine and aqueous humor to be analyzed through mass
      spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Patients have a night fasting
      period prior to sample collection, and a lifestyle and food frequency questionnaire is filled
      to control for nutritional influence on metabolites. Diabetic patients are excluded, since it
      would confound our analysis.
