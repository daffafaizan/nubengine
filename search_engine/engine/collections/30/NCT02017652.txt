    
      1. Validate FS-II abdominal StO2 measurements from the intestines, liver, and flank to
           umbilical venous and arterial blood oxygen saturation.

        2. Validate FS-II cerebral StO2 measurements against the predicate FDA cleared FORE-SIGHT-I
           (FS-I) monitor.

        3. Collect data from FS-II sensors on the forehead and abdomen (intestine) for 24 hours to
           compare dynamic changes vs the pulse oximeter. For larger neonates, add a predicate FS-I
           sensor to the opposite side forehead for dynamic comparison to FS-II measurements.

        4. Obtain abdominal Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) data simultaneous with accepted
           measures of bowel motility (a. frequency and composition of stools, and b. Ultrasound
           assessment for the frequency and magnitude of bowel peristalsis, if available).
