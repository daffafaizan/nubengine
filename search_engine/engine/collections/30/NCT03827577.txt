    
      Lung cancer is a systemic disease with local manifestations that are ultimately responsible
      for a reduced life expectancy in a relatively large subgroup of metastatic lung cancer
      patients.

      In such a subgroup, local ablative therapy of the primary tumor and of all metastatic lesions
      with a combination of surgery and/or radiotherapy should lead to a clinically significant
      improvement of their overall survival with acceptable morbidity and preserved Quality of Life
      compared with medical treatment alone

      OMEGA is a randomized trial of local ablative therapy in NSCLC patients with potentially
      resectable or locally controlled primary tumors and oligometastatic disease

      The decision to randomise OM-NSCLC patients either before any systemic therapy or after 3
      months of treatment without progression is left to the recruiting centre(s).

      Local ablative therapy will be administered in any case to patients harboring cerebral
      oligometastasis

      Statistical methods

      Dynamic balancing as per the method of Pocock and Simon [16] according to:

        -  Synchronous vs. metachronous presentation

        -  Number of oligometastases (1 vs. 2-3) including extrathoracic N3 disease

        -  Nodal status (N0 vs. N+)

        -  Oncogene-addiction (EGFR/ALK/ROS-1 driven or PDL1 >50% vs <50% vs. wild type)
