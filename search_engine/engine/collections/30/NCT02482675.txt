    
      This study consists of four, 3-hour postprandial trials in response to consuming the
      following dietary treatments: 1. oral glucose challenge, 2. oral glucose challenge in
      combination with non-fat milk, 3. oral glucose challenge in combination with whey protein
      isolate, and 4. oral glucose challenge in combination with sodium caseinate. For three days
      preceding each trial, participants will be provided all meals to standardize physiologic
      responses to test meals. On each trial day, vascular function will be assessed and blood
      samples collected prior to and at 30 minute intervals for 3 hours following test meal
      ingestion.
