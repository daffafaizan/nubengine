    
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, which will enroll 128
      patients hospitalized due to AHF. These patients with wet-warm phenotype whose estimated
      glomerular filtration rates at admission are above 15 and below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and
      cumulative urine output <300 mL in 2 hours after the first dose of intravenous furosemide
      will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a standard care with uptitrating intravenous
      furosemide alone or a combination therapy with tolvaptan 15mg once daily for 2 days. The
      standard furosemide treatment will follow the modified 2019 Position Statement from the ESC
      Heart Failure Association. The primary endpoint is the cumulative urine output at 48 hour.
      Key secondary endpoints include the improvement of fractional excretion of sodium at 6 hour,
      the total dose of furosemide, the changes in the body weights, the net fluid loss, the
      lessening of diastolic dysfunction parameters on echocardiography, and the incidence of
      clinically relevant worsening renal function at 48 hour.
