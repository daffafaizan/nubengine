    
      This is a cross-sectional study that will enroll up to 10 women undergoing laparoscopic,
      elective bilateral oophorectomy at a local hospital in Baton Rouge, LA. Women will complete 7
      study visits over 3 months; a single screening visit to assess eligibility, a pre-bilateral
      oophorectomy visit for imaging and adipose tissue biopsy collection, and 5 post-bilateral
      oophorectomy visits to "dose", maintain compliance and subject retention, and perform
      follow-up imaging and adipose tissue biopsy collection for outcome measures.
