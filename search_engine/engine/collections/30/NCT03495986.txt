      functional electrical stimulation leg cycle ergometry plus diet (HBFESLCE + Diet) to
      home-based (HB) Diet alone. This is a randomized, baseline-controlled, prospective,
      interventional trial to assess the impact of a 16-week exercise and/or diet intervention on
      selected fitness parameters in adults with high SCI. Primary outcome measures will include
      body composition by iDXA, insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness and BMR, while secondary
      outcomes will include lower extremity BMC and density, lipid profiles, and hsCRP determined
      before and after the 16-week interventions. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either
      HBFES LCE + Diet on an RT300 ergometer or Home-based (HB) Diet Alone intervention. Both
      groups will be routinely monitored via telemedicine while at home.
