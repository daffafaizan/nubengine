        -  Determine the effect of d-methylphenidate on fatigue in patients receiving radiotherapy
           for primary or metastatic brain tumors.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on the quality of life of these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on depression in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on global neurocognitive function, including attention
           and concentration, memory, language, visuospatial skills, and executive function, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified by tumor type (primary vs metastatic), treatment (radiotherapy vs radiotherapy
      and chemotherapy), and Karnofsky performance status (70% or 80% vs 90% or 100%). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      All patients undergo radiotherapy over weeks 1-4.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral d-methylphenidate twice daily on weeks 1-12.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily on weeks 1-12. In both arms, quality
           of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of radiotherapy, and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks
           after radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
