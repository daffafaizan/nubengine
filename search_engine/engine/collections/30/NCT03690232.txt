      between each treatment. The HA group was administered intra-articular HA ((Hyruan PlusR,
      average MW 3000 kD; LG Life Sciences Ltd, Korea)) for sessions with a 1-week interval between
      each treatment. The results were measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS), Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and Lequesne index. A
      baseline for each test was measured before treatment and then the effects of the treatments
      were measured by each test at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment
