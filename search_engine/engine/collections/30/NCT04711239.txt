      different stages of embryonic development, with varying rates of amplification success.
      Differences in analytes, timing of SCM collection and the duration of embryo culture within
      the collected medium, performance of assisted hatching (AH), whole genome amplification
      methods, comprehensive chromosome screening methods and next generation sequencing (NGS)
      platforms, bioinformatic analyses and strategies for identifying maternal contamination all
      contribute to the ultimate performance of niPGT-A.

      This study aims to validate a noninvasive PGT-A (niPGT-A) method utilizing cfDNA released
      from the human blastocyst into the SCM.

      Patients undergoing a fertility treatment with PGT-A due to secondary infertility will be
      recruited. On day 6 post fertilization, SCM will be collected prior to blastocyst biopsy. The
      SCM is normally discarded at this stage. Trophectoderm biopsy and sample collection will
      follow the IVF laboratory's standard practices for clinical PGT-A.

      Three aneuploidy screening kits, relying on different whole genome amplification methods
      followed by NGS on the Ion GeneStudioâ„¢ S5 Prime System (ThermoFisher Scientific), will be
      compared. The concordance between cfDNA and trophectoderm biopsies will be evaluated for
      approximately 150 blastocysts with the best performing niPGT-A protocol.

      Selection of the embryo(s) for transfer will be based solely on the PGT-A result from the
      biopsied cells. The patient's IVF+PGT-A treatment plan and timeline will not be altered.
