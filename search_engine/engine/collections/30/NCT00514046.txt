    
      BACKGROUND:

      Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is a rare calcitonin-producing tumor
      arising from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid, is often a manifestation of multiple
      endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B and can be detected in children as young as five
      years in MEN 2A and one year in those with MEN 2B

      MEN results from an activating mutation in the rearranged during transfection (RET)
      proto-oncogene resulting in a constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)

      Vandetanib is an orally bioavailable multi-RTK inhibitor that blocks the mutant RET gene
      product and has anti-tumor activity in adults with hereditary MTC

      OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the activity of vandetanib in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC using
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (primary endpoint), tumor biomarkers
      and tumor-related diarrhea

      To assess the safety and tolerance of vandetanib in children and adolescents at a dose
      equivalent to the recommended dose in adults

      To assess the pharmacokinetics of vandetanib at steady state in children and adolescents

      Secondary objectives include monitoring progression-free and overall survival, assessing RET,
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) and
      somatostatin receptor expression in archival tumor tissue, assessing changes in
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations in RET in tumor tissue vs germ line in PBMC and after
      treatment; assessing gene expression and gains/losses of DNA in tumor tissue at baseline,
      during treatment and at the time of progression; establishment of pediatric MTC cell lines
      sensitive and resistant cells lines in vitro

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Children and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age (inclusive) with unresectable, recurrent or
      metastatic hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma

      Measurable disease by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)

      DESIGN:

      Vandetanib will be administered as a once daily dose, continuously (1 cycle equals 28 days)
      at a dose of 150 mg,m(2), per day

      To ensure the safety of the adult dose in children and adolescents, a limited intra-patient
      dose escalation will be performed in the initial cohort of patients, with older patients (13
      to18 yrs) being studied before younger patients (5 to12 yrs)

      Patients wil be enrolled at a dose of 100mg, m(2), per day (180 mg per day in adults) for two
      28 day cycles and escalated to 150 mg, m(2), per day (270 mg, per day in adults) on cycle 3,
      if dose limiting toxicity was not observed at the lower dose. If the 150mg, m(2), per day
      dose level is tolerable on cycles 3 and 4, all subsequent patients will be enrolled at this
      dose level

      Pharmacokinetics of vandetanib will be studied at steady state at the end of cycle 2 and
      trough levels will be obtained prior to the second dose on cycle 1, and on day 1 of cycles
      2-5.

      Responsible of measurable tumors will be assessed by RECIST. Biomarker and clinical response
      will also be monitored. Twenty one patients will be studied to determine if the response rate
      in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC is consistent with the 28 percent objective
      response rate in adults
