      sorafenib-associated HFSR. Urea is useful for the treatment of hyperkeratotic conditions and
      has been recommended for the treatment of multitargeted kinase inhibitor-related HFSR . To
      our knowledge, no randomized, controlled trials to date have evaluated treatments to
      prevent/palliate sorafenib-associated HFSR. We therefore tested the prophylactic effects of a
      urea-based cream on the incidence of HFSR associated with sorafenib treatment of patients
      with advanced HCC.
