      in HER2+ patients without exposing patients to the toxicity of an anthracycline-based
      regimen. A minimum of 60 evaluable patients will be accrued to the study. We are assuming an
      observed pCR (or near pCR) rate of 70%. Assuming no more than 10% of patients will be
      inevaluable for the primary endpoint (pCR), we will have at least 54 evaluable patients. With
      this number, we will have 90% power, with a 1-sided alpha error of 0.05, to demonstrate a pCR
      rate exceeding 50% for our novel regimen.
