      calcium with vitamin D supplementation. We randomly sampled the population of healthy,
      independent living women 55+ years in nine rural counties. We randomly assigned 1180 women to
      one of three groups: Group 1 receives calcium (1400 mg/d) and vitamin D placebo, Group 2
      receives both calcium (1400 mg/d) and vitamin D (1100 IU/d) and Group 3 receives both
      placebos.

      A full-service market research firm randomly selected telephone numbers from all households
      with listed numbers in the nine-county rural sample area. The firm continued calling until
      1180 women were selected who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were willing to
      participate in a four year prospective study of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The
      participants were enrolled into study between May 2000 and July 2001.

      Participants have study visits every six months. Annually the following are performed: bone
      density scans, height and weight, brief medical history including medicine changes, fracture
      surveillance, and compliance with calcium and vitamin D. At baseline and end of study, spine
      x-rays and dietary recall were obtained.
