      tumors, especially refractory/relapsed acute B lymphocytes. CD7 is a transmembrane
      glycoprotein expressed by T cells and natural killer cells and their precursors; it is also
      expressed in >95% of lymphoblastic T-cell leukemias and lymphomas . CD7 was previously
      evaluated as a target for immunotoxin-loaded antibodies in patients with T-cell malignancies,
      but tumor responses were limited.

      Enhancing the potency of CD7-directed cytotoxicity by substituting autologous CAR-T cells for
      a monoclonal antibody would augment the efficacy of CD7-targeted therapy in patients with
      T-cell malignancies. To prepare CAR7-T cells, CD7 expression is suppressed on autologous T
      cells by unique blocking technique, and CD7-negative T cells are transduced with a humanized
      anti-CD7-41BB-CD3Î¶ lentiviral vector.

      This is an investigational study. The objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      CAR7-T cells in patients with CD7+ T-cell malignancies.
