      by removal of the protruding disc through an operation. Fusion of the discs follows in about
      70% of cases.

      Adjacent disc disease (ADD), symptomatic degenerative changes in the levels adjacent to the
      operated level is regarded as a late complication. Fusion at the operated level is thought to
      contribute to this process due to compensative increased mobility and stress on the adjacent
      segments.

      Keeping the operated segment mobile through the use of a cervical disc prosthesis possibly
      prevents ADD.

      We hypothesize that use of a cervical disc prosthesis preserves or restores normal mobility
      to the cervical spine. To test this hypothesis subjects are randomised in a group receiving a
      standard anterior cervical discectomy, and a group receiving a standard discectomy with
      placement of a cervical disc prosthesis. Digital X-ray cinematographic videos are made of a
      flexion/extension movement. The videos will be analyzed manually and through a newly designed
      automated program, to check for mobility and order of movement.
