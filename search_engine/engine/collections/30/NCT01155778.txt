      devastating and disabling disease.

      Shire Human Genetic Therapies (Shire HGT) is developing a sulfamidase enzyme replacement
      therapy (ERT)rhHNS for patients with MPS IIIA. recombinant human heparan-N-sulfatase (rhHNS)
      is being administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an surgically implanted
      intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD), because when administered intravenously (IV) it does
      not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB).

      This study is a multicenter, multiple-dose, dose escalation study designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of up to 3 dose levels (10mg,45mg and 90mg
      monthly for 6 months) of rhHNS administered via an IDDD in patients with Sanfilippo syndrome
      Type A ages greater than or equal to 3 years of age.

      Patients who have completed all study requirements in this study will be invited to
      participate in an open-label extension study that will be designed to evaluate long term
      safety and clinical outcomes of intrathecal administration of rhHNS.
