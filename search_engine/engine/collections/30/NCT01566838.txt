      attenuating the physiologic stress of surgery and decreasing post-operative pain. Despite
      this approach, incisions in the chest are proportionally more painful than in other parts of
      the body, and most patients require some form of narcotic pain medication.

      Multiple strategies for post-operative pain control have been attempted in thoracic surgery
      with no obvious superiority of one versus another. Pain catheters have been increasingly used
      over the past decade in different surgical procedures in order to minimize incisional pain
      for the first 3 to 7 days after an operation. The published literature is equivocal as to the
      efficacy of such approach following thoracic surgery with most recent series reporting no
      benefit in the use of these catheters. Of utmost importance is the placement techniques
      described thus far, which in our opinion, have been suboptimal.

      In order for a pain catheter to work, the infused local anesthetic has to constantly bathe
      the nerve in question thus preventing painful stimuli from being transmitted. It is hard to
      dispute the ability of local anesthetic to block pain conduction. Consequently, the success
      of the intervention is directly dependent on the placement technique to achieve such goal,
      hence the rationale for our study.
