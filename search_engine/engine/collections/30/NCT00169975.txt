    
      Coronary Artery Disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. The non invasive
      detection of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS's) remains a clinical challenge. Electrocardiogram
      (ECG) may only diagnose myocardial infarction in 50 % of the cases. Magnetocardiography is a
      new and noninvasive method capable of measuring and mapping the magnetic field that is
      generated during the cardiac cycle. The electric current is affected by ischemic damage,
      which in turn alters the magnetic field. The magnetic field is not affected by body tissues,
      unlike the surface current measurements in ECG.

      Comparisons: The diagnostic accuracy of the CMI-Magnetocardiograph will be compared to that
      of the ECG in diagnosing High Risk Unstable Angina.
