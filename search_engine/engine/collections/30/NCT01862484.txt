      that children on restriction diet will have significantly lower ADHD RS scores after 5 weeks
      relative to the Ruse diet group. In addition children will undergo functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and again at 5 weeks. Children will perform a flanker
      task known to engage the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC) during attention tasks. The children will also perform will look at pictures of
      appealing and unappealing food and rate whether they would like to eat it or not. This task
      is known to activate the ventral striatum (VS) (reward processing). A secondary hypothesis is
      whether children on the restricted diet will show changes in activity and connectivity of
      areas (DLPFC, ACC, VS) relative to those on the Ruse diet.
