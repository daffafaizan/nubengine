      receive a cognitive rehabilitation program + pharmacological treatment, 2) another group
      (n=66) will receive a psychoeducation program + pharmacological treatment, and 3) a control
      group (n=66) will only receive pharmacological treatment. A psychopathological,
      neuropsychological and functional assessment will be administered pre and post-intervention
      and a 12-month follow-up to assess the long term effects of the intervention.
