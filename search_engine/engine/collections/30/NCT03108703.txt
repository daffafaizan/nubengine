    
      There is an evolving body of literature that shows high rates of tumour control and minimal
      associated toxicities with SBRT to treat RCC. However, the majority of published evidence is
      retrospective in nature, and there is a scarcity of data on the impact on quality of life and
      cost-effectiveness of kidney SBRT.

      The principal aims of this multicentre study are to prospectively assess QoL and oncologic
      outcomes in non-surgical patients who receive SBRT for the treatment of primary renal cell
      carcinoma.

      The study population will include 30 consecutive patients treated with kidney SBRT on a
      conventional linear accelerator (35-40 Gy in 5 fractions) at the Odette Cancer Centre,
      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto (OCC) and the Juravinski Cancer
      Center, Hamilton Health Sciences Centre, McMaster University (JCC).
