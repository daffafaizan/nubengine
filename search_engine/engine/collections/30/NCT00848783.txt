      preoperative chemotherapy and intraperitoneal consolidation, was conducted in patients with
      locally advanced, potentially resectable gastric cancer or cancer of the gastro-esophageal
      junction (GEJ), both staged as T3N0, T4N0, any TN1 or TN2 disease. The data suggest that for
      patients with locally advanced gastric or GEJ cancer, systemic induction therapy, curative
      surgery with high Ro resection rates, and IP adjuvant therapy, has acceptable toxicity and
      encouraging survival outcome. The Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Infusional
      Chemotherapy (MAGIC) trial has also shown that perioperative chemotherapy - chemotherapy
      given both before and after surgery - can provide a significant survival benefit.

      The investigators hypothesize that adjuvant intraperitoneal salvage of cancer micrometastatic
      residues after surgery contributes to disease-free survival. The goal of this trial is to
      determine whether IP Floxuridine, added to adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy, prolongs
      patient's survival. This will be tested during the randomized open-label trial.
