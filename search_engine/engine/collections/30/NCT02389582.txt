      using ASA. All patients will receive the same medications in effective doses recommended at
      each stage of the study, so that every individual is his self-control, the Enoxaparin will be
      administrated at a dose of 1mg/kg twice a day and Dabigatran at a dose of 150mg twice a day.
      Study Design: Phase 1 : There will be a first collection of blood samples from all patients
      at baseline for laboratory tests, then the patient will receive Dabigatran for 5 days and
      laboratory tests including platelet aggregation will be made, among others. After a 30 days
      washout period, enoxaparin will be administrated for 5 days and in the 6st day, the same
      laboratory tests, including platelet aggregation, will be performed.
