      interventions have not yet been used as a standard in each clinic, the effects on patients
      have been frequently researched in recently. A detailed description of the treatment, the
      devices to be used and the disclosure of the steps of the procedure may have an effect on the
      result of the treatment. The aim of the study; (1) the presence of comorbid psychiatric
      conditions in patients with lumbar disc hernia and radiculopathy, (2) to evaluate the effect
      of the written and visual informative form given before the injection of the lumbosacral
      TFESI.
