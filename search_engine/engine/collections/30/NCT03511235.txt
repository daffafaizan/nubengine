    
      This is a multicenter, retrospective, observational study in men diagnosed with localized
      PrCa who had Prolaris testing prior to the treatment decision. The study will collect
      demographic, clinical, pathologic, and Prolaris test data from medical records and Myriad's
      Prolaris database.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of BCR or metastasis, whichever
      occurs first, among Prolaris-tested men who were at low risk of DSM (â‰¤3.2%), who also met
      NCCN low-risk criteria, and who were initially treated with AS.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the frequency of AS selection among all
      men who had low DSM risk, as determined by Prolaris testing and AS durability among
      Prolaris-tested men with low DSM risk who selected and initiated this treatment.
