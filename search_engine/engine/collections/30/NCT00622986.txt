      Europe for decades for the treatment of menopause related problems, either as nutritional
      supplements or as pharmaceutical products. Previous clinical trials had shown that an extract
      of Cimicifuga Foetida L.(Ximingting, Luyepharm), which was standardized to have similar
      components of an extract of Cimicifuga Racemosa, was safe and efficacious to relieve the
      climacteric symptoms and signs in Chinese women who were recruited according to criteria
      categorized by theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine.We are interested to know whether it
      may have the same efficacy and safety profiles when judged with method and standard commonly
      accepted in western medicine.
