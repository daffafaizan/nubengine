      mental state of patients with stroke after debridement. The statistical analysis test of
      correlation is carried out, and the reliability and validity test and the norm establishment
      of the Chinese version are further tested. Convenient sampling will be performed at a single
      medical facility. The planned implementation period is 2019/01/01 ~ 2019/12/31, and the
