      most mammalian exocrine secretions, such as milk, saliva and tears, bronchial, and intestinal
      secretions. LTF is also found in the secondary granules of neutrophils a glycoprotein present
      in milk, has been demonstrated to possess a multitude of biological functions. Lactoferrin in
      Inflammation and Sepsis The antimicrobial activity of LTF is well documented and consists of
      two mechanisms: one is iron dependent and deals with high affinity of LTF to iron
      (bacteriostatic), and the other one is due to LTF affinity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to
      function as a direct bactericidal agent for Gram-negative organisms. Small changes, such as
      single nucleotide polymorphisms, can affect outcomes against pathogenic agents . LTF
      interacts with cell surface receptors involved in "danger signal" recognition [e.g.,
      toll-like receptor (TLR)4, CD14, and CD22]. At the molecular level, LTF seems to reduce
      LPS-induced monocyte activation and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory mediators.
      Lactoferrin in Anemia in Liver Disease The hepatic expression of the hepcidin gene is
      regulated by signals which reflect body iron status and erythropoietic activity. The
      regulation of hepcidin by iron status includes a signal from the circulating transferrin via
      hepatocellular transferrin receptor (TfR2). Like transferrin, lactoferrin will deliver iron
      to hepatocytes but unlike transferrin, lactoferrin cannot deliver iron to erythroid cells.
      Lactoferrin does not interact with TfR1 or TfR2.
