      connecting as a fistula without intervening normal capillary bed. As the disease progresses,
      the lesion may cause several adverse clinical events including stroke, seizure or even death.
      For patients with BAVM deemed unsuitable for invasive treatment or who has elected to defer
      invasive treatment, it is essential to take effective medical management.

      Lovastatin possesses antiinflammatory and antiproliferative actions in human endothelial and
      vascular smooth muscle cells independent of its lipid-lowing action. These findings suggest
      that lovastatin may be beneficial for maintaining vascular stability, which may contribute to
      slowing down the progression of the disease and reducing the incidence of adverse clinical
      events.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and disease-modifying efficacy of
      lovastatin in patients with BAVMs. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      combination of lovastatin and symptomatic treatment drugs or combination of placebo and
      symptomatic treatment drugs. Patients will have post-dose safety follow-up visit at 1, 3, 6,
      and 12 months after the study begins. The changes in clinical outcomes, including lesion
      volume changes and the rate of stroke, seizure or death, will be evaluated in a period of 2
      years.
