        -  Determine the safety and immunogenicity of adjuvant vaccine comprising ovarian cancer
           synthetic peptides, tetanus toxoid helper peptide, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) emulsified
           in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with previously treated ovarian epithelial or primary
           peritoneal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive vaccine comprising ovarian cancer synthetic peptides, tetanus toxoid helper
      peptide, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously and intradermally to 2
      different sites on days 1, 8, and 15. On day 22, patients undergo removal of the lymph node
      draining the vaccination site to determine whether the immune system is responding to the
      vaccine. Patients then receive additional vaccine as above only to the primary vaccination
      site on days 29, 36, and 43.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, every 3 months
      for 9 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.
