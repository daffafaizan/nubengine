      strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment. Improved treatments for patients with
      obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes and promote weight
      loss. This study (maintenance stage) RCT will provide new and novel findings from a
      controlled test, amongst responders to acute treatments, whether NB medication results in
      superior maintenance and longer-term outcomes than placebo. This is the first controlled test
      of maintenance pharmacotherapy for BED and will be only the third RCT for BED of any
      medication with follow-up after medication discontinuation.
