    
      Specific Aim 1: To demonstrate that clinical surrogates of SICU patients who view a video
      decision aid in addition to receiving written and verbal information about procedures and
      life sustaining therapy in the SICU make more informed decisions than patients and clinical
      surrogates who receive written and verbal information alone.

      Hypothesis 1: Adding a video decision aid to the current informed consent process, for
      procedures and life sustaining treatments in the SICU, will better inform clinical surrogates
      of incapacitated patients admitted to the SICU regarding decision making when providing
      consent for medical treatment.
