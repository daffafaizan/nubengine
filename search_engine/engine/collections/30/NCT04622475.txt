      steroid-refractory gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease (GI-aGvHD) by FMT. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety of FMT capsule in the treatment of
      steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD patients. The secondary objectives are as follows.

      To observe the efficacy of FMT capsule in the treatment of steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD 28
      days after the first administration.

      To explore the characteristics of gut microbiota changes after FMT capsule treating
      steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD.

      To evaluate the safety of FMT capsule treating steroid-refractory GI-aGvHD 12 weeks and 24
      weeks after the first administration.
