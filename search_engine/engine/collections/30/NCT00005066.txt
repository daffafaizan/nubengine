      or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma treated with O6-benzylguanine and carmustine. II.
      Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the
      duration of response, time to progression, and survival of these patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed 1 hour later by carmustine
      IV over 15 minutes. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with progressive disease
      are followed every 6 months until death. Patients without progressive disease are followed
      every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.
