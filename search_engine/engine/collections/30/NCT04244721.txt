      synchrony and communication with their children with ASD. Then, it is recommended to the
      parents to practice the therapy daily at home. In France, this type of early intervention is
      poorly developed and is only accessible in specialized centers located in large urban
      centers. Guiding parents by videoconferencing could make this intervention accessible to
      families in undeserved areas. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      a PACT intervention delivered by parents and guided by videoconferencing, on the autism in
      their children with ASD, aged 18 to 36 months at the inclusion.

      This study is a multicenter (5 centers), two-parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. It
      will compare a group of children receiving the usual therapy (TAU) and a group receiving TAU
      plus the PACT intervention. The primary outcome is the autism symptoms measured with the
      ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) at 12 months. A total of 238 children will be
      included in the study (119 per group).
