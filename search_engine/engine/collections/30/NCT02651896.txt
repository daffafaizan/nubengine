      adenocarcinoma, tumor which is considered to present a low α / β, and therefore benefit from
      this approach.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      1. Acute and late radiation induced toxicities.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        1. Freedom from prostate cancer recurrence - freedom from biochemical failure survival;

        2. Cause specific and overall survival

        3. Aspects of quality of life and health economics
