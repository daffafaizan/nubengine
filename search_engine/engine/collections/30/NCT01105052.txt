      a lack of trained CBT-therapists, and self-help is beginning to prove useful for many areas
      of psychological distress. Earlier studies of different kinds of self-help (e.g. computer
      based and bibliotherapeutic) suggest that many patients do indeed benefit from self-help
      treatments for insomnia, but there is a need for independent replications. Also, most
      previous studies have had very strict inclusion criteria, such that for instance only
      individuals with primary insomnia and no co-morbid problems have been included. A general
      question in self-help is whether patients need therapist support to benefit from treatment,
      or if a book is enough to alleviate symptoms.
