      cisplatin, high-dose cytosine arabinoside and dexamethasone (DHAP) or other platinum-based
      treatments. Recent studies have shown a 37% response rate in patients with large cell
      lymphoma to immunotherapy with Rituxan. Patients <75 years old and in otherwise good health
      may be candidates for high dose therapy with stem cell rescue if they have disease that
      remains sensitive to chemotherapy. Typically, patients are administered 2 cycles of DHAP or
      ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) and, if the disease responds, they proceed to
      high-dose therapy with stem cell support. Even patients not considered transplant candidates
      are also often treated with DHAP or ICE or other salvage regimens. It is likely that the
      response rate with DHAP alone in patients eligible for transplant is <59%. Recent studies
      have attempted to improve on the results from DHAP or ICE by combining them with rituxan.
      NCCTG has just completed a phase II trial of R-DHAP. Preliminary results of the R-ICE
      protocol indicate a higher response rate and longer time to progression than traditional ICE.

      The problem with DHAP and ICE is that they are associated with significant side effects and
      specifically, with DHAP the cisplatin often causes kidney problems. In fact, some patients
      who are considered transplant eligible before DHAP may become transplant ineligible simply by
      the kidney side effects. Clearly, there is a need to improve the quality of life of patients
      undergoing treatment and to avoid the kidney problems.
