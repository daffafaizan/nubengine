      resource-efficient caregiver training program for signalling changes to children with
      intellectual disabilities or autism spectrum disorders. 2. To pilot the program to test the
      feasibility of taking it forward into a clinical trial. 3. To conduct a process and economic
      evaluation of the pilot intervention to provide further data on its suitability for a
      clinical trial.

      Parents/caregivers of children aged 7-16 years old who frequently show temper outbursts when
      things change in their routines or plans will keep a web-based diary accessed via smart phone
      or other device on their child's temper outbursts for a 6 month period (baseline). After 6
      months of keeping this diary, parents/caregivers will then access web-based training for
      approximately 1 month which will include sessions to study once or twice per week as well as
      exercises to practice in between sessions.

      After the training is complete parents will be asked to implement the strategies they have
      learnt in the 6 months that follow. In addition researchers from the university will
      telephone parents/ caregivers to ask some questions about their child's temper outbursts and
      on the effects this behaviour has on daily life. Parents will be interviewed at three points
      during the study (before baseline, after baseline, before intervention and after intervention
      phases). Interviews will focus on gathering information of their child's behaviour.

      Focus groups with relevant experienced professionals and parents (not participating in the
      main part of the study) will guide the training resource development and development and
      content of the behaviour diary used by parents during the study.
