      multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study of doripenem versus comparator to
      assess the effectiveness and safety of doripenem in the treatment of VAP in adult patients.
      The study consists of screening phase, open-label treatment phase, and follow-up. The
      treatment duration is from 7 to 14 days. The primary endpoint is the clinical response rate
      of doripenem at the early follow-up visit. The patients will receive either doripenem or
      comparator for 7 to 14 days.
