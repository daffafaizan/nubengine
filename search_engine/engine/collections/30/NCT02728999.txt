      General Hospital were eligible to participate. Each subject was randomized to steep or a
      decreased angle of Trendelenburg. While under anesthesia an arterial line would be placed to
      monitor vital signs. At specific time points throughout surgery, all vital signs were
      measured including End Tidal CO2, peak airway pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate
      and arterial CO2 as well as operative time, blood loss and conversion to laparotomy.

      The arterial line was removed at the conclusion of the case, and all variables will be
      compared between the two cohorts.
