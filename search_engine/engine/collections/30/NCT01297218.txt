      temporarily increase acetylcholine, based on the cholinergic hypothesis. These drugs can
      improve the symptoms but is not able to inhibit the disease progression. New drugs from the
      disease have been developed but they have not been successful yet.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of differentiating into various tissues. Due to the
      characteristics of the cells it has been widely investigated in tissue regeneration. In
      addition, the paracrine effect of MSC in microenvironment has been recently reported. MSC has
      been developed as an immunomodulation cell therapy product because it has been known that it
      does not cause immunological rejection in allo- and xeno-transplantation. Clinical studies
      showed that umbilical cord blood-derived MSC is immunologically stable and not toxic.

      This study is to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of NEUROSTEMÂ®-AD (Human Umbilical
      Cord Blood Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells) and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
      This study is also to investigate the efficacy of this study drug in patients with dementia
      of Alzheimer's type.
