    
      This prospectively decision impact study will evaluate physicians and patient treatment plan
      choices before and after reviewing Decipher results for eligible patient cases. The clinical
      utility of Decipher will be evaluated for patients meeting the inclusion criteria at two
      time-points post-RP:

        1. In the adjuvant setting: within 12 months after surgery (in the absence of detectable
           PSA rise of BCR)

        2. In the salvage setting: post-RP with evidence of PSA rise or BCR (defined as PSA
           detectable and rising on 2 or more subsequent determinations)

      A total of 150 patient cases, in each arm, will be prospectively selected from clinical
      sites. The study as a whole will enroll 300 patient cases.

      As a condition of participation in the study, each clinical site must agree to provide a
      minimum of 10 patient cases.
