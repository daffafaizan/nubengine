    
      The study protocol-mandated baseline data will include demographics, comorbidities,
      EuroSCORE[European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation] II, C-reactive protein, left
      ventricular ejection fraction (by transthoracic echocardiography) and peak expiratory flow
      rate (assessed by spirometry). Physical performance status will be assessed by APACHE [Acute
      Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation] II score. Furthermore, SOFA [Sequential
      [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment] score will be assessed preoperatively and up to
      7th postoperative day.

      Preoperatively and on the 7th postoperative day, the following parameters will be calculated
      or measured and then recorded:

        -  Anthropometric data including body height, weight and waist circumference measurement,
           estimation of waist/circumference ratio and calculation of body mass index [BMI].

        -  Nutritional status will be assessed by MUST[Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool] score

        -  Body composition analysis using bioelectrical impedance analysis [BIA], will be
           performed for the calculation of FFM [fat-free mass] and fat mass [FM] indicators,
           intracellular, extracellular and total water [ICW, ECW, TBW] and phase angle parameter
           [PhA]. Additionally, muscular power will be assessed by handgrip strength [HGS], the
           upper third triangle perimeter and skin fold thickness will be measured.

        -  Daily calorie and protein needs of each patient will be calculated

      During hospitalization, the following parameters will be recorded:

        -  Type of diet [parenteral, intestinal, oral]

        -  Post-operative infections involving respiratory system, medieval space, sternum trauma,
           lower limb trauma (if present) and endocarditis.

        -  The occurrence of organ dysfunction or sepsis. Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening
           organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical
           operationalization, organ dysfunction will be represented by an increase in the
           Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more,
           which will be associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%.

        -  Thromboembolic events such as stroke, peripheral venous thrombosis and pulmonary
           embolism.

        -  Acute renal failure.

        -  Re-operation for bleeding.

        -  Need for inotropic or vasoactive support.

        -  Hospitalization data (intubation> 24 hours, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU
           stay, duration of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality
