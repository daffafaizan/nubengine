      could offer clinically important advantages in the treatment of acute herpes zoster over
      currently available therapies due to rapid absorption and conversion to the active moiety as
      well as a longer intra-cellular half-life in infected cells. Clinically, these
      characteristics could translate into once-daily dosing versus thrice-daily dosing as seen
      with current therapy, leading to a higher rate of compliance and quality-of-life, especially
      among elderly patients. The objective of EPB348-0201 is to determine the pharmacokinetics and
      dosage of EPB-348 that best balances safety and efficacy among adult immunocompetent patients
      with an acute episode of herpes zoster. This multi-center study will randomly assign patients
      to either EPB-348 1000 mg once daily or EPB-348 2000 mg once daily or valacyclovir 1000 mg
      three times daily.
