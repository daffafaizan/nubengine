           and Placebo BID. These will be prepared in blister-packs.

        -  Depending on enrollment/surgery date, patients will take medication either one to two
           weeks before surgery. Patients will be assigned to a treatment group according to a
           random table.

        -  Each patient will be initially provided with a 1 or 2-week supply of drug in blister
           packs. The patient will take the final dose of study drug on the morning of surgery.

      Baseline labs will be obtained and then again at time of surgery along with a piece of
      surgical tissue.
