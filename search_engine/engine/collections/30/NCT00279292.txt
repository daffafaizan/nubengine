      celiac plexus neurolysis. Patients with pancreatic cancer who are unresectable and who have
      significant pain (> 3 on 0-10 scale) will be enrolled. At the time of a staging endoscopic
      ultrasound, patients will be randomized to celiac neurolysis or sham (injection of same
      medication into lumen of stomach). Neurolysis will be performed using standard bupivicaine
      and ethanol. Patients will be followed for at least 3 months for pain, quality of life and
      narcotic usage.
