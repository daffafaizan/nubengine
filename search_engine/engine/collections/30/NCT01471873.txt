      was used for the sake of the study.Two study groups were formed: 1) Keratoconus group (KC)
      included patients with progressive keratoconus and 2) Collagen-Cross-linking group (CXL)
      included keratoconus patients that had been treated with uneventful CXL at least on year
      prior to their enrollment in the study.

      Three consecutive scans were obtained by two experienced operators. The same procedure was
      repeated within two weeks for the assessment of intersession variability. In all cases
      acceptable maps had at least 10.0mm of corneal coverage.All back elevation points were
      codified in order to facilitate statistical processing of data. Further to single point
      analysis, three additional parameters were evaluated: a) zone 4 parameter (z4) which derived
      by the analysis of all points at the central 4.0mm diameter zone, b) zone 8 parameter (z8)
      which derived by the analysis of all points at the central 8.0mm diameter zone, and, c)
      highest elevation point parameter (HEP), which derived by the analysis of the highest
      elevation points for all participants. Reproducibility of measurements was evaluated by means
      of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Three different ICC types were calculated: a)
      intrasession ICC for both operators (ICC1 & ICC2), b) interobserver ICC, and, c) intersession
      ICC. Moreover, Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the level of agreement between the
      two operators.
