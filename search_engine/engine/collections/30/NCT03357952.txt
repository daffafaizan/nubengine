      daratumumab alone in participants with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior
      lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD)
      or whose disease is double refractory to both a PI and an IMiD. The study consists of
      Screening Phase (procedures performed within 28 days before enrollment), Open-Label Treatment
      Phase (with End-of-Treatment Visit to occur 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment)
      and Follow-up phase (8 weeks after the last dose of study treatment). Ongoing safety
      evaluation during Part 1 and Part 2 will be overseen by the Safety Evaluation Team (SET). In
      Part 3, ongoing safety and efficacy evaluation will be performed by the Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC).
