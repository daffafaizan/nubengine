      particularly in older persons. However, the optimal therapy for this disorder has not been
      defined. The primary chronic symptom in HFNEF is exercise intolerance, manifested by
      shortness of breath and fatigue with exercise. This is the major determinant of quality of
      life, can be measured objectively and reproducibly and is modifiable.
