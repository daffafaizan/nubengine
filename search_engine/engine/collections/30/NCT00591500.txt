    
      The purpose of this study is to better understand genetic susceptibility to melanoma and the
      interactions of specific polymorphisms with each other and with environmental factors.

      To accomplish this, buccal swabs or blood specimens from patients with melanoma (either
      single primary or multiple primary) have been collected. Specimens will be prepared in the
      Epidemiology Laboratory at MSKCC. They will be analyzed at MSKCC for INK4A (and functional
      assays for DNA repair capacity when blood is available) and the melanocortin gene (MC1R), at
      the University of North Carolina for polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and immune function
      genes, at the University of Pennsylvania for polymorphisms in the melanocortin receptor gene
      (MC1R) and immune function genes, and at the University of California (Irvine) for
      polymorphisms in metabolizing genes (P450's and GST's). Samples will be banked at MSKCC and
      the University of New Mexico. In order to perform this study, subjects from population-based
      registries in the United States (New Jersey, North Carolina, Michigan, San Diego/Imperial
      Counties), Canada (Cancer Care Ontario, British Columbia), Italy (Turin), Australia (New
      South Wales, Tasmania), were interviewed, asked to provide blood or buccal swab samples and
      asked to provide permission to obtain and review slides of their primary melanoma. This study
      is now closed to accrual.
