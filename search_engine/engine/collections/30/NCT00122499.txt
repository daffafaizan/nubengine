      Radiotherapy is a common treatment modality for early stage prostate cancer. Because of the
      high incidence of post-radiation erectile dysfunction (ED), up to 72% after external-beam
      radiotherapy, this patient category represents a most difficult therapeutic challenge. Oral
      drug therapy represents the first-line management option for patients with ED. The results of
      the studies completed thus far with sildenafil show that a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor
      is a safe and efficacious drug for the treatment of post-radiation ED. No studies have
      investigated the efficacy of tadalafil in men complaining of ED after radiotherapy of
      prostate cancer. Because of the extended period of effectiveness, which may last up to 36
      hours after intake, tadalafil allows freedom in the choice for time of sexual activity. Also
      the absence of restrictions of tadalafil intake with food or alcohol should simplify its
      administration. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study has been
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of "on demand" dosing of 20-mg of tadalafil or
      placebo administered for 12 weeks to patients with ED after external-beam radiotherapy for
      prostate cancer.
