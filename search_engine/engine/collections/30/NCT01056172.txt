      (800mg/day) for 16 weeks in patients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 result in a lower
      overall sustained virologic response rate than treatment with the standard 24 weeks regimen.
      Ribavirin was used as a flat dose (800mg/day) in ACCELERATE trial. But, previous studies
      which used the weight-based dose of ribavirin (800-1400mg/day) had shown that a treatment
      duration of 16 weeks was as effective as 24 weeks regimen in HCV genotype 2 patients with a
      RVR. But, there was too small number of patient enrolled study to argue logically about
      ACCELERATE trial. In this study, we aimed to confirm the non-inferiority peginterferon
      alfa-2a and weight-based ribavirin for 16 weeks compare with standard treatment duration of
      24 weeks in patients who achieved rapid virologic response with genotype 2 CHC.
