    
      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter Phase II study with Phase I lead-in. Patients
      enrolled in this study will receive external radiotherapy with or without nimotuzumab
      (TheraCIM h-R3). The objective of the Phase I component of the study is to evaluate the
      safety and feasibility of the administration of nimotuzumab with palliative radiation in
      patients who are unsuitable for radical therapy (curative intent chemoradiation) and to
      select the optimal biologically effective dose (BED) for Phase II component of the study. In
      the Phase II component, overall survival, local and systemic response rates and quality of
      life will be evaluated inpatients treated with nimotuzumab in combination with palliative
      radiation vs. radiation alone.

      The Phase I component of this study has been completed. The Phase II is now closed to
      recruitment.
