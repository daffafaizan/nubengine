    
      In particular, changes induced by the ECC will be evaluated on:

        -  Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity (IDO)

        -  Apoptosis of lymphocytes and dendritic cells

        -  Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)

        -  Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC )

      After general anesthesia and arterial catheterization and prior to the start of ECC, blood
      samples will be taken for flow cytometry studies, for the purification of PMNs and monocytes.
      The purified PMNs and monocytes will then be used for the measurement of cytokine,
      phagocytosis and bactericidal production capacities.

      The morning following surgery, blood samples will be taken and follow the same process.
