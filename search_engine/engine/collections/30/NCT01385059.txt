      I. To determine if axitinib modulates pre-metastatic niche density in patients with high-risk
      prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if pre-metastatic niche density in regional lymph nodes (LNs) is associated
      with progression-free survival (PFS).

      II. To determine if therapy with axitinib prolongs time to biochemical recurrence.

      III. To determine if phosphorylated form of signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (pSTAT)3 in tumor tissue is associated with biochemical recurrence.

      IV. To determine if myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment in tumor tissue is
      associated with biochemical recurrence.

      V. To determine if lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression in tumor tissue is associated with
      biochemical recurrence.

      VI. To evaluate time to metastatic recurrence.

      VII. To determine the rate of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence (grade >= 3 for
      both) in the setting of preoperative axitinib therapy.

      VIII. To evaluate changes in blood-based biomarkers (pSTAT3 and selected angiogenic factors)
      from baseline to the time of prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Patients then
      undergo prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection at 5-6 weeks after
      biopsy confirmation of prostate cancer.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
