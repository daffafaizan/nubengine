      diagnosed with a concussion by participating sports medicine physicians at the Boston
      Children's Hospital Sports Concussion Clinic. If patients elect to participate, they will
      undergo their regularly scheduled clinical examination along with two testing components
      requiring less than 15 minutes of additional time to complete: an instrumented gait balance
      assessment, a vestibular-ocular motor screen, and a weekly activity survey. Participants with
      concussion will be matched with control subjects who meet similar demographic characteristics
      and report to the clinic for other orthopedic injuries that do not affect brain function,
      gait, or either lower extremity.

      During the assessment, participants will complete a protocol which measures balance control
      while walking and simultaneously completing a cognitive task, a vestibular-ocular motor
      ability, and physical and cognitive activity levels. As a need exists to develop protocols
      which utilize inexpensive, objective, and sensitive measurements to track concussion
      recovery, this study seeks to incorporate innovative and clinically feasible methods into the
      clinical examination of concussion.
