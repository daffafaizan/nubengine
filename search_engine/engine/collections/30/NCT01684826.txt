      skin, caused by high peak skin dose. The increasingly complex nature of many of the
      interventions performed requires the use of significant amounts of radiation for their
      completion. Of particular relevance to dose reduction concerns are obese patients, for whom
      additional radiation is often necessary to obtained sufficient diagnostic quality, as well as
      patients suffering from chronic total coronary occlusions (CTO), for whom long procedures
      with extended radiation time and contrast usage are common.

      In order to introduce a dose reduction technology the most important aspect is to validate
      the diagnostic image information. Philips has developed a new algorithm that is capable to
      process images with similar image quality but acquired at lower dose.
