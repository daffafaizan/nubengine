      Hospital, a general university teaching hospital with 2500 beds in Wuhan, China.The study
      consisted of female patients, American Society of Anaesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS)

      and hysteroscopic surgery. All the patients were randomly assigned to receive
      propofol,sevoflurane,or sevoflurane+propofol for anaesthesia maintenance. The primary outcome
      measure was the level of postoperative pain assessed by Numerical Analogue Scale (NAS) at
      rest 0.5 hour after the operation. The secondary outcomes were postoperative pain assessed by
      Numerical Analogue Scale (NAS) at rest 1 and 24 hour after the operation, the incidence of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting, the incidence of shiver, and quality of recovery
      determined by QOR40 in the first 24 h after surgery.
