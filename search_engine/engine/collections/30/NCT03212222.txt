      possible with most children capable at 3 years old though some may not be able to cooperate
      until 4 years of age. While visual acuity screening is standard in schools and pediatric
      clinics, the specificity of the exams has been questioned. A number of community screening
      exams rely on outdated and flawed methods that may not accurately access the vision of all
      children. Because many children who fail these vision screenings are referred to
      ophthalmology clinics without a true visual acuity deficit, a more accurate but accessible,
      cost effective, and feasible vision screening exam is necessary. One solution is a smart
      phone application designed to assess visual acuity, called Peek Acuity. The application is
      available for android operating system and can be downloaded as a free beta from the Google
      Play Store. A short tutorial walks users through the application. The application displays a
      single letter "E" in 4 positions, 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees (rolling "E") that does not
      require English comprehension. Patients are instructed to point in the direction of the arms
      of the "E." The examiner records the responses by swiping the screen in the direction the
      patient points. The application uses responses to calculate visual acuity and typical exams
      can be completed within 2 minutes.

      In one study, Peek Acuity visual assessments have been shown to be comparable to that
      determined by the ophthalmology clinic in patients aged 55 years and older. This study also
      found that the Peek Acuity is efficient, with an average exam time of 77 seconds compared to
      82 seconds using the standard Snellen eye chart.
