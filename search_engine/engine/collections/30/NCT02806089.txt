    
      Aim of this study is to determine in chronic kidney disease patients:

        -  the involvement of malnutrition inflammation and atherogenesis syndrome (increase in C
           reactive protein and decrease in serum albumin) on voluntary muscle strength impairment
           (estimated by handheld dynamometer)

        -  the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and muscle mass (estimated by
           creatinine index)

        -  the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and lean body mass (estimated by
           bioelectrical impedance analysis)

        -  the correlation between voluntary muscle strength and physical activity (the physical
           activity being estimated by the "Voorrips" score questionnaire)
