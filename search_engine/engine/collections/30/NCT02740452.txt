      with ligamentoplasty technique.

      Contrary to the classic ligamentoplasty, the treatment with Ligamys consists of promoting
      heating of the ligament itself by controlling mechanical environment.

      It allows a "dynamic" stabilization of the torn Anterior Cruciate Ligament with in the 3
      weekly following traumatism. These techniques may improve the recovery process,
      proprioceptive results, decrease morbidity of transplant harvesting and faster for the
      patients. It's all these issues we would like to assess with a randomised multicenter study.
