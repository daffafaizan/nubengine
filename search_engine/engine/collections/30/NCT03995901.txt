    
      The purpose of this randomized (2:1) controlled study is to assess the safety, efficacy and
      overall benefit of FCR001 cell therapy in de novo living donor renal transplantation relative
      to a standard-of-care control immunosuppression regimen of antibody induction, tacrolimus,
      mycophenolate, and corticosteroids.

      FCR001 is a cryopreserved allogeneic stem cell therapy derived from mobilized peripheral
      blood of the kidney donor that is delivered as a single dose in kidney transplant recipients
      who received a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. FCR001 contains the donor's CD34+
      cells, facilitating cells, and αβ T cells. This therapy induces or restores patients' immune
      tolerance by establishing stable donor chimerism in the transplant recipient without the need
      for life-long immunosuppression.
