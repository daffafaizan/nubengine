      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging is a method for studying absorption and scattering
      (optical properties) of tissue in humans. It is related to near-infrared spectroscopy , but
      allows for more quantitative and thorough measurements. The researcher use Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy to measure fatty tissue, water, blood concentration level during weight loss
      program to determine the effect of sustained changes in weight or relapses.
