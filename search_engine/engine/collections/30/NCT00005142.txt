      Atherosclerosis is frequently generalized, affecting blood vessels in various parts of the
      body. Previous studies had noted the strong association between peripheral arterial disease
      and coronary heart disease and the similarity of risk factors, particularly diabetes and
      cigarette smoking for both diseases. The natural history of peripheral arterial disease had
      not been delineated because of the lack, until recently, of accurate and reliable
      non-invasive testing.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      All 624 subjects were initially studied under a Lipid Research Clinic protocol that involved
      two evaluations, visit 1 and visit 2. At visit 2, half of the subjects were from a random
      sample of the LRC visit 1 cohort and others were selected from the visit 1 cohort for
      hyperlipidemia, defined as being at or above age- and sex-specific 90th percentiles for
      cholesterol or 95th percentiles for triglycerides or taking lipid-lowering medications. At
      visit 2, the subjects were characterized as to age; sex; drug, diet, alcohol and smoking
      history; personal and family history of cardiovascular disease; Rose questionnaire; and
      electrocardiogram and examination by a cardiologist. The subjects were given a traditional
      manual examination for peripheral arterial disease and four non-invasive tests including
      segmental blood pressure, flow velocity by Doppler ultrasound, postocclusive reactive
      hyperemia, and pulse reappearance half-time. The subjects were categorized into large vessel
      peripheral arterial disease, isolated small vessel peripheral arterial disease or normal
      based on the results of non-invasive testing and followed for an average of four years.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
