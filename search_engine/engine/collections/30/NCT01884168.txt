    
      1. The patients with malignant cavity effusion are treated with dendritic cells (DC) plus
           cytokine induced killer cells (CIK) locally.

        2. Malignant cavity effusion from cancer patients is obtained through puncture and is
           centrifugalized to get supernatant fluid and enrich cancer cells before and after the
           therapy.

        3. The enriched cancer cells which are flash frozen, as well as the supernatant, are stored
           at -80Â°C until processing.

        4. The T-Cell Receptor/B-Cell Receptor gene expression in cavity effusion is detected by
           micro-array to explore the mechanism that DC-CIK immunotherapy controls the malignant
           cavity effusion.

        5. Statistical analysis is performed using unsupervised hierarchical cluster.
