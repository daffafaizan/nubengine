      thymoma or thymic carcinoma. The previous trials have showed that radiotherapy was
      significantly associated with prolonged OS and chemotherapy is playing an increasing role in
      treatment of patients with advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma. However, whether concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy is safety in advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma is still unknown. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy for limited advanced unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
