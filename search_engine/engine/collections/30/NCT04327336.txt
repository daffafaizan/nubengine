      cost-effectiveness relationship, with two parallel open groups. 200 OHS patients will be
      divided into two groups by simple randomization 1:1 and followed for one year. The premise of
      non-inferiority is -2 at the lower limit of the confidence interval 95% for the change in
      PCO2 between the arms being assessed by analysis of covariance, adjusted for 2-sided, age,
      sex, body mass index in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. The cost-effectiveness
      will be performed by Bayesian techniques with sensitivity analysis.
