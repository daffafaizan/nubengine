      non-tunneled catheter, a pigtail, or chest tube are frequently used to penetrate the pleural
      space. A 50-ml or 60-ml syringe may be connected to the over-the-needle catheter or a pigtail
      for simple aspiration, while underwater-sealed bottle or suction drainage connected to chest
      tube for drainage of pneumothorax. Vacuum bottle for removing pleural effusion are frequently
      reported in literature and common in daily practice. However, the use of vacuum bottle in
      drainage of pneumothorax was seldom reported. This study aims to investigate the safety of
      vacuum bottle plus non-tunneled catheter for drainage of iatrogenic pneumothorax.
