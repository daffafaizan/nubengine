    
      The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful evaluation of healthy volunteers and
      individuals with psychiatric disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism
      spectrum disorders. The evaluations will help determine if the participant meets criteria for
      participation in research protocols of the Pediatric and Developmental Neuroscience Branch
      (PDN) at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and other collaborative
      investigations. This protocol will be the entry point for PDN investigations. Since the entry
      criteria for these protocols vary, the screening evaluations will also vary. Behavioral
      evaluations will also be done through this protocol for individuals participating in
      IRB-approved protocols being conducted by collaborating scientists in NIH. The evaluations
      might include: a psychiatric interview; a diagnostic interview; developmental and/or
      cognitive testing; ratings of other psychiatric symptoms; neuropsychological testing; a
      medical history; a physical exam; blood; and a request for medical records. Parents of minors
      will be interviewed.
