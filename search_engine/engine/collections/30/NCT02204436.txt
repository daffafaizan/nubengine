      product use), after 4 (T4) and 8 week-treatment (T8):

        -  Image analysis with UV flash (Wood's light)

        -  Photographic recovery

        -  Skin spots image analysis

        -  Skin colour evaluation

        -  Spectrophotometry (skin brightness)

        -  Optical colorimetry (spots colour)

      At the end of the study (T8), each volunteer filled a questionnaire regarding:

        -  the efficacy of the study product (skin brightness and hydration, spots dimensions and
           colour intensity - score: very marked; marked; medium; light; absent)

        -  the cosmetic acceptability of the study product: colour and perfume before and after
           application, consistency, spreadability, absorption, effect on the skin, greasiness and
           presence of product residues (score: negative; medium; good; excellent) the product
           tolerance (score: bad; poor; medium; good; excellent).

      At the end of the study the investigator assessed the treatment tolerance considering the
      possible appearance of related adverse events as bad, poor, medium, good, excellent.
