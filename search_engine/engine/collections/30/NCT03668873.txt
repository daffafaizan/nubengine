      specially targeting bedtime and sleep disturbances, but delivered via telehealth platform and
      enhancing the program using live parent coaching at bedtime. Utilizing REDCap automated
      survey invitations feature, investigators will provide reminders of the intervention
      recommendations and data collection requirements. In a randomized clinical trial of 90
      children with ASD, ages 2 to less than 7 years, a parent training program targeting sleep
      disturbance (Sleep Parent Training; SPT), will be compared to Sleep Parent Education (SPE).
      The investigators hypothesize that SPT will be superior in improving child sleep, child
      daytime functioning as well as parent well-being compared to SPE.

      Specific Aims: Aim 1. To evaluate the efficacy of Sleep Parent Training program (SPT)
      delivered via telehealth for sleep disturbances compared Sleep Parent Educational Program
      (SPE, time and attention control) also delivered via telehealth in 90 children with ASD (ages
      >2 to <7 years) with moderate or greater sleep disturbances as measured by the Composite
      Sleep Index (CSI) of the modified Simonds and Parraga Sleep Questionnaire (MSPSQ).97 Aim 2.
      To evaluate the impact of SPT on child and parent quality of life (daytime child behavior,
      parental stress, parent sense of competency, mental health) compared to SPE.
