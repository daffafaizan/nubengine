      genes involved have been difficult to identify. New technologies now exist to help
      researchers discover obesity susceptibility genes. One of these technologies is the
      Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) Array 6.0 chips. SNPs are
      individual base pair differences in genes of different individuals, and they are the main
      source of human genetic diversity. The "chips" are thumbnail-size silicon surfaces that
      contain copies of hundreds of thousands of SNPs of the human genome (in this case around
      900,000). SNP chips allow researchers to screen thousands of genes in a single experiment and
      compare genes of subjects with a particular disease or condition with unaffected control
      subjects. The investigators study utilizes SNP chips to compare the genetic profiles of obese
      subjects (N = 20, body mass index > 35 kg/m2) without common obesity-related co-morbidities
      such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension with well matched, lean controls (N = 20, body mass
      index 18-25 kg/m2). This is a pilot study intended to explore the following: 1) possible
      associations between obesity and previously unidentified obesity susceptibility genes; 2)
      associations between known obesity genes and obesity risk in subjects without obesity-related
      metabolic co-morbidities; and 3) how well our genetic data conform to other studies in
      similar populations as a way of assessing if the investigators have identified a
      representative cohort of obese subjects.
