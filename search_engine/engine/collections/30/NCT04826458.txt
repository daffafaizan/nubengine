    
      This is a multicenter, interventional, non-pharmacological study on a app for oral anticancer
      therapy management.

      The primary aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the electronic diary in
      improving adherence to oral therapy treatment compared to the paper diary, in patients with
      solid and haematological tumors.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. describe the reasons for non-adherence in each group (eg. forgetfulness, side effects,
           misunderstanding of prescription),

        2. describe the patient's compliance with the instrument and modalities (electronic diary,
           paper diary) through a short questionnaire

        3. description of the costs related to therapeutic non-adherence. A total of 124 patients
           will be considered: enrollment will take place consecutively until the predetermined
           number is reached.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a balanced procedure a blocks
      exchanged to one of the following interventions, stratified by type of therapy (chemotherapy
      vs. biological therapy): A. electronic diary B. paper diary The electronic diary consist of
      an Android app (for Android version 2.2 and later) for mobile devices, which acts as a diary
      for the patient.

      Adherence will be assessed at each treatment cycle by counting the remaining tablets. For
      patients with disease progression within six treatment cycles, the assessment of adherence
      and therefore the count of the remaining tablets will end on the date of progression.
