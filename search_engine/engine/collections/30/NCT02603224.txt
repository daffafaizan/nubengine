      Cohorts of 3-6 healthy male volunteers, ages 18-45, will receive single or multiple ascending
      doses of MRG-201 by intradermal injection at one site and placebo at a second site over a
      period of up to 15 days, with follow-up for up to 28 days after the last dose to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose in intact or incised normal skin and the tendency for active drug
      to diffuse through the skin.
