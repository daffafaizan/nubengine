    
      Patients will be consented, enrolled, and randomly assigned to a control group (no dog) or to
      an experimental group (dog). The patient assigned to the experimental group will be exposed
      to the therapy animal prior to the dental appointment. Pre-dental procedure and post- dental
      procedure surveys will be given to all the subjects asking the same questions. Biometric data
      will be collected by measuring heart rates of the patient/subject during the dental
      appointment with a Fitbit.
