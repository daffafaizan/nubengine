      trophoblastic cells, most of which occur in women of reproductive age. The survival rate of
      patients with score of 7 or more points, or WHO â…£ period for high-risk patients was of 60% to
      80%. However, due to severe toxic reactions, long treatment time, loss of optimal
      reproductive age and increased costs, and treatment failure caused by chemotherapy
      resistance, high-risk GTN is still one of the tumors seriously affecting the life health and
      quality of life of young women.

      First-line chemotherapy recommended by FIGO is regimen of EMA - CO with corresponding side
      effects and adverse factors in the following aspects as relatively higer incidence of
      myelosupression, VP - 16 being associated with a second tumor, especially leukemia, and a
      definite effect of cyclophosphamide on the failure ovarian function Taxol (Taxol) is the most
      widely used and most effective broad-spectrum anti-tumor drug in gynecological malignant
      tumors at present, and T (paclitaxel) +P (platinum drugs) scheme is the first-line
      chemotherapy scheme in ovarian cancer patients at present. According to references, TP also
      has effects on resistant and refactory high risk GTN patients.

      Given relatively simple operation way of TP chemotherapy, and the effect of chemotherapy in
      recurrence and high-risk refractory GTN performance,this prospective multicenter randomized
      controlled clinical research was to study the effect and safety of paclitaxel plus cisplatin
      as the first-line regimen in the treatment of high risk gestational trophoblastic tumor
      compared with EMA-CO.
