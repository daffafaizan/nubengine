      glycine uptake, sarcosine increases synaptic glycine concentration to enhance NMDA receptor
      function. NMDA receptor, a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors, serves important
      functions in the brain, including learning, memory, cognition, and neural plasticity under
      physiological conditions and contributes to neurodegeneration in pathophysiological
      processes. NMDA receptor represents collectively a group of heteromeric tetramers. Every NMDA
      receptor is a protein complex, typically composed of two NR1 subunits and two NR2 subunits
      that together form the NMDA receptor ion channel. It requires two receptor agonists
      (glutamate for the NR2 binding site and glycine for the NR1 binding site) to open the ion
      channel for NMDA receptor activation. Clinically, modulation through the NMDA-NR1-glycine
      site is preferred to avoid the excitotoxicity associated with the glutamate site activation.8
      In addition, recent animal studies have shown that dopamine secretion can be enhanced by
      either blocking the striatal NR2 or by activation of the NMDA-receptor glycine site. In the
      project, we will focus on pharmacological enhancement of NMDA-glycine receptor function based
      on increasing synaptic glycine concentration by sarcosine administration to examine whether
      enhancing NMDA-glycine receptor activity can improve the neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognition
      and hopefully motor function in PD-D patients
