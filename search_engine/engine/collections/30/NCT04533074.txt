      randomly divided in two groups: group (1) single visit regeneration and group (2) multiple
      visits regeneration protocol, in which calcium hydroxide will be applied for one week or more
      according to resolution of signs and symptoms. Dentin debris collected on a file will be
      taken as microbiologic sample to be cultured and examined by MALDI-TOF MS. This will be
      performed after the access cavity preparation and after irrigation in both groups, these
      samples will be labelled A and B, respectively. In group (2) there will be a third sample
      labeled C which will be taken after the removal of the intra canal calcium hydroxide.
