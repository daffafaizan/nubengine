      study. Patients will attend for 4 study days >1 week apart, whereas controls will attend for
      single day. Circulating MÏ† and other immune cells will be confirmed using FACS prior each
      study.

      Study 1 Both patients and control will attend for visit 1: assessment of vascular function
      using forearm plethysmography as part of case control study.

      Vasculitis patients will then attend for visits 2, 3 & 4 as part of randomised three way
      crossover study (randomised & infusions given in a double-blind method): comparison of the
      effects of selective ETA receptor antagonism (BQ123; 1000nmol/min for 15min iv), mixed ETA/B
      antagonism (BQ123/788; 1000 nmol/min & 300 nmol/min for 15 min), and placebo on systemic
      haemodynamics.
