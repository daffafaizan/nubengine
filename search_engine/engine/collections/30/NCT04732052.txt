      Impulsivity (RRI) and reducing incidents of aggression in people with developmental
      disabilities is residential or hospital settings. Using a single blind, parallel arms,
      randomized controlled trial design, adults (n=60) aged 18 to 65 with developmental
      disabilities, who have a history of impulsivity leading to aggression, will be randomised to
      receive either repetitive anodal or sham tDCS. Enrolled participants will receive either
      three treatment sessions of tDCS or sham tDCS. Behavioural and impulsivity will be measured
      before and immediately after treatment, one week, and one month after treatment end. Data
      will be analysed in SPSS using repeated measures ANOVA.
