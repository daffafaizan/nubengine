      balance and head-neck proprioception sense in patients with chronic neck pain. The study will
      recruit 120 chronic neck pain patients and randomize the into 2 groups of 60. Group 1 will
      receive a course of manual therapy and infrared radiation for 15 minutes (twice weekly for 12
      sessions). The other group (control) will receive infrared radiation therapy only. Manual
      therapy will be provided by experienced physiotherapists and assessed by a separate assessor.
      All outcome measures will be assessed at the beginning of study, upon completion of
      intervention, 3-month and 6-month after the completion of study. All measurements collected
      will be analysed by computerized statistical software in order to calculate the effectiveness
      of manual therapy and relationship among those outcome measurements.
