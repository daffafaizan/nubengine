      ethambutol or clarithromycin in combination with ethambutol for 24 weeks, after which they
      are evaluated for entry into a maintenance phase of treatment. Clinical, microbiologic, and
      safety assessments are performed every 3 weeks for the first 12 weeks, then monthly for the
      remaining 12 weeks.
