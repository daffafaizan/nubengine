    
      Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It is thought
      to be mainly a primary or idiopathic form; however, it may also be secondary to many other
      diseases (e.g., infections, drugs, neoplasms and autoimmune diseases). In this study, the
      presence of Helicobacter Pylori antigen was investigated in renal tissue from needle biopsy
      samples, and the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the effects of H. pylori eradication
      on proteinuria level in patients with MN will be investigated.
