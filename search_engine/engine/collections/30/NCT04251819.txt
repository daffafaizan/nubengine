      decades, opioid prescriptions have quadrupled while the age of heroin initiation has
      decreased, suggesting that more individuals are using opioids and transitioning to heroin and
      potent synthetic opioids than in the past. Further, fatal opioid overdose is now the leading
      cause of accidental death and is the 5th highest overall cause of mortality in the US.
      Engaging opioid users in opioid agonist treatments has been shown to lower rates of criminal
      behavior, lower rates of non-opioid drug use, and increase retention in drug treatment
      programs, while decreasing mortality and new HIV and hepatitis infections. However, a recent
      study noted that 68% of patients prescribed buprenorphine had poor medication adherence,
      which was associated with illicit opioid use. A Cochrane review concluded that buprenorphine
      was less effective at retaining patients in treatment relative to methadone. One reason for
      lower treatment retention may be the high comorbidity of opioid use disorder and chronic pain
      and/or opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Buprenorphine, as a partial mu agonist, provides lower
      analgesia but an improved safety profile relative to full agonists like methadone. Thus,
      enhancing the analgesic properties of buprenorphine will provide a safer alternative for
      opioid use disorder patients with chronic pain/hyperalgesia.
