    
      A randomized, non-blinded, controlled clinical trial using a parallel design of a
      hypocaloric, low fat (<30% energy from fat) diet with or without 2 oz of almonds over 18
      months. Interim analyses will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The study will be
      divided into 3 phases. Phase 1 (months 0-6) will be an active, intensive weight loss phase.
      During phase 1, all subjects will meet once a week in the evening for 1.5 hours. Phase 2
      (months 6-12) will be a less intensive weight loss phase. During phase 2 groups will meet
      every other week in the evening for 1.5 hours. The last phase will be the weight maintenance
      phase or phase 3 (months 12-18).
