      bladder muscle contracts more than normal during filling. These patients often have an
      inability to void, so that catheterization is required to empty the bladder.

      The medicine being tested in this study is called solifenacin succinate. Solifenacin tablets
      are given to adults for the treatment of overactive bladder. A new liquid suspension has been
      developed to treat children and adolescents in this and other studies.

      The efficacy and safety of the solifenacin suspension was investigated. The take-up and
      length of time that the solifenacin suspension stays in the body was also investigated during
      this study. Effectiveness was measured by urodynamics (the filling and emptying of the
      bladder) and the urine volumes during catheterization together with the diary responses
      relating to the number of incontinence episodes or incontinence free days.

      Safety assessments included analysis of the blood and urine, review of the electrocardiogram
      (ECG), ultrasound of the kidney, simple memory and understanding tests (cognitive function)
      and the ability to see near and far objects (visual accommodation).
