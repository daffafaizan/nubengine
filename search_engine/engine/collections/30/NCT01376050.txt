      weeks. Venous stasis ulcers account for 80% to 90% of all leg and foot ulcers, affecting an
      estimated 500,000-600,000 people in the United States every year. Venous stasis ulcers
      account for the loss of 2 million working days and incur treatment costs around $3 billion
      dollars annually in the United States. Standard of care for venous stasis ulcers includes
      compression of the affected leg together with daily dressing changes to minimize swelling;
      debridement of the ulcer to remove dead tissue and bacteria; and daily wound Care dressing to
      keep the wound clean. Venous stasis ulcers typically have very lengthy and poor healing
      rates, with up to 50% remaining open and unhealed for 9 months or longer. Many patients
      suffer pain and sleep and mobility problems, impairing quality of life. Recurrence rates for
      venous stasis ulcers is very high, with about one third of treated individuals experiencing 4
      or more episodes of ulceration.

      Low level laser light therapy (LLLT), with its proven tissue healing acceleration properties
      has recently gained attention as a simple, non-invasive alternative adjunctive therapy to
      assist in both wound closure and accelerated time to wound closure. Numerous histological
      trials have exhibited laser therapy's capacity to upregulate essential wound-healing factors
      such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),
      oxygen concentration, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, re-epithelialization, and
      tissue granulation. Clinically, the application of laser therapy has demonstrated promise,
      accelerating the rate of wound healing and tissue contracture.
