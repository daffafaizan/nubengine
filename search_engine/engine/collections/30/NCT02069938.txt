    
      Subjects will be recruited to participate in controlling a physical robotic device such as a
      quadcopter or a robotic arm using imagination of movement or other activities as detected by
      brain waves that can be used to control a robotic device.

      The subjects will be able to observe the controlling of a robotics device using one's thought
      and participate in multiple sessions to learn the skills to better control such a device.
