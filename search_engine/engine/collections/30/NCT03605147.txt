    
      The study is a randomized double-blind controlled trial. Patients randomly enter into two
      treatment groups: 1) the CaHMB group and 2) the placebo group. Treatment allocation is by
      block randomization, with an one-to-one ratio for CaHMB and placebo. The results are
      concealed in opaque envelopes. Patients will report their daily diets with an online
      software. Patients will come for clinic after 4 weeks and 12 weeks, receiving laboratory
      tests and sarcopenia evaluation, and events of primary and secondary outcomes will be
      analyzed.
