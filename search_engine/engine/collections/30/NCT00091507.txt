      Basic and clinical research suggests intravenous GIK metabolic myocardial support reduces
      ischemia-induced arrhythmias, progression from unstable angina pectoris (UAP) to acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI), myocardial infarction (MI) size, and mortality. Also, for ST
      elevation MI (STEMI), GIK may prolong time of benefit of coronary reperfusion. These effects
      should reduce short- and long-term mortality from ACS, including AMI and UAP, and the
      propensity for heart failure (HF). These benefits are related to the earliness of ACS, when
      both risk and opportunity to save lives are highest.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multicenter clinical trial of
      IMMEDIATE GIK as early as possible in ACS in the prehospital emergency medical service (EMS)
      setting. Distinct from prior and ongoing GIK trials, this will test GIK for all ACS rather
      than only for AMI or STEMI in prehospital EMS. The primary hypothesis is that early GIK will
      prevent or reduce the size of acute myocardial infarction. Major secondary hypotheses posit
      GIK will reduce mortality (30 days and 1 year), reduce pre- or in-hospital cardiac arrest and
      the propensity for heart failure. Other hypotheses address mechanisms of these effects.
