    
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty five children with CP (mean age 7.4±4.8 years; 19 boys),
      enrolled in this randomized controlled study underwent BTX injections (3±1.7 muscles per
      procedure). Prior to treatment each child was assigned to receive either medical clown
      intervention (study) or standard care (control). Outcome measure was the Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) as reported by the child (n =14) or parent (n =11) prior and subsequent to each
      procedure.
