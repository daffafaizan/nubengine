      screening period lasting up to 5 weeks and a treatment period lasting 8 weeks. Subjects will
      visit the dental clinic twice during the screening period, at Day 1, and at Weeks 4 and 8 of
      the study.The study will include a single-center run-in phase during which 12 subjects will
      be enrolled in order to gain preliminary effectiveness data on the TMJ NextGeneration(TM)
      device. Following completion of the first 12 subjects, a sample size re-estimation may be
      conducted in order to verify the initial sample size assumptions of the study. These run-in
      subjects will not be included in the final analysis of the study. Approximately a total of
      153 subjects will be enrolled in the study with subjects allocated 2:1 to the TMJ
      NextGeneration(TM) and occlusal splint treatment arms, respectively. The study is powered
      with respect to the dual primary effectiveness endpoints of CFB in bruxism episodes per hour
      of sleep and CFB in migraine episodes per month.
