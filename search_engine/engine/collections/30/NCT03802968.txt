      videoassisted thoracoscopic(VATS) surgery but normal respiratory functions were yet impacted
      during general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, loss of respiratory muscle tone and
      intrathoracic surgery. Lung ultrasonography has been confirmed to be a available tool for
      rapid confirming atelectasis, pleural effusion , pneumonia and pneumothorax. Diaphragmatic
      excursion were well correlated with vital capacity by lung function testing and diaphragmatic
      ultrasound imaging was demonstrated accurately to identify atrophy and impaired contractility
      or motion of the diaphragm.The primary aim of this present study was to investigate
      respiratory complications after OLV in the postoperative period by using bedside lung
      ultrasonography.The secondary aim was to evaluate the variation of lung ventilation during
      thoracoscopic surgery through lung ultrasonography combine with diaphragm ultrasound and
      assess the accuracy of ultrasound to confirm proper endobronchial intubation.
