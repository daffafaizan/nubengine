      endoscopic diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and associated Intraepithelial
      neoplasia(IEN), providing in-vivo optical biopsies comparable to standard histology.
      Specifically, EM will enable targeted biopsy rather than random mucosal biopsy during routine
      endoscopic surveillance of BE or endoscopic evaluation of patients with suspected or proven
      unlocalized IEN, which will improve the diagnostic yield of mucosal samples for BE IEN.
      Furthermore, when combined with high resolution endoscopy, EM may improve the overall in vivo
      detection of IEN in lesions as well as flat mucosa.

      The investigators also hypothesize that EM will provide additional accurate information
      regarding the presence of IEN that will impact upon the physician's decision to obtain a
      mucosal biopsy or perform endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). This could potentially minimize
      the number of unnecessary biopsies and as well as enable the physician to perform EMR at the
      time of the initial examination, rather than delaying endoscopic treatment to another
      procedure after the pathology from the mucosal biopsies are available. This study is
      important because it will validate single center studies supporting the routine use of EM for
      screening and surveillance of BE.
