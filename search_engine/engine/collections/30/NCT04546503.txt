    
      Inclusion of multiple trauma patients with limb fractures and need for sedation and prolonged
      mechanical ventilation.

      Patients should meet the following criterias: pressure of cerebral perfusion>60mmHg,
      normothermia, PaCO2 35-40 mmHg, pH> 7.20, Normal coagulation parameters, Hb> 8g / dl (without
      head trauma) or Hb> 10g / dl (if associated head trauma).

      Randomization in two patients groups: "RA group" versus "NoRA Group

      Methods:

      group without locoregional anesthesia: Sedation using midazolam and sufentanil: Multi-Daily
      adjustment of doses every 4 hours using Behavioral Pain Scale score <4 and Ramsay Score > 4.

      group with locoregional anesthesia: Sedation using midazolam and sufentanil: Multi-Daily
      adjustment of doses every 4 hours using Behavioral Pain Scale score <4 and Ramsay Score > 4 +
      peronerval block catheter from 0 to 24h after admission in intensive care unit using
      ropivacaine 0.2% with a continuous infusion at 1mL/10 Kg /H Follow-up up to 5 days for the 2
      group. The main objective: sufentanil consumption (reported in Âµg / kg / d) for the same
      levels of Behavioral Pain Scale and Ramsay Scales values.
