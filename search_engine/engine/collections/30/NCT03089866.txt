      from the desired clinical effects of sedative and anesthetic drugs. Recent evidence suggests
      that disruption CNS function may be prolonged and result in unwanted cognitive effects in
      predisposed individuals. Investigators know that there is a considerable pharmacokinetic
      (onset, distribution and elimination) and pharmacokinetic variability of neurotropic drugs
      even with in persons within a certain age and weight group. What the investigators do not
      know, is how to predict or quantify an individual's susceptibility to sedation and anesthesia
      and, more importantly, the potential cognitive susceptibility of an individual's brain to
      these drugs.

      Auditory functional imaging is a well validated task. It can be applied as a short (5 minute)
      test. Investigators know (preliminary data) that the size of the brain activation area
      changes after sedation. Investigators now postulate that this change reflects a disruption of
      neuronal integration in the brain and that this change may be an objective measure of the
      cognitive effects of sedation for an individual.

      As supportive data for an R-01 grant application the investigators propose to enroll 20
      elderly subjects by public advertisement and quantify the effects of sedation with midazolam
      on auditory activation (auditory fMRI) and cognitive performance (mini Mental State exam and
      complex reaction time).
