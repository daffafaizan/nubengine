      or laryngeal tumor will fill the RSI questionnaire. Then fiberoptic examination will be
      performed by a laryngologist that will complete the RFS score.

      Patients with suspicious lesions will be referred for TFL standard biopsy and CDx brush
      biopsy in order to determine whether the lesions are malignant or benign. The pathologic
      diagnosis of invasive carcinoma from a TFL biopsy is considered equivalent to the pathology
      results from a direct laryngoscopy biopsy. All patients with benign pathology or carcinoma
      in-situ (CIS) on TFL biopsy will be referred for subsequent direct laryngoscopy (DL) for
      definitive diagnosis. At the time of the DL biopsy will include also another CDx brush smear.
      Patients with benign-appearing lesions will be taken for lesion removal and biopsy.Before
      removal of the lesion a CDx brush smear will be collected.

      All the participants suspected of LPR will have: PHmetry with Manometry andCDx brush
      biopsy.All relevant demographic and clinical data will be retrieved for analysis.

      CDx biopsies will be an addition to the routine management of the patients in the diagnosis
      and follow-up of laryngeal lesions and LPR and will not replace the standard regimen.
