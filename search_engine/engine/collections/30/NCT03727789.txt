      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the dose-limiting toxicities of
      intra-arterial facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137
      (CBL0137) in patients with advanced extremity melanoma or sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tumor response in advanced melanoma and sarcoma patients treated with
      intra-arterial administration of CBL0137.

      II. To define both response in-field (area of the limb distal to the infusion point) and
      out-of-field (any area proximal to the infusion point) in patients treated with CBL0137 based
      intra-arterial infusion.

      III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of CBL0137 in the study population pre-and post CBL0137
      intraarterial infusion.

      IV. Assess tumor protein expression profiles before and after treatment with CBL0137.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess if the proposed treatment has any effect on quality of life as measured by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ? Melanoma (assessment tool also applicable to
      sarcoma).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of FACT complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137.

      Patients receive FACT complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137 intra-arterially (IA) over 15
      minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 6 and 12 weeks, every 3
      months for 12 months, then at 24 months.
