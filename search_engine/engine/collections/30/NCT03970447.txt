    
      Glioblastoma (GBM) adaptive, global, innovative learning environment (GBM AGILE) is an
      international, seamless Phase II/III response adaptive randomization platform trial designed
      to evaluate multiple therapies in newly diagnosed (ND) and recurrent GBM. Its goals are to
      identify effective therapies for glioblastoma and match effective therapies with patient
      subtypes. Bayesian response adaptive randomization is used within subtypes of the disease to
      assign participants to Arms based on their performance. The primary endpoint is overall
      survival (OS).

      GBM AGILE is designed to efficiently evaluate therapies. The trial will be conducted under a
      single Master Investigational New Drug Application/Clinical Trial Application and Master
      Protocol, allowing multiple drugs and drug combinations from different pharmaceutical
      companies to be evaluated simultaneously. The plan is to add experimental therapies as new
      information about promising new drugs are identified and remove therapies as they complete
      their evaluation.
