    
      The STRATUS Pilot Study is a prospective observational study (before-after design) to assess
      the feasibility of implementing a full-scale randomized trial powered for clinical outcomes
      (RBC transfusion, incidence and severity of anemia). Identification of barriers and
      facilitators of implementation will enhance the conduct of the full-scale trial and
      facilitate incorporation of the intervention into routine practice.
