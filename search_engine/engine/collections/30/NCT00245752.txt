      Denmark, but there is only little evidence to the effect of acupuncture.

      Many of the induction procedures currently in use in Denmark also have a little risk of side
      effects. to mention a few: There is a increased risk of maternal and neonatal infection,
      bleeding, ruptured membranes and placental disruption as result of the use of endocervical
      balloon catheter. In connection with manual rupture of membranes there is an increased risk
      of umbilical prolapse, maternal and neonatal infection, affected fetal heart rate, scratches
      on the scalp and placental bleeding. By using misoprostol there has been seen
      hyperstimulation of uterus causing affected fetal heart rate.

      Many women are asking for alternatives to the existing methods used in obstetric dept.s.

      In order to assess the effect, or lack of, acupuncture might have, we want to use acupuncture
      in the study group on acupuncture points on hands, feet, ankles and back of the head. The
      control group will get placebo acupuncture needles on same locations. The included women will
      be treated with the kind of acupuncture that counts for the group to which shes been
      allocated on gestational age 41+6 at 8:00 am and 2:30 pm.
