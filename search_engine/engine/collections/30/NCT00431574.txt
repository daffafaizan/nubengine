      on their current antipsychotic (monotherapy) for a period of at least 3 months. After
      providing informed consent, individuals will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms:
      regular daily antipsychotic dosing or active medication at the same daily dose every 2nd day.
      Various scales to measure clinical response and side effects will be administered at
      baseline, as well as every 2 weeks thereafter. Subjective scales will also be employed, and
      lab evaluations will include plasma antipsychotic levels at baseline and endpoint, as well as
      prolactin. Our sample size will be 20/group.
