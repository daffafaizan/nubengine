      pentavalent antimonial meglumine antimoniate. The treatment with meglumine antimoniate is
      toxic and at least some of the more relevant adverse events associated with that drug are
      dose-dependent. Recently, some research developed in Brazil has shown evidence that lower
      doses of pentavalent antimony are equally efficacious as compared to the standard-dose
      regimen. That evidence has been obtained in patients from the State of Rio de Janeiro who
      were infected by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. The purpose of the study is to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the low-dose pentavalent antimony regimen in patients with
      cutaneous leishmaniasis infected by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis living in a rural area
      of the State of Bahia, Brazil, where cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly endemic. The
      usefulness of the study is based on the possibility to reduce the toxicity observed during
      treatment and the treatment costs.

      The main comparison of the therapeutic response is going to be made between two groups
      composed of an equal number of properly randomized patients with localized cutaneous
      leishmaniasis treated with any of the following drug schemes:

        -  Meglumine antimoniate (calculated dose based on the concentration of pentavalent
           antimony) 5 mg/kg/d intravenous for 20 days

        -  Meglumine antimoniate (calculated dose based on the concentration of pentavalent
           antimony) 15 mg/kg/d intravenous for 20 days

      The clinical outcomes of cure or failure will be evaluated until the third month of
      follow-up.
