      operated at least 2 years previously, with healthy weight (at least 50% loss of excess
      weight) - HW group ; 2) Clinically severe obese patients (BMI > 40 kg/m2, without
      co-morbidities or > 35 kg/m2 with co-morbidities) - OB group; 3) Post-op RYGBP WR patients
      (at least 10% above post-op minimum weight and less than 50% loss of preop excess weight) -
      WR group. All patients, from a private practice in Brasilia, were given indirect calorimetry
      examinations (GERATHERM RESPIRATORY®) measuring resting metabolic rate (RMR), respiratory
      exchange rate (RER) and DIT and collected urine during 24 hours for analysis. Immediately
      after RMR measurement, a solid mixed meal was served (270 kcal: 62% carbohydrate, 12% protein
      and 26% lipid). Remove? After ten minutes, successive PP energy expenditure measurements were
      taken (after some minutes, viz): 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 110-120, 120- 130,
      130-140, 160-170 and 170-180, accompanying a 3-hour measurement period. DIT, calculated for
      each interval, followed this equation: DIT = PP Metabolic rate (MR) time interval - RMR.
      Correct? Mean areas under the curve (AUC) of all groups and baseline time measurements were
      compared using the analysis of variance test (ANOVA). Between-group longitudinal changes were
      tested using a mixed-effects model analysis of variance for repeated measures. Showing a
      p-value < 0.05, a Bonferroni correction was used. AUC was calculated by trapezoidal rule,
      considering significant a value of p <0.05.

      Results: 45 patients participated (HW 21, OB 13, WR 11). Mean group age was 37.00 ± 6.98
      years , 38.72 ± 7.01 years, and 37.88 ± 6.39 years, respectively. I changed the sequence to
      match the original. RER values increased significantly in all groups from baseline until
      final measurements. Metabolic rate (MR) adjusted for body weight (BW-adjusted MR (MR/kg)?)
      was not significant in the OB group at any PP moment compared to baseline. The HW and WR
      groups showed significant increase until final measurements. Mean AUC values for RER and RMR
      in absolute terms did not differ between groups (p = 0.3111 and p = 0.1131, respectively).
      (Two p values for how many groups ? 2 or 3?) Mean AUC values for BW-adjusted MR (kcal/kg)?
      differed between groups, where the average AUC value was significantly greater in the HW
      group than in the WR and the OB groups (p <0.0001 for both). Mean AUC value for BW-adjusted
      MR in the WR group was not significantly different from the OB group (p = 0.6369).
