      intervals of an intense isokinetic exercise protocol for knee extensor muscles.

      Design: Randomized Controlled Trial. Participants: 26 Tae Kwon Do athletes performed a
      vigorous exercise program on the isokinetic dynamometer twice in a period of 10 days, each
      time on a different extremity. In this way two groups of 26 individuals each were created,
      with the same individuals alternating. In the massage group (MG) a sport massage was applied
      between the sets while in the control group (CG) the break was passive.

      Main Outcome Measures: knee flexion and extension ROM, thigh circumference, and creatine
      kinase (CK) levels in blood plasma were measured before and after each test while L-DOMS was
      measured 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the exercise.
