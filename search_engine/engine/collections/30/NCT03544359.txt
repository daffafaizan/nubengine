      treatments and no cure. Tinnitus is thought to involve dysfunction in central brain networks
      subsequent to peripheral injury or interference; thus, neurostimulation therapies that
      directly target central circuits are receiving growing interest. Of these, noninvasive
      transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is an attractive option, due to its relative
      affordability, mobility, and favorable safety profile. A growing number of studies have
      demonstrated that tES of temporal/auditory cortex is effective at transiently reducing
      tinnitus symptoms, including tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress. However, the results of
      previous clinical trials are variable, and a mechanistic understanding of tES and its
      therapeutic effects remains elusive. The main goal of this research is to lay the groundwork
      for improved, patient-centered approaches to noninvasive neurostimulation therapy for chronic
      tinnitus. To accomplish this long-term goal, this study will determine how the intrinsic
      activity and connectivity of auditory networks are affected during simultaneous tES-fMRI of
      auditory cortex, specifically in those patients who experience reduced tinnitus symptoms
      after 5 consecutive days of tES. Though the primary goal of the proposed research is to
      optimize tES for the treatment of tinnitus, these studies will also provide a wealth of
      information regarding tinnitus pathophysiology and the mechanisms of tES more generally,
      which is being investigated for the treatment of a wide variety of brain disorders and
      injuries.
