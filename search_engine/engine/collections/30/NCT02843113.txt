      years. In response, support has grown for responsible fatherhood programs aimed at improving
      the quantity and quality of fathers' involvement. Research on these programs has concluded
      that factors such as fathers' parenting skills, co-parenting relationship quality, and
      socioeconomic status all impact fathers' ability to contribute to their children's growth and
      development. Using this previous research as a foundation, the Stepping Up 4 Your Child
      project will go beyond traditional fatherhood initiatives by integrating the provision of
      responsible parenting, economic stability, and relationship education services to fathers at
      risk for paternal disengagement. To do so, the University of Louisville's Kent School of
      Social Work will leverage its existing relationship with the Kentucky Office of Child Support
      Enforcement. Specifically, through Stepping Up 4 Your Child, non-custodial fathers will be
      provided with a comprehensive, solution-oriented program featuring group based parent
      education and individualized case management to help them achieve financial independence,
      increase their parenting skills, and develop a co-parenting alliance. Given that each of
      these focus areas have all been cited as three of the strongest predictors of paternal
      engagement, Stepping Up 4 Your Child and the results of its evaluation will have significant
      implications for the families it serves, as well as the practitioners, researchers, and
      policymakers interested in responsible fatherhood. 1
