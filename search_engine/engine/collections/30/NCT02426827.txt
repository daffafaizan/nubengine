    
      The study is a non-blinded evaluation of the use of cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
      for treatment of patients with Hunt and Hess grade 1-2 subarachnoid hemorrhage and evidence
      of cerebral vasospasm. Stimulation will be provided with electrodes placed percutaneously in
      the upper cervical epidural space. The outcome of 5 patients will be studied with focus on
      possible adverse events related to the intervention. Vasospasm response to treatment will be
      measured as a secondary outcome. Middle cerebral artery flow velocity will be followed by
      transcranial Doppler and clinical outcome measured by NIH stroke scale. Flow velocities will
      be monitored daily by transcranial Doppler and NIH stroke scale performed daily for 7 days,
      after which spinal cord stimulation will be discontinued and the epidural lead removed.
