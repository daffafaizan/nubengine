      polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) can be successfully treated with immunoglobulin either
      intravenously (IVIG) or subcutaneously (SCIG).

      CIDP is diagnosed by electrophysiology which is time-consuming and unpleasant for the
      patient.

      New techniques suggest that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging can be
      used to detect injuries in the peripheral nerves

      We want to study if MRI and ultrasound is able to detect damages in peripheral nerves, nerve
      roots and plexus in patients with CIDP.

      Moreover, we want to compare these findings to healthy matched controls and to see if
      treatment with immunoglobulin changes findings in MRI
