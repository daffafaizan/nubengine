        -  Pregnant women with threatened preterm labour (TPL) will present vaginal microbiome
           different from those without TPL.

        -  Treatment with probiotics will modify the vaginal microbioma of pregnant women with TPL.

        -  The PB rate before 37 weeks in pregnant women with TPL who have received probiotics
           since their diagnosis will be reduced by at least 30%.

      Goals

        -  To correlate the use of probiotics of pregnant women with TPL with the PB rate before 37
           weeks.

        -  To ascertain the PB rate before 28, 30, 32 and 34 weeks in both groups.

        -  To assess neonatal morbidity between both groups.

      Methods

      Prospective, randomised, longitudinal, prospective, double-blind study.

      Relevance

      This study will determine whether the use of probiotics in pregnant women with TPL is
      associated with a lower risk of PB before 37 weeks. If so, it would allow us to act on the
      tertiary prevention of PB and treatment of TPL, the main cause of perinatal morbidity and
      mortality in our setting. It will also facilitate understanding of the pathophysiology of PB,
      influence of vaginal microbiota and the mechanism of action of probiotics.
