      Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for test-retest reliability
      (n=67). Construct validity was determined by comparing with the Venham Picture Test (VPT).
      The factor structure was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Confirmatory
      factor analysis (CFA) was used for the dimensionality. The cut-off points of the Turkish
      version of MCDASf were plotted using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
