    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the rate of engagement in a PEP to PrEP HIV
      provider network for those patients presenting following a non-occupational HIV exposure.

      The development of a referral network and intensive clinical follow up of PEP patients will
      result in more patients appropriately initiating PEP, being referred to appropriate follow
      up, and post exposure transition and maintaining on PrEP (if indicated) at completion of the
      PEP medications.
