      management of pediatric bipolar disorder. Its new Extended Release formulation offers the
      advantage of once a day dosing. Although the precise mechanisms by which Divalproex Sodium
      exerts its therapeutic effects remains unknown, it has been suggested that its activity may
      be related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the
      shorter acting formulation Divalproex Sodium is FDA approved for the treatment of adult
      bipolar disorder, its Extended Release formulation is currently only FDA approved for adults
      for the prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches and has not yet been studied in patients
      with mania. Three studies of Divalproex Sodium have documented safety and efficacy of this
      compound, as well as superiority over placebo, in the treatment of adults with bipolar
      disorder.

      This medication has not, however, been adequately investigated in children. The proposed
      study includes 1) an 8-week acute period, during which participants are observed during
      weekly visits, and up to an 8-month extension period, during which participants see a study
      clinician on a monthly basis, to document the response rate 2) assessment of the impact of
      Divalproex Sodium Extended Release on functional capacities (quality of life, psychosocial
      function) and cognition, 3) careful assessment of safety and tolerability.
