      neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and is associated with physiologic,
      biochemical, and clinical responses indicating pain and stress in prematures. Although
      morphine is one of the most used drugs for premedication and for sedation and analgesia
      during mechanical ventilation in the treatment of RDS its pharmacological profile precludes
      several limitations mostly due to its much delayed onset of action what makes the drug not
      suitable as premedication and due to its prolonged duration of action mainly in prematures.
      Unlike morphine, remifentanil has an unique pharmacokinetic properties with a rapid onset of
      action and, a fast decrease in plasma concentration after interruption of administration due
      to a context-sensitive half-time of 3.2 minutes. So, it could be the ideal opioid for
      neonates who are especially sensitive to respiratory depression by opioids
