      remains unclear. The objective of the B-Convinced study is to demonstrate that continuation
      of beta-blocker treatment in case of hospitalisation for heart failure worsening is as safe
      as the interruption of such treatment.

      Hypothesis: The proportion of patients clinically improving within 3 days is not inferior
      when beta-blocker treatment is maintained compared to beta-blocker interruption in case of
      hospitalisation for heart failure worsening with pulmonary oedema.

      Design: Open, randomized non-inferiority trial on two parallel groups of patients.
      Randomization performed centrally with a vocal server.

      Tested Hypothesis: 90% of success in the interruption group, power of 80%, non-inferiority
      limit of 15% (relative reduction). 162 patients are required with such a hypothesis.

      Primary Endpoint: Clinical improvement within 3 days of hospital admission evaluated by the
      investigator by a standardized questionnaire.

      Secondary Endpoints: Clinical improvement at day 8 or at hospital discharge,
      morbidity-mortality at 4 months.
