      myasthenia. Beside these, respiratory involvement is one of the common complications of DM.
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occur in approximately 90% of patients with DM, part of them
      may manifest rapidly progressive-interstitial lung disease (rp-ILD), which progresses into
      respiratory failure that is difficult to correct and leads to death. Early identification of
      rp-ILD high risk group is of great significance to improve the prognosis of patients and to
      conduct following clinical studies. A simple, easy, convenient and reliable diagnostic tool
      has not yet acquired till now.

      MSG-Jiangsu, short for Myositis Study Group-Jiangsu, was founded by department of
      rheumatology and immunology of eighteen tertiary hospitals. Clinical Research on Advanced
      Warning Factors Of Respiratory Injury in Dermatomyositis (CRAWFORD) as a multicenter
      observational cohort study was started at Jun 1, 2020. Our cohort plan to recruit 1,000 adult
      inpatients. What's more, prognostic data from these DM patients were obtained by following up
      for 1 year. At the same time, clinical data and auxiliary examination results of the baseline
      DM patients were analyzed to look for factors that are associated with outcomes. Then,
      regression analysis of influencing factors will help us to set up a multi-factor weighted
      score to forecast the prognosis of DM patients. Finally, Biological specimen from patients at
      baseline are used to look for biomarkers that predict prognosis by RNA-sequencing, whole exon
      sequencing, proteomic screening and so on.
