      enhance testing compliance in a population of children who are receiving a diagnostic
      evaluation for Autism. Another purpose of this study is to determine if pre-exposure to the
      test setting can increase the compliance on individual test measures. To test the central
      hypothesis and accomplish the study objective, 2 aims guide the proposed study.

        1. Determine the extent to which pre-exposure to expectations and tasks that occur during
           the audiological evaluation will increase audiological testing compliance. Hypothesis:
           Children receiving the intervention video, which will model what they will experience
           during the audiological evaluation, will show greater compliance during the evaluation
           than children who receive the placebo video.

        2. Determine the extent to which enhanced testing compliance will increase the number of
           test measures obtained during an audiological evaluation. Hypothesis: Children who are
           more compliant during the audiological evaluation will allow the audiologist to obtain
           more test measures in a single appointment than the children who are less compliant.
