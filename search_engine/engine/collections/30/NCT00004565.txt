      distributed. Although we have been able to identify genetic factors whose variants appear to
      significantly alter an individual's risk of developing breast cancer (BRCA1 and BRCA2), these
      genes are likely involved with less than 10% of breast cancer cases. Perhaps more applicable
      to the general population are genes which, while not directly involved with the oncogenic
      process, may have variants (polymorphisms) which act indirectly by increasing the risk of an
      oncogenic change within a cell.

      It is the goal of this proposal to look at genes, environment, clinical co-factors, and, if
      possible, any interactions in breast cancer. The ultimate objective of these studies is to
      establish an effective way of identifying individuals at greatest risk for cancer. We will
      evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with polymorphisms in genes involved in
      estrogen metabolism and action. We will also evaluate the association of breast density and
      polymorphisms in genes associated with estrogen metabolism and action. In addition, we will
      also evaluate nipple aspirate fluid and breast duct lavage fluid as another potential source
      of promising biomarkers of risk.
