      esophageal cancer increase from 10% to about 20%-40%, recurrence rate decrease from 80% to
      50%-60%, and local recurrence remains to be the most important type of failure. What called
      for is to enhance local control without increasing toxicity to improve survival. The
      investigators have found effective and safe regimen of simultaneously integrated boost
      radiotherapy in previous study, which can achieve high dose in tumor area with avoid of
      normal tissues. However, a recent prospective study reported that neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy resulted in much higher toxicities compares to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (46% vs. 15%, p= 0.04). Although chemoradiotherapy reached a higher pCR rate (28% vs. 9%,
      p=0.002), patients did not differ in survival in two groups.

      Nimotuzumab is an humanized monoclonal antibody against EGFR. Radiotherapy combines
      Nimotuzumab reveals synergistic effect in head and neck cancers with lower toxicities as
      compared to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Our previous study showed that EGFR expression rate
      were similar in esophageal cancer and head and neck cancers. Based on above results, the
      investigators design this study which aims to obtain a non-inferior pCR rate and pathological
      lymph node metastases rate in premise of lower toxicities.
