      after cardiac surgery. There is evidence that strict control of glucose levels
      postoperatively results in improved outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. There is
      currently no consensus on optimal management of hyperglycemia intraoperatively. The aim of
      this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is to determine whether normalization
      of intraoperative glucose levels with insulin improves outcomes. The comparison group will be
      treated with current standard practice to control hyperglycemia during surgery. The primary
      outcome is a composite of mortality, sternal wound infections, prolonged pulmonary
      ventilation, cardiac arrhythmias (new-onset atrial fibrillation, heart block requiring
      permanent pacemaker, cardiac arrest), stroke and acute or worsening renal failure within 30
      days after surgery. Secondary outcome measures are length of intensive care unit and hospital
      stay as well as safety and efficacy of the study insulin infusion protocol.
