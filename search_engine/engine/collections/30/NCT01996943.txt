      may be caused by ethanol (commonly referred to as alcohol) and specifically how ethanol may
      trigger episodes of the most common abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation (AF). This
      study will demonstrate the mechanism of ethanol induced atrial fibrillation and clarify the
      health effects of one of the worlds' most popular drugs (ethanol). With this understanding,
      physicians may be able to better identify those patients most at risk for ethanol induced AF
      and target public health campaigns towards this vulnerable population.

      Patients in this study will undergo an electrophysiologic study both prior to and after
      receiving either an ethanol or placebo infusion. This electrophysiology study will measure AF
      inducibility (the primary outcome), left and right atrial conduction times, and the atrial
      effective refractory period in multiple locations (AERP). The changes in the conduction times
      and AERPs (before and after study drug infusion) will be recorded as secondary outcomes.

      About 100 people will participate in this study. 50 people will be randomized to receive
      intravenous ethanol, and 50 people will be randomized to receive an intravenous placebo. The
      placebo will be in the form of 0.45% saline solution ("half normal saline") and the alcohol
      will be in the form of 6% volume/volume ethanol in 0.45% saline solution.
