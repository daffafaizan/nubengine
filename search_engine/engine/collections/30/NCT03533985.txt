      therapy interventions have on the pacification, stabilization, and development of infants
      diagnosed with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome is a group of
      problems that occur in a newborn who has been exposed to illegal or prescription opiates
      while in the mother's womb. Participants will receive 6 music therapy sessions over a 14-day
      period based on a randomized treatment schedule of 6 different interventions.
