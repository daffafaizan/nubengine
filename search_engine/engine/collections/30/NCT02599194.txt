    
      OUTLINE:

      Patients are evaluated with a PET/CT scan using the radiolabel 18F-FSPG
      [18F-(S)-4-(3-fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid] or 18F-FDG ([18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose), before
      and after therapeutic treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Uptake of the radiolabel 18F-FSPG in patients with biopsy-proven cancer will be evaluated and
      compared to the uptake of 18F-FDG, before and after therapy (non-specified) in the same group
      of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the agreement of the clinical assessment for cancer status between 18F-FSPG and
           18F-FDG.

        -  Safety and tolerability of 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG.
