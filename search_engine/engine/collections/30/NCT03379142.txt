      smoking prevalence have been realized in the United States (U.S.), this decline is not
      universal. Muslim communities continue to have disproportionately high smoking prevalence
      rates. For example, one of WellShare International's studies showed a smoking prevalence rate
      of 44.1% among Somali adult (predominantly Muslim) men in Minnesota, compared to the average
      smoking rate for adult men in Minnesota (14.4%) and in the United States of 17.8%. Despite
      ample evidence that pharmacotherapy and counselling are effective for smoking cessation in
      the general population, no one has identified effective ways to extend these benefits to the
      Muslim communities and the U.S.'s largest Somali population which resides in Minnesota. Even
      when readily available, such aids seem to be underutilized, reflecting the commonly held
      belief among Muslims that giving up smoking primarily requires only will power. Although
      approaches that draw on the need for will power around the Ramadan fast (during which smoking
      is prohibited during daylight hours) have been considered, no systematic attempt has been
      made to make effective evidence-based smoking cessation methods available leveraged on the
      Ramadan. Muslim smokers face yet another challenge during the holy month of Ramadan, where
      adherence to medications during this month has been documented as challenging. However,
      because cigarette smoking continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, it is
      critical to identify evidence-based methods for promoting adherence to known effective
      methods for reducing tobacco related health disparities in this underserved minority
      population in Minnesota.
