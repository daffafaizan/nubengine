      perioperative patient care. Narcotic medications are frequently utilized in postoperative
      care, but these have risks including sedation or dependence. Non-pharmacologic measures for
      postoperative pain control may help limit the need for opioids in postoperative pain control.

      Early mobilization is also important after surgery, however postoperative mobility is rarely
      monitored and relies on subjective reports.

      The investigators will seek to examine the implementation of an ERAS protocol using VR and
      Fitbit wearable activity devices on postoperative recovery after head and neck surgery. This
      is a prospective, 4-arm, randomized controlled trial.
