        -  To determine whether early myocardial structural and functional changes can be detected
           using cardiac MRI in patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin
           lymphoma receiving doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast prior to initiation of
      doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy and 3 months after completion of six courses of
      chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and twelve courses of chemotherapy for Hodgkin
      lymphoma.
