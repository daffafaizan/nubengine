      response rate (RR) of 20-24% as a single agent and RR of 37-40% as a combination therapy with
      5-FU and/or cisplatin.

      S-1 is a new oral dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitory fluoropyrimidine (DIF). In
      two late phase II studies of S-1 for advanced gastric cancer, RR was 45%, with very low (2%)
      incidence of grade 3 toxicity.

      Recent phase I/II trial of the combination of docetaxel and S-1 in patients with advanced
      gastric cancer suggests that repeated 3-4 week cycles of S-1 60-80mg/m2 /day for 14 days
      combined with docetaxel 40-75mg/m2 is feasible.

      Oxaliplatin, diaminocyclohexane-platinum, is an alkylating agent inhibiting DNA replication.
      Comparing to cisplatin or carboplatin, oxaliplatin appear to be more effective and has a more
      favorable toxicity profile. Phase II studies of the combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin
      in patients with advanced gastric cancer suggests that docetaxel 60 or 75mg/m2 combined with
      oxaliplatin 130 or 80mg/m2 every 3 weeks is feasible.

      Recent dose finding study of the combination of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and S-1 (DOS) in
      patients with advanced gastric cancer suggests that docetaxel 52.5mg/m2 on day 1 and
      oxaliplatin 105mg/m2 on day 1 combined with S-1 80mg/m2 on day1 to day 14 every 3 weeks is
      feasible.

      Docetaxel, S-1 and oxaliplatin have distinct mechanisms of action and no overlapped key
      toxicities. Furthermore, fluoropyrimidine and docetaxel or oxaliplatin have shown synergism
      in vivo studies and in clinical trials. Based on these results, the combination of DOS is a
      reasonable candidate of new chemotherapeutic regimen for the advanced gastric cancer.
