    
      Patients and methods:

      This cross-sectional study will include 100patients of chronic HCV infection who attend El
      Raghy Assiut university Hospital, either inpatients or outpatients. Chronic HCV infection
      will be diagnosed based on detectable HCV RNA with anti-HCV Ab in patient with clinical
      and/or ultrasonographic criteria of chronic liver disease.

      Patients will receive treatment to HCV by DAAs and follow up for 12 weeks to confirm
      sustained virological response

      Method:

      Patients presenting in this study will be subjected to the following:

        1. Full history and clinical evaluation.

        2. Body weight (kg) and height (m).

        3. BMI will calculate as weight divided by squared height (kg/m2).

        4. Waist circumference will measured at a level midway between the lowest rib and the iliac
           crest, and the hip circumference at the level of the great trochanters, with the legs
           close together.

        5. Blood pressure (mmHg) was measured twice in the upper arm after a 10-min period of rest
           and taken an average.

      Laboratory investigations will include:

        -  Complete blood count (CBC)

        -  Liver function test

        -  HCV Ab and HCV RNA by PCR

        -  HBs Ag

        -  Alpha fetoprotein

        -  Lipid profile

        -  Serum urea and creatinine

        -  Fasting blood sugar (FBG)and Serum fasting insulin level

        -  Insulin resistance determined via Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) IR = fasting
           insulin (µu/ml) × fasting glucose (mmol/L)
           ----------------------------------------------------------------- 22.5 An index value of
           ˃ 2. 5 was defined as IR (Huang et al., 2011)

        -  Vitamin D level:

      Vitamin D deficiency wasdefined as a 25 (OH)-vitamin D serum level < 20 ng/mL, vitaminD
      insufficiency as 25 (OH)-vitamin D levels of 20 - 29.9ng/mL, and normal vitamin D levels ≥ 30
      ng/mL (Holick MF et al.,2011)

        -  Abdominal Ultrasound

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)
