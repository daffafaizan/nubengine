    
      Early stage breast cancer cases between 2006 and 2009 will be identified by the Summa Akron
      City Hospital cancer registry. The cases will be reviewed and abstracted. The abstracted data
      will include results of physical breast examinations, mammograms, sonograms, breast MRI
      reports, biopsy procedure notes and pathology reports to illustrate the clinical stage.
      Definitive surgical pathology reports will be included in the abstracted data to demonstrate
      the final pathologic stage of the breast cancer.

      A database will be developed to capture the abstracted data. Outcomes will be determined
      based on final pathology reports.
