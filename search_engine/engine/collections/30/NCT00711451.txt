    
      Patients presenting to William Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak Labor and Delivery for a scheduled
      low transverse cesarean delivery will be asked to participate in a prospective, randomized
      study to evaluate any changes in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) pre- and post-delivery.

      After obtaining informed consent, the patients will be randomized to one of two groups: group
      1 will have manual removal of the placenta at cesarean section and group 2 will have
      expressed removal of the placenta at cesarean section.

      Both groups will have a pre-operative continuous wave Doppler evaluation and a post-operative
      continuous wave Doppler evaluation at 24 hours after delivery. Continuous wave Doppler
      evaluation will be used pre- and post-operatively to evaluate any changes in SVR.
