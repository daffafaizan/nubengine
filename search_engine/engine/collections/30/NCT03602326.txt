      the effects of the Bobath Approach in the early term in stroke, state that NDT-B is reliable
      and feasible. However none of these studies have examined the effects of NDT-B in acute term
      stroke on functionality and daily living. Additionally, in all of these studies it was also
      stated that further studies should be conducted.
