      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of ixabepilone and
      temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. To describe toxicity profiles associated with the combination of ixabepilone and
      temsirolimus.

      III. To assess preliminary efficacy of the combination of ixabepilone and temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1 and temsirolimus IV
      over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
