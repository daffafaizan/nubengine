    
      A pre-post experimental design will be used, in which 150 AA participants aged 50-65 will
      complete a baseline assessment of cognitive testing and data-driven assessment of
      deficiencies across five CogRx domains (physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, sleep,
      social activity). Participants will be randomized to either: psychoeducation + CogRx,
      psychoeducation only, or no contact control. The psychoeducation and CogRx groups will
      receive general psychoeducation on dementia prevalence, prognosis, and risk factors, while
      the CogRx group will also receive personalized information on their risk factor profile and
      develop a tailored 3-month intervention plan, which will consist of simple evidence-based
      strategies to implement at home. Motivational reminders as well as adherence and
      self-efficacy questions will be administered via text-messaging over the 3-months.
      Participants will return for 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Specific Aim 1 (proximal
      outcomes) is to determine whether the CogRx condition is superior to psychoeducation alone in
      improving engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Specific Aim 2 (distal outcomes) is to
      compare the three conditions on a brief battery of cognitive and psychological measures. The
      Exploratory Aim is to gather feedback for future implementation of this program, including
      cultural considerations, barriers and facilitators to engagement, and likelihood of
      continuing the program.
