      hyperglycaemia is probably multifactorial, peripheral insulin resistance is a major
      contributor, similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). There are several similarities
      between critical illness and T2D, including the presence of systemic inflammation and
      increased plasma free fatty acids (FFA), all of which may induce insulin resistance in
      healthy volunteers. In critical illness, elevated catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone
      and glucagon may also contribute to insulin resistance.

      The degree of hyperglycaemia correlates with mortality in ICU patients. van den Berghe et al.
      found that IV infusion of insulin to obtain strict normoglycaemia reduced mortality as well
      as morbidity in critically ill surgical patients and in some medical ICU patients.

      However, insulin increases the risk of hypoglycaemia; this is a major obstacle to strict
      euglycaemia in ICU patients and may explain the inability of others to reproduce the benefits
      reported by van den Berghe et al. Thus, alternatives to insulin for controlling plasma
      glucose (PG) in ICU patients are warranted.

      Aim:

      To study the role of the incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 for glycaemic,
      metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory profile in

        -  critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and

        -  healthy volunteers exposed to a standardised systemic inflammation
