      is just "spill-over" from infection of other parts of the body. Traditionally, studies of
      potential treatments for MAC focus only on MAC changes in the blood. This study compares MAC
      changes in blood to those in bone marrow, which is another tissue where MAC is often found.

      Patients receive both clarithromycin and ethambutol for 48 weeks; those who become intolerant
      to the study drugs may receive suggested substitute drugs (azithromycin and rifabutin).
      Patients receive a bone marrow biopsy at baseline and at either 4 or 8 weeks. Patients are
      evaluated at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48.
