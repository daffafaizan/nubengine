      (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), 4-period, 5-treatment crossover
      study in order to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 4 new formulations of abiraterone
      acetate compared to the current commercial formulation. Approximately 32 healthy adult males
      will participate. The total study length is up to 68 days. This study will consist of a
      screening phase followed by an open-label treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose
      treatment periods separated by a washout period of at least 7 days between dosing.
      Individuals will be randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment sequences. A single dose of 1000 mg
      abiraterone acetate will be given in each treatment period under fasted conditions.
      Participants will be confined to the study center from Day -1 of each treatment period until
      completion of the 96-hour blood sample collection on Day 5 of each treatment period. A
      follow-up visit will occur between 5 to 7 days after the last study procedure. Serial
      pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples will be collected during the
      open-label treatment phase as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
