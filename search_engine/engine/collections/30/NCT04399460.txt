      At the beginning and after 12 weeks, body weight, composition will be measured through Bodpod
      scans. Resting metabolic rate and thermogenesis will be measured by indirect calorimetry.
      Also, fecal samples will be collected for gut microbiome profiling along with blood for
      glucose, insulin, hormones, triacylglycerol, HbA1c, short-chain fatty acid, red blood cells
      and FGF21. Urine samples will be collected throughout the study.

      A followup session at 16 weeks will reassess previous measures.
