      proposed diagnostic criteria for neonatal ARDS. The study consists of a prospective,
      multicentre, web-based,cohort study in China in which neonates who fulfil the new criteria
      definition are enrolled in order to: describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and
      prognosis of neonates affected by neonatal ARDS; identify a list of risk factors for neonatal
      ARDS, as it exists for adults and older children with ARDS; and guide future studies.
