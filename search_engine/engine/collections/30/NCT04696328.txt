      cell-derived cardiomyocyte sheet in combination with an immunosuppressant for ischemic
      cardiomyopathy patients. The primary evaluation items will be improvement of left ventricular
      systolic function (LVEF) for efficacy, and safety will be assessed by blood tests, general
      laboratory tests, and other safety-related evaluations. Secondary evaluation items are NYHA
      functional evaluation, left ventricular remodeling evaluation by echocardiography,
      hemodynamic evaluation, physical activity function evaluation such as 6MWD and SAS, QOL, and
      exercise tolerance evaluation by questionnaires.
