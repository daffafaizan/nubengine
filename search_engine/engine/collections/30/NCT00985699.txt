        -  To determine if toxicity following treatment for lymphoma varies according to genetic
           polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes (i.e., SOD2, CAT, GPX1, GSTM1, and
           GSTP1).

        -  To assess whether these genetic polymorphisms are associated with progression-free
           survival and/or overall survival in these patients treated for lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected samples are used for biomarker analysis.
