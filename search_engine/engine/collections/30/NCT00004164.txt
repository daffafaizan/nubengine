      fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium in patients with potentially curable nasopharyngeal
      cancer. II. Assess the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed 1 hour later by cisplatin IV over
      4 hours and fluorouracil IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 96 hours. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is
      administered subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover or
      day 10. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses. Within 2 weeks after the
      completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo definitive radiotherapy for about 7 weeks. After
      radiotherapy, patients who did not achieve complete remission after chemotherapy may undergo
      surgery. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
