      acute pain, however not without its adverse effects including post-operative nausea, vomiting
      (PONV), constipation, urinary retention, sedation and respiratory depression. Such factors
      have been implied in the literature to contribute to prolonged post-operative length of stay,
      delayed return to diet, return of bowel function and increased incidence of ileus.
      Alternatively, non-opioids, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, NSAIDs, and selective
      cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, can be utilized for acute pain, either alone or in combination
      with opioids. In the bariatric post-surgical population, NSAIDS both oral and IV (Toradol,
      Ibuprofen) are not recommended due to their potential bleeding tendency, anti-inflammatory
      effect, and ulcerogenic effect.

      The LRYGBP may be classified as a surgery type associated with mild to moderate
      post-operative pain. Therefore, the mode of pain relief could directly affect the length of
      stay. The advent of IV acetaminophen serves as a opportunity to investigate in detail the
      efficacy of this non-opioid medication in the management of acute pain in the immediate
      post-operative period without the aforementioned adverse effects as expected from traditional
      opiate medications. A comprehensive approach to this study includes a prospective,
      double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of subjects who will undergo LRYGBP and
      randomized to the study agent (IV acetaminophen) or placebo.
