      smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Subjects will be recruited from the James P. Wilmot Cancer
      Center, University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. Patients seen in the inpatient or
      outpatient setting with histologically confirmed SMM will be evaluated for this study.

      20 patients will be treated as follows: Denosumab: day 1 = 120mg SC every 4 weeks for 12
      cycles. Cycles will be 28 days in length. Patients will be followed after completion of the
      study per standard of care for progression free survival for an additional 2 years after the
      last dose of denosumab. All patients will take daily vitamin D and calcium supplements of at
      least 1200mg elemental calcium and 800IU of vitamin D unless documented hypercalcemia
      develops on study. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy
      with denosumab. Serum vitamin D levels will be checked during screening and should be
      repleted to a total 25-hydroxyvitamin D level â‰¥30ng/mL.
