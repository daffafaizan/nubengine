      to optic nerve damage. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States, affecting
      1-2% of individuals aged 60 and over. Management of glaucoma requires chronic, life-long
      treatment with a spectrum of therapeutic options including medications, laser treatment and
      surgical implants. The common goal among the various therapies is to lower intraocular
      pressure to target levels in order to prevent loss of visual fields from excessive pressure
      on the optic nerve.
