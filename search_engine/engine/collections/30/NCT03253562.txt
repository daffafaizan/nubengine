      increased cardiovascular complications. Recently, studies suggest that metformin and
      vildagliptin can reduce cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients with unclear
      mechanisms. This work aimed to determine the effect of metformin and vildagliptin on
      diabetic-hypertensive patients. Patients were allocated into four groups: groupI: healthy
      volunteers, groupII: patients recently diagnosed with their hypertension and diabetes,
      groupIII: patients treated with captopril (25mg once daily) for their hypertension in
      addition to metformin (1000mg bid) groupIV: patients treated with captopril (25mg bid) for
      hypertension in addition to vildagliptin (50mg bid). At the end of the therapeutic period,
      then total cholesterol, LDL,serum Creatinine level, blood pressure and vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) levels in serum will be measured for different groups to estimate the
      benefits of one drug over the other one in protecting against cardiovascular risks for
      diabetic hypertensive patients..
