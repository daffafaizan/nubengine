    
      Study Procedures: Upon obtaining informed consent and within 4 weeks of the planned date of
      surgery, each site coordinator will collect baseline clinical and demographic information, a
      visual analogue score (VAS), the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
      (PROMIS-10) Global Health Survey, the short form Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand
      (QuickDASH) questionnaire and grip and then pinch measurements from the participant. On the
      same day, and immediately following collection of baseline clinical data in the clinic, the
      surgeon will anesthetize the trapeziometacarpal joint. Adequacy of the injection and
      resulting anesthesia of the joint will be assessed by repeat of the VAS score. Following 15
      minutes set time for the local anesthetic, the VAS diagram will again be completed by the
      patient followed by recording of repeat grip and then pinch measurements. Each patient will
      then undergo one of three pre-specified procedures; trapeziectomy with ligament
      reconstruction-tendon interposition (LRTI) arthroplasty with flexor carpi radialis tendon;
      trapeziectomy with suture suspensionplasty; or arthroscopic or open trapeziectomy with
      temporary K-wire fixation. Patient follow-up visits are otherwise scheduled according to the
      surgeon's routine and by clinical indication only. The patient will follow the routine
      postoperative rehabilitation protocol and hand therapy program of the operating surgeon.
      Protective splinting and exercise programs are to be utilized per surgeon protocol and
      preference.Postoperative study assessment will occur at three and six months after operation,
      The 3 and 6 month evaluation will include PROMIS-10 and QuickDASH surveys, completion of the
      VAS pain diagram, and recording of grip, key, and pulp to pulp pinch strengths. Additionally,
      specific notation of paresthesias, dysaesthesias, or sensitivity of the incision will be made
      by the surgeon or hand therapist at the 3 and 6 month assessments.
