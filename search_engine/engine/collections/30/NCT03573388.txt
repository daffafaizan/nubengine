    
      Principal investigators that enrolled stable or unstable patients with ICL who underwent both
      FFR and OCT assessment of the same lesion, will be contacted to participate the study.
      Agreeing investigators will be asked to complete a structured database by providing a series
      of key baseline clinical and angiographic data, OCT and FFR parameters.

      Collected dataset will include: sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia,
      current smoking, family history of CAD, clinical presentation, previous PCI, previous MI,
      previous CABG, non-invasive ischemia, angina, nÂ° of diseased vessels, diseased vessel,
      percentage diameter stenosis at quantitative coronary angiography (QCA% stenosis), length of
      stenosis at quantitative coronary angiography, presence of thrombus or ulceration, MLA, area
      stenosis at OCT, FFR protocol (intracoronary adenosine, endovenous adenosine, contrast)
      results and long term clinical follow-up.
