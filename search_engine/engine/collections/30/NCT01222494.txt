      adiposity with DEXA, PDDF and CIMT, directly relevant to diabetes and cardiovascular disease
      risk. The primary goals of this study are to deliver an evidence-based weight loss
      intervention to the population of youth who are overweight or obese as a result of
      antipsychotic treatment, to characterize metabolic risk associated with weight using
      sensitive biomarkers, and to evaluate the magnitude of change observed in these biomarkers in
      children receiving an established behavioral weight-loss intervention.

      Aim 1: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL)
      intervention on DEXA-measured whole body adiposity in overweight/obese antipsychotic
      (AP)-treated children compared to nonpsychiatric (NP) overweight or obese healthy controls,
      and in AP-treated youth randomized to monthly Usual Care (UC).

      Aim 2: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a BWL intervention on PDFF in
      overweight/obese AP-treated children compared to NP overweight or obese healthy controls, and
      in AP-treated youth randomized monthly UC.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the main effect of time of 16 weeks of a weekly behavioral weight loss
      intervention on CIMT in overweight/obese AP-treated children compared to NP overweight or
      obese healthy controls, and in AP-treated youth randomized monthly UC.
