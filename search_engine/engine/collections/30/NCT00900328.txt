      Primary

        -  To determine the correlation between c-Met expression, mutation and amplification, with
           stage and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) of the lung.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the correlation with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), EGFR
           mutations and expression, Kras mutations, p53 mutations, c-CBL protein expression,
           mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), DUB3 expression & regulation, and ALK
           translocation, with respect to survival.

        -  To determine the correlation with circulating c-Met and HGF in AC and evaluate
           prognostic implications of circulating markers in AC of lung.

        -  To determine (when available) levels of circulating Met and HGF in serum before and
           after surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected tissue samples from patients enrolled in CALGB 140202 are assessed for
      mutation analysis of c-Met, EGFR, and K-ras. DNA is examined by PCR, followed by agarose gel
      electrophoresis; gene amplification of c-Met is examined by real time quantitative PCR;
      met/HF protein in serum is examined by ELISA; and c-Met, EGFR, p53, c-CBL, DUB3 enzyme, and
      ALK, and epithelial mesenchymal transition examined by IHC.
