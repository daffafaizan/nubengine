      controlling negative behavioral outcomes through partnerships that use a third party's legal
      powers. In ASEP, the police partner with the schools to work together to engage with young
      people, reduce their anti-social behavior and increase their school attendance. At the core
      of the partnership is communication of the legal lever: in ASEP, it is the Queensland
      Education (General Provisions) Act (2006) - requiring young people attend school up to age 16
      and holding parents legally responsible. The laws are communicated to parents and young
      people who are not regularly attending school in a procedurally fair way within the context
      of an ASEP conference. The ASEP conference is especially designed to incorporate fair
      communication of the laws and consequences and involves a purpose-built script that seeks to
      increase willingness of both parents and young people to comply with the law. The ASEP
      conference participants include a trained facilitator (from Restorative Outcomes Australia;
      ROA), the young person missing a lot of school, their parent or guardian, a uniformed
      school-based police officer, and a school representative (e.g., teacher). An individually
      tailored Action Plan is developed during the conference which stipulate the "actions" that
      all conference participants are to take over the subsequent two months in order to ensure
      that the young person increases their school attendance and re-engages with school and/or
      transitions into paid work.
