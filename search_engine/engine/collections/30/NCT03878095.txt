    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall response rates of olaparib and ceralasertib (AZD6738) in subjects
      with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant solid malignant tumors, who will be recruited to 2
      cohorts: a. Cholangiocarcinoma b. Other solid malignant tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of olaparib and AZD6738 in adults with
      recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant solid malignant tumors.

      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2- mutant
      solid malignant tumors.

      III. To assess the duration of response in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant
      solid malignant tumors.

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of olaparib and AZD6738.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) concentration in plasma by mass spectrometry and
      correlate with treatment response.

      II. To evaluate 2HG levels in tumor biopsies prior to the beginning of treatment and while on
      therapy and correlate with treatment response.

      III. Correlate 2HG concentration in plasma and in tumor biopsies. IV. To evaluate
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double strand breaks (DSBs) as measured by mass cytometry time of
      flight (CyTOF)-imaging mass cytometry (IMC) in tumor biopsies before and after treatment with
      olaparib and AZD6738.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and ceralasertib PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
