      the efficacy and safety of the combination of bortezomib and rituximab in patients with
      relapsed or refractory rituximab na√Øve or sensitive indolent non-follicular and mantle cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite of the availability of treatment for this disease, this study
      is justified because no known therapies are really curative and it is necessary to look for
      new treatment options to improve the clinical outcome and prognosis of relapsed indolent
      lymphoma. This study is designed for patients not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cells transplantation.
