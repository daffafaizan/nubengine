      Vemurafenib (960 mg orally, daily) in combination with Metformin (500 mg orally, twice daily
      for 2 weeks, then 850 mg orally,twice daily) in patients with unresectable Stage IIIC and
      Stage IV melanoma. Phase II will evaluate the clinical activity of the combined
      Vemurafenib/Metformin regimen. The safety profile of this combined Vemurafenib/Metformin
      regimen will be monitored during both phases. The treatment period consists of 28-day cycles
      until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
