    
      This is a Phase I dose finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess
      the safety, tolerability, manufacturing feasibility, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary
      efficacy of huCART19-IL18 cells in patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). This trial will evaluate up to 7 dose levels using the Bayesian
      Optimal Interval (BOIN) design with accelerated titration to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of huCART19-IL18 cells. Subjects will be assigned to a dose level prior to study
      treatment based on available safety experience at the current and prior dose levels.
      huCART19-IL18 cells will be administered to all subjects as a single intravenous (IV)
      infusion or slow IV push, depending on the assigned dose level. For consistency, the
      huCART19-IL18 infusions will be identified as IV infusions throughout the protocol.
