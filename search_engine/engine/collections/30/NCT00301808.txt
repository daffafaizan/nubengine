      Primary

        -  Assess 1-year survival of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated
           with cisplatin, pemetrexed disodium, and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy followed by
           consolidation therapy with docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the progression-free survival and overall survival.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes followed by cisplatin IV
      over 60 minute on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive concurrent thoracic radiotherapy in weeks 1-7.
      Between 3-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with no progressive disease
      receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment with docetaxel repeats every 21 days for
      3 courses.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 month and periodically
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
