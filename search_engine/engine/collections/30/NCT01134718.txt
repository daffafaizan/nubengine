    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people involved know
      the treatment), single dose, crossover (volunteers will receive different treatments
      sequentially during the trial) study in healthy volunteers. The trial will evaluate the
      levels of TMC435 in the blood circulation after a single dose of 150 mg TMC435 administered
      as 3 different capsule formulations following breakfast. There will be a 7-day washout period
      between treatments and a 4-5 week follow-up at the end. Each volunteer will receive all three
      treatments. The main focus of the trial is the pharmacokinetic characteristics (how drugs are
      absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from
      the body over time) of the different formulations. This evaluation requires multiple blood
      samples from Day 1 through 72 hours after dosing. Safety assessments (lab work, blood
      pressure, pulse and electrocardiogram) will follow a different schedule and are measured on
      Day -1 (day prior to taking first dose of drug), Day 1 (without lab work) and Day 4 of each
      treatment period, and 1 and 4-5 weeks after the last treatment. Each volunteer will receive 3
      treatments, 7 days apart from each other. Each treatment consists of one single oral dose of
      150 mg TMC435.
