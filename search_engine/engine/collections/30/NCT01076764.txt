      control arm (UFH + Eptifibatide). Then after interim analysis, patients will be randomized to
      the continued Otamixaban arm (per Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) decision based on interim
      analysis results) or the control arm (UFH + Eptifibatide). Except the DMC, all participants
      will remain blinded to this decision until the end of study.

      The total duration of the study period per subject will range between 30 days and 180 days.
      Study end date being the Day 30 visit of the last randomized patient, follow up will be until
      Day 180 or study end date whichever comes first.
