    
      This is a Phase 1, multi-arm and open-label (all knew the intervention of study) study to
      explore the safety, pharmacodynamics (the study of how drugs act on the body) and
      pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over
      time) of CNTO 3649. The study has been divided in Part 1 and 2. Part 1 includes healthy adult
      Japanese men and Part 2 includes Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The
      healthy adult Japanese men in part 1 will receive a single dose of either 10, 30, 100 or 300
      microgram/milliliter (mcg/mL) of CNTO 3649 and participants in part 2 will receive
      subcutaneous doses of either 30 or 100 mcg/mL of CNTO 3649 once a week for 4 weeks. The study
      will have a Screening period of 28 days for Part 1 and 42 days for Part 2. Participants will
      primarily be assessed for safety (adverse events, weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, body
      temperature, abdominal ultrasonography, standard 12-lead electrocardiography, and laboratory
      test). The total duration of study will be 57 days for Part 1 and 92 days for Part 2.
