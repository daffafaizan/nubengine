      early feeding in patients with oral cavity reconstruction who are allowed to eat by mouth on
      post-operative day 1. Traditionally, surgeons have opted to delay the time to oral feeding in
      oral cavity reconstruction because of concern that an early oral diet may stress intraoral
      suture lines and lead to the development of salivary leaks. However, evidence from small
      studies evaluating oral feeding timing in patients who underwent total laryngectomy suggests
      that there is no increased risk associated with early oral feeding. As such, the study team
      will aim to determine whether early feeding on postoperative day 1 is non-inferior with
      respect to the development of orocutaneous fistula to the standard care as described in the
      literature. There are roughly 50-60 oral cavity reconstructive surgeries performed at Mount
      Sinai each year - as such it is not feasible to recruit two study arms for direct comparison.

      In addition to salivary leak rates, the study team will report outcomes related to the
      cohort's wound healing, length of time in the hospital, length of time requiring an enteral
      tube feeds, swallow evaluation information, and the results of patient reported outcomes
      measures.
