      glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein expressed ubiquitously in synaptic vesicles, in depression
      and anxiety and whether ketamine, an N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, normalizes SV2A
      density at time of its greatest anti-depressant response. This study will conduct an
      examination of SV2A and associated consequences using neuroreceptor imaging and behavioral
      techniques for the following aims.

      Aim 1: To compare SV2A availability in individuals with MDD, healthy control individuals, and
      individuals with PTSD using APP311 and PET.

      Hypothesis 1: This study hypothesizes lower SV2A density in MDD and PTSD in the prefrontal
      cortex.

      Aim 2: To determine whether ketamine administration alters SV2A density in HC, MDD, and PTSD
      individuals. Note: this arm is completed.

      Hypothesis 2: This study hypothesizes administration of ketamine will lead to a significant
      increase in SV2A density in all subject groups (HC, MDD, and PTSD), and this increase will
      correlate with antidepressant response in individuals with MDD.

      New Aim pending.
