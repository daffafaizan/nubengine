           Reproduction use. Female reproductive system will be collected at the Virgen de la
           Arrixaca University Clinical Hospital from surgical pieces of patients undergoing
           surgical procedures. IVI Murcia Clinics uterine fluids from oocyte donors will be
           collected. These fluids will be store in the Arrixaca Hospital Biobank for future
           researches.

        2. Validation of the addition of uterine fluid to human embryonic culture media:

      Couples undergoing assited Reproduction Treatment in IVI Murcia will be asked for their
      inclusion in this study. Uterine fluid will be take 48 hours after peak of LH (luteinizing
      hormone), in natural cycle. Oocytes from these patients, will be divided into two groups:
      Half of the zygotes of each patient, control group, will be grown in the conditions usually
      used in the clinic, and the other half, experimental group, will add 1-5% of uterine fluid
      from the patient (v / v)

      On day 3 and on day 5 of culture the quality of the embryos in both groups will be assessed
      according to the usual criteria of the clinic and the best quality and highest probability of
      implantation will be transferred, following the usual clinical practice. The samples of
      uterine fluid, after the initial processing in the IVI-Murcia clinic will be transferred to
      the Department of Physiology of the University of Murcia where they will be fractionated to
      perform a quality control according to the following specifications:

      Uterine fluid pH 7.0-7.6 Osmolarity (mOsm / kg) 260-320 Endotoxin (EU / mL) <0.15 Sterility
      No growth

      Only samples that meet these criteria will continue to be part of the study
