      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at six months for patients with advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the small bowel (small intestine) or ampulla of Vater treated with
      capecitabine, oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate (RR) for CAPOX and bevacizumab. II. To determine the
      overall progression free survival for CAPOX and bevacizumab.

      III. To determine the overall survival (OS) for CAPOX and bevacizumab. IV. To determine the
      toxicity of CAPOX and bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive oxaliplatin via central venous catheter (CVC) over 2 hours and
      bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Participants also receive
      capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 10 and 30 days, and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
