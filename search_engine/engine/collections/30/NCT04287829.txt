      Pembrolizumab has shown to be active in in small phase II studies in MPM. Its activity
      however, is limited, with a response rate up to 20%. So, there is a need for new treatment
      combinations with drugs that might exhibit a synergistic interaction with pembrolizumab. The
      mechanisms of actions of lenvatinib, which has a broad spectrum of activities, predicts many
      synergistic interactions with PD-1 blocking. The aim of this study is to characterize the
      potential clinical activity, toxicity and biomarkers of outcome of pembrolizumab - lenvatinib
      in patients with recurrent MPM.
