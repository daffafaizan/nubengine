      Observational prospective cohort study.

      Patients

      Patients admitted to the ICU for severe trauma will be included. Two groups of patients with
      severe trauma will be studied:

        1. Patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI): TBI with initial Glasgow
           Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8 and AISextrahead score ≤3

        2. Patients with severe trauma without TBI (AISextrahead score > 3)

      A group of healthy individuals will serve as a control population.

      Expected total enrollment 20 patients in each group, and 10 healthy controls.

      Patient data collection

      For each patient, the following data will be collected:

        -  Demographic data: age, sex, height, weight, ICU admission date, simplified acute
           physiology score II (SAPS II), injury severity score (ISS), abbreviated injury scale
           (AIS) at ICU admission.

        -  Trauma-related data: number and type of trauma-related organ injuries, initial GCS,
           presence of mydriasis at initial management.

        -  Factors with potential impact on microbiota: antimicrobial therapy, nutrition type,
           medications (proton pump inhibitors, opioids, sedations, catecholamines, steroids),
           surgical procedure during ICU stay.

        -  Evolution: multidrug resistant bacteria acquisition during ICU stay, ICU
           acquired-infections. Mechanical ventilation duration, extrarenal epuration, ICU length
           of stay, neurological outcome evaluated by disability rating scale (DRS-F) at ICU
           discharge and at 90 days post trauma, death at ICU discharge and 90 days.

      Sample collection

      Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs will be performed for each patient within the first 24 hours
      after ICU admission (day 0), then 48 hours (day 2) and 7 days (day 7) after ICU admission and
      weekly thereafter until ICU discharge. Rectal and oropharyngeal swabs will be performed by
      trained paramedical staff using sterile swabs with transport medium ESwab® (Becton, Dickinson
      and Company, New Jersey, USA). Swabs will be stored at -80°C until DNA extraction.

      DNA extraction

      DNA extraction will be performed using QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA® kit (Qiagen®, Courtaboeuf,
      France) for rectal swabs and Extracta DNA Prep® kit (Quanta Biosciences®, Beverly, USA) for
      oropharyngeal swabs. DNA will be quantified by Quantit® dsDNA HighSensitivity Assay Kit
      (Fisher Scientific).

      16S rRNA amplification and sequencing

      V3 and V4 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences will be amplified by polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) with universal primers (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and
      GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), following the Illumina MiSeq®
      System protocol (Illumina®). Amplicons will be purified and then sequenced using MiSeq®
      sequencing system ((Illumina®).

      Sequences processing

      Sequences processing and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering will be performed using
      SHAMAN software (SHiny Application for Metagenomic ANalysis) based on R® software (package
      DESeq2), provided by Pasteur Institute. Taxonomic classification will be performed using
      SILVA database reference.

      Statistical analysis

      Statistical analysis will be performed using SHAMAN software (SHiny Application for
      Metagenomic ANalysis). Bacterial phyla, families and genera repartition will be analyzed, and
      relative abundance of bacterial genera will be compared between the different populations.
      Alpha-diversity will be analyzed using different parameters (Shannon index, Simpson's
      diversity index), as well as beta-diversity (principal component analysis).

      The different populations of patients and healthy volunteers will be compared, and the
      evolution of microbiota along time will be studied.
