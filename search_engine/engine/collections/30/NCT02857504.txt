      interventions in pulmonary surgery. It is used in both techniques: thoracotomy and
      videothoracoscopy (VATS)(1).

      OLV can be provided by double lumen tube (DLT) or bronchial blocker. There are advantages and
      disadvantages of both techniques, but DLT is more recommended because it allows total
      emptying of the operated lung. Air and secretion can be aspirated through the wide lumen of
      the tube during the surgery (2, 3).

      There are many kinds of DLT which differ according to shape and material. Most commonly used
      are left sided DLT which are placed into left main bronchus and right or left lungs can be
      closed or emptied. Left sided tube have a hook which is placed on the carina to prevent
      displacement of the tube. There are also DLT without the hook which are more gentle and
      easier to place in the left main bronchus (4,5). After the insertion of the left tube without
      the hook, bronchoscopy is recommended to check the position of the tube (6,7,8,9).

      Some severe complications (injury of the bronchial tree) after insertion of the hooked tube
      are found in the literature (10). The investigators have published such complication from our
      experience (11).

      Each anesthesiologist decides individually which kind of DLT to use as there are no studies
      which have objectivised the advantage of either technique. There is only one study where they
      have compared both techniques but they have found no difference. That is why the
      investigators decided to study which technique is better so this can be included in our
      standard operative procedure.
