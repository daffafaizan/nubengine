      completed trial of weekly injections of 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P), the
      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Maternal Fetal Medicine
      Units (MFMU) Network found the treatments significantly beneficial in the prevention of
      recurrent preterm birth. Other studies have shown that fish oil supplementation can reduce
      the risk for preterm birth. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Omega-3, a
      polyunsaturated fatty acid nutritional supplement, in addition to injections of 17P, further
      decreases the rate of preterm birth in women at risk.

      This study is a randomized, double-masked clinical trial with two study arms: a daily
      supplement of Omega-3 capsules containing 800 mg of DHA and 1200 mg of EPA or a daily
      supplement of a matching placebo. All patients will also receive weekly injections of 17P.
      Eight hundred pregnant women with a history of previous preterm delivery will be recruited
      for this study. After successfully completing a compliance run-in, which can begin as early
      as 15 weeks gestation, patients will be randomized and begin treatment between 16 and 22
      weeks gestation. They will remain on study drug until 36 week and 6 days or delivery,
      whichever occurs first. Blood will be drawn at randomization and at a monthly visit falling
      between 25-29 weeks of gestation to test for compliance, to analyze genetic polymorphisms and
      to determine whether Omega-3 affects the production of inflammatory cytokines.
