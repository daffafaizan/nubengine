      patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with capecitabine. II. Determine the toxicity of
      this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days
      1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every
      3 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-9 months.
