      carcinomas (PTC). The mutation has been associated with poor prognosis and more advanced
      disease stage. Therefore, pre-operative detection of the BRAF-V600E mutation may be of
      clinical interest in order to individualize treatment of patients with BRAF positive PTC.

      FNABs are performed immediately before the thyroid operation, and BRAF-V600E detection using
      VE1 is performed on clots. The VE1 stain is compared to the mutation status of the removed
      cancer or control tissue using the Cobas test.
