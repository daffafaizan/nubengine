      resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery boost. Following surgical resection, patients
      would receive a stereotactic radiosurgery boost to the surgical bed, 2-8 weeks after surgery.
      A dose of 15 to 22 Gy would be delivered in a single fraction. Patient would be subsequently
      followed clinically and radiologically to watch for local control as well as toxicity. If a
      recurrence or new metastasis(es) is detected, further treatment may be given, consisting of
      chemotherapy, surgery, whole brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiotherapy.
