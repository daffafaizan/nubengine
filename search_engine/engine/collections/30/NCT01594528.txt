      induced pain (pressure application, ischemia induction).

      Included subjects are subjected to experimental pain tests : pressure application (160 kPa)
      with an algometer to determine the pain with Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), and ischemia
      induction to determine the time needed to feel pain with an intensity equivalent to 3 with
      the VAS.

      Subjects are filmed during experimentation to identify the corporal mobility signs, facial
      expression signs and sonorous signs associated to pain stimulation.

      Neurophysiological measures complete these observations : surface electromyogram, heart rate
      measure, blood pressure.
