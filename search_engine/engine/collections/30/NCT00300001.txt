      Internet assisted home-based symptom reporting system Cancer Symptom Monitor (CSM) for a
      twelve-month study period. Patient and care team evaluations will be measured using
      quantitative and qualitative methods (via focus groups). The second group will receive
      "standard care" without home-based symptom monitoring. Both groups will be evaluated at
      baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, & 12 months, for symptom levels and overall quality of life during
      the twelve-month study period.
