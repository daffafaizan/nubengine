           LYMPHOMA (PH+ ALL) The trials combining imatinib with high-dose chemotherapy were
           successfully resulting in high response rate and longer survival and a role for bridging
           therapy to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) by means of
           concurrent or alternating regimen in patients with Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).(24-29) Current combination therapy of imatinib and
           chemotherapy became standard therapy of Ph+ ALL and new 2nd generation TKIs are
           investigating. These experiences may be translated into the treatment of CML BP.

        2. HIGH-DOSE DAUNORUBICIN IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML) INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY Two
           recently published papers of randomized trials comparing standard dose daunorubicin (45
           mg/m2 for 3 days) and high dose daunorubicin (90 mg/m2 for 3 days) demonstrated improved
           CR rate and survival with high dose daunorubicin in younger (60 years or younger) and
           older (over 60 years) patients, respectively.(30, 31) Therefore high-dose daunorubicin
           can be applied safely and effectively to the treatment of CML BP.

        3. NILOTINIB COMBINED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY FOR PHYLADELPHIA POSITIVE CML MYELOID BLASTIC PHASE
           (MBP) OR PHYLADELPHIA POSITIVE AML We will try 2nd generation TKI, nilotinib and
           high-dose daunorubicin induction chemotherapy combination to find out the combination
           therapy can improve response rate and survival in patients with CML MBP.
