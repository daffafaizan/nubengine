      individuals enrolled achieve azoospermia (zero sperm). However, early data demonstrated that
      some individuals have persistent sperm in their semen despite treatment. We hope to be able
      to determine whether differences in intratesticular hormone levels account for persistent
      sperm production in men who do not reach counts of zero as compared to those who do in the
      male contraceptive study. This study will measure testosterone levels in the testes of men
      who are participating in male contraceptive studies. Testosterone will be measured in a small
      amount of testicular fluid at the end of the study treatment phase after sperm counts have
      been reduced to zero or very low levels.
