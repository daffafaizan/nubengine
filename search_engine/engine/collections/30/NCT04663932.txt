    
      Eligible patients with STEMI who meet the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria will receive
      thrombolytic therapy, and then be transferred to the PCI center for coronary angiography
      (CAG). Patients having a target vessel with TIMI grade 3 flow as shown by CAG, and and â‰¥ 50%
      angiographic stenosis after thrombus aspiration, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either
      an immediate stenting group or a deferred stenting group. Patients assigned to the immediate
      stenting group will undergo appropriate stent implantation based on characteristics of the
      lesions. Patients assigned to the deferred stenting group will be sent back to the ward after
      PCI to receive standard anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies, and the CAG will be
      repeated 5 to 7 days after initial intervention, followed by treatment with stent
      implantation.

      All subjects will be recorded postoperative microcirculation perfusion and ST-segment drop of
      electrocardiogram and followed up by telephone or in the clinic at 1, 6, and 12 months after
      discharge from the hospital to obtain information including their general condition, chief
      complaints or discomforts, details of taking their oral medications, recent relevant test
      results, and to evaluate the primary endpoint, secondary endpoints.
