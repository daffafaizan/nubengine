      hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), on the basis of severity of sHPT is generally preferred in
      current practice. Whether the proposed dose, based on the formula baseline intact parathyroid
      hormone (iPTH [pg/mL]) divided by 80, is the most appropriate has not been adequately
      assessed. A trial comparing the iPTH/80 dose to the immediately lower iPTH/120 dose was
      undertaken. We studied the ability of the two different dosing schemes to control iPTH levels
      within a desired range between 150 and 300 pg/mL, as well as the frequency of iPTH
      over-suppression (< 150 pg/mL) in the two groups (iPTH/80 and iPTH/120).
