    
      All participants will receive the same low-volume (2L) PEG plus ascorbic acid solution
      (MOVIPREPÂ®*, Norgine, Harefield, United Kingdom; each liter containing 100.0 g macrogol 3350,
      7.5 g sodium sulfate,2.7 g sodium chloride, 1.0 g potassium chloride, 4.7 g ascorbic acid,
      5.9 g sodium ascorbate, and lemon or orange flavoring).

      Patients allocated in the "control arm" will receive the whole preparation the day before
      colonoscopy, whereas, patient randomly allocated to the "active treatment" will take one
      liter of the bowel preparation the evening before the procedure and the remaining liter the
      day of the procedure.

      Participants will also receive a standardized low-fiber diet before the colonoscopy, avoiding
      fruit, legumes or vegetables for 3 days before the procedure. They will have a normal
      breakfast and a light lunch on the day before the procedure, but no solid food will be
      permitted since then. Liquid food (e.g., clear soup or yoghurt) will be permitted for the
      evening meal. Clear fluids can be taken at any time, until 2 hours before the procedure.

      Treatments are allocated using a computer-generated, randomized code list. The treatment
      allocation is concealed and is accomplished at the screening visit through non-research
      personnel who is not involved in the study. To ensure masking, the endoscopists who perform
      the colonoscopies are not involved in the randomization process and in the pre-procedure data
      collection.

      Data on patient compliance, tolerability and acceptability are collected on the morning of
      colonoscopy, immediately before the procedure, by a nurse questioned through a standardised
      questionnaire. The endoscopist is not allowed to take part in the questioning or to supervise
      the questionnaire.
