    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the tolerability of the addition of standard dose salsalate to the standard
      treatment combination of venetoclax + hypomethylating agent (HMA) (decitabine or azacitidine
      [5-azacytidine]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the remission rate and, when feasible, perform exploratory studies of:

      Ia. Patterns of mutation clearance. Ib. Distribution of cells with low and high reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) content at various points during therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      CYCLE 1: Patients receive salsalate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) until completion of cycle
      1. 24-48 hours later or concurrent with salsalate, patients begin to receive decitabine
      intravenously (IV) for 10 days or azacitidine IV for 7 days. Starting 24 hour after
      salsalate, patients also receive venetoclax PO continuously until completion of cycle 1.

      CYCLE 2: Patients receive decitabine IV for 5 days or azacitidine IV for 7 days, salsalate PO
      BID, and venetoclax PO continuously.

      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
