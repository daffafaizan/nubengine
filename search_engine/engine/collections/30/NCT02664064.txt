      successful approach to reduce the risk of developing diabetes in patients with prediabetes.
      While the DPP lifestyle intervention was successful and group based adaptations of the DPP
      have positive results, scalable alternatives that allow for even broader reach are necessary.
      Omada Health has developed an online, group-based, recognized DPP program (Prevent). The goal
      of this study is to evaluate a literacy-adapted version of Prevent for patients with
      prediabetes in safety net health care settings.
