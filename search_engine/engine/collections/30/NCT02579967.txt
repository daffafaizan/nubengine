    
      Background:

        -  Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are conditions associated with major
           quantitative or qualitative immunologic abnormalities that are, in most cases, due to
           defects in cells of hematopoietic origin

        -  Participants with PID can have life-threatening complications including malignancy,
           recurrent infection, and autoimmunity/immune dysregulation

        -  Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (allo BMT) has the potential to cure the
           immune defect in PID and thereby reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with
           these diseases

      Objectives:

      -To estimate the acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD)-free, graft failure-free survival at
      day +180 after allo BMT, analyzed separately by conditioning arm/cohort

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients age greater than or equal to 4 through 75 years

        -  PID deemed to be of sufficient past severity to warrant allo BMT, by meeting the two
           criteria below:

             -  PID as defined by identified genetic defect or, in the absence of a mutation,
                patients with an immune defect potentially amenable to allo BMT who meet the
                clinical history criteria below may be eligible

             -  Clinical history of at least two of the following:

                  -  Life-threatening, organ-threatening, or severely disfiguring infection

                  -  Protracted or recurrent infections

                  -  Infection with an opportunistic organism

                  -  Chronic elevation in the blood of a latent virus

                  -  Evidence of immune dysregulation

                  -  Hypogammaglobulinemia/dysglobulinemia

                  -  Hematologic malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder

                  -  Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy or pre-cancerous lesion

        -  At least one 7-8/8 (9-10/10) HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or an
           HLA-haploidentical related donor

        -  Adequate end-organ function

        -  Consensus opinion by the investigative team that the patient has the potential to
           benefit from transplant despite existing, non-hematopoietic organ dysfunction

        -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

        -  HIV negative

        -  Disease status: patients with malignancy should be referred in remission for evaluation,
           except in the case of virus-associated malignancy who may be referred at any time

      Design:

        -  The study will have two arms that vary in mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) duration.

        -  RIC and RIC-MMF arms: pentostatin 4 mg/m2/day IV on days -11 and -7, low-dose
           cyclophosphamide orally daily on days -11 through -4; busulfan IV, pharmacokinetically
           dosed, on days -3 and -2.

        -  Bone marrow is the preferred graft source. Peripheral blood stem cells are permitted

        -  GVHD prophylaxis:

             -  High-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) on days +3 and +4,
                sirolimus on days +5 through +90, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on days +5
                through +35 for all arms except the RIC-MMF arm. The RIC-MMF arm will receive MMF
                of varying durations based on a duration de-escalation schema.

             -  Participants with DNA repair/telomere defects/familial cancer syndromes may receive
                a reduced dose (25 mg/kg/day) PTCy on days +3 and +4, in addition to sirolimus and
                MMF.
