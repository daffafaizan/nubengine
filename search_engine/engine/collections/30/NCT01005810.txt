      for cannabis dependence in adolescents. While recent advances have been made in psychosocial
      treatments for cannabis dependent adolescents, minimal work has been done to investigate the
      potential adjunctive role for pharmacotherapy in treatment. NAC is an inexpensive,
      over-the-counter agent with a favorable tolerability profile in adults and children, in
      common use since FDA approval in 1963. Preclinical and preliminary clinical research in
      adults suggests a role for NAC in addiction treatment via glutamate modulation.
