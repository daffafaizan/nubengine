      consist of participants who will have elected to have RYGB at the Mayo Clinic Bariatric
      Center of Excellence. The Diet group will have a low-calorie diet prescribed by a registered
      dietitian. Both groups will collect stool from every bowel movement 2 days before presenting
      for baseline testing. Both group participants will present for baseline testing after an
      overnight fast and before intervention (RYGB or low calorie diet). Participants will consume
      a standard breakfast provided by study staff and blood samples will be collected at -15, 0,
      15, 30,45,60,90,120,150,180,210,240,300,360 minutes. Appetite and satiation ratings will be
      recorded via questionnaires during that day every 15 minutes for the first 90 minutes, then
      every 30 minutes. Participants will repeat this regimen again after losing 7% of their body
      weight after having RYGB or low calorie diet.
