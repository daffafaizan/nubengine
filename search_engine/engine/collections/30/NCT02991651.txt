      the potential for the use of rexinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer. IRX4204, a
      second generation rexinoid, is a highly potent and specific activator of RXRs. Because
      IRX4204 is significantly more potent and more selective for the RXRs relative to the RARs
      than a first generation approved RXR agonist drug, bexarotene, it potentially will be
      associated with fewer adverse events and greater activity in clinical use. Preclinical
      studies of the combination of IRX4204 plus erlotinib, and previous clinical studies of the
      combination of the bexarotene plus erlotinib indicated at least additive beneficial effects
      for treatment of NSCLC. This study seeks to investigate the safety and activity of IRX4204 in
      combination with erlotinib in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC.
