      disease causes destruction of connective tissue and bone. As a result of stimulation by
      bacterial antigen PMN produces free radicals via respiratory burst as a part of host response
      to infection.

      Free radicals can be defined as molecules or molecular fragments with an unpaired electron
      which imparts certain characteristics to the free radicals such as reactivity . Reactive free
      radicals are able to produce chemical modifications and to damage proteins, lipids,
      carbohydrates and nucleotides in the tissues.
