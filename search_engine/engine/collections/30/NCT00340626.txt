      individuals from multiplex families determined to have hereditary oral clefts will be
      studied. Healthy Syrian individuals with no family history of oral clefts will also be
      enrolled as a comparison group. The purpose of this study is to identify the gene(s) involved
      in heritable oral clefts by linkage analysis and gene mapping strategies. Characterization of
      genes involved in inherited oral clefts could provide important insight into the inheritance
      and pathogenesis of this disease. All families are enrolled into the study by our Syrian
      collaborators (under Ethics Board approval from the IBN AL-NAFEES Hospital) and only coded
      phenotype data and coded biospecimens are ever received at the NIH.
