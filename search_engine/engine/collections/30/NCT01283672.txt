      cardiovascular disease, and there may be significant differences among whole grain sources
      with respect to ability to alter biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. This acute study is
      designed to determine if whole grain barley improves postprandial lipid metabolism and
      improves endothelial function. Further, we will determine if acute consumption of whole grain
      barley versus acute consumption of whole grain oats results in differential response with
      respect to biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk.
