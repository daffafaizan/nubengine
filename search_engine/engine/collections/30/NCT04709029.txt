      intrathecal 3 ml bupivacaine 0. 5% +1 ml normal saline + intravenous 8 mg dexamethazone in 10
      ml saline. Group 2: patients receive intrathecal 3 ml bupivacaine 0. 5% + 4 mg (1 ml)
      dexamethazone + intravenous 10 ml normal saline. Upon patients' arrival into the operating
      room, peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2), ECG, pulse rate (PR), and systolic and diastolic
      blood pressures will be monitored one of the researchers and recorded every 5 minutes till
      the end of surgery. In a sitting position and with antiseptic techniques, 25 G Quincke needle
      was inserted intrathecally at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace through midline approach. The study
      drugs were given by an anesthesiologist not not aware of the type of medications injected.
      Subsequently, the patients were put in the supine position, and given oxygen 3 L/minutes by
      nasal prongs.
