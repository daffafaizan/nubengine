    
      This is a dose-escalation study of stereotactic body radiation therapy.

      Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy once daily (QD) for a total of 5
      fractions and then undergo IRGA (either radiofrequency ablation or microwave ablation) 1 week
      later.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
