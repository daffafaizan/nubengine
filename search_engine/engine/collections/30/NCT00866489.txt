      mortality after neurosurgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby
      brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic protection
      from prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning protects the brain
      injury in patients undergoing elective neurosurgery, a randomized trial will be performed in
      current study.

      DESIGNING Thirty patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial meningioma will be
      randomize assigned to neurosurgery with RIPC or conventional neurosurgery (control). Remote
      ischemic preconditioning consist of three 5-min cycles of right upper limb ischaemia, induced
      by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the upper arm and inflated to 200 mm Hg, with an
      intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff is deflated. Cerebral injury was
      assessed by S-100b, NSE, and neurological function scores in different time points.

      EXPECTED RESULTS RIPC will reduce the incidence of cerebral injury.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      In patients undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial meningioma, RIPC reduces the
      incidence of postoperative cerebral injury.
