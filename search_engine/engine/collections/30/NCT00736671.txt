      may be learned by exploring to what extent alterations in non-motor and non-dopaminergic
      systems may play a role in the balance impairment in this disorder. This project is designed
      to evaluate striatal pre-synaptic dopaminergic, cortical, thalamic, and brainstem
      cholinergic, cognitive, and oculomotor mechanisms underlying the risk of falling and
      imbalance in PD. The proposed study will exploit advances in our center in the development of
      dynamic biomathematical modeling of electronic platform data, application of specialized
      cognitive and oculomotor assessments, and positron emission tomography (PET). This novel
      multi-system approach holds promise for understanding mechanisms of falling in PD beyond
      pre-synaptic dopaminergic nigrostriatal denervation.
