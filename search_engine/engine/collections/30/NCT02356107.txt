      biochemicals lead to distinct clinical problems. Therefore, investigators believe that
      treatment with a combination therapy, which could correct both deficits, would have a
      synergistic effect in the treatment of hypoxia-related depression and possibly other forms of
      treatment-resistant depression. Thus, investigators propose to investigate antidepressant
      efficacy of dietary 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and creatine, as a means to restore the brain
      neurotransmitter and metabolic imbalances linked to chronic hypoxia caused by high altitude
      residence.
