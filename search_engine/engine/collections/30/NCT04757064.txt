      children and adolescents after lymphomas and brain cancers (Wang et al., 2018; Luetke et al.,
      2014).

      It is a primary malignant bone tumor with a worldwide incidence of 3.4 per million people per
      year (Mirabello et al., 2009). They are characterized by the production of osteoid, or
      immature bone, by malignant mesenchymal cells (Wang et al., 2018; (Luetke et al., 2014).

      Patients displayed some persisting physical difficulties including incapability to perform
      active range of motion (ROM), decreased muscle strength, altered gait and sit-to-stand
      patterns, yet they maintained high levels of emotional acceptance and coping. A surprising
      but important finding was the persisting hip weakness in both operated and non-operated
      limbs, which extends up to 42 months after resection around the knee. This indicates that
      continued rehabilitation programs emphasizing hip strengthening should be considered for
      these patients, even years after surgery (Beebe et al., 2009). Furthermore, ROM exercises,
      strengthening exercises and balance exercises improve overall Quality of life (QOL) for these
      patients (Marchese et al., 2006).
