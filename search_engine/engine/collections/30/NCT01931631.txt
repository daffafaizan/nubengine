      reverse coronary artery blockages may have a significant beneficial effect on type 2
      diabetes, as demonstrated by reductions in fasting serum glucose concentrations and
      medication use. The investigators therefore randomly assigned 99 individuals with type 2
      diabetes to either a low-fat, vegan diet or a diet based on current American Diabetes
      Association guidelines for 22 weeks with a one-year follow-up period. The principal dependent
      measure is hemoglobin A1c. Cardiovascular risk factors are also being tracked, as is dietary
      acceptance.
