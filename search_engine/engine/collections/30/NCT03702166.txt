      neurobiologically, and causally, applying causal modeling to psychometric and neurofunctional
      data. We will enroll 30 individuals with both tinnitus and PTSD. Participants will be asked
      to complete baseline assessments of subjective tinnitus distress, PTSD, depression, and
      resting-state fMRI at baseline. Individuals with comorbid tinnitus and PTSD who are eligible
      for the study will receive 12 sessions of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) over a 6- to
      15-week period. CPT is a trauma-focused treatment for PTSD that guides individuals on how to
      recognize and challenge thoughts that are erroneous and dysfunctional. One-month follow-up
      assessments of tinnitus-related distress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be conducted,
      along with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
