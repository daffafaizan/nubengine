      I. To assess the value of MRI and PET as a non-invasive predictive assay for therapy outcome
      in cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy and receive chemotherapy per standard of care. Patients
      undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and magnetic
      resonance (MR) spectroscopy at baseline, 2-2.5 weeks, 4-5 weeks, and 1 month following
      radiation therapy completion, and fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) at
      baseline, 2-2.5 weeks, and 4-5 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at least every 3-6 months for 5 years.
