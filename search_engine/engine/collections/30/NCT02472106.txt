      to 5 centers and a minimum of 20 subjects. Up to 50 subjects may be enrolled in this study.
      The first 3 post-dilatation procedures for each investigator will be considered roll-ins and
      not included in the main study analyses. Subjects will exit the study at hospital discharge
      or 7 days post treatment, whichever comes first. The expected duration of the clinical
      investigation is approximately 6 months.

      Subjects implanted with the CoreValve or other commercially available self-expanding TAVI and
      with the use of the V8 as a postdilatation balloon may be enrolled in this study. The subject
      will exit the study after the predischarge ECHO where the Paravalvular Leak (PVL)
      measurements are taken or resolution of a V8 related AE (if applicable).
