      Her2-targeted therapy. Treatment consists of a chemo-immunotherapy phase followed by a
      maintenance phase. The chemo-immunotherapy phase consists of 6 cycles of 4 weeks each. During
      each cycle the subject will receive 80 mg/m2 paclitaxel intravenously on Day 1, 8 and 15 and
      30 mg efti subcutaneously on Day 1 and 15 in a 28-day (4-week) cycle. Efti will always be
      given after paclitaxel. The maintenance phase comprises 6 visits with 4 weekly intervals;
      during each such visit 30 mg efti is given subcutaneously as monotherapy. A total of 24
      subjects will be enrolled into the study. The primary goal of the study is safety and
      tolerability profile of efti in combination with weekly paclitaxel both given the same day in
      contrast to subsequent days as in the AIPAC trial.
