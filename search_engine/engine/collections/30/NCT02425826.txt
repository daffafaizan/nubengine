    
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the
      efficacy and safety of apremilast in subjects with moderate plaque psoriasis. 221
      participants were randomized 2 (apremilast):1 (placebo) at approximately 25 sites in the
      United States. Those randomized to the apremilast treatment group received apremilast 30 mg
      tablets orally twice daily for 52 weeks. Those randomized to the placebo treatment group
      received placebo tablets (identical in appearance to the apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally
      twice daily (BID) for 16 weeks. Beginning Week 16, those initially randomized to placebo were
      switched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID for an additional 36 weeks (52 weeks total).

      Study enrolled adult patients with stable moderate plaque psoriasis, who are na√Øve to
      systemic psoriasis treatments.
