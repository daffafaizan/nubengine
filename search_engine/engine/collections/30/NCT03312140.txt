      choline chloride (2x0.5 gram three times a day) as a food supply for 88 days. D9-choline
      metabolism is measured before and after the intervention phase. Hypothesis of the study is,
      that supplying choline augments the secretion of phosphatidyl choline and lipoprotein (VLDL)
      from the liver and therefore results in a measurable reduction of the triglyceride storage of
      the liver.
