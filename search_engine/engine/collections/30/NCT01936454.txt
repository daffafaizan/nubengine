      of Sino-implant (II)Use and the Pharmacokinetics (PK) over Five Years of use in Chinese Women

      Population: A total of 590 Chinese Sino-Implant (II) users between 20and 44 years of age
      enrolled in one of four prospective cohorts:

      Cohort 1: n=20 women with insertion dates 3-5months prior to enrollment and followed for 2-6
      months Cohort 2:n=20 women with insertion dates 9-11 months prior to enrollment and followed
      for 2-6 months Cohort 3: n=250 women with insertion dates 21-24 months prior to enrollment
      and followed through month 36 Cohort 4:n=300 women with insertion dates 33-36 months prior to
      enrollment and followed through month 6

      Study Duration: 33 total months in the field: 3 months of participant recruitment(all
      cohorts); up to 27 months of pregnancy monitoring and PK blood sampling in Cohort 4 (up to 15
      months in Cohort 3 and 6 months in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2);and 3 months of close-out
      activities.

      For secondary PK outcomes, blood samples will be taken 2 to 6 months apart from each woman in
      Cohort 1 and Cohort 2; at enrollment, month 30 and month 36 from the first 20 consenting
      women in Cohort 3; and at enrollment and months 42, 48, 54, and 60 from the first 30
      consenting women in Cohort 4.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the contraceptive effectiveness of Sino-implant (II) during
      the third and fourth years of use

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the contraceptive effectiveness of Sino-implant (II) during the fifth year
           of use.

        2. To characterize the total and free levonorgestrel (LNG) plasma concentration-time
           profiles over five years following Sino-implant (II) insertion

        3. To characterize the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) serum concentration-time profile
           and its relationship to total LNG levels over five years following Sino-implant (II)
           insertion
