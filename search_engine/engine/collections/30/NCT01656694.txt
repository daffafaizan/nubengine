    
      This study is an epidemiological Level IV-Case Series clinical study that will study the
      survivorship of the Sigma® HP Partial Knee System in a consecutive series of patients. All
      patients who received the Sigma® HP Partial Knee System between August 21, 2008 and October
      31, 2009 will be available to include in the study. Data will be collected preoperatively,
      intra-operatively, and post-operatively at intervals of 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years,
      and 5 years. Data will be analyzed for survivorship status at the 2- and 5-year follow-up
      visits. Other data, including functional outcomes, radiographic outcomes, and wear will be
      analyzed at the 5-year follow-up visit. Subjects will participate in the study for five years
      after their surgery.
