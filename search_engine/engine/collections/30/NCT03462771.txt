      supplementation on the muscular adaptive response in sarcopenic elderly women submitted to
      resistance training. A total of 30 sarcopenic elderly women, aged 65 years or older, were
      divided into two groups of 15 volunteers: (1) Exercise group and placebo (GEP) and (2)
      Exercise group and fish oil (GEOP). The two groups underwent a resisted exercise program over
      12 weeks in three weekly sessions supervised by physicists and physicists at the School of
      Physical Education and Sports of Ribeirão Preto (EEFERP). All volunteers (both groups) are
      also instructed to ingest two food supplement capsules at each main meal, and the GEP group
      will use capsules composed of sunflower oil as a placebo. The GEOP is directed to take two
      capsules of fish oil at each main meal, totaling 4 capsules per day, that is, four grams of
      fish oil. To check the quadriceps muscle volume before and after an intervention, as
      volunteers from both groups are submitted to MRI. An extension power and isokinetic force of
      extension of the lower limb at a knee and hip extension and are measured by dynamometry
      (Biodex 4 Pro, Biodex, USA) and a functional solution evaluated by the application of the
      6-minute walk test. In addition, will be described the biochemicals for the quantification of
      the following cytokines: IL1, IL6, IL8, IL10 and TNF-α, such as to allow selection of the
      presence of inflammation.
