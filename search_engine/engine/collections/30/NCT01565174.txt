      genes that are related to the neurotransmitters dopamine (D2, DAT, COMT), GABA, glutamate and
      the cannabinoid receptor CB1. Out of this cohort, 24 male subjects without history of
      cannabis or drug-induced psychosis will undergo brain imaging procedure in order to measure
      THC-induced dopamine release using [11C] Raclopride in PET imaging. Carriers of high activity
      COMT158Val allele are expected to show higher meso-limbic DA release than carriers of low
      activity COMT 158Met homozygotes and after smoking a cigarette with THC which in turn are
      thought to underlie the risk for THC-induced psychotic symptoms. The aim of the present study
      is to evaluate the relationship between the COMT genotype and cannabis-induced meso-limbic
      dopamine release as measured by D2 occupancy. In addition, the association between
      predisposition to psychosis, age of onset of cannabis dependence, and genotype of COMT and
      other neurotransmitters-related genes will be evaluated. Such finding could provide novel
      pharmaco-genetic explanation for the psychogenic effects of cannabis in vulnerable
      individuals.
