      oxytocin. After screening and informed consent subjects will receive either their assigned
      dose or a placebo. Thirty minutes following the drug administration patients will be
      evaluated on the EEG and pupillometry tasks followed by two tests that evaluate social
      salience. One week later subjects will have a second challenge in the alternative (drug or
      placebo) condition.
