        -  Compare time to prostate-specific antigen progression in patients with progressive
           androgen-independent prostate cancer and bone metastases treated with doxorubicin and
           strontium chloride Sr 89 with or without celecoxib.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to extent of bone
      metastases on bone scan (> 20 lesions vs ≤ 20 lesions) and quality of response (i.e., decline
      of the prostate-specific antigen from baseline) to prior induction chemotherapy (≥ 80% vs <
      80%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and
           strontium chloride Sr 89 IV on day 1. Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily
           in the absence of disease progression.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and strontium chloride Sr 89 as in arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
