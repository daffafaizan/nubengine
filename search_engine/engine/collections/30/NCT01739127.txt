      and have much lower propensity to induce motor side-effects. These medications are seeing
      increased use for indications other than psychosis, and greater use in populations such as
      adolescents. However, one of the most critical issues in the field of psychiatry today is the
      overwhelming evidence that chronic use of the second generation antipsychotics can result in
      metabolic dysregulation, which includes weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance.
      A recent meta-analysis indicated that switching from other second generation antipsychotics
      to the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole consistently resulted in significant weight loss and
      may be an optimal treatment for patients who exhibit drug-induced weight gain. Therefore, we
      aim to compare metabolic dysregulation (namely abdominal weight gain and fat distribution)in
      participants taking aripiprazole, to participants who are taking higher-metabolic propensity
      antipsychotic drugs (such as risperidone or quetiapine), and to healthy participants.
