      Alcoholic Hepatitis, GS-US-384-1943 trial of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) fibrosis
      Stage 3 (STELLAR-3), and, GS-US-384-1944 trial of NASH and compensated cirrhosis (STELLAR-4).
      The time points for the HepQuant SHUNT tests coincide with pre-specified time points within
      the Gilead clinical trials. Subjects enrolled in GILEAD's STELLAR and Alcoholic hepatitis
      trials may participate concurrently in this HepQuant sponsored investigational device study
      at participating US sites only (IDEs as listed above) once approved by the applicable
      IRB/IEC.

      The main eligibility criteria for enrollment into the HepQuant study is enrollment into one
      of the three Gilead clinical trials listed above.

      The HepQuant SHUNT Test is minimally-invasive and measures hepatocyte function and inflow to
      the liver from the simultaneous clearances (hepatic filtration rates, HFRs) of cholate from
      systemic and portal circulations. The Test quantifies portal-systemic shunting (SHUNT) and
      generates a liver disease severity index (DSI). DSI is a score from 0 (no disease) to 50
      (terminal illness) that is a composite of both HFRs and correlates with stage of fibrosis,
      presence of varices, especially large varices, and risk for future clinical outcomes. DSI is
      the primary output variable from the HepQuant SHUNT test. The HepQuant SHUNT test potentially
      satisfies the unmet medical need for a minimally-invasive test of global liver function and
      physiology
