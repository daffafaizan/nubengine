      Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are common causes of the
      300,000 sudden deaths occurring in the United States each year. Most of these victims have
      associated heart disease, most commonly coronary artery disease. Populations consuming
      considerable quantities of fish and marine mammals have lower than expected mortality rates
      from coronary disease. Interventional and observational trials have indicated that fatty fish
      consumption decreases the death rate from coronary artery disease, in part by reducing the
      number of sudden deaths. Animal and tissue culture studies both support the hypothesis that
      these beneficial effects are from the antiarrhythmic properties of n-3 long chained
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids).

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Prospective, randomized, double blinded trial. Survivors of VT and VF with an implantable
      defibrillator were randomized, 100 to dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids(PUFA) or 100 to a placebo. Adherence to the supplement were assessed by measurements of
      plasma, red cell, and adipose tissue n-3 fatty acid concentrations. The primary outcome
      variable was the incidence of recurrent VT or VF, but secondary variables were also assessed
      using serial implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) assessment, correlation of the
      rhythms with the biochemical measurements of n-3 fatty acids, hospitalization rates and
      quality of life. The (ICD) was the best protection available to patients and stored rhythm
      electrograms which allowed documentation of rhythm endpoints.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
