      with anxiety disorders. Animal models support this hypothesis but to this date, studies in
      humans are lacking.

      The investigators will randomise patients with a confirmed diagnosis of anxiety disorders to
      follow a ketogenic diet (<50 grs of carbohydrate per day) or a conventional diet (50%
      carbohydrate, 30% lipids, 20% protein) for one month.

      Symptom control will be assessed weekly using Beck's inventory for Anxiety. Diet adherence
      will be measured using standardised food frequency logs and acetoacetate urine strips.
