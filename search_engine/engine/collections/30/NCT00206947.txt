    
      The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of cholinergic augmentation of atypical
      antipsychotic medication on:

        -  Cognitive deficits

        -  Sensorimotor gating

        -  Psychopathology

      The primary objective was to examine:

      â€¢ The effects of donepezil, compared to the effects of placebo, on cognitive function,
      sensorimotor gating and psychopathology in patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic
      (ziprasidone).

      Secondary objectives are to examine:

        -  The effect of donepezil, compared to the effects of placebo, on cognitive function,
           sensorimotor gating and psychopathology in patients treated with ziprasidone.

        -  Which specific areas of cognitive deficits benefit from cholinergic augmentation of
           atypical antipsychotic treatment.

        -  The interactions between cognitive deficits and psychopathology: To what extent the
           effects of cholinergic augmentation on psychopathology, sensorimotor gating, and
           cognition are independent or correlated.

        -  Which specific brain areas are activated during cholinergic augmentation of treatment
           with an atypical antipsychotic drug (ziprasidone).

      Participants: Schizophrenic men and women between the ages 18 to 55 who meet the ICD-10
      criteria for schizophrenia living in the catchment area of the psychiatric departments of
      Bispebjerg University Hospital,Rigshospitalet, or Psychiatric Center, Glostrup. Patients can
      be either unmedicated, or need to be switched from other antipsychotic medications due to
      side-effects, or lack of effect on negative symptoms, positive symptoms, or cognitive
      function. Patients can be enrolled in the study as inpatients or outpatients, and changes in
      hospitalization status during the trial are allowed. Patients were stabilized on
      antipsychotic medication (ziprasidone) before they were randomized to treatment with either
      donepezil or placebo.
