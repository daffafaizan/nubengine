      enough vitamin D in your body is associated with increased risk of injury and reduced health
      and athletic performance. It is often recommended that individuals who have low levels of
      vitamin D take vitamin D supplements. However, the effects of vitamin D supplementation on
      health and strength gains in collegiate athletes are not known. The goal of this study is to
      determine whether vitamin D supplementation increases strength and bone density, while
      reducing the risk of injury in collegiate athletes. Fasting vitamin D concentrations will be
      measured and athletes will be supplemented daily with Vitamin D for 8-12 weeks. The amount of
      supplementation will depend on whether the athlete is categorized as sufficient (>30ng/ml),
      insufficient (20-35ng/ml), or deficient (<20ng/ml). Vitamin D concentrations, strength, bone
      density, and injury risk will be assessed before and after the intervention period.
