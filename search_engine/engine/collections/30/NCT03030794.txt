      War Veterans (GWV) with Gulf War Illness (GWI). Migraine like HA and diffuse body pain were
      detected in 64% of GWV with GWI. This high prevalence of chronic HA and diffuse body pain
      conditions are often associated with neuropsychological dysfunction in mood, attention,
      memory and other systemic symptoms, which cast a profound negative impact on patients'
      quality of life. Unfortunately, conventional pharmacological treatments for GWI related
      headaches and pain (GWI-HAP) has not been shown to be effective and drugs such as narcotics
      contain many long term untoward psychosomatic and abusive side effects. Therefore, developing
      and validating non-invasive and low risk innovative treatment for this patient population is
      warranted. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is currently a US FDA approved treatment
      for major depression and migraine HA.
