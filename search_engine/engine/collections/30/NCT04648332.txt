      Medical Center (Odessa, Ukraine). The study design was approved by the Ethical Committee at
      Bogomolets National Medical University. Patients who planned osteosynthesis of the proximal
      femur and who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to 3 study groupsThe aim of our
      study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of different techniques of perioperative
      anaesthesia and anaesthesia in patients with fractures of the proximal femur: general
      anaesthesia and systemic analgesia, neuraxial (spinal) anaesthesia, compartment psoas block
      in combination with a sciatic nerve block. Patients in group 1 underwent catheterization of
      the lumbar plexus from the posterior access on admission to the hospital and began analgesia
      with bupivacaine 0.125% 6-8 ml / h. Intraoperative anesthesia was provided with a bupivacaine
      bolus of 0.5% 200 mg in a lumbar catheter and a sciatic nerve block with 1.5% 450 mg of
      lidocaine. Postoperative analgesia was provided with prolonged lumbar plexus block with
      bupivacaine 0.125% 6-8 ml / h.

      Patients in group 2 underwent intraoperative spinal anaesthesia at the level of L3-L4 with
      hyperbaric bupivacaine 10-15 mg. Patients in groups 1 - 2 receive intraoperative sedation
      with propofol 1% with a target level of sedation RASS from 0 to -2. Group 3 patients
      underwent general sevoflurane inhalation anaesthesia with fentanyl infusion for analgesia.

      All patients received paracetamol 3g/day and dexketoprofen 75 mg/day during hospitalization.
      On-demand, nalbuphine 5 mg SC was used for analgesia.
