    
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) refers to a medical condition which occurs in aging men
      where the prostate gland is enlarged preventing the free flow of urine. This causes symptoms
      of frequent urination, constant feeling of urgency to go to the bathroom, and difficulty
      passing urine due to the obstruction caused by the enlarged gland. The incidence (number of
      new cases) of BPH increases from 40% among males between the ages of 50 and 60 years to 90%
      among males older than 80 years of age. Treatment of BPH is currently undergoing intense
      scrutiny due to the cost and morbidity (complications and disability due to the procedure)
      associated with the "gold standard" treatment, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate
      (TURP). The TURP procedure has established its place as a standard of care for BPH due to its
      exceptional clinical efficacy and established long-term durability. Despite the clinical
      prowess of TURP, there remain significant concerns regarding the relatively high incidence of
      postoperative morbidity and the significant economic burden on world healthcare systems.
      Laser vaporization prostatectomy, on the other hand, has developed into a relatively new
      technological advance that has been utilized with favorable outcomes for more than a decade.
