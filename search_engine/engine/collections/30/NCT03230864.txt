    
      In the study, patients will receive risperidone (4-6 mg/day), or, if recently failed on
      risperidone, olanzapine (15-20mg/day). Later during the study, patients will be randomized to
      either receive Lu AF35700 (10 mg/day), or continue their treatment from the prospective
      confirmation (PC) period.

      The study consists of a Screening Period (up to 3 weeks), a single-blind PC Period (6 weeks),
      a Double-blind Treatment (DBT) Period (8 weeks), and a Safety Follow-up Period (6 weeks).

      Patients who did not fulfil the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, were withdrawn
      from the study after the PC period.

      Patients who fulfilled the randomization criteria for the DBT Period, continued into the DBT
      period and were randomized into one of the 2 treatmetn arms (1:1) with either Lu AF35700 10
      mg or to continue the treatment allocated in the PC period (olanzapine or risperidone) at the
      dose set at the last visit of the PC period. This means that approximately half of the
      confirmed treatment-resistant patients were randomised back to the failed treatment in the PC
      period.

      Data was not collected seperately for the DBT olanzapine and DBT risperidone participants,
      and there was no intent to compare Lu AF35700 to each drug seperately.
