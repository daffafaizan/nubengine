      Primary

        -  Determine the relationship between estimated absorbed dose and tumor response using
           different dosimetric methodologies in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with
           iodine I 131 tositumomab or yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan.

        -  Determine the relationship between estimated absorbed dose and normal organ toxicity
           using different dosimetric methodologies in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the difference in the dose-response relationship between dosimetric methodologies
           in these patients.

        -  Assess the influence of prior therapy on the dose-response relationship for hematologic
           toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to planned radioimmunotherapy treatment (iodine I
      131 tositumomab vs yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan).

        -  Stratum 1: Patients receive dosimetric rituximab IV followed by indium In 111 (^111In)
           ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo positron emission
           tomography (PET)/CT scans and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT
           scans between 2-24, 48-72, and 90-120 hours after ^111In ibritumomab tiuxetan
           administration. Patients who have acceptable biodistribution receive therapeutic
           rituximab IV followed by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes between
           days 7-9.

        -  Stratum 2: Patients receive dosimetric tositumomab IV over 60 minutes followed by iodine
           I 131 (^131I) tositumomab IV over 20 minutes on day 0. Patients undergo PET/CT scans and
           SPECT/CT scans on days 0; 2, 3 or 4; and 6 or 7. Patients who have acceptable
           biodistribution receive therapeutic tositumomab IV over 60 minutes followed by ^131I
           tositumomab IV over 20 minutes on approximately day 7.

      In both strata, blood is collected at baseline to measure FLT-3 levels. All patients also
      undergo a baseline PET/CT scan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 88 patients will be accrued for this study.
