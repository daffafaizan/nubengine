      patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Subjects will be divided
      into two groups (1:1 matching will be achieved after a screening of propensity score) to
      receive one of two interventions in addition to standard HF management: Sacubitril/Valsartan
      group or RAAS inhibitor group. All subjects can have a beta-blocker, CCB, and/or
      alpha-blockers to control BP. Dialysis treatment: patients normally complete hemodialysis or
      peritoneal dialysis, need to ensure adequate dialysis requirements, no obvious overload,
      patients achieve dry weight after dialysis.

      Participants will be treated and follow-up for at least 18 months.
