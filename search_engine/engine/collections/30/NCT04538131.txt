      efficacy and safety of sensor-driven position-adaptive SCS in the treatment of gait
      disturbance in patients with PD. More than 1 month after operation, subjects will be randomly
      assigned into two groups, with one group treated with conventional spinal cord stimulation
      intervention and the other treated with sensor-driven position-adaptive spinal cord
      stimulation intervention. Both groups will be followed-up for more than 1 week and receive
      comprehensive evaluation. A cross-over design will then be applied to eliminate the
      individual variability until both groups complete another 1 week follow-up. Stimulation
      parameters and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) remained during follow-up in both group.
      Clinical evaluation is assessed by 6-min walk test (6MWT) and timed up-and-go task (TUG) with
      gait analysis. Quality of life is evaluated by The 5-level EQ-5D. The severity of PIGD is
      assessed by gait and fall questionnaire (GFQ) , modified fall efficacy scale(MFES),
      activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale and the survey of activities and fear of
      falling in the elderly (SAFFE ). Within group t test will be made for comparison between two
      groups.
