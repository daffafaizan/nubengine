      group. Children of the control group will receive standard of care for infants with severe
      CHD: cardiac surveillance, counselling and screening at the University Children's Hospital
      Zurich and standardised developmental checkups by their paediatrician. Physiotherapy is
      normally not comprised in standard of care, but some infants may receive physiotherapy, if
      they present with obvious signs of motor developmental delay, detected by the paediatrician
      later on in their life. Once enrolled in this study, an infant of the control group will not
      receive early motor intervention as an infant enrolled in the intervention group.

      Infants randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive early motor intervention,
      which will be based on the results of our qualitative study. It will comprise supporting
      parents by a paediatric physiotherapist. Parents will be guided on how to best stimulate
      their infant's development during daily activities. Parents will be actively involved in the
      intervention with the aim to challenge their infant at the limit of its postural capacity and
      thus help the infant to optimize its motor repertoire. The intervention will start after
      baseline with infants aged 3-6 months and end after three months with infants aged 6-9
      months.

      The intervention will start at home, then alternating at the Children's Hospital and at home.
      Telephone or video counselling will be provided to support parents if needed. The order may
      change according to the needs of the family when necessary and adjusted to best fit the daily
      routine the family.
