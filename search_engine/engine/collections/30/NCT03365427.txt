      depend on adequate rehabilitation and subsequent functional recovery after
      surgery.Rehabilitation affects or even determines various performance of post-operative knee,
      including knee range-of-motion (ROM), muscle strength, functional independence, all of which
      subsequently affect patients' quality of life. Conventional way of rehabilitation is exercise
      therapy, which rely on guidance of therapists and the self-efficacy of patients.

      An application (APP) on smart phone was designed for people received TKA to play the role of
      guider and help improving patients' self-efficacy. This is a single-centre randomized
      clinical trial, with an anticipation of 200 patients with knee osteoarthritis enrolled, who
      will be randomly assigned into experiment group or control group. The patients in the
      experiment group will be introduced to this APP and requested to use it regularly, while the
      patients in the control group will receive pure conventional rehabilitation. Primary outcome
      includes Visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, knee society score (KSS), ROM, ability of daily
      living (ADL) before operation and at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery. All potential
      covariates of those two groups, such as age, sex, and pre-operative kellgren-lawrence scores
      would be matched by completely randomize.
