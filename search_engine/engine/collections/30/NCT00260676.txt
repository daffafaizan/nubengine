      50-70% of kidney, liver and heart are eligible for transplantation, only 20% of the lungs fit
      the criteria for transplant. More than 30% of the lungs theoretically suitable for donation
      are not actually collected because following brain death they develop severe hypoxemia and
      abnormal chest X-ray. Guidelines for critical care management of potential organ donors
      suggest that after the diagnosis of brain death, treatment priority can be shifted from
      cerebral protection to a strategy aimed at preserving solid organ perfusion and function.
      However the ventilatory strategy recommended for potential lung donors is similar to the one
      proposed for brain injured patients. This ventilatory strategy based on high Vt and low PEEP
      may induce a further exacerbation of the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response in
      patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Moreover, recent data
      suggest that this strategy may be harmful in "normal lungs" of mechanical ventilated
      patients. Aim of the study is to verify if a "PROTECTIVE" ventilatory strategy (low tidal
      volume and high PEEP, application of CPAP during the apnea test and recruitment maneuvers)
      improves lung function. Primary end point of the study is to increase the number of lungs
      that meet the eligibility criteria for transplantation. Secondary end point is to increase
      the number of lungs really transplanted.
