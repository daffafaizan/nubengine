      I. To assess the pharmacokinetic properties of intravenously administered lidocaine inside a
      glioblastoma tumor by means of mass spectroscopy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the differences in overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)
      between the patients in the lidocaine therapy group and historical controls taken from the
      literature (Stupp et al) with comparable post-operative treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bolus lidocaine intravenously (IV) per standard of care. After intubation,
      patients receive another infusion of lidocaine IV over 4 hours or until the end of surgery.
      Patients also undergo collection of blood and tumor samples at the start of surgery and
      hourly afterwards until a total of 4 samples are collected.

      After completion of surgery, patients are followed for 24 hours, and at 7-14 days, up to 30
      days.
