      patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the quality of life of
      patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare the pharmacokinetics of these treatment
      regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral vinorelbine weekly. Arm II: Patients receive
      vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed several times during
      treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 195 patients will be accrued for this study.
