      study. Migrant construction workers of either Bangladeshi or Indian ethnicity from a single
      dormitory in Singapore volunteer to participate at the study. Only eligible workers are
      included in the study if they fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria; 20 and 51 years
      old, a BMI between 17.0 to 27.5 kg/m2, willing to adhere to the study procedure for at least
      six months, and sign informed consent, are free of current medical and/or chronic/non
      communicable diseases, no history of heavy smoking or alcohol consumption. The eligible
      subjects receive fortified rice for their daily lunch and dinner each day of the week (i e 14
      meals/week) over six months. The nutrient levels per 100 g fortified rice contain 150 µg
      vitamin A (Vitamin A palmitate), 0.5 mg vitamin B1 (thiamin mononitrate), 7 mg vitamin B3
      (niacin amide), 0.6 mg vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), 1 µg vitamin B12
      (cyanocobalamin), 130 µg folic acid, 4 mg iron (ferric pyrosphosphate), and 6 mg zinc (zinc
      oxide). At baseline and after 6 months of intervention, BMI and vital signs such as blood
      pressure, pulse and body temperature are collected. Also, 10 ml venous blood is sampled at
      baseline and after 6 months of intervention and subsequently tested for hemoglobin, serum
      folate, and serum zinc, serum ferritin and serum vitamin B12 status. In a small subset of the
      migrant construction workers, an extra 5 ml blood sample is taken for homocysteine testing.
