      information on gait performance in patients with chronic hemiplegia (six months to two years
      post-stroke) who either continue to attend two physical therapy sessions per week for two
      months or who stop physical therapy sessions for two months. This will permit us 1) to assess
      the efficacy of continuing physical therapy sessions during the chronic phase of post-stroke
      hemiplegia, 2) to investigate whether the effects of physical therapy in these patients
      gradually decreases during the period of six months to two years post-stroke, and 3) to model
      the relationship between standard measures of gait performance (speed, endurance, balance,
      use of technical aids…) with other multidimensional covariates: social and environmental
      factors (type of housing, presence of a third person,…), cognitive factors (cognitive
      disorders associated) and thymic factors (anxiety, depression) and 4) to assess the costs
      associated with the physical therapy care of chronic-phase stroke patients .
