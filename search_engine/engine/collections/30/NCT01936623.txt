      Eligible participants (N = 80) will be randomly assigned to immediately receive a
      computerized brief intervention focused on drug use or to receive the same computerized brief
      intervention at 3-month follow-up. All participants will be assessed at three time points:
      baseline, and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups.
