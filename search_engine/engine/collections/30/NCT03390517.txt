      anastomosis and intraoperative fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green and operation
      alone. After surgery on 7-8 POD patients are examined to two sides X-Ray proctography
      performed by introducing 100 ml of water-soluble liquid contrast material through the anus
      over the anastomotic line by a Foley catheter for diagnosis of anastomotic leakage.
