      patients will be enrolled, 60 to group, randomized in 1:1 fashion. The control group will
      consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology for management of acute systolic heart failure
      with intravenous diuresis and standard medical therapy, meeting inclusion criteria.
      Information will be gathered through observational prospective data analysis from Epic EMR,
      and will include daily diuretic type and dose required, daily urine output, daily creatinine,
      total days of admission, daily and pre-discharge weight, admission BNP, and pre-discharge
      BNP. The intervention group will consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology meeting
      inclusion criteria and being managed with standard medical therapy. This group will receive
      additional therapy using bilateral lower extremity compression wraps applied by nursing staff
      per pre-set protocol, and will receive education on the use of compression wraps. Patients
      will be instructed to wear the compression wraps for the entirety of the time they are
      undergoing intravenous diuresis, with pauses in care as needed for hygiene and symptom relief
      purposes. During the time of compression wrap application, the following data will be
      collected: urine output, daily weights, daily creatinine, daily and total dose and type of
      intravenous diuretic used. Prior to discharge, a BNP will be obtained. Endpoints (including
      percentage of weight reduction, total urine output achieved with diuresis, total dose
      requirement and type of intravenous diuresis, total days of intravenous diuresis, days to
      discharge, discharge BNP, and percent reduction from admission BNP) will then be compared to
      assess the utility of adding lower extremity compression wraps to inpatient management of
      acute systolic heart failure.
