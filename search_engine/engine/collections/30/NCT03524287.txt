      reported to range from 9.8%-20.9%, and the presence of No. 10 lymph node metastasis is
      closely related to survival. Therefore, in East Asia, D2 lymph node dissection of potentially
      curable locally advanced upper third gastric cancer including No. 10 lymph node is the
      standard surgical treatment.

      Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming
      the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive
      procedures. However, it remains a controversial international issue if it is safe and
      feasible to conduct robotic assisted spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection for
      advanced upper third gastric cancer. There is no prospective study to identify the results.

      The study is through a prospective, open, single-arm study,to explore the clinical outcomes
      of the robotic assisted spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection in the treatment of
      locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma （cT2-4a, N-/+, M0）.
