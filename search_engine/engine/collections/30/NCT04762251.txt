      After a 2-week baseline period, and a baseline metabolic visit, participants will be
      randomized into one of two groups (TRE, time-restricted eating; CP, current practice
      guidelines). All participants will receive five (5) telehealth consultations at baseline,
      week 2, 4, 8 and 12, the content of which will be based around their randomized condition.
      They will undergo metabolic testing on two (2) further occasions (4 months, 12 months) over a
      12-month period to assess the changes in primary and secondary outcomes.
