      to compare the safety and efficacy of terameprocol (45mg or 90mg/application)administered
      once per week for 3 weeks to the cervix uteri in patients with biopsy-proven CIN. Patients
      who met eligibility criteria visited the clinic weekly for terameprocol application. Patients
      kept a daily diary card record of genitourinary symptoms.
