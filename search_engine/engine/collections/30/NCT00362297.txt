      Eligible patients will return to clinic to be given study drug and a patient diary card on
      which to record concomitant medications, signs and symptoms, and adverse experiences. The
      investigator will instruct the patient on daily home viral sample collection, taking the
      study drug, and completing the diary card. The patient will be instructed to return to clinic
