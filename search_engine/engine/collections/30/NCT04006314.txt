      proteins in the SF are not reduced after PRP injections, this indicates that PRP is not a
      good treatment choice for patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA. If
      inflammatory protein concentrations are further increased after NPT as patients may start
      strenuous exercises with reduced knee pain, more knee joint destruction may result. This
      signifies that NPT has pain reduction effect only and is not a viable treatment option.
      Roentgenograms may not show immediate signs of increased degeneration on the knee joints, but
      SF proteomic findings can provide us with evidences suggesting whether there is ongoing knee
      joint destruction. Upon the completion of this study, adequate scientific evidences will be
      gathered to know whether simultaneous PRP and NPT injections is a feasible option in treating
      patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA.
