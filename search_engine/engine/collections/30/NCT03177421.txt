      large body of research has shown poor sleep-related outcomes related to media exposure,
      especially in evening or bedtime hours - a trend that holds true from infancy to adolescence.
      Prior research has demonstrated clinic-based interventions can be effective in reducing
      general screen time. Yet, little work has been done to leverage existing health information
      technology to adapt bedtime media use guidelines into sustainable counseling interventions.
      This study will develop, implement, and evaluate a computerized, evidence-based decision
      support intervention for reducing inappropriate childhood bedtime media use and improving
      sleep measures.
