    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm (non-randomized), interventional cohort,
      non-significant risk (NSR) study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      Rotational Fractional Resection (skin resection and focal lipectomy) in patients with mild to
      moderate submental fat and mild to moderate submental skin laxity. The total duration of
      study participation for each subject is approximately up to 7 months for each subject from
      the screening visit to the exit visit. The follow-up period will be approximately 6 months
      after the procedure. Eligible subjects will complete a total of 8 study visits: screening,
      procedure, and follow-up visits at 1, 7, 14, 30, 90 and 180 days post-procedure.
