      effects on the cardiovascular system. in order to summarize the mechanism of the event,
      cholesterol is transported from the liver to the cells and from the cells back to the liver
      via blood. Cholesterol and other fats are carried in packets called lipoprotein to dissolve
      in the blood. Those with these are two kinds of cholesterol, these low-density lipoproteins
      and good cholesterol can help to lower the cholesterol as well. LDL cholesterol is the main
      package that carries cholesterol in the blood. When the blood is high, it sticks to the
      inside of the veins and forms plaques around here. With the addition of cholesterol, a blood
      clot that formed in cracks that occur on these plaques grow the arteries and clogs them. If
      the blockage occurs in the heart vessels, it can cause a heart attack and stroke. Cholesterol
      in the blood is a part of a package called HDL-cholesterol is carried in. HDL-cholesterol
      prevents the accumulation of cholesterol in the veins.

      It collects the cholesterol circulating in the blood and brings it to the liver to get rid of
      it from the body. Thus, it reduces the exposure of blood vessels to the harmful effects of
      cholesterol. All these effects of HDL cholesterol in the paraoxonase enzyme owes. This may be
      the reason why Dolat may even use another nomenclature instead of HDL in future years. A
      paraoxonase-1 enzyme, which is known to decrease blood level with age, is found to be
      significantly lower in patients with myocardial infarction at a young age compared with the
      healthy control group in this study, and the measurement of this enzyme level can be used as
      a screening test in people with risk factors.
