      I. To determine the recommended dosing for the combination of sunitinib (sunitinib malate)
      and dalteparin in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      II. To evaluate safety and tolerability for the combination of sunitinib and dalteparin in
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      III. To determine early signs of clinical activity of the combination of sunitinib and
      dalteparin in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical response rate of sunitinib and dalteparin in patients with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      II. To determine time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival amongst patients with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving sunitinib and dalteparin.

      III. To determine the effect of sunitinib alone and dalteparin alone compared to the
      combination of dalteparin plus sunitinib on plasma coagulation parameters.

      IV. To determine the effect of sunitinib alone and dalteparin alone compared to the
      combination of dalteparin plus sunitinib on angiogenesis parameters in blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dalteparin.

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) in weeks 1-4 and dalteparin
      subcutaneously (SC) QD in week 6 during course 1. In all subsequent courses, patients receive
      sunitinib malate PO QD in weeks 1-4 and dalteparin SC QD in weeks 1-6. Courses repeat every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 3 years.
