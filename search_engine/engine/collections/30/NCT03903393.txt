      a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, with poorly defined
      pathophysiological mechanisms remain. Circulating lncRNAs are long, noncoding RNA molecules,
      which negatively regulate gene expression, and considered as promising biomarkers for PE. The
      objective of the study is to evaluate circulating lncRNA signatures in women with PE compared
      to healthy women, and in women sub-grouped per PE severity. This study assessed lncRNA
      expression profile in the serum at early stages of gestation of women who later developed
      severe preeclampsia (sPE) in the third trimester of pregnancy compared to women with
      uncomplicated pregnancies. Circulating lncRNA was extracted from maternal serum. This study
      also assess lncRNA expression profile in the placenta tissues of PE patients and healthy
      pregnant women.
