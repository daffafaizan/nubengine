    
      Background:

        -  Potential negative effects of pacing in the RV-apex are well documented

        -  Asynchronous ventricular activation

        -  reduction of systolic and diastolic LV function

        -  Experimental data: histological changes

        -  Asymmetric LV hypertrophy and thinning

        -  However, study results comparing septal / RVOT-pacing versus RV-apical pacing
           controversial:

        -  Acute versus chronic

        -  Small number of cases, uncontrolled, unblinded,

        -  Brief periods of observation in the cross-over design (3 months)

        -  "RVOT" often summarizes different stimulation sites: high RVOT, lateral, septal.
           Actually only limited data with proven septal stimulation

        -  No objective performance assessment (CPX)

        -  Assessment of alternative stimulation site previously RVOT versus RV-apex,

        -  ventricular pacing compared to ventricular pacing, then tested a potential harm to
           another

        -  The question of the optimal pacing mode of patients with SSS (DDDR versus AAIR) appears
           to be open again. While in Germany, two-chamber systems with AAI [R] mode with
           ventricular back-up are used, should the DDD (R) mode with an AV delay ≤ 220 ms be the
           preferred pacing mode, according to the results of the DANPACE trial for patients with
           SSS [DANPACE, ESC 2010, Stockholm].

      Aim:

      - to evaluate chronic effects of proven right ventricular septal compared to minimized right
      ventricular septal pacing in patients with SSS

      Inclusion criterion:

      -Pacemaker indication according to current guidelines: sick sinus syndrome (SSS)

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Life expectancy < 2 years

        -  Age <18 years

        -  Noncompliance with regard to participation in the study

        -  Pregnancy

        -  AV block ° 2 and higher

        -  Permanent atrial fibrillation

        -  Heart failure NYHA III and IV, reduced LV-EF <40%

        -  ICD indication

        -  Acute coronary syndrome. PCI or CABG <3 months

        -  Heart transplant

        -  Placement of septal RV electrode is not possible

      Study design:

        -  Prospective, monocentric, randomized, double-blinded

        -  Run-in phase: 4 weeks AAI [R]-DDD [R]

        -  ECG, PM-interrogation, echocardiography, performance diagnostics, CPX, QoL questionnaire

        -  Randomization: two groups 4 weeks (between 3 to 6 weeks) after implant A) septal right
           ventricular chamber pacing: mode DDD [R] versus B) Reduction of unnecessary ventricular
           pacing: AAI [R]-DDD [R].

        -  FU: 6 and 12-months

        -  ECG, Holter-ECG, PM-interrogation, echocardiography, performance diagnostics, CPX, QoL
           questionnaire

        -  Extension of follow-up if possible

      Primary endpoints:

      -LV ejection fraction and end-systolic LV volume after 12 months.

      Secondary endpoints:

      -LV end-diastolic volume, TAPSE, parameters of dyssynchrony (SPWMD, LV-PEP, IVMD), AF-burden,
      % ventricular pacing, CPX: peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), VO2 AT, VO2/HR, VE/VCO2 slope;
      QoL scores (SF-36) after 12 months.

      Blinding:

        -  Patient compared to the pacing mode

        -  Physician: offline analysis of echo and CPX blinded to the pacing mode

      Statistics/sample size estimation:

      In order to detect a difference in LVEF of 5% and for LV-ESV of 5 mL between the 2 groups
      after 12 months:

        -  90% power/alpha 5%: 84 patients per group

        -  80% power/alpha 5%: 63 patients per group

             -  10% for compensation of drop-outs / patients lost of follow-up. Two-sided 5% type 1
                error Analysis intention-to-treat and based on the finally programmed pacing mode.
