      months postpartum in bi-weekly cell phone based peer support (CPS) or monthly peer-led
      support groups (PSG) can increase adoption and duration of EBF amongst low-income women in
      Kenya served by a nationalized BFHI certified hospital above benchmarks achieved with current
      approaches and standard of care by existing facility-based support (SOC).

      The study aimed to reach the following specific objectives related to message delivery on
      EBF:

      assess the feasibility of two innovative approaches (CPS and PSG) to deliver extended
      postnatal peer support for EBF by women in an urban, low-income country setting; compare the
      effectiveness of these two innovative approaches to existing facility-based support; and
      compare the relative effectiveness of each type of peer support intervention.
