    
      Aim 1. In a comparative 2-group design, we will evaluate and compare the feasibility of the
      intervention through assessment in both settings (home-based and inpatient) on:

        1. Adherence to RGN107 protocol by licensed care providers and/or family or other
           caregivers providing wound care; measures include implementation of procedures,
           frequency of dressing changes.

        2. Reach, enrollment, disenrollment, acceptability, satisfaction; measures include
           difficulties with recruitment and enrollment, side effects such as burning, peri-wound
           skin irritation.

        3. Usability issues such as powder ability to stick to wound and ease of use of applying
           powder.

      Aim 2. Estimate variability of outcome measurements and effect sizes and investigate the
      presence of a preliminary "signal" of clinical efficacy in two groups of hospice/home
      health/residential individuals receiving RGN107 in:

        1. Physical wound symptoms outcomes, specifically pain, odor and exudate.

        2. Quality of life of individuals receiving and caregivers using RGN107.
