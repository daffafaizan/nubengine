      urothelial cancer after platinum-failure. It has proved to improve the survival results
      compared with the best suportive care. In adition, the tolerability was favourable, specially
      for not leading appearance of neuropathy nor other cumulative toxic effects.

      In this study, it is proposed to test the feasibility, in terms of tolerability and efficacy
      of monotherapy with vinflunine in patients who, after completing the first-line
      cisplatin-based treatment for Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Urothelial Tract (CCTU),
      have reached a stabilization or objective response. In order to have an adequate control
      group in the proposed design will be a phase II trial in which one group will receive
      standard management (follow-up until progression disease).
