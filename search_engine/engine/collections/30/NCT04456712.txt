      worldwide.Fluoroquinolones are classified into generations according to the spectrum of
      antimicrobial activities that targeted them.Fluoroquinolones may cause several side effects
      as tendon rupture, central nervous toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, gastrointestinal
      toxicity, phototoxicity, disrupted glucose metabolism, skin disorders and hypersensitivity.
      Ciprofloxacin, a second generation fluoroquinolone, is one of the most successful and widely
      used compounds of fluoroquinolone. On the other hand, levofloxacin is a third generation
      fluoroquinolone.

      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is chronic disease and a serious of metabolic disorder associated with
      the presence of hyperglycemia due to partial or complete insulin deficiency. Diabetes
      mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.

      Fluoroquinolone class is associated with cardiac side effects as QTc prolongation. Some
      agents of fluoroquinolones were withdrawn from market. However, cardiac adverse effects has
      been developed with fluoroquinolones still in market. Members of fluoroquinolones class have
      different effects on QT interval. The US FDA suggested that the risk and benefits ratio of
      fluoroquinolones should be taken into consideration.

      In addition to hyperglycemia events are more common with fluoroquinolones than with other
      classes of antibiotics. The food and drug administration (FDA) confirmed the current warning
      that fluoroquinolones may cause decrease in blood sugar especially in diabetic patients.
      However, other study proved that fluoroquinolones may cause dysglycemic events in diabetic
      and non-diabetic patients.
