      made from adipose tissue that acts as paracrine and endocrine hormones. Adipokines are
      involved in maintaining varieties of processes such as, appetite and satiety, energy
      expenditure activity, endothelial function, blood pressure, hemostasis, adipogenesis, insulin
      sensitivity, energy metabolism in insulin-sensitive tissues, fat distribution and insulin
      secretion in pancreatic Î²-cells. Adipokines may contribute to reduce scar formation and
      improve cardiac function in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Reperfusion therapy such as
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be administered to all eligible patients with
      AMI symptom onset within the prior 12 hours. However, our previous work showed that obese
      patients may benefit more from PCI. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the
      efficacy and mechanism of adipokines cardiac protection for obese and non-obese patients with
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who have undergone PCI.
