      among other detriments, a blunted ability to maintain a constant core temperature. Impaired
      thermoregulation leaves persons with tetraplegia more susceptible to hyperthermia than
      able-bodied persons (AB). There has been a paucity of work addressing the thermoregulatory
      responses of persons with SCI to hot ambient temperatures, and even less study addressing the
      effect of these temperatures on cognitive performance. The goals of this pilot study are: to
      improve our understanding of the thermoregulatory mechanisms of individuals with tetraplegia
      when exposed to heat and to determine the effect of impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms on
      cognitive performance during exposure to 35°C for up to 2 hours. In order to address our
      goals we have designed a study methodology which consists of comparing the physiological and
      psychological responses of the two study groups (tetraplegia versus AB controls) from
      thermoneutral (27°C) to hot (35°C) environments.
