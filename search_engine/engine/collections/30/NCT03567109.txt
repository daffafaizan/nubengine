      schema alterations are involved in the chronification of those disorders. Those alterations
      bring the opportunity for new exploration or therapeutic solutions. Our hypothesis is that
      musculoskeletal disorders lead to motor imagery alterations relative to body schema
      disorders. Reaction time extension et error rate increase in a hand laterality judgment task
      would confirm that hypothesis. It is assumed that body schema alterations of patients
      suffering from musculoskeletal disorders could change with localisation, dependant on
      disorder's laterality and distality.

      It is a monocentric, prospective, case-control trial, with 4 subgroups of 30 patients :
      shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic low back pain, healthy
      subjects. We compare reaction time and error rate on a hand laterality judgement task. In
      that task, participants are asked to identify hand right or left laterality, when those hand
      is presented on a computer screen, by answering with the keyboard. Hands are shown on palmar
      or dorsal view and with 12 different angles of rotation. An eye-tracking device register
      participant eye movements during the task.
