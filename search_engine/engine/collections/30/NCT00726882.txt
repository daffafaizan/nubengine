      ABT-333 at any dose level or matching placebo in a prior clinical study involving ABT-333.
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who received ABT-333 at any dose level or
      matching placebo in Study M10-351 Substudy 2 (NCT00696904; ABT-333 dosing duration was 2
      days) and Study M10-380 (NCT00851890; ABT-333 dosing duration was 28 days) were eligible.

      After receiving at least 1 dose of ABT-333 or placebo, subjects were assessed for
      participation in this rollover study and asked to review the informed consent. The day of
      study completion or early discontinuation from the prior ABT-333 clinical study served as the
      baseline assessment. If it was found that a participant received placebo during the previous
      ABT-333 clinical study, the sites were instructed to discontinue the participant from this
      study.

      This study included approximately monthly blood sample collection procedures for 48 weeks,
      and no treatment was provided during this time.
