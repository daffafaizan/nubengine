      in dose-dependent increases in platelet counts, but required dose for raising platelet count
      is variable between individuals according to each patient's ability to eliminate serum
      romiplostim. Because of this variability, after administration of initial 1mcg/kg of
      romiplostim, dose adjustment is recommended based on the platelet response to given dose of
      romiplostim. However, the optimal dose interval of romiplostim has rarely been studied. In
      pivotal studies, romiplostim was administered on a weekly schedule, and based on these
      studies, one dose at every week is being widely used. In one study in which ITP patients
      received weekly subcutaneous doses of romiplostim at a range from 3 to 15mcg/kg, half life of
      romiplostim was estimated from 1 to 34 days, suggesting that lengthening the interval between
      doses more than a week can be potentially possible in some patients.
