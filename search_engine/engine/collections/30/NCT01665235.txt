      ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack,while Atherosclerotic intracranial arterial
      stenosis is an important reason for Asian patients with stroke ,accounting for the 33% to 51%
      of a etiology ratio.The latest research suggests that varying degrees of blood pressure
      variability can affect the risk of stroke.This study observe the relationship between blood
      pressure variability and prognosis of ischemic stroke patients with intracranial arterial
      stenosis,with cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI + DWI),magnetic resonance angiography
      and Trans-cranial Doppler(TCD) .
