      post-intubation, the tube will be finally fixed after palpating endotracheal cuff at three
      sites (below cricoid cartilage, at suprasternal level and just below suprasternal notch). ETT
      cuff position will be scanned by sonography of airway to confirm the position of the proximal
      end of the ETT cuff. Fibre optic bronchoscopy will be done to find distance between tip of
      endotracheal tube and carina. This distance will be measured repeatedly 5 minutes after
      pneumoperitoneum, 10 minutes after trendelenburg position and 10 minutes after making the
      patient supine at the end of surgery. Change in the distance will be noted to confirm the
      migration of ETT.
