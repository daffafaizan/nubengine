      with a spectrum of therapies, including specialized medical management as well as mechanical
      support with an LVAD approved by FDA for destination therapy. However, there is substantial
      variation in the therapeutic approaches employed to treat these patients, with relatively low
      numbers of patients receiving DT LVAD therapy to date. Therefore, the VentrAssist DT trial is
      designed to provide maximal flexibility to the investigators/clinicians to incorporate their
      clinical judgment in managing these complex patients.
