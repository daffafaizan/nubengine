      in the Mayo Clinic's Clinical Research and Trials Unit. They will undergo daily subcutaneous
      injection of CD-NP, or placebo, for 3 days with hemodynamic monitoring, ECHO, endothelial
      function assessment, and renal blood flow monitoring. Blood and urine samples will also be
      collected and assayed.
