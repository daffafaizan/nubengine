      planned to enroll a total of 25 patients with advanced heterogeneous emphysema due to alpha1
      antitrypsin deficiency. All patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in
      Heidelberg. Therapy of all patients consists of implantation of intrabronchial valves (IBV,
      Spiration, Olympus) in the most emphysematous destroyed lobe.
