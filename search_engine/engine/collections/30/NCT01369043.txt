      with ascorbate (vitamin C) or R,R,R-Î±-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) improves insulin
      sensitivity in the untrained state but blocks exercise-induced increases in insulin
      sensitivity and other adaptations to exercise. The results will provide new information on
      the roles of anti-oxidant supplementation in modifying insulin sensitivity, and will inform
      guidelines for anti-oxidant supplementation as an adjunct to exercise.
