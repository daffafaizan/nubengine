      I. To determine whether a 6-week indoor or outdoor aerobic exercise program is feasible in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) undergoing chemotherapy and to explore
      patient's preferences for indoor versus (vs.) outdoor exercise.

      II. To determine the effects of a 6-week indoor or outdoor aerobic exercise program on
      cancer-related fatigue and quality of life (QOL) in patients with mCRC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 6-week indoor or outdoor aerobic exercise program on body
      composition (lean body mass, fat mass, body fat percentage [%]) and biomarkers of systemic
      inflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a], C-reactive protein
      [CRP]) in patients with mCRC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 6-week exercise program on cardiovascular (CV) function.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo aerobic exercise sessions consisting of cycling or walking at a low-moderate
      intensity and progressing to moderate intensity for 30 minutes 2 times a week for up to 8
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 weeks and at weeks 13,
      19, and 31.
