      transplantation (KT). It has been associated with high morbidity and mortality in kidney
      transplant recipients (KTR). Its actual management is only based on the humoral immunity :
      the main risk factor for CMV infection after KT is the association of a seropositive donor
      and a seronegative recipient (so-called "D+/R- mismatch").

      However several studies have highlighted the essential role of cellular immunity to control
      CMV infection. The Quantiferon-CMV (QF-CMV) is an IGRA test (Interferon Gamma Releasing
      Assay) which evaluates T CD8 lymphocytes production of Interferon Gamma (IFNy) exposed to CMV
      antigens. Some studies have shown the possible interest of the QF-CMV in predicting CMV
      infection after antiviral prophylaxis discontinuation or when CMV viremia is detected.

      However some limits have been underlined. First its positivity threshold hasn't been approved
      in KTR. Hemodialysis patients (HP) called to receive a renal allograft also suffered from
      altered immunity. No study has directly compared the QF-CMV value in KTR, HP and control
      patients.

      That's why we propose evaluating the expression of basal cellular immunity against CMV (far
      from any active infection) in KTR and HP using the QF-CMV and comparing it to control
      patients population (not suffering from kidney dysfunction or immunosuppression).
