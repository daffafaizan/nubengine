      the treatment of "real world" de-novo and restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and
      coronary bypass grafts. Study goals are based on non-inferiority for Drug-Coated Balloon
      (DCB) compared to Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon (PCB) and Dru-eluting Stents (DES) (historical
      data) with 80% power. Primary and secondary outcome variables are international accepted
      parameters in stent-trials, which sufficiently describe the efficacy and safety of the
      investigated device and allow clinical conclusions. Additional attention will be paid to
      those patients who received, by observation, a shortened dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).

      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the SeQuent® SCB in the
      treatment of coronary artery disease with reference vessel diameters between ≥ 2 mm and ≤ 4
      mm with suitable lesion lengths. There is no limitation of lesion lengths. In case the lesion
      is longer than 34 mm, more than one stent needs to be used.
