      I. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients at
      high risk for hereditary pancreatic cancer.

      II. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to identify the presence of pancreatic cancer in patients
      with cystic lesions of the pancreas.

      III. Assess the ability of DCE-MRI to accurately predict tumor margins in patients who have
      undergone chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

      IV. Obtain DCE-MRI scans of from healthy volunteers (Group 4), to establish baseline imaging
      parameters of the normal, non-diseased pancreas for use as a comparator to affected
      pancreata.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Clinical factors associated with the presence of pancreatic cancer will be assessed in
      each of the three experimental groups, including disease free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.

      ARM I (High-risk for familial or hereditary pancreatic cancer): Patients undergo DCE MRI
      yearly for a minimum of 3 scans.

      ARM II (Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [IPMN]): Patients undergo DCE MRI prior to
      surgery for resection of IPMN.

      ARM III (Pancreatic cancer): Patients who undergo chemotherapy prior to resection will have 2
      DCE MRI scans; one study scan prior to undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, as well as one study
      scan following neoadjuvant therapy as part of their pre-operative work up in addition to the
      standard imaging studies. For patients that do not require chemotherapy treatment prior to
      resection they will have just one DCE MRI scan prior to surgical resection.

      ARM IV (Healthy volunteers): Patients undergo a single DCE MRI examination.
