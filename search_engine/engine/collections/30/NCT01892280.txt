      diabetes management and adherence declines. Thus, there is a need to improve adherence and
      glycemic control in mid to older teens with type 1 diabetes by strengthening the teens'
      self-efficacy for daily diabetes self-management to help prepare them for the transition
      between pediatric and adult care. This 18-month, multi-center RCT is designed to increase
      frequency of blood glucose monitoring and improve glycemic control in teens with type 1
      diabetes through a behavioral intervention called Teenwork with or without text message
      reminders to check blood glucose levels.

      We will implement and evaluate the Teenwork intervention and text message reminders to check
      blood glucose levels in a 2x2 factorial design in which 300 participants, across two sites,
      will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups: Teenwork, Text Message, Teenwork/Text Message, or Usual
      Care.

      Participants in the Teenwork Group will meet with a research assistant during each study
      visit to review strategies for improving self-care, including self-management and
      self-advocacy, focusing on two areas: blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration.
      Participants in the Text Message Group will be instructed in the use of the text messaging
      system. They will receive 2-way text message reminders to check blood glucose levels at
      self-selected times and to reply by text message with blood glucose results. Participants in
      the Teenwork/Text Message Group will receive both the Teenwork intervention and the text
      message reminders (as described above). Participants in the Usual Care Group will receive the
      same intervention as the Teenwork/Text Message Group, but not until after 1 year.
