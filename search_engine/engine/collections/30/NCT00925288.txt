      available vaccine has been shown to protect against persistent infection from these types. If
      this study gives evidence showing the vaccine is acceptable in preventing cervical HPV
      infection by types 16 and 18 in this population, then the burden of cervical cancer and
      cancer precursors could be drastically decreased through widespread vaccination of this
      target group. Vaccination at the point of entry of brothel based sex work may become a
      requirement to lower the burden of cervical cancer among FSWs and also among all other sex
      partners of clients of FSWs. A modified schedule may prove beneficial for FSWs in Peru to
      complete the vaccine regimen.
