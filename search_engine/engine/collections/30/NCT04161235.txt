    
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective, observational study. Approximately 70 study
      participants undergoing Zephyr Valve treatment with the use of at least one Zephyr Valve
      5.5-LP EBV will be enrolled and followed out to 3 months. Assessments will be conducted at 45
      days and 3 months. The evaluation will be conducted at up to 6 sites.

      Patients prescribed Zephyr Valve treatment for their emphysema will be consented and will be
      enrolled only after: 1) determination of little to no collateral ventilation between target
      and ipsilateral lobes and 2) implantation of at least one Zephyr Valve 5.5-LP EBV. Baseline
      data will be collected retrospectively after enrollment of a patient in the Post-Market
      Evaluation. Performance and safety of the Zephyr Valve treatment with the use of at least one
      Zephyr Valve 5.5-LP will be evaluated post-treatment based on data collected until 3 months
      after the treatment.
