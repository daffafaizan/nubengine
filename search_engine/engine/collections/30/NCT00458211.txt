      has not been well studied or well accepted in the very severely ill in State Hospitals. This
      study aims to fill that gap by examining 75 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder who require a change of medication because of poor response or unacceptable side
      effects.

      After signing consent and having a baseline assessment they will, if necessary, be reduced to
      one antipsychotic then started on ziprasidone, increasing to 160mg the second day. The one
      antipsychotic they had been on will be reduced over a week and stopped. The ziprasidone can
      be increased to 240mg after three weeks if necessary.

      The study will last eight weeks with efficacy assessed by Clinical Global Impressions (CGI),
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) every two weeks and Brief Assessment of
      Cognition, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Personal Evaluation of Transitions in
      Treatment and Medical Outcomes Study Cognitive Questions at the beginning and end. Side
      effects will be measured by movement disorder scales (Simpson-Angus scale for Parkinsonism
      (SANRS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS)), ECG
      and weight and blood metabolic measures.

      The hypothesis is that ziprasidone will be generally effective and that side effects
      especially metabolic indices will be reduced.
