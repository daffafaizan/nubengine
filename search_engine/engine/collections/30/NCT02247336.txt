    
      Eligible patients are aged 40-65 years, enrolled in primary care, do not have a personal
      history of colorectal cancer, and have some knowledge of family health history. In Aim 1, a
      retrospective chart review will be conducted to determine the baseline rate of documenting
      family health history of colorectal cancer in the medical record for patients enrolled in the
      Aim 2 randomized trial. In Aim 2, consented patients will be randomized to provide
      patient-entered family health history and receive patient and provider decision support at
      enrollment or 12 months later (wait-list control). The primary outcome is risk-appropriate
      CRC screening/surveillance referral for patients 12 months post-enrollment. Secondary
      outcomes include patient uptake of recommendations and referral for genetic consultation 12
      months post-enrollment. In Aim 3, qualitative interviews will be conducted with physicians
      and clinic leaders; data will be analyzed using conventional content analysis. In Aim 4, data
      will be obtained from the administrative databases and patient medical records to conduct a
      budget impact analysis.
