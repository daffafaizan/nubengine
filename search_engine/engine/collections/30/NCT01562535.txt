      maneuver. They both are safe to perform but none of them have been statistically superior
      over the other. More studies are needed to confirm or discard the tendency of the studies to
      favor the pronation maneuver.

      The investigators intend to perform a randomized trial evaluating which of these techniques
      is better than the other in terms of returning the mobility of the affected arm and
      decreasing pain.
