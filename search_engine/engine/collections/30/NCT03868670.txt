      approach for utilizing the NeuroPace RNS® System for nucleus accumbens responsive
      neurostimulation (NAc- RNS) to ameliorate loss of control over (LOC) eating in persons with
      treatment-refractory obesity, specifically those who have failed gastric bypass surgery. The
      primary objectives are to assess the safety & feasibility & potential efficacy of the medical
      device named the NeuroPace RNS® System
