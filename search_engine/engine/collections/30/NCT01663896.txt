      produce high resolution, real-time images that are clearer and more quickly produced than
      those produced by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). OCT imaging is performed utilizing an
      imaging catheter with a single optical fiber core that both emits light and records its
      reflection while simultaneously rotating 360Â° during continuous pullback within the coronary
      artery. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is a pressure-derived, lesion-specific, physiological
      index determining the hemodynamic severity of intracoronary lesions. FFR is measured by
      placing a pressure guidewire across the lesion of interest and pharmacologically inducing
      hyperemia. The ratio of distal to proximal pressure allows the physician to physiologically
      determine if the narrowing is the cause of ischemia. the goal of this study is to define new
      parameters for stent optimization, benefitting from the unique Fourier-domain (FD-OCT)
      capabilities.

      This stage I study will identify the parameters which will be prospectively tested in a
      second stage II protocol.

      In hospital, 30 day, and 12 month outcomes data will be correlated with OCT baseline findings
      in order to identify optimal stent implant parameters.
