      patients with high risk hematologic malignancies in first remission or in second or
      subsequent remission, and adult patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute
      nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) in second or subsequent remission, who are undergoing high
      dose chemoradiotherapy followed by unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation. II.
      Determine the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in this setting. III. Determine whether
      contamination of umbilical cord blood with maternal cells is a clinical problem in this
      setting. IV. Describe the incidence of leukemic relapse in these patients after UCB
      transplantation. V. Describe the incidence of serious infections and secondary
      lymphoproliferative diseases following transplantation with UCB in these patients. VI.
      Determine specifically whether larger recipients (greater than 40 kg) can be durably
      engrafted with unrelated UCB, and determine whether nucleated cell or progenitor cell content
      of the graft is predictive of hematological engraftment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a back-up bone marrow harvest prior to treatment. Patients receive
      9 fractions of total body irradiation (TBI) on days -9 to -5, followed by melphalan IV on
      days -4 to -2 and antithymocyte globulin IV or methylprednisolone IV on days -3 to -1. If TBI
      is not allowed, busulfan is substituted and administered orally every 6 hours for 4 days on
      days -8 to -5. On day 0, patients receive umbilical cord blood infusion. Cyclosporine and
      methylprednisolone begin on day -2 and continue for 6 months. Patients are followed
      indefinitely for survival and late toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 48 patients will be accrued into this study within 4 years.
