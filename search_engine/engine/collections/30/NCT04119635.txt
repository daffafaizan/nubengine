    
      This study is cross-sectional and is carrying out between 1995 and 2017 in two French
      tertiary referral centers (Montpellier, Toulouse) and EPIMAD registry which is currently the
      largest Inflammatory Bowel Disease cohort in world and cover 9.6% of French population (Nord,
      Pas-de-Calais, Somme, and Seine-Maritime department).

      All patients diagnosed with CD who had underwent a B3 complication (intra-abdominal abscess,
      fistula, perforation, peritonitis, or phlegmon) before the age of 18. Patient having isolated
      perineal disease, indeterminate colitis or with too much missing data were excluded.

      The main endpoint: incidence of intestinal resection performed for B3 complication.

      The secondary endpoints:

        -  description of the pediatric population with B3 complication with:

        -  demographic data: sex, family history, phenotype of the disease according to the Paris
           classification, age at diagnosis of B3, period of diagnosis of B3 (before or after
           2001), time between the diagnosis of CD and the diagnosis of B3, a history of medical
           and surgical treatment for CD received before B3.

        -  clinical data: type of B3 complication, presence of stenosis and its location, clinical
           symptoms (fever, obstructive symptoms), nutritional status.

        -  description of the immediate management of these patients, specifying: the place of
           care, the type of immediate management performed, the drug treatments received in the
           acute phase, the medical treatments for CD introduced for the B3 episode, the intestinal
           resections performed for the B3 episode, the realization of a stoma, the radiological
           drainage of abscesses, the immediate complications of B3.

        -  description of the long-term evolution of these patients, specifying: the given drug
           treatments, the clinical recurrence of the CD, the recurrence of B3, the need for
           intestinal resection during follow-up, the occurrence of other events

        -  identification of risk factors for pejorative evolution defined by "recurrence of B3" or
           "intestinal resection" in these patients.
