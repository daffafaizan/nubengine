      cancer represents the second worldwide cause of cancer death after lung cancer. In patients
      with advanced disease, chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life. Combinations of
      two or three drugs including a platin derivative (cisplatin or oxaliplatin), a
      fluoropyrimidine (5FU or capecitabine) and an anthracycline (usually epirubicin) have
      demonstrated superiority compared to single or double agent therapy and are the current
      standard. As of today there are no published studies comparing anthracycline-based to
      taxane-based three-drug regimens. The objective of the present study is to compare EOX as
      evaluated in REAL-2 to the low-TOX regimen consisting of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine. Low-TOX is expected to be better tolerated than the original DCF regimen. The
      study will be performed in the HER2 negative patients.
