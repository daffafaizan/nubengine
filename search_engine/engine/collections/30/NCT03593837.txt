      clinical trial to determine whether HQGZWWT granules can relieve pain and protect joints.
      Investigators will randomly divide 120 patients with active arthritis for 3 months. Main
      measurements include ratio of 50 of ACR (American College of Rheumatology), change of DAS
      (28) from baseline to 3 months, and SHARP scores of van der Heijde from baseline to 12
      months. SecondarymeasurementsincludeACR20, ACR70, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability
      Index (HAQ-DI), arthritis pain score, and Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis. The time
      points are set as baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. In
      addition, the rate of change (score) in the ACR50 and DAS28 from the baseline to 2-week,
      1-month, 2-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up are also the secondary outcome measures.
