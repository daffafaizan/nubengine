      infection to AIDS. This phenomenon may be explained by a vicious cycle of malnutrition and
      infection. Here, the immune system needs energy and micronutrients to adequately respond to
      infection. Early interests in Arthrospira p. (Spirulina) were based on its high source of
      protein. Recently, it has drawn attention for its therapeutic effects including reduction of
      blood cholesterol, nephrotoxicity, anticancer properties, radiation protection, antiviral and
      antibacterial properties as well here improvement of the immune system.

      The aim of the three months Randomized, double blind and placebo Controlled Trial (RCT) is to
      investigate the effect of a daily supplementation with Spirulina for adult wife living with
      HIV/AIDS in Yaound√©. The trial will be experimental, prospective, and longitudinal on 70
      patients. The study consists of two periods of three months.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Spirulina on CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and
      the viral load during the RCT. The second objective is to confirm the effect of Spirulina on
      nutritional status markers: albumin, iron anemia, bioimpendenz, and BMI. The documentation of
      the nutritional marker will depict the restorative potential of Spirulina on patients with
      advanced HIV infection. Further data collected within a 24-hour recall will inform about the
      Individual Dietary Diversity Score. Explorative objective is the following of three disease
      outcomes of an HIV infection at four different time points, at t=0, 3, 6 months, and 1 month
      after the trial. The three explorative outcomes are the immune status with CD3+, CD8+, CD38+
      and IFN gamma, the oxidative status, and the patient's quality of life.

      This trial will end by August 2010.
