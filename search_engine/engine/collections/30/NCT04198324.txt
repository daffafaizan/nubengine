      incision of the uterus leads to isthmocele development. Long-term morbidities associated with
      isthmocele are uterine scar pregnancy, uterine perforation, pelvic pain, and spotting-style
      bleeding after menstruation. Many factors that may affect the healing of uterine scar have
      been studied in the literature (i.e. Double or single-layer closure, locked or unlocked
      closure, uterine retroflection). Suturing complete fold of the wound lips during the closure
      of the uterus may cause the endometrial layer to be embedded in the myometrium and to form
      niche tissue. The study hypothesized that isthmocele development can be reduced by suturing
      without enclosing the endometrium during uterine closure.
