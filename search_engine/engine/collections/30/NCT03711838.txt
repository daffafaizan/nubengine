      in the study. Then, participants will be allocated to either a 1) Low Respondents (LR) or a
      2) High Respondents (HR) group based on the basal satellite cells content of their vastus
      lateralis muscle of their dominant leg. In a double-blind, crossover, repeated measures
      design, participants will consume either Placebo (PLA) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) before
      (7-day loading phase), on exercise day and for 8 consecutive days following a single bout of
      intense exercise (300 eccentric contractions at 30 deg/sec in an isokinetic dynamometer). In
      both conditions, blood samples and muscle biopsies will be collected at baseline, before the
      exercise protocol and at 2- and 8-days post-exercise. Muscle performance and soreness will
      also be assessed at the same time points. Before the first trial, participants' dietary
      intake (via diet recalls) and physical activity (via accelerometry) will be analyzed and
      nutritional plans will be provided to participants in order to normalize their antioxidant
      and protein intake. A 4-week washout period will be implemented between trials. Blood samples
      will be analyzed for inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Muscle samples will be
      analyzed for satellite cells responses and myogenic potential, protein levels of
      intracellular signaling proteins, muscle thiols and antioxidant enzymes activity.
