      preventive treatment of contrast induced nephropathy.

      An acute kidney injury is generally detected too late to allow effective intervention in
      patients who undergo urgent/emergency coronary angiography.

      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a new biomarker predictive for AKI
      already shown to be useful for earlier diagnosis of contrast induced nephropathy.

      Purpose The primary objective of this study is to to test the hypothesis that a NGAL-driven
      early intensive strategy can reduce the occurrence of contrast induced nephropathy in
      patients with urgent/emergency coronary angiography
