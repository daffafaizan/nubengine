    
      Main objective / secondary:

      The investigators propose to conduct a study with a double objective:

        1. To assess the analytical performance and its positioning relative to all the tests
           available to us in urine samples,

        2. To evaluate prospectively the clinical impact test in urinary infections

      Expected results and prospects:

      This study will define the performance and limitations of this test in the most difficult
      situations (low number of bacteria / ml, haematic urine, ...) and will specify its
      indications and its place among all other tests before implanting it in our routine, as
      appropriate.

      The clinical impact study will provide medical and economic analysis data including
      shortening time to adapt antibiotic therapies and put in septic isolation to argue the
      implementation of this test routinely.
