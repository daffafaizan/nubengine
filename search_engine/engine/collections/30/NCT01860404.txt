      concussion in the United States.1 The Centers for Disease Control now estimates that 1.6 -
      3.8 million sports related concussions occur each year in the United States. A large
      proportion of these patients have enduring cognitive and neurobehavioral problems. Concussion
      is a heterogeneous insult to the brain that precipitates a complex pathophysiological process
      that can result in a cascade of deleterious side effects. At present, there are no proven
      therapies to mitigate or prevent the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral consequences of
      concussions. The limbic hippocampus, a brain structure crucial for learning and memory, is
      often damaged in concussion. In preclinical studies in our laboratory, analysis of
      ipsilateral hippocampi isolated from mice after traumatic brain injury (TBI) demonstrated
      that only the concentrations of the three BCAA's (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) were
      significantly altered (reduced) after injury. When these brain-injured animals received
      dietary supplementation with BCAA's, the concentrations of these amino acids were restored in
      the injured hippocampus and the injured animals demonstrated significant cognitive
      improvement to levels comparable to those obtained in non-injured control animals. In light
      of these results and the increasing awareness and morbidity associated with concussion, we
      are proposing a pilot therapeutic exploratory clinical trial to determine the effects of
      BCAA's in reducing the neurocognitive side effects of concussion injury.
