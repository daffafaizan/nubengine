      fourteen specimens from the Department of Human Anatomy. We correlated the areas with a low
      vascularity with the usual areas that patients have ulnar nonunion.

      In the clinical study we retrospectively reviewed a cohort of ulnar fractures treated
      surgically with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), during a period of 10 years
      (2007-2016). We identified 211 ulnar fractures. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 1
      year. We defined non-union if there was no radiological consolidation of the fracture after
      this period, and we classified them according to Weber classification. We assessed risk
      factors like: fracture site vascularity, surgical treatment technique, biological factors of
      the patient, and the fracture's mechanism. We correlated data and associated risk factors
      from the anatomical and the clinical studies.

      Data were analysed using SPSS software system version 21. Multivariate regression analysis
      was performed to assess independent risk factors of ulnar non-union. Chi square test or
      Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical measurements. Statistical significance was
      considered as p less than 0.05.
