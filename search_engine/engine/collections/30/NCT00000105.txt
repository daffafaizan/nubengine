      Arm A: Intracel KLH 1000 mcg (1 mg) without adjuvant, subcutaneous Tetanus Toxoid 0.5 ml
      intramuscularly (this arm closed 1/2/02).

      Arm B: Biosyn KLH 1000 mcg (1 mg) without adjuvant, subcutaneous tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml
      intramuscularly (this arm closed 3/18/03).

      Arm C: Biosyn KLH 1000 mcg (1 mg) with Montanide ISA51 (now replaced with vegetable (VG)
      source after 8/31/06 to increase product safety) subcutaneous Tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml
      intramuscularly (this arm open 3/18/03).

      Subjects ineligible for tetanus may still receive KLH on this protocol. This is especially
      true given the national shortage of tetanus vaccines. Subjects will be eligible for tetanus
      when it becomes available if there has been no significant change in treatment interventions
      or overall health status and it is within 3 months of the KLH vaccine.
