    
      Subjects that provide Informed Consent and satisfy the Eligibility Criteria will undergo CT
      or Ultrasound guided percutaneous placement of a single, two, three, or four Light Sources
      depending on their tumor characteristics. No more than four Light Sources will be used at a
      single treatment session. The Light Sources may be used in a single lesion or in multiple
      lesions. Depending on lesion size, one or more Light Sources may be used to treat a single
      lesion.

      Following ultrasound or CT confirmation of the Light Sources, patients will receive an
      intravenous dose of LS11 at 1 mg/kg. 15 minutes to 1 hour following completion of LS11
      administration, delivery of 200 J/cm light energy at 20 mW/cm will begin. Upon completion of
      light treatment, the Light Sources will then be manually removed and the patients will be
      observed for acute complications.

      Subjects will be evaluated for treatment-related adverse events at every scheduled clinical
      visit. Restaging by contrast enhanced spiral CT and tumor evaluation, using the RECIST
      criteria, are performed at Week 4 and Week 8.

      Subjects may receive a second Litx™ treatment at Week 4 or Week 8, as recommended by the
      study investigator. Subjects who receive the second Litx™ treatment will be evaluated for
      treatment-related adverse events at every scheduled clinical visit. Restaging by contrast
      enhanced spiral CT and tumor evaluation, using the RECIST criteria, are performed. The active
      phase of the protocol ends 8 weeks after the last treatment received.

      Following completion of the active phase of the protocol, subjects will be monitored for
      survival for one year (at 6, 9 and 12 month time points) from the date of study entry or
      until death, whichever occurs first.
