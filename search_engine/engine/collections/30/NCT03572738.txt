      daily lives can shed light on the ways in which HS causes quality of life impairment. In this
      study, the study team aims to identify the following: problems faced by patients with HS, the
      rate of depression, the rate of stigmatization, the rate of fear of being accepted in
      society, treatments that patients have tried (and which treatments seem to have worked best),
      the rate of alternative treatment use, and the correlation of these factors with the severity
      of disease.
