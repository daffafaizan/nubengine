    
      Study Phase I: Run-In-Phase Based on acceptable safety data for nintedanib monotherapy, a
      rapid dose finding will be conducted in a classical 3+3 design. Predefined dose levels are
      150 mg (dose level 1) and 200 mg (dose level 2) nintedanib, twice daily, with weekly
      paclitaxel 90 mg/m2.

      Study Phase II Patients with advanced (unresectable Stage III or IV) BRaf V600 wild type
      melanoma (n=120) will be randomized (1:1) to receive either Nintedanib (150 or 200 mg BID
      depending on results of phase I) in combination with paclitaxel or Placebo in combination
      with paclitaxel.

      Total study duration per patient: approximately 12 months of therapy + Follow up until end of
      study

      All patients enrolled in either phase I or phase II will be treated according to the
      following treatment plan:

      Week 1 - 24:

      Chemotherapy with paclitaxel combined with nintedanib/placebo

      Week 25 - 48:

      Extended monotherapy with nintedanib/placebo

      Week 52 (or approximately 4 weeks after last treatment dose):

      End of Treatment visit

      Follow up:

      After end of treatment the survival, disease status and further therapies of each patient
      will be assessed every 3 months until death, progression of disease or end of study whichever
      occurs first
