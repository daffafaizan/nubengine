      countries and is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Breast cancer is a
      disease that can develop and progress for various reasons. In addition to unchangeable
      factors such as increasing age and genotype, modifiable factors such as smoking, alcohol
      consumption, lack of physical activity, malnutrition, and obesity play a role in the
      pathogenesis of the disease.

      Breast cancer risk increases with increasing body mass index (BMI) in postmenopausal women.
      Chronic inflammation in obesity is associated with an increase in the release of
      proinflammatory factors (such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6). This situation; It is a risk factor for
      many types of cancer such as colon, stomach, breast and prostate carcinomas and supports a
      cause-effect relationship between obesity and cancer. These proinflammatory factors act as
      signal converters for tumor growth and progression. Obese women have elevated levels of TNF-α
      and IL-6 in the circulation, and this is associated with the development and progression of
      breast tumors.

      The Mediterranean Diet, which consists of high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids,
      fruits, vegetables and whole grains, has been widely evaluated and indicated as an important
      factor in preventing tumor formation from inflammatory pathways.

      Weight loss improves the antitumor immune system, lowers estrogen levels, reduces the risk of
      breast cancer and has been associated with better outcomes in obese patients. Lifestyle
      intervention studies strongly suggest that weight loss is possible and observational studies
      can actually improve breast cancer survival.In this regard, a healthy lifestyle and diet are
      the first steps to prevent breast cancer.
