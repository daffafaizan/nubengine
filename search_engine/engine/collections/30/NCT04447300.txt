      with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) [1]. However, the incidence of atrial fibrillation
      (AF) recurrence remains high [2], mostly due to pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection [1],
      emphasizing the formation of transmural lesions to achieve complete conduction block along
      the ablation lines [3].

      Previous studies have shown that elimination of the negative component of the unipolar
      electrogram (UP-EGM) during radiofrequency applications reflects transmural lesions. The
      persistence of such a negative component consistently corresponds to non-trans mural lesions
      [4].

      The high-power short duration (HPSD) RF application applies to all RF energies delivered at
      more than 40 W [5]. Higher the power more is the resistive heating causing wider tissue
      injury [5]. The lesion size with HPSD is larger in width but lesser in depth compared to
      lower powers with longer duration [5]. In contrast, RF applications of lower power and longer
      duration result in larger dissipation of RF energies deep into the tissues due to conductive
      heating causing tissue destruction at greater depths [6]. Hence, there is a risk of
      collateral tissue damage [5].

      HPSD ablation has been advocated as a means to minimize the risk of collateral organ damage
      as the lesions are smaller in depth. However, Maintaining a high power for a constant
      duration in the absence of a guide may not be the right strategy [5].

      Unipolar waveform modification by complete elimination of the negative component may serve as
      a guide for HPSD ablation [5].
