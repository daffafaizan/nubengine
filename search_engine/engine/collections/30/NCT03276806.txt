      hospitalization at an urban safety net hospital as an opportunity to connect high risk
      smokers to lung cancer screening and smoking cessation services. Building on the
      well-established inpatient tobacco dependence consult service at Boston Medical Center, the
      investigators will study the effect of adding a nurse-driven LDCT screening SDM intervention
      to inpatient smoking cessation counseling among screen-eligible hospitalized smokers.
      Hospitalization may be an ideal time-point for this intervention as it offers 1) a "teachable
      moment" for patients, when they may be particularly receptive to interventions to reduce
      smoking-related disease, and 2) an opportunity to offload busy PCPs of the obligation to
      conduct SDM for LDCT screening.

      In Aim 1, screen-eligible patients who are smokers will be randomized into one of the study
      arms (n=284, 142 per arm) to receive either inpatient 1) SDM (SDM by a thoracic oncology
      nurse using a decision aid) or 2) usual care and a LDCT informational brochure during
      inpatient smoking cessation consultation visits. In both arms the thoracic oncology nurse
      will counsel patients on smoking cessation. The investigators hypothesize that for
      screen-eligible smokers, inpatient SDM will increase (1) LDCT screening rates, (2) patient
      knowledge of LDCT screening, and (3) 1 month smoking quit rates compared to usual care.

      In Aim 2, the potential for future implementation of the intervention will be evaluated by
      incorporating stakeholder impressions of the intervention through qualitative interviews. By
      study end, an inpatient intervention will be created to promote both LDCT screening and
      smoking cessation among low income and minority smokers. This hybrid study will allow te
      investigators to establish not only the effectiveness of the intervention, but also help
      inform future implementation.
