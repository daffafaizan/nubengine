    
      This is a phase II single-center study of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in urothelial
      carcinoma patients who failed at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy and one line
      of immunotherapy of targeted therapy.

      Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation including imaging, blood and urine samples, EVG
      and physical examination to confirm suitability for the study.

      Eligible patients will undergo surgery to collect a tumor sample for TIL culturing.

      Patients will receive an autologus TIL infusion once the cells have been properly cultured.

      Following the infusion, patients will receive a high dose of IL-2.

      Following the intervention, patients will be monitored to evaluate study endpoints.
