      shoulder joint movement is added to hemiplegic shoulder pain in time. Therefore, adhesive
      capsulitis is one of the differential diagnoses that come to mind first in patients with
      hemiplegic shoulder pain and stiffness. Indeed, in arthrographic and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) studies, it has been reported that adhesive capsulitis (or more accurately,
      capsular changes), is quite frequent.

      Although a relationship has been reported between stroke and adhesive capsulitis, it is
      controversial whether the underlying cause of the capsular changes seen in hemiplegic
      shoulder pain is true adhesive capsulitis. Although these capsular changes and joint
      limitations in patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain may theoretically be related to
      idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, secondary causes including spasticity, contracture, fibrosis
      due to lack of movement, rotator cuff lesions, and glenohumeral subluxation have also been
      emphasized as a cause of the capsular restriction. Although there have been a limited number
      of studies, ultrasound, which has been reported as a sensitive and specific method in the
      diagnosis of true (idiopathic) adhesive capsulitis, has not yielded similar results to
      arthrography and MRI in demonstrating fibrotic and adhesive changes in the glenohumeral
      capsule in stroke patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain and stiffness. Because
      ultrasonographic examinations are mostly focused on rotator cuff tendons, bicipital tendon,
      and subacromial bursa, lack of detailed examination in terms of adhesive capsulitis may be
      one of the underlying reasons for this inconsistency. In this context, this study aims to
      investigate ultrasonographic structural changes that may be associated with adhesive
      capsulitis in subacute stroke patients with painful and stiff hemiplegic side shoulder.
