      measurement of the lateral rectus (LR) insertion distance, 2)to investigate the longitudinal
      change of LR muscle insertion after strabismus surgery, and 3)to determine the effect of
      insertion movement on the angle of deviation after strabismus surgery. An AS-OCT scan of the
      LR muscle was performed every visits. Preoperative limbus-LR insertion distance was compared
      with intraoperative surgical caliper measurement of LR insertion using intraclass correlation
      coefficient analysis (ICC). Data on gender, age, degree of deviation (prism diopter), and
      spur-LR insertion distance using AS-OCT were collected at postoperative months 1,3 6.
