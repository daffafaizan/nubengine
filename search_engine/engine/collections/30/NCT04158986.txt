      within 2 years of diagnosis. Grave complications result in functional impairment and reduced
      quality of life. 20-37 % of patients with liver cirrhosis are readmitted less than 30 days
      after a hospitalization for decompensation. These patients have a higher 90-day mortality
      rate than those who avoid readmission. Re-admissions have great personal-, societal- and
      economic consequences.

      In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of a nurse-driven post-discharge intervention
      for patients with liver cirrhosis, compared with standard follow-up will be investigated.

      The intervention, based on concepts from Family Nursing, will comprise three home-visits
      within eight weeks after discharge including therapeutic conversations focusing on
      strengthening participants' family relationships and social networks, disease education and
      help to initiate contact to municipal offers. After 12 weeks the participants will be
      followed-up by telephone.
