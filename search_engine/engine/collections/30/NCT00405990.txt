      Obstetric Unit (MOU). Community sensitization activities will be implemented in the catchment
      community to encourage male partner participation.

      At the booking visit all women will be offered antenatal care, HIV group education and VCT as
      usual. Thereafter women will be recruited to enrol into the study, after signing the consent
      form half of the cohort members will be randomly assigned to partner VCT (Group A) and half
      to partner pregnancy information (Group B). Men in group B will be offered VCT at the second
      interview late in pregnancy. However, VCT will be provided if requested by study participants
      at any stage of the study or if the female partner is HIV positive. Women in group A will be
      given a written invitation to hand to their partners to encourage them to invite their
      partners to come to the antenatal clinic for VCT. In group B, women will be given a written
      invitation to give to their partners to encourage their partners to attend a pregnancy
      information session at the antenatal clinic.

      VCT will be offered again close to delivery for all women and men who were previously
      uninfected or of unknown status. For those found to be HIV-infected at a prior visit, CD4 and
      CD8 T-cell counts, viral load, and full blood count tests will be conducted. Both women and
      men will be referred to the Antiretroviral clinic where ARV will be offered if appropriate
      and formula feeding (or exclusive breastfeeding) will be recommended. Reasons for declining
      VCT and data on sexual behaviour and violence will be sought at each visit.
