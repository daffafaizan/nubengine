      AAA Endograft is a safe and effective method of treating AAA's in those patients considered
      to be suitable candidates for open surgical repair. The safety of the Boston Scientific
      ENOVUS AAA Endograft will be determined by comparing the rate of major morbidity in the
      Treatment Group against the rate of major morbidity in the Control Group within 30 days of
      the initial procedure. The efficacy of the Boston Scientific ENOVUS AAA Endograft will be
      determined by evaluating the proportion of patients in the Treatment Group that are free from
      AAA rupture and conversion to open surgical repair within 1 year of the initial procedure.

      The secondary safety endpoints will be compared between the Treatment and Control
      Groups:Mortality rates at 30 days and 1 year, AAA related mortality at 30 days and 1 year.
      The secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated in the Treatment Group only and include:
      Technical success, enlargement of AAA, migration, significant endoleak, and loss of device
      integrity. Secondary Clinical Utility endpoints will be compared between the Treatment and
      Control groups and will include: blood loss, duration of procedure, ICU stay, length of
      hospital stay, and duration of anesthesia.
