      implants) participated in the experiment. After dental surgery, patients were prescribed a
      once-daily analgesic regimen for up to 7 days. The intervention consisted of label
      manipulation. Patients were randomly assigned to either the brand-name analgesic or to its
      (purportedly) cheaper generic version. In reality, all participants obtained the same
      brand-name medication. The medication was provided at no cost, and patients were instructed
      to take the first pill while at the clinic. They were informed that they could (a) increase
      the dosage of the prescribed analgesic to twice daily if necessary and (b) stop taking the
      medication when no longer needed. Any other changes to the regimen were discouraged, and
      patients were instructed to consult with the dentist before any such changes. Telephone
      follow-ups were conducted at 24 hours, 4 days, and 7 days after surgery. Two main dependent
      variables were obtained: the number of prescribed analgesics consumed and the number of
      non-prescribed analgesics consumed. The patients also reported the pain felt during the
      period.
