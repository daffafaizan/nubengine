      (RMST) induced changes in ventilatory function in healthy children. Children will undergo one
      session of pulmonary function and strength testing to quantify rate of inspiratory and
      expiratory pressure development and to determine whether inspiratory and expiratory pressure
      correlate to maximal respiratory pressures and forced pulmonary function tests. Currently
      normal pressure-flow-timing responses are not well-characterized in healthy children. The
      purpose of this study is to help develop more efficient RMST exercise prescriptions for ill
      children on ventilators and with neuromuscular weakness.

      Participants in the study will refrain from caffeine products and exercise on the day of
      respiratory testing. In conjunction with respiratory testing, baseline and exertional blood
      pressure, heart and respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry will be monitored. Participants will
      complete tidal flow-volume assessments and forced expiratory maneuvers according to the
      AMerican Thoracic Society guidelines. Participants will undergo 5 sets of 10 maximal-effort
      breaths against standardized resistances (one set each at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm H20).
      Following each set, subjects will rate the load magnitude and their feelings of breathing
      discomfort using a 0-10 visual analog scale. Participants will also perform maximal
      inspiratory and expiratory pressure maneuvers. All tests will be separated by at least 2-3
      minutes of rest.
