    
      This study aims to obtain safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data when
      HPN-01 is orally administered as single doses and as multiple doses to healthy subjects.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase (Part 1) and a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase (Part 2). One cohort of Part 1 will receive HPN-01 after
      a standard high fat/high calorie breakfast (the fed condition) to investigate the effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of HPN-01.
