    
      -  To compare performance data driving with the data self-assessed on the ability to drive,
           and the level of sleepiness and fatigue

        -  To measure the effects of distractive task on driving performance, consisting of a
           conversation with co-driver of the real or simulated vehicle (a series of difficult
           questions involving reflection)

        -  To validate the (known) effects of cannabis

        -  To adapt equipment and standardize methods for the pharmacological studies evaluating
           other types of substances having an impact on driving (antihistamines, antidepressants,
           antiparkinsonian ...) and other populations of subjects (men versus women, young versus
           elderly, healthy versus sick ...)

        -  To compare data obtained under conditions of simulated driving and actual driving
           situation, under identical experimental conditions (volunteers, narcotic substance,
           experimental) and measure the degree of ecological validity of the simulation of driving
