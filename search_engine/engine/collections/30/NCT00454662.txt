      because of their additive effects. Combination therapies of AT1 subtype angiotensin II
      receptor antagonist and calcium channel blocker or low dose diuretic have shown
      pharmacological benefit. However, reduction of cardiovascular events and safety profile of
      these combination therapies under same level of antihypertensive target have not been
      investigated yet.

      In this study, primary objective is to compare two combination therapies when
      antihypertensive target is 140/90mmHg in elderly hypertensive patients with high
      cardiovascular risk.

      Primary Outcomes: A composite of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events: Sudden death
      (death of endogenous origin within 24 hours after acute onset); Cerebrovascular events (new
      occurrence or recurrence of a cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid
      hemorrhage or transient ischemic attack); Coronary events (new occurrence or recurrence of a
      myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization[PCI or CABG], hospitalization for angina
      pectoris, hospitalization for heart failure); Renal dysfunction (doubling of serum creatinine
      and creatinine â‰¥2.0 mg/dl, end stage renal disease) Secondary Outcomes: All deaths; Death
      from cardiovascular events; Effects on glucose metabolism(fasting plasma glucose,
      postprandial glucose, new onset of diabetes mellitus); Incidence of primary outcomes events;
      New occurrence of atrial fibrillation; Safety; Proportion of the subjects who withdrew from
      the allocated treatment
