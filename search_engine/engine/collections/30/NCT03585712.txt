    
      This study is an exploratory, prospective, multi-center, randomized, cross-over study to
      assess the effect of norgestrel 75 mcg on cervical mucus and ovarian activity during reported
      perfect daily use, after a delayed intake of 6 hours and after a missed pill.

      After a screening period up to one month, depending on the menstrual cycle of the subject,
      the subjects will take norgestrel 75 mcg for three 28-day treatment periods, every day at the
      same time except for one day in the middle of treatment period 2 and treatment period 3 where
      they will either take it 6 hours late or not take it.

      They will be randomized to 2 sequences, either 6 hours delayed intake in treatment period 2
      and missed pill in treatment period 3 or the opposite.

      After the end of treatment period 3, a follow-up up to 12 days may be required to follow
      ovarian activities.

      Subjects will have visits twice a week and sometimes more often to assess the effects of the
      pill on:

        -  cervical mucus properties by a cervical mucus sampling

        -  ovarian activity by a vaginal ultrasound (TVUS)

        -  reproductive hormones levels by a blood sample (Progesterone (P4), Estradiol (E2),
           Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH))

        -  plasma drug level by a blood sample
