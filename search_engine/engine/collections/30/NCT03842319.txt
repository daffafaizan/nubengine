      efforts are needed to improve secondary prevention and understand the mechanism underlying
      disease progression. Based on primary prevention trials, a potential benefit of the
      Mediterranean diet after an acute coronary syndrome can be anticipated. The integrated
      microbiome-mediated/ immunologic and metabolic pathways by which the Mediterranean diet
      modifies cardiovascular risk remain mostly unknown. Intestinal and oral dysbiosis is involved
      in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and microbiome dynamics may account for some of the
      observed benefits of Mediterranean diet. The first objective of the trial is to evaluate the
      effects of a well-controlled Mediterranean diet intervention on atherosclerotic plaque
      vulnerability and coronary endothelial dysfunction after an episode of acute coronary
      syndrome. The second objective is to decipher the interplays among diet, microbiota, immunity
      and metabolism responsible for the observed effects. The investigators propose a randomized
      mechanistic clinical trial, using state-of-the-art efficacy read-outs. The multidisciplinary
      consortium includes highly experienced cardiologists, nutritionists and experts in
      translational research in immunology, microbiomics, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and
      metagenomics. This study will provide valuable insights to identify potential microbiome
      therapeutic targets for coronary artery disease.
