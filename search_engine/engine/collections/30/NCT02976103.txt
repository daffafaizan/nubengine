      post-mastectomy with pockets that hold post-surgical drains. The Jacki was invented by a
      cancer survivor who leads A Little Easier RecoveryÂ®, a non-profit organization in
      Massachusetts, and may help participants manage the pain of post-surgical drains to increase
      comfort and ease of daily living. The jacket has not previously been tested in a research
      study. The investigators are hoping to learn whether the jacket is effective in reducing pain
      and discomfort from the time participants leave the hospital until they return to have their
      drains removed.
