    
      This trial is an open-label, randomised, multicentric, comparative, Phase II study aiming to
      evaluate the clinical benefit of a combined treatment associating radiotherapy + Nivolumab +
      Ipilimumab versus radiotherapy + Capecitabine (standard treatment) in early TNBC patients who
      have Residual cancer burden (RCB) II or III residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Following validation of eligibility criteria, patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive:

        -  Arm A: Nivolumab (360 mg IV, every 3 weeks) for 8 doses and Ipilimumab (1 mg/kg, IV,
           every 6 weeks or every 2 doses of Nivolumab in case of dose delays) for 4 doses.

        -  Arm B: Capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice a day, Bis In Die [BID]), 14 days on / 7 days off
           for 8 cycles.

      In both arms, radiotherapy will be administered as per standard practice and has to be
      initiated one week before C1D1.
