    
      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effect of alkali administration on bicarbonate and potassium levels in patients
      with SCD and depressed serum bicarbonate levels.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the effect of alkali administration on improvement in hemolysis and on sequelae of
      impaired kidney function, ie, LDH, Hgb, reticulocyte count, red cell half-life, and muscle
      strength, Vitamin D levels, and markers of bone turnover, respectively.

      To assess the influence of alkali administrations on markers of kidney tubule inflammation.

      To evaluate intraparenchymal iron in patients with SCD and renal dysfunction. Safety and
      adverse events of alkali patients with sickle cell disease will be monitored. This research
      will supplement current knowledge about management of the clinically important subset of
      people with SCD who have renal insufficiency and acid-base perturbation.
