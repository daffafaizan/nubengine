      Cardiovascular Rehabilitation and Exercise Physiology of the Heart Institute (InCor). The aim
      of this study is to assess the effects of exercise training on sympathetic modulation and
      arterial baroreflex control in patients with chronic heart failure. The investigators studied
      twenty-six chronic heart failure outpatients, age 30 to 70 years, functional class II to III
      of New York Heart Association, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40% and peak oxygen
      uptake (VO2) ≤20. The exclusion criteria were recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina
      (<3 months), heart failure duration (<3 months), permanent pacemaker dependence, atrial
      fibrillation, skeletal muscle abnormality (e.g., arthritis) and participation in a regular
      exercise program. They were assigned to 2 groups: Untrained (n=13) and trained (n=13).
