        -  Determine if the addition of low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) to involved-field
           radiotherapy improves the disease-free survival of patients with previously untreated,
           stage I or II low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the response of patients treated with low-dose TBI.

        -  Compare the overall survival and quality of life of patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, stage (I vs II), performance status (0-1 vs 2), lactate dehydrogenase
      elevation (yes vs no), histological subtype (small lymphocytic lymphoma vs lymphoplasmacytoid
      lymphoma vs follicular lymphoma), and, for stage I patients, presence of measurable mass (yes
      vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo involved-field radiotherapy daily five days a week for 2.5-4
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) daily 5 days a week on
           weeks 1 and 4. At 4 weeks after completion of TBI, patients undergo involved-field
           radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, at 4 weeks after completion of involved-field
      radiotherapy, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 344 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.
