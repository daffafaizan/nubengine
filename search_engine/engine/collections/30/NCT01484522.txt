      The FDA has currently approved several Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccines to be used in
      children and adults. However, little data is available in perinatally infected youth.
      Therefore, knowledge of the immunogenicity of several of the licensed Influenza A 2009
      monovalent vaccines in HIV-infected children and youth is critically important to address the
      health care needs of this vulnerable population. Efforts are currently underway to evaluate
      Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccines in healthy children as well as other populations. This
      study will assess the immune response following receipt of three Influenza A monovalent
      vaccines in HIV-1 infected children and youth. Protection of HIV-1 infected children and
      youth from 2009 H1N1 Influenza A will require knowledge of immunogenicity of these new
      products in this population. The 2009 (H1N1) Influenza A virus is likely to infect a
      significant proportion of HIV-1 infected children and youth. Immunogenicity of licensed and
      commercially available Influenza A 2009 monovalent vaccines must be established in HIV-1
      infected children in order to assure that this population is protected. Lack of a protective
      immune response would support the need for additional measures to protect this high risk
      population.
