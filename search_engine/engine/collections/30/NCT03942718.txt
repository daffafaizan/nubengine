      in subjects with SLE in comparison to treatment-as-usual therapy. Several previous studies
      showed that exercise leads to various benefits in treating SLE, including enhanced aerobic
      capacity, reduced symptoms of depression and fatigue. Moreover, it has been shown that
      exercise is well tolerated and does not impair disease activity in SLE negatively. Here, the
      effects of an individual internet-based exercise therapy for 12 weeks will be evaluated.
