      in adenoid cystic carcinomas could be achieved by highly conformal radiotherapy techniques
      and particle (neutron/ carbon ion) therapy. Considering high doses are needed to achieve
      local control, all malignant salivary gland tumours probably profit from the use of particle
      therapy, which in case of carbon ion treatment, has been shown to be accompanied by only mild
      side-effects.

      Methods/ design:

      The COSMIC trial is a prospective, mono-centric, phase II trial evaluating toxicity in the
      combined treatment with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and carbon ion (C12)
      boost in 54 patients with histologically proved (≥R1-resected, inoperable or Pn+) salivary
      gland malignancies. Patients receive 24 GyE carbon ions (8 fractions) and IMRT (2.0 Gy/
      fraction).

      Study objectives:

      Incidence of mucositis ≥ CTC°3 will be assessed as the primary endpoint of the trial, local
      control, disease-free survival, toxicity (incl. mucositis CTC °I-II and late toxicity at 3
      years post RT)
