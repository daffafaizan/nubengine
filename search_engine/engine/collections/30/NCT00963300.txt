        -  To characterize the status of global hypoxia within the prostate before stereotactic
           body radiotherapy (SBRT) as assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent and
           tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI.

        -  To characterize tumor vasculature and metabolism within the prostate before SBRT as
           assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging,
           respectively.

        -  Correlate prostate and normal tissue hypoxia before SBRT with clinical outcomes
           (toxicity and biochemical [PSA] control) after SBRT.

      OUTLINE: Within 1-3 weeks before beginning stereotactic body radiotherapy, patients undergo
      T2-weighted anatomic MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging,
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent and tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI, and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI.
