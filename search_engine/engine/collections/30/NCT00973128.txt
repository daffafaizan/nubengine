      from the cases presenting to the health post. The inclusion criteria were: age between 15 and
      50 years, of either sex, diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis of less than 60 days. The
      diagnostic criteria were the presence of a typical single cutaneous ulcer, localized on lower
      limbs, and a positive delayed type hypersensitivity test (DTH or Montenegro skin test) to
      Leishmania antigen.
