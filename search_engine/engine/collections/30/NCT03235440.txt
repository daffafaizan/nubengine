      obesogenic environment, often with little support in the home, school, or medical environment
      to make healthy choices. Obesity is increasingly common in underserved communities that lack
      access and resources for physical activity and healthy eating. Louisiana is a prime example
      of the need for effective obesity treatment, ranking 1st nationally for adult obesity and 4th
      for adolescent obesity with the highest obesity prevalence among African American
      adolescents. We urgently need evidence-based programs to help children and families change
      lifestyle behaviors, achieve clinically significant weight loss, and thereby reduce the
      prevalence of pediatric obesity.

      The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force identifies behavioral treatment including dietary,
      physical activity, and behavioral counseling components as a viable option for pediatric
      obesity treatment, yet a key challenge is how to implement these programs to maximize access
      and participation. Summer (between school years) represents an opportunity for intensive
      intervention to change health behaviors and help children to lose weight. During the summer
      months, children gain weight at a more rapid pace and spend more time engaged in sedentary
      behavior compared to the school year.

      The American Diabetes Association launched Camp Power Up as a summer week-long day camp for
      youth who are obese and/or at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The camp will focus
      on wellness education, nutrition, physical activity, and obesity prevention. The purpose of
      the proposed study is to examine effects of Camp Power Up on children's weight status and
      their psycho-social health.
