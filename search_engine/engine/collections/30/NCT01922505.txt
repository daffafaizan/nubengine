      and clarithromycin) is currently considered the gold standard therapy for eradication of H.
      pylori. However, recently the eradication rate with first-line treatment has a tendency to
      decrease because of increasing antibiotics resistance. In addition, PPI is mainly metabolized
      by cytochrome p450 2C19 (CYP2C19) in the liver and several reports have suggested that
      differences in th CYP2C19 genotype are associated with H. pylori eradication failure. Thus,
      the first aim of this study is to investigate the trend of eradication rates of first-line
      triple therapy in recent ten years. And the second aim is to analyze the antibiotics
      resistance rate for H. pylori by using culture minimal inhibitory concentrations(MICs) result
      and to analyze the association between CYP2C19 genotype and eradication rate of H.pylori. And
      also investigate the other clinical factors (age, gender, underlying disease, cigarette
      smoking and alcohol use) that affect the eradication rate.
