      characterized by an abnormal hemoglobin S, which polymerizes when deoxygenated leading to red
      cell rigidity and microvascular flow obstruction. Recurrent episodes of ischemia and a
      chronic inflammatory state lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury in multiple vital organ
      systems. Endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in patients with sickle cell disease
      and new therapies are targeted specifically towards the endothelium. Contrast ultrasound is a
      non-invasive technique that has been used to assess microvascular flow in coronary artery
      disease, diabetes, and other disease states. We propose to use this technique in sickle cell
      patients to compare their myocardial and skeletal muscle flow with that of normal controls,
      to detect changes during pain crisis, and to compare flow abnormalities with cardiac
      functional abnormalities.
