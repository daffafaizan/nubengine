      varying degrees between 13-64%, depending upon which definition one uses. The "downstream"
      control of the pancreatic duct with the help of a transpapillary stent might minimize the
      risk for leakage over the transected pancreas surface.

      Trial evaluation will be A. The pancreatic bed was drained and postoperatively the fluid was
      continuously collected and daily analysed for pancreatic amylase and bilirubin. Daily
      measurement of pancreatic enzyme content in the drain fluid, at least for 5 post operative
      days or as long as the patient retains the drain. X-Amylase and X-Protein as long as the
      patient has the external drain.

      B. Co-variables measured in the form of: operation time, complications in relation to
      diagnosis, duration of hospitalization. Patients receiving a pancreas stent are followed in
      order to evaluate the natural course of the pancreas stent.
