      fluid, blood, and blood degradation matter between the arachnoid and dura mater in a
      well-developed membrane cavity. The presentation of this disease begins with minor head
      trauma and takes 4-7 weeks to become symptomatic.

      One of the significant problems exists with CSDH is the rate of recurrence, which currently
      stands at a 7-30% rate worldwide. The recurrence of a CSDH is typically defined as the
      presence of residual or recurrent CSDH after the first resolution, leading to additional
      surgical intervention either within 3 months (early recurrence) or after 3 months (late
      recurrence). Additional surgical intervention (recurrence rate) is the outcome variable that
      our study will be looking at. Factors leading to persistent recurrence include age, use of
      anticoagulant therapy, volume of hematoma cavity, degree of midline shift on CT, presence of
      residual air post-operatively, and volume of residual hematoma fluid. The variability in
      surgeons' operative and post-operative care, which tries to address the multiple factors that
      lead to recurrence, illustrates the difficulty in trying to reduce postoperative recurrence.
      In fact, there is no postoperative standard of care. These variations in operative and
      postoperative care have yet to significantly decrease the recurrent rate of CSDH.

      Given the health status and fragility of the patient population that is most commonly
      affected by CSDHs, and the inherent morbidity related to operating on this population, we
      hypothesize that D5 1/4NS can help mitigate the issue of residual/recurrence CSDH leading to
      subsequent surgeries. The fluid dynamics of D5 1/4NS have been studied and we can assume that
      it will facilitate brain re-expansion.
