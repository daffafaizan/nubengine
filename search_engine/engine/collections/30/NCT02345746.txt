      with liver-only or liver-predominant metastases who have failed at least one line of systemic
      chemotherapy. We hypothesize that combination therapy will be able to convert some patients
      to surgical resection candidates, or/and to overcome chemo-resistance of liver metastases to
      systemic i.v. chemotherapy for some clinically fit, heavily pre-treated patients
