      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including delineation of effector and regulatory T cells,
      before and after one cycle of pembrolizumab treatment. Other correlative secondary objectives
      include investigation of associations among pre-treatment TIL numbers, clonality of TILs and
      change in number and phenotype of TILs with samples collected after pembrolizumab treatment
      between MSI and DNA polymerase (POLE) ultramutated ECs versus MSI low/stable ECs versus copy
      number high (CNH) ECs, among others. To assess the complex interplay between obesity,
      molecular subtype, the microbiome and immune regulation, gut, vaginal and uterine microbiota
      profiles will be characterized and potential associations with body mass index (BMI),
      pre-treatment TIL numbers, clonality of TILs and change in the number and phenotype of TILs
      will be investigated. Secondary clinical objectives include (1) of the pathologic response
      rate after one cycle of pembrolizumab following hysterectomy and surgical staging in stage
      I/II, serous/clear cell EC and stage III, G3 (serous, clear cell or endometrioid histologies)
      EC and (2) characterization of the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab pre-hysterectomy and in
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as adjuvant therapy for EC.
