        -  Compare the clinical response, distant metastases, disease-free survival, and overall
           survival in patients with previously untreated, locally advanced, nonmetastatic
           nasopharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy alone vs concurrent chemoradiotherapy
           followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      Patients are randomized to receive radiotherapy alone (arm I) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (arm II).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy once daily 5 times a week for 7 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6-8 hours for 4 consecutive days every 3
           weeks for 3 courses. Concurrent radiotherapy is given once daily 5 times a week over the
           7 week treatment period. This chemoradiotherapy is followed 3 weeks later by adjuvant
           chemotherapy. Patients receive cisplatin IV and fluorouracil IV over 6-8 hours for 4
           consecutive days every 4 weeks for 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for the first year, every 6 months for the next 2 years,
      and then annually thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
