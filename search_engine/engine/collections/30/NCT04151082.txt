      I. To establish feasibility and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of steroid therapy that provides
      symptomatic improvement in oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) survivors with late lower cranial
      neuropathy (LCNP).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To examine endpoints that may be sensitive to functional or symptomatic gains with steroid
      therapy for late LCNP in OPC survivors by characterizing changes in symptoms, functional
      status, quality of life (QOL), neurophysiology, and imaging studies after steroid therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish a hypothesis-generating database of physiologic, functional, and
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors with late lower
      cranial neuropathy treated with steroid therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of steroid therapy followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive prednisone orally (PO) (or by feeding tube) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and
      then taper off over 2 weeks or methylprednisolone intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
