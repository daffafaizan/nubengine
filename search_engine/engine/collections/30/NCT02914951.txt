      communication, and repetitive behaviors. In addition to the core symptoms, 50 to 70 percent
      of children with ASD often exhibit disruptive behavior problems including irritability,
      tantrums, noncompliance, aggression and self-injury.

      In this open pilot study expands clinical research on CBT for irritability to children with
      autism and mild cognitive impairment. CBT consists of individual weekly sessions dedicated to
      teaching children to recognize situations that may lead to frustration and to build coping
      skills for dealing with frustration in socially appropriate ways. Recent research as well as
      clinical reports suggest that children with mild intellectual disabilities (IQ between 55 and
      85) can also benefit from CBT. The intervention is modified to reduce complexity of
      activities during therapy sessions but retains key elements and principles of CBT. Thus, the
      modified version of CBT is referred to as "Principles-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy for
      Irritability in Autism" or PB-CBT for short. Subjects in this study will receive a
      comprehensive evaluation of ASD and associated psychopathology. Irritability and related
      disruptive behaviors will be rated on weekly basis to utilize a single-subject approach to
      data analysis. Children will be asked to participate in functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) with tasks of social perception and emotion regulation before and after CBT. The
      purpose of the fMRI portion of the study is to evaluate feasibility of fMRI as an outcome
      measure in studies of behavioral interventions for children with ASD and intellectual
      disability.
