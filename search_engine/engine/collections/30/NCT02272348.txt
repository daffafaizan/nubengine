    
      170 patients with type 1 diabetes, volunteering for education to functional insulin therapy,
      will be recruited by the Department od Endocrinology, Diabetes, Nutrition of Montpellier
      University Hospital.

      After inclusion, the patients will be randomized in 2 groups: group 1 will be immediately
      trained to functional insulin therapy and group 2 will be trained at the end of the study.
      The patients will be met as outpatients 3 months after inclusion. The primary endpoint will
      be the global score for CIDS questionnaire.

      Secondary endpoints will include: HbA1c level at month 3, frequency of hypoglycemia from
      inclusion to month 3, scores for each of the 20 items of CIDS questionnaire.

      An ancillary study will assess: the acceptability of the new EAD questionnaire which
      specifically evaluates the self-management of diabetes, the concordance validity of EAD and
      CDIS questionnaires, the reproducibility test-retest, the internal consistency and the
      sensitivity to change of EAD questionnaire.
