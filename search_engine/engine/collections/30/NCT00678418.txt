    
      Part A was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy and
      safety of 24 weeks of monthly treatment with VIVITROL compared to placebo in opioid-dependent
      adults.

      Subjects who completed Part A could choose to continue to Part B, which was an open-label
      extension to assess longer-term safety, durability of effect, health economics, and quality
      of life (QOL) in the continuing study population for up to 1 year.

      At the conclusion of both parts, each completing subject will have received a total of up to
      19 injections of study drug over approximately 1.5 years.

      Dosing was performed by the principal investigator or designated study staff member.

      All subjects received standardized, manual-based psychosocial support at each scheduled
      visit. Opioid use was tracked through urine drug testing and subjects' self reports. Other
      evaluations for efficacy and safety, health economics, and quality of life were routinely
      conducted throughout the study.
