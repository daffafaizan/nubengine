      with metastatic breast cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer with palliative intent. Active
      substance of the product, which is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for
      intramuscular administration, is a complex between cis-diammineplatinum(II) derived core and
      an amphiphilic polymer, containing a composition of benzene polycarboxylic acids. The
      amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear and
      significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g.
      cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment in
      metastatic cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;

        -  can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      BP-C2 is a novel lignin-derived polyphenolic composition with ammonium molybdate. BP-C2,
      given orally, is believed to reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents.

      This is a single center, two arm, open label pilot study (phase IIa). The eligible patients
      will be allocated either to BP-C1 arm or to BP-C1+BP-C2 arm and treated for 32 days with
      further follow-up for 28 days.
