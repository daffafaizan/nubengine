      Pain.

      100 patients [Age group 25-45 yrs] who were diagnosed with neck pain, with onset Ëƒ1-3 months
      (chronic) were randomly assigned to group A receiving conventional Physiotherapy plus SNAGs
      and group B receiving conventional Physiotherapy plus ultrasound.

      Subjects in-group A that received conventional Physiotherapy plus SNAGs showed greater
      Improvement in pain and range of motion compared with the conventional Physiotherapy plus
      ultrasound group on 2nd week compared with pretreatment.

      The result of study suggests that both SNAGs and Ultrasound groups improves the symptoms of
      neck pain. Ultrasound group improved the pain symptoms but was too small to reach
      satisfactory outcome for patients. Based on these results conventional Physiotherapy plus
      SNAGs should be the treatment of choice for neck pain rather than conventional Physiotherapy
      plus Ultrasound .
