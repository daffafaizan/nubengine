      production of collagen, the quality, and quantity of the connective tissue. The etiology and
      pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis are mostly revealed however, there are many dark points
      in the etiopathogenesis of aggressive periodontitis. The existence of periodontal destruction
      at even one tooth in the mouth increases the risk of further periodontal destruction.
      However, the incidence of progression of the disease to the unaffected teeth was not
      demonstrated. Yet, the progression of the disease from diseased sites to healthy sites is
      likely to occur but no evidence is present comparing healthy and diseased sites of chronic
      and aggressive periodontitis. Present study aimed to evaluate the histological changes in
      both diseased and healthy sites in both localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) and chronic
      periodontitis (CP) patients by determining fibroblast and inflammatory cell counts in
      histologic slides and immunohistochemical staining of enzymes and hypoxia markers in order to
      better understand the dimensions of this demolition in periodontal disease.
