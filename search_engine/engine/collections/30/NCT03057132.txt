      management of skin around an ostomy, drain and/or fistula. All subjects will receive the
      product for up to 14 days. The primary site must have red skin with breakdown (i.e. skin
      erosion and denudation or denudation of skin alone). Secondary sites can have red skin with
      or without breakdown. Product will be applied twice/week or more frequently if additional
      applications are needed due to leakage, skin irritation or standard of care. Skin assessments
      (including photography) will be completed at baseline and at all follow-up visits.
