      I. Determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory, diffuse or
      mediastinal, large B-cell lymphoma treated with sunitinib malate.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the effects of this
      drug on peripheral blood biomarkers, circulating endothelial cells, and their precursors in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
