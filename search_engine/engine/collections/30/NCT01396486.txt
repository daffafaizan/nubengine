      evaluate effectiveness and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids and inositol used alone and in
      combination. The investigators plan to decrease the variability in the population under study
      by limiting the age range to 5-12 years and excluding cases with significant, untreated,
      comorbidity. The cognitive effects/side effects with a neuropsychological battery pre and
      post treatment will be measured. Subjects with a history of failing treatment with two or
      more conventional treatments will be excluded.

      This will be a 12-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial study to compare efficacy and
      tolerability of the natural treatments omega-3 fatty acids and inositol used in combination
      in the treatment of bipolar spectrum disorders in children and adolescents (ages 5-12).
      Subjects will be randomized in double blind fashion to one of three arms: omega-3 fatty
      acids, inositol or the combined treatment. Further, the proposed study will include measures
      of cognition prior to starting study medication and at endpoint. The investigators will
      minimize the variability of the population under study by limiting the age range to 5-12
      years, minimizing untreated or clinically significant comorbidity and excluding subjects who
      have already failed treatment with 2 or more anti-manic agents. Subjects will include youth
      ages 5-12 years with a bipolar spectrum disorder (type I, II, or NOS), mixed, manic, or
      hypomanic state, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) (DSM-IV), randomized to 3 treatment
      arms: 1) treatment with omega-3 fatty acids (N=20); 2) treatment with inositol (N=20); 3)
      treatment with the combination of inositol and omega-3 fatty acids (N=20).
