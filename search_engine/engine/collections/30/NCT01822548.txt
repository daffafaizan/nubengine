      is therefore crucial that blood glucose lowering drugs reveal a favorable cardiovascular risk
      profile independently of metabolic control.

      EPCs are a subset of circulating mononuclear cells derived from the bone marrow. EPCs play a
      fundamental role in the formation of new blood vessels (neo-endothelization) and repairing of
      existing blood vessels (re-endothelization) in order to maintain endothelial homeostasis and
      integrity. Endothelial damage and tissue ischemia, through the release of growth factors and
      cytokines, represent a strong stimulus for the mobilization of EPCs from the bone marrow.
      Reduced EPC number has been related to the presence of traditional risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease and to the development of atherosclerosis and has been shown to
      predict cardiovascular (CV)risk. Type 2 diabetes is known to be associated with an increased
      CV risk and a reduced EPC number. Recent data suggest that DPP-IV inhibitors might be
      involved in the mechanisms promoting bone-marrow EPC mobilization. This putative ancillary
      effect of DPP-IV might have a favorable impact on type 2 diabetes, a condition characterized
      by an increased CV risk.

      This is a randomized, open-label, active-treatment-controlled, two parallel arm (2:1),
      intervention trial comparing DPP-IV inhibitor Vildagliptin (100 mg daily) with Glibenclamide
      (maximum daily dose of 10 mg). Treatment allocation and titration regimens are not blinded.

      Primary end-point:Absolute change in the EPC number at visit: V0 (randomization), V2 (month
      4), V3 (month 8) and V4 (month 12).

      Secondary end-point: Absolute change in HbA1C compared to baseline.
