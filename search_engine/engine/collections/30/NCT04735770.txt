      efficacy and safety of LTAP with local wound analgesia in laparoscopic endometriosis surgery.
      Patients are randomized to receive LTAP with levobupivacain and wound infiltration with
      placebo or wound infiltration with levobupivacain and LTAP with placebo. The primary outcome
      is postoperative opioid consumption measured by Patient Controlled Analgesia -pump (PCA).
      Secondly, subjective postoperative pain up to 24 h postoperatively will be measured by
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Additional outcome measures are factors related to recovery and
      length of stay in the hospital as well as a 6 month follow-up survey regarding pain and
      general wellbeing after surgery. A total of 46 patients will be randomized in a proportion of
      1:1.
