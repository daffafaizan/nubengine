      consecutive critically ill septic adults admitted to the intensive care unit. Clinical and
      laboratory data including chemiluminescence immunoassay for antiphospholipid antibodies
      [anticardiolipin (aCL), antiphosphatidylserine (aPS)] were obtained. Blood samples were
      collected on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 of hospitalization. The primary study endpoint was ICU
      mortality defined as death before ICU discharge. Secondary end points included correlation
      between SOFA score and biological parameters.
