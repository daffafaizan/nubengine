      in combination with conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Bevacizumab,
      a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been shown
      to stop the growth of new blood vessels of tumors, both in the laboratory and in patients
      with other types of cancers. Bevacizumab has improved the effect of chemotherapy in adult
      patients with different types of cancer by increasing tumor response and increasing the
      chances of survival. This study has two main goals:

        -  To find out if bevacizumab can be combined safely with chemotherapy for osteosarcoma

        -  To find out if adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy will be beneficial in treating
           osteosarcoma.

      The chemotherapy drugs used in this study are commonly used to treat osteosarcoma. Patients
      with non-metastatic and resectable tumors receive bevacizumab and chemotherapy comprised of
      cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate. Patients with metastatic tumors or tumors
      that cannot be removed by surgery receive bevacizumab and chemotherapy comprised of
      cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide and etoposide. If the tumor can
      be removed by surgery, surgery will be performed after 10 weeks of chemotherapy and will be
      followed by additional chemotherapy. After completion of active therapy, patient's response
      to therapy will be followed for approximately 5 years.
