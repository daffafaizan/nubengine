      laterotrusion and maximum protrusion will be recorded by digital caliber. The overbite and
      the overjet, length of upper lip and lower facial third will be measured. The symmetry of the
      upper lip in a forced smile will be determined. The measurements made at T0 will be repeated
      at T1 (2 weeks after surgery), T2 (5 weeks after surgery), T3 (9 weeks after surgery), T4 (12
      weeks after surgery), T5 (24 weeks after surgery) and T6 (after orthodontic removal).The
      level of pain during the measurements of the mandibular movements will be recorded in the
      Visual Analogue Scale, and the self-reported area of the orofacial sensory alterations by
      means of a diagram and the objective area by means of the sensory discrimination test of two
      points will be determined. In T4, the impact of the status of the function and oral
      structures on daily activities will be recorded through a self-pass questionnaire based on
      the Oral Index Daily Performance questionnaire (OIDP-sp). In the T6 the measurement of
      laterotrusion, protrusion and retrusion movements measured by Gysi Gothic arch will be
      performed.
