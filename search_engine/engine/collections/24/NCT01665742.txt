      and insulin resistance. Mechanistic data indicates inflamed adipose tissue with increased
      infiltration of immune cells that generate pro-inflammatory cytokines. With childhood obesity
      in Ireland increasing at a rapid pace, it is important to establish the role of a
      non-pharmacological dietary approach to decreasing the sub-acute chronic inflammation seen in
      overweight and obese children. Several foods contain nutrients that are known to have
      anti-inflammatory properties. Such foods including fish, fruits and vegetables are known to
      be deplete in the adolescent diet. The aim of this project is to investigate whether a
      nutritional supplement containing anti-inflammatory nutrients, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (found in fish oil), vitamin C, vitamin E, and polyphenols found in green tea and
      tomato; will improve metabolic phenotype in 13-18 year old teenagers over an 8-week period.
      Further, to provide insight into the role of genetics in the development of metabolic
      dysregulation and response to dietary treatment.
