      hydroxychloroquine is currently used in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the meantime,
      the efficacy as well as the dosage of hydroxychloroquine is highly debated. Because of the
      severity of COVID-19 and the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus
      erythematosus patients, a loading dose was rapidly included in the new hospital regimens to
      optimize drug distribution in tissues and more precisely in the lungs. Due to the lack of
      information on the plasma/blood concentrations required to induce a virological/clinical
      effect, plasma/blood concentration is monitored in many European countries for patients
      whether or not they are included in clinical research protocols. This problem of relationship
      between efficacy and exposure is important in the critically ill patient because both the
      bioavailability and the variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters are potentially
      responsible for variations in concentrations.

      This study is a prospective, observational, open, multisite, pharmacokinetics study of
      hydroxychloroquine in critically ill patients. There is no supplemental intervention or
      additional samples compared to the standard care of these patients in our teaching hospital.
      The total duration of the study is that of the duration of hospitalization in intensive care.
      The duration of the pharmacokinetic study is 9 days, starting on D1 of the treatment with
      hydroxychloroquine, and ending with the last recommended residual plasma control. The total
      duration of treatment with hydroxychloroquine is 10 days, as recommended by the High Council
      of Public Health in its opinion of March 23, 2020.
