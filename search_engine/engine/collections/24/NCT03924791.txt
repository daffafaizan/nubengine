      lumbar intervertebral disc. The herniated disc compresses a lumbar nerve root that continues
      its route into the sciatic nerve. About 13% to 40% of all people will suffer from sciatica at
      least once during their lifetime. Sciatica can have severe socio-economic effects; patients
      are immobilised by the pain they experience and therefore cannot go to work or participate in
      social events. Most cases resolve spontaneously with conservative therapy using only standard
      analgesics and/or physiotherapy. In a large RCT it was demonstrated that outcome of
      conservative and surgical therapy was comparable after 26 weeks. With this knowledge the
      guidelines for surgical treatment of sciatica were adjusted and it is nowadays usual care to
      offer surgery only after at least 8 weeks of conservative care and preferably after 14-16
      weeks of conservative care. This decision is made together with the patient in a process of
      Shared Decision making. Although this treatment regimen has been demonstrated to be
      efficacious and cost effective, the burden for a patient during these weeks of conservative
      care is usually high. The investigators seek to find a type of conservative care to reduce
      the discomfort due to the pain and to enable the patient to remain physically active. Not
      only will this add to the quality of life of the patient, but it will also prevent the
      patient from taking a sick-leave. In this study, patients will be randomized to either
      treatment with transforaminal epidural injections or to standard care consisting of oral pain
      medication.
