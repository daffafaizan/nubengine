      need for general anaesthesia. Such office-based procedures include outpatient hysteroscopy,
      endometrial biopsy, large-loop-excision of the transformation zone and manual vacuum
      aspiration for the management of miscarriage. Advantages experienced by patients include
      reduced anaesthetic risk, enhanced recovery time and flexibility of timings. For the
      healthcare provider there are significant cost benefits on the basis of reduced theatre time,
      staff and equipment. Patient satisfaction is generally high but influenced by their
      experience of pain and feelings of anxiety before, during and after the procedure.

      The rationale for this study is to invetsigate the role of distraction techniques and the
      feasibility of using virtual reality for the management of acute pain and anxiety experienced
      by patients undergoing manual vacuum aspiration

      Primary objective

      â€¢ Feasibility of using virtual reality as a distraction technique in management of acute pain
      and anxiety in patients undergoing manual vacuum aspiration for miscarriage.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Understanding the acceptability and effectiveness of VR interventions in office
           gynaecology procedures

        -  Understanding the factors that might influence the willingness of patients to
           participate in a future formal trial of the technology.

        -  Understanding how best to implement the technology and designing of the contents of the
           VR intervention.
