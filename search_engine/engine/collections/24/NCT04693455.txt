      of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is proposed to be administered orally as capsules.

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study.
      Approximately 56 HVs will enter into the phase 1 study. The study is designed to evaluate the
      safety,tolerability and PK of ZD03 capsule at different dose cohorts when administered
      orally.

      Subjects who meet the enrollment criteria will be enrolled in one of the seven dose levels
      designated for the study, including the doses of 20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 240 and 300 mg (doses
      escalated by 100%, 100%, 50%, 50%, 33% and 25%, respectively). Each cohort will consist of 8
      subjects randomized at 3:1 to receive a single oral dose of ZD03 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) in a
      double-blind manner in a fasted state
