    
      This is a randomized, open-label, inpatient/outpatient, 3-period crossover study in healthy
      subjects.The study will consist of 3 treatment periods. In treatment period 1, subjects will
      be randomly assigned on study day 1. A single 60-mg dose of codeine will be administered to
      all subjects. In periods 2 and 3, subjects will receive either DVS SR 100 mg/day or
      paroxetine 20 mg/day until the steady state is reached. At steady state, subjects will
      receive codeine 60 mg concomitantly with either DVS SR 100 mg or paroxetine 20 mg, depending
      on the treatment sequence to which they are assigned. DVS SR 100 mg or paroxetine 20 mg
      administration will continue for an additional 2 days. In treatment period 3, subjects will
      receive the alternative treatment sequence.
