      United States-our nation's teenagers continue to use illicit drugs at a worrisome rate. Broad
      reviews of the treatment outcome literature indicate that family interventions in general,
      and Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) in particular, are effective with drug using youth.
      This study is designed to compare BSFT to treatment as usual (TAU). The researchers believe
      that BSFT will be much more effective than TAU in reducing adolescent drug use. They will
      also examine which of these treatment approaches does a better job of engaging adolescents
      and family members in treatment, decreasing problem behaviors, decreasing sexually risky
      behaviors, increasing pro-social activities (e.g., school, work), and improving the
      functioning of the family.

      With the addition of the extended follow up, we have the opportunity to examine the
      sustainability of study outcomes into early adulthood, filling a gap in the treatment
      research literature about the long-term effects of adolescent substance abuse treatment. The
      follow up study examined the long term effectiveness of BSFT compared to TAU in the rates of
      substance use, number of arrests and externalizing behaviors, in youth who received study
      treatments at the time when they were adolescents.
