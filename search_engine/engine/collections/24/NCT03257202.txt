      preoperative surgical preparation. Lee et al. showed 70% growth rate of P. acnes despite the
      application of Choraprep prior to sampling. However, this study was limited as it failed to
      utilize a control group and only investigated one preparatory technique. Meanwhile, there
      remains to date no study investigating the effect of topical treatments. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate how specific topical treatments affect growth in the dermal layer. 12
      volunteers who are normal volunteers, students, or employees of USC will each receive 4 punch
      biopsies from their back above the scapular spine, with each biopsy taken from a region of
      the skin treated with a different topical (topical clindamycin alone, topical benzoyl
      peroxide alone, topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide together, and a control). A 3df
      overall test of the treatment indicators will test for any differences in positivity for P
      Acnes among the treatments; pairwise comparisons among the treatments will adjust for
      multiple comparisons. A two-tailed statistical test will be performed, testing at an alpha of
      0.05, and analyses will also be performed based on hemolytic subtypes.
