      urethral catheter (nelathon or tiemann tip) for measuring of post-void residual of urine.
      Insertion of a urethral catheter is usually accompanied by a discomfort and sometimes even a
      pain. In order to minimize these unpleasant feelings urodynamic technician uses gel with
      anesthetic agents.

      Single-use sterile catheters without any equipment and no coating can be used with lubricants
      and nowadays are the standard equipment at urodynamic study. Non-coated standard catheters
      are widely considered in the literature to cause an increase in urethral irritation, poor
      patient satisfaction, increased bacteriuria, and long-term urethral complications. Single-use
      sterile catheters with hydrophilic coatings, ready-to-use solution, with gel on the surface
      of the catheter or gel in the wrapping. Hydrophilic-coated catheters are characterized by
      having a layer of polymer coating, which absorbs and binds water to the catheter up to 10
      times its own weight. This results in a thick, smooth and slippery surface reducing friction
      between the catheter surface and the urethral mucosa during insertion. The coating layer
      remains intact upon introduction into the urethra and ensures lubrication of the urethra in
      its entire length. Coloplast Speedicath hydrophylic catheters are designed for single use and
      are pre-coated to allow ease of insertion and removal, thereby reducing the risk of urethral
      mucosal irritation that can be more prevalent in an non-coated product.

      Up today, there are no studies to verify whether a patient has different feelings with
      different type of catheters during the first-time urethral cauterization at urodynamic study.
