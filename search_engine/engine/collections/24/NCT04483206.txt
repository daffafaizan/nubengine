    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure achievement of target melphalan systemic exposure in the first 20 patients.

      II. Identify safety and preliminary efficacy within each systemic exposure range of melphalan
      using a 5+5 design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe International Myeloma Working Group response levels and selected grade 3/4
      toxicities in an expansion set of patients at the recommended phase 2 area under the curve
      (AUC) range.

      II. Measure deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair score from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
      diagnostic bone marrow sample (FFPE) and from pretransplant marrow aspirate sample.

      III. Assess melphalan-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
      melphalan-treated patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive standard of care high dose melphalan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over
      30 minutes on day -3 and PK-directed melphalan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day -1.
      Patients then undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days.
