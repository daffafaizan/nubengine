      correlates with major outcomes after cardiac and thoracic surgery, including acute and
      chronic pain, atrial arrhythmias, and cognitive function. To test this hypothesis,
      approximately 95 patients will be enrolled, and spontaneous baroreceptor sensitivity will be
      measured prior to surgery as well as immediately postoperatively. Outcomes will include acute
      pain using the numeric rating scale, Brief Pain Inventory, and Gracely Box Scale administered
      preoperatively, on postoperative days 1 and 2 and by phone at 6-weeks postoperatively.
      Chronic pain will be assessed at 6-month follow-up visit via hyperalgesia testing using Von
      Frey filaments. Postoperative atrial arrhythmias will be assessed by review of postoperative
      telemetry, the electronic medical record, and ECG performed prior to discharge. Finally,
      cognitive function will be assess via Mini-Mental State examination administered preoperative
      and at the 6-month follow-up visit. Association between BRS and the outcomes of interest will
      be tested with regression models adjusted for appropriate covariates. Significance threshold
      alpha will be adjusted for the number of statistical tests using the Bonferroni correction.
      Our hypothesis is that patients with impaired preoperative BRS will have an increased
      incidence of acute and chronic postoperative pain, atrial fibrillation, and cognitive decline
      after surgery.
