      local infiltration with bupivacaine and 15 patients will receive placebo before surgery. The
      haemodynamic response to head pin replacement and skin incision will be recorded.
      Postoperatively all patients will have a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device containing
      morphine (1 mg/ml) for analgesia. Visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain evaluation, sedation
      scores, and also postoperative morphine consumption will be evaluated and recorded.
