      of the most critical barriers to the development of effective prognostic tools and
      therapeutics. The addition of personal biological factors to our prediction models may
      account for a significant portion of unexplained variance and advance the field towards
      precision rehabilitation medicine. The overarching goal of the Epigenetic Effects on
      Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Recovery (EETR) study is to investigate an epigenetic
      biomarker involved in both childhood adversity and post-injury neuroplasticity to better
      understand heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes following pediatric TBI. The primary
      hypothesis is that childhood adversity will be associated with poorer neurobehavioral
      recovery in part through an epigenetically mediated reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF) expression in response to TBI.

      EETR is an observational, prospective, longitudinal concurrent cohort study of children aged
      3-18 years with either TBI (n=200) or orthopedic injury (n=100), recruited from the UPMC
      Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Participants complete study visits acutely and at 6- and
      12-months post-injury. Blood and saliva biosamples are collected at all time points-and CSF
      when available acutely-for epigenetic and proteomic analysis of BDNF. Additional measures
      assess injury characteristics, pre- and post-injury child neurobehavioral functioning,
      childhood adversity, and potential covariates/confounders. Analyses will characterize BDNF
      DNA methylation and protein levels over the recovery period and investigate this novel
      biomarker as a potential biological mechanism underlying the known association between
      childhood adversity and poorer neurobehavioral outcomes following pediatric TBI.
