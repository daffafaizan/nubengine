      For the reasons of the degenerative arthritis pain, the clinical observation is not entirely
      due to the cause of joint deformity or cartilage damage, soft tissue lesions around the knee
      is also a common source of pain, the use of floating needle for the diagnosis of soft tissue
      injury , And observed its efficacy, which is also the core of this study.
