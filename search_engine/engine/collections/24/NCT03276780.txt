      associated with a three-fold increase in cessation rates relative to poor adherence.
      Psychoeducational interventions focused on increasing adherence to NRT do not result in
      behavioral change (e.g., smoking cessation). Experiential approaches, such NRT sampling with
      PQAs, are based on learning theory models of behavioral change and have resulted in increased
      motivation, self-efficacy, adherence, and abstinence relative to psychoeducation or
      motivational interventions. However, nicotine sampling still relies of the participant using
      NRT outside of session, which may not occur. Providing an experiential intervention in which
      the NRT is sampled and any problems with NRT reframed during the session may provide a
      powerful learning experience that can increase in home sampling with PQAs and long-term
      adherence, ultimately increasing the likelihood of smoking cessation. This may be
      particularly relevant for low-income smokers who hold more negative views of NRT, have lower
      health literacy, and are less likely to use medication during cessation attempts.
