    
      A single-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-control study in which 30 Sickle Cell
      disease patients having a vaso-occlusive crisis will either receive SANGUINATE 320
      mg/kg/patient (8 mL/kg/patient) or Normal Saline on Day 1 (Visit 1) and Day 2 (Visit 2)
      infused over 2 hours each day. Patients are to remain in the hospital for up to 7 days but
      can be discharged at any time after receiving the second dose of SANGUINATE, provided their
      vaso-occlusive crisis has resolved and the patient has completed discharge procedures.
      Patients will have a follow-up phone call 7 days after discharge from the hospital to obtain
      safety, concomitant medication and pain assessments.
