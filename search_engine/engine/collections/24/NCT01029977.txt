      subjects arriving for a routine screening mammography, before and after they undergo the
      mammography. This is in order to reach a conclusion whether the the firm breast compression
      involved in the mammography procedure affects the performance of the MIRA technology. At the
      current stage of the development of the device, the goal of this clinical trial is in no way
      to arrive at a statistical analysis.
