      dangerous effects such as hypertension, tachycardia, myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmias and
      increased intracranial and intra-abdominal pressure. After thyroidectomy, activities during
      emergence such as agitation or coughing, signs of hypertension or tachycardia, or etc. may
      lead to postoperative bleeding, resulting in acute airway obstruction or reoperation.

      The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine which is
      administered during emergence in adult patients undergoing elective thyroidectomy on smooth
      emergence form general anesthesia and postoperative outcome.
