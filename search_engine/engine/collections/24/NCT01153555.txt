      criteria and sign an informed consent. At the time of catheterization the patients will be
      further analyzed for eligibility using angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Patients who fulfilled the clinical and angiographic criteria will undergo further imaging
      evaluation using an IVUS RF catheter (Volcano Therapeutics) and FFR wire (Radi or Volcano).
      The decision for treatment of any lesion will be at the operator's discretion. For patients
      enrolled at Washington Hospital Center and do not undergo percutaneous coronary intervention,
      an assessment with non invasive perfusion adenosine MRI also be performed.
