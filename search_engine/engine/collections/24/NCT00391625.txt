      does not involve the central nervous system (CNS). Typical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher
      disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia,
      hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased
      quality of life. Gene-ActivatedÂ® human glucocerebrosidase (the long term safety of enzyme
      replacement therapy with DRX008A (GA-GCB; velaglucerase alfa) is produced in a continuous
      human cell line using proprietary gene-activation technology and has an identical amino acid
      sequence to the naturally occurring human enzyme. GA-GCB (velaglucerase alfa) contains
      terminal mannose residues that target the enzyme to the macrophages-the primary target cells
      in Gaucher disease. This study was designed to evaluate the long term safety of GA-GCB
      (velaglucerase alfa) in patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease
