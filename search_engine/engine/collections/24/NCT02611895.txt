      subject to the use of highly active associations of more than 25 antiretroviral drugs
      currently available and good treatment adherence. But a key question remains: whether it can
      persist viral replication low noise HAART, since several arguments suggest a subclinical
      escape of the virus to HAART at least in some individuals. The technique proposed in this
      research consists of the detection and quantification of the linear viral cDNA intra
      cytoplasmic, as persistent novo infection marker in order to highlight the subclinical
      replication active in treatment of HIV-1 and consider an optimized therapeutic management of
      patients.

      Main objective : Comparing the frequency of patients infected with HIV and treated
      effectively (HIV viral load undetectable plasma with conventional methods) having the HIV DNA
      into the cytoplasm of their CD4 + T cells from peripheral blood, as cellular infection marker
      novo persistent, among patients with a therapeutic regimen contains or not the viral
      integrase inhibitor raltegravir.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the frequency of patients infected with HIV and treated effectively with the
           HIV DNA into the cytoplasm of their CD4 + T cells from peripheral blood

        -  Evaluate the causes of persistent infection in de novo virological responders to
           treatment with ART: presence of the HIV genome encoding strains resistant to treatment
           ART ongoing noncompliance to treatment, type of antiretroviral therapy, CD4 nadir ,
           pretreatment level of plasma HIV RNA, total duration of ART

        -  Assess the impact of persistent novo infection virological responders: cell activation
           CD4 + and CD8 +, lack of immunological treatment response, changes in lymphocyte ratio T
           na√Øve / memory cells cells, the presence of transient increase viremia, residual viremia
           levels

        -  Identify virological responders may benefit from treatment intensification Methods : HIV
           patients will be recruited by the doctors of Infectious and Tropical Diseases Service
           (MIT) in the Montpellier University Hospital.

      As part of this research, three additional blood tubes (7 ml EDTA tube) will be collected,
      totaling 21 ml at the time of blood sampling carried out during two consultations scheduled
      as part of the usual care the pathology of HIV patients in the Service of MIT.

      These consultations will be conducted at baseline and a further 3 to 6 months from the date
      of inclusion.
