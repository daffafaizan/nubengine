      fluorescein. Study physician will use tonometer to measure the intra ocular pressure in each
      eye. This is a standard procedure done in any ophthalmological examination. Each patient will
      undergo intraocular pressure examination at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00.

      In the first day intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00, same day
      measurements. The day after intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, two days after at
      12:00 and three days after at 16:00. One month later the patient will undergo another serious
      of intra ocular pressure measurements.

      In the first day intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00, same day
      measurements. The day after intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, two days after at
      12:00 and three days after at 16:00.

      The relationship between the two diurnal curves will be analyzed.
