      individuals who are virologically suppressed with combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART).
      ART is effective in prolonging life and enabling individuals who are HIV positive to live
      near-normal life spans. However, these individuals are increasingly developing a number of
      chronic diseases of aging, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The
      proposed studies will examine the role of highly active antiretroviral therapy in restoring
      the mucosal immunity and the systemic effect on immune activation, bacterial translocation,
      and change in HIV-associated cardiovascular disease risk.
