      Can the assessment of fetal lung volume by Virtual Organ Computed-aided Analysis (VOCAL) and
      pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed Doppler predict neonatal respiratory distress
      syndrome in term fetuses of diabetic mothers?

      Research hypothesis:

      The assessment of fetal lung volume by VOCAL and pulmonary artery resistance index by pulsed
      Doppler can predict neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in term fetuses of diabetic
      mothers.
