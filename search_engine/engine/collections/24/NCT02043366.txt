      ultra-short-acting opioid remifentanil seems to cause opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) more
      frequently and predictably compared with the others, likely due to its rapid onset and
      offset. Therefore, prophylaxis of remifentanil induced hyperalgesia is indispensable to
      postoperative comfort and satisfaction.

      There is no denying the fact that OIH is related to central glutaminergic system and
      N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-activation induced central sensitization. Prostaglandins
      can promote glutamate release from both astrocytes and spinal cord dorsal horns with
      subsequent activation of the NMDA receptors, and flurbiprofen axetil, as non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), not only functionally antagonizes the NMDA receptor
      activation via inhibition of prostaglandins, but also is a targeted drug which gathers at the
      site of inflammation, thus greatly enhances the analgesic effect. While butorphanol has both
      spinal analgesic and sedative functions because of predominantly central κ-receptor agonist
      activation, other advantages of butorphanol include few side effects, very low addiction
      potential, and low toxicity on account of a partial agonist-antagonist activity to
      μ-receptor. Moreover, antihyperalgesic activity of κ opioids at the site of inflammation has
      been reported in various acute pain models. The following study is carried out to evaluate
      whether butorphanol combined with flurbiprofen axetil can be safely and effectively applied
      to preventing postoperative hyperalgesia induced by remifentanil in patients undergoing lower
      abdominal surgery.
