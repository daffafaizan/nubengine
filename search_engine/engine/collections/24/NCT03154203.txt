      participated this study and now we are going to expand this study in Chinese population.

      In Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, we recruit consecutive patients who meet the including
      criteria. And their medical and family history are obtained with standardized structured
      questionnaire including information about smoking and drinking and exercise habits, history
      of diabetes mellitus, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, renal disease and peripheral arterial
      disease, use of antihypertensive, lipid-regulating and hypoglycemic drugs. Their biochemical
      examinations of venous blood and urine were measured after an overnight fast.

      For the 24-hour brachial and aortic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring of each patient, we
      use the Mobil-O-Graph NG apparatus (IEM, Stolberg, Germany), which is well validated and now
      commercially available.

      All participants underwent carotid and cardiac ultrasonography by a validated ultrasound
      system (Mylab 30 CV machine, ESAOTE SPA, Genoa, Italy). The parameters of cardiac function
      and structure and the parameters of carotid arteries are assessed according to the ASE
      recommendation. Further, we use these parameters to estimate the damage of heart and carotid
      artery including left ventricular mass index (LVMI), carotid left ventricular diastolic
      function (LVDD), intima-media thickness (CIMT) and cross-sectional area(CCSA).

      Four years later, the above measurements will be performed again and the corresponding data
      of events and mortality will be collected.
