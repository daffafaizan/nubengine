    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of pepinemab
      (VX15/2503) administered as an intravenous infusion every 14 days to children with recurrent
      or refractory solid tumors. (Part A) II. To define and describe the toxicities of VX15/2503
      administered on this schedule. (Parts A-B) III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      VX15/2503 in children with recurrent or refractory cancer. (Parts A-B) IV. To preliminarily
      define the antitumor activity of VX15/2503 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory
      osteosarcoma. (Part B) V. To determine if VX15/2503 either improves the disease control rate
      at 4 months in patients with recurrent measurable osteosarcoma or produces an objective
      response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. (Part B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamics of VX15/2503 through VX15/2503 saturation of T-lymphocytes.

      II. To assess the immunogenicity of VX15/2503 in pediatric patients with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of VX15/2503 sensitivity including SEMA4D, PlexinB1, and
      other markers of immune cell infiltration in archival tumor tissues.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive pepinemab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
