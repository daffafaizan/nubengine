      connect with researchers who are applying the latest science and technology to develop new
      treatments for stroke recovery. Anyone who is 18 years of age or older and has had a stroke
      may submit a survey to join. The self-reported information on the survey will be used to
      match participants to current or future stroke research studies and study personnel for each
      specific study may contact participants for further screening. Some studies are recruiting
      participants nationally, not just in the San Francisco Bay Area.
