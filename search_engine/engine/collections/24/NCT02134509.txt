    
      In this randomized control trial, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of two
      treatments: (1) a standard smartphone application to support smokers working to become
      quit-free, or (2) the tested intervention, an app that trains behavioral strategies for
      smoking cessation. The primary endpoint of interest will be 1-week point prevalence
      abstinence at end of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow-up for individuals.
