      are not known. The SPEC study compares outcomes for young children (12 to < 35 months of age)
      with astigmatism meeting spectacle prescribing recommendations and randomized to either
      Full-Time spectacle wear (encouraged and reinforced) or Ad Lib spectacle wear (only as
      accepted by the child). The primary outcome analysis compares cognitive development at 38-42
      months in children randomized to the Full-Time and Ad Lib groups. Secondary analyses compare
      Language, Motor, Social-Emotional, and Adaptive Behavior developmental outcomes and visual
      acuity outcome for children randomized to the Full-Time and Ad Lib groups.
