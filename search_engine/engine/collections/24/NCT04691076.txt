      treatment experience during gastrointestinal endoscopy, which is a vital prerequisite for the
      large-scale development of this operation as well as the early screening and treatment of
      gastrointestinal malignancies. Clinically, fentanyl combined with propofol is the most
      commonly used anesthesia regimen for the painless gastroscopy, however its high incidence of
      respiratory and circulatory depression will threaten the safety of patients. Instead,
      esketamine has a good action in anesthesia and analgesics, a slighter respiratory depression,
      as well as with a remarkable improvement in adverse effects than ketamine. What has already
      been proved is that low- dose of esketamine can remarkably reduce the dosage of propofol
      during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; In our pilot study, we found that not
      only the incidence of respiratory depression was significantly lower than that of fentanyl
      during endoscopic polypectomy, but also the dosage of propofol was reduced at the same
      time,suggesting that esketamine may have a potential superiority in the painless
      gastrointestinal endoscopy.Our project plans to collect the patients who have received
      painless gastroscopy and polypectomy in the hospital, and use a target-controlled infusion
      (TCI) of propofol in combination with esketamine, by observing the total dose of propofol ,
      the time of recovery and the length of hospital stay, the satisfaction of patients and
      endoscopists, drug side effects,adverse events of respiratory and circulatory system and
      other indicators ,to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this anesthetic scheme.
