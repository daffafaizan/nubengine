      receptors which are found in high densities in a fear circuitry involving the amygdala,
      hippocampus, the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex serve important functions in
      the regulation of stress-coping behaviors. Besides eCB regulation there is strong evidence
      from ongoing research of the investigators group and others suggesting an important role for
      glucocorticoid signaling as an endpoint of the biochemical sequelae initiated by stressful or
      aversive stimuli. One of the long-term research goals of our lab is to understand such
      functions and determine their relevance to the pathogenesis of PTSD and to provide a more
      integrative view on neurobiological mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of the
      neuroadaptive response to stress. The objective of the proposed translational study is to
      test a model, based upon basic science studies, exploring multisystem impairments in PTSD
      including eCB and glucocorticoids in the modulation of fear memories by examining the CB1
      receptor in a PTSD fear circuit as well as glucocorticoid function. The investigators propose
      that impaired eCB signaling in PTSD resulting in the maladaptive neurobehavioral response to
      the stressor is associated with an upregulation of the CB1 receptors and insufficient
      glucocorticoid signaling.
