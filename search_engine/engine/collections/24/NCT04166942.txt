    
      The primary objective of the study is:

      â€¢ To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KD025 following a single oral dose of KD025 in
      subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects with
      normal hepatic function.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of KD025 in subjects with
           mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, and in healthy subjects with normal
           hepatic function.

        -  To assess the PK of the KD025 metabolites following a single oral dose of KD025 in
           subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects
           with normal hepatic function.
