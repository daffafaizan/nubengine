    
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study of daratumumab
      for the treatment of participants with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior
      lines of therapy including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease is double refractory to both a
      PI and an IMiD. Up to approximately 150 participants are to be enrolled. The study includes
      screening, treatment, and follow-up phases. Participants will receive daratumumab by
      intravenous infusion (28-day cycles) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      other protocol-defined reasons. For all study drug administrations, participants will receive
      pre- and post-infusion medications for the prevention of infusion related reactions.
      Follow-up will continue until death, loss to follow up, consent withdrawal for study
      participation, or study end, whichever occurs first. The study will consist of 2 sequential
      parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The purpose of Part 1 is to select a dose and schedule for Part 2
      of the study. Assessment of tumor response and disease progression will be conducted
      according to IMWG response criteria. Serial pharmacokinetic blood samples and a
      pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study. At the end of the study, participants who are benefiting from treatment with
      daratumumab will have the option to continue treatment.
