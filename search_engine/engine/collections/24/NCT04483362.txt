    
      All participants will receive the intervention which involves weekly sessions with a
      physiotherapist and the provision of an activity tracker. The sessions will aim to help
      motivate participants to be more physically active and identify barriers to physical activity
      in their environment. The activity tracker will be used to set a steps per day goal for the
      participant to achieve.

      The intervention will be assessed for feasibility using aspects of the Bowen Framework. Under
      this framework the intervention will be evaluated according to different domains:

        -  Acceptability: To what extent is a new idea, program, process or measure judged as
           suitable or satisfying

        -  Demand: To what extent is a new idea, program, process, or measure likely to be used

        -  Implementation: To what extent can a new program is successfully delivered to intended
           participants

        -  Practicality: To what extent can the program can be carried out with intended
           participants using existing means, resources, and circumstances

        -  Limited efficiency: Does the a new program show promise of being successful with the
           intended population

      In order to find out the best way to assess physical function, participants will complete 5
      different assessments. The results from these assessments will help to determine the best
      measure to use in this population.
