      dexamethasone as second line treatment for relapsed Multiple Myeloma patients initially
      treated with lenalidomide-based regimens. Daratumumab is a human IgG1Ä¸ monoclonal antibody
      that binds with high affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein. It
      is a targeted immunotherapy that attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38, in a variety of
      hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. Ixazomib is an orally administered
      proteasome inhibitor with anti-myeloma activity.
