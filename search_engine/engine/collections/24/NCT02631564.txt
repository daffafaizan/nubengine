      have poor prognosis except for curative resection. Chemotherapy combined biologic agents have
      improved mCRC median progress free survival and median overall surivival, but it is difficult
      to deal with liver lesions after FOLFOX and FOLFIRI treatments failed. We aim to observe the
      safety and efficacy of hepatic infusion and embolization of oxaliplatin, irinotecan and
      raltitrexed treatment for refratory liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
