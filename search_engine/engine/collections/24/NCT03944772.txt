    
      This is an open-label, multicentre, multi-drug, biomarker-directed Phase 2 platform study in
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring an epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR)-sensitizing mutation whose disease has progressed on first-line
      monotherapy with osimertinib.Treatment options for these patients are limited. Novel
      treatments for these patients are urgently required.

      This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of multiple study treatments.
