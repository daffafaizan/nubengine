        -  Determine the negative predictive value of a negative sentinel lymph node in patients
           with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.

        -  Determine the location of the sentinel node in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive injection(s) of isosulfan blue into the dermis at the junction of
      the tumor and normal vulvar skin. Once the afferent lymphatic channel and sentinel node have
      been identified, patients undergo unilateral or bilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy
      followed by resection of the primary tumor with adequate margins. Preoperative
      lymphoscintigraphy is also performed.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter or until recurrence.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-630 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-6
      years.
