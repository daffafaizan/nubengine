           without concurrent chemotherapy. This will cure about 80% of patients. For the 20% who
           developed recurrence or metastases, the prognosis is poor.

        -  Elevated EBV-DNA in plasma at end of radiotherapy has been shown to predict disease
           recurrence and may be a marker of subclinical residual disease.

        -  This study aims to test whether adjuvant treatment with 6 cycles of a modern
           chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin combination) can improve the survival of
           these high risk patients of nasopharynx cancer who have elevated EBV-DNA after
           completion of their radiotherapy.
