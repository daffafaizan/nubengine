      physiologic processes. It has been determined that patients with cardiovascular disease have
      intracellular magnesium (Mgi) deficiencies. Among the ICD registries in Europe and the United
      States 64% and 77% of patients also carry the diagnosis of CAD, respectively. Patients with
      CAD have risk factors that lead to the development and or propagation of atherosclerosis.
      Paramount among these risk factors are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.

      Comparison: Magnesium compared to placebo in patients with ICDs to evaluate the effect they
      have on cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose.
