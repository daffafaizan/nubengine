      ultrasonographic and electrophysiological examinations were performed before and at two, six,
      and 12 weeks after steroid injection. Cross sectional area (CSA) was measured at 2 levels: at
      the tunnel inlet and in the mid-carpal tunnel. Flattening ratio (FR) was measured only in the
      mid-carpal tunnel. Correlation analyses between baseline ultrasonography, BQ, and
      electrophysiological measures were performed.
