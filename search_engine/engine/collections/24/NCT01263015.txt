      multicenter, study conducted in approximately 788 HIV-1 infected ART-na√Øve subjects. Subjects
      will be randomized 1:1 one of the following treatment arms:

      GSK1349572 50 mg plus abacavir/lamivudine fixed-dose combination once daily (approximately
      394 subjects)

      OR

      Atripla once daily (approximately 394 subjects)

      Analyses will be conducted at 48 weeks and 96 weeks. Subjects randomized to receive
      GSK1349572 and who successfully complete 96 weeks of treatment will continue to have access
      to GSK1349572 plus abacavir/lamivudine fixed-dose combination through the study until it is
      locally available-as long as they continue to derive clinical benefit, until they meet a
      protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, or until development of the compound is
      terminated.

      ViiV Healthcare is the new sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of
