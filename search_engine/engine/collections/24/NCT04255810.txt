      thought to be caused by their breast implants. The term Breast Implant Illness or "BII"
      originated with several social media groups. There is no current pathophysiologic explanation
      or diagnostic test for BII; it is not a recognized medical disease at this time. Recently
      several studies have been designed and funded to study the role of psychological and social
      behavioral factors. This study has been designed to scientifically analyze biospecimens from
      three cohorts of age matched women in the United States. This study aims to address the
      questions asked by patients, physicians, and the FDA with regard to the scientific validity
      of BII.
