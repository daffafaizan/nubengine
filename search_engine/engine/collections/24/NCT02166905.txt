    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of fixed doses of DEC205mAb-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein
      (DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401) with adjuvant poly-ICLC given as a vaccine in
      combination with INCB024360 (IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360). (Phase I) II. To evaluate toxicity
      as defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) Version 4.0. (Phase I) III. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) (primary
      endpoint) using standard immune-related response criteria (irRC) criteria. (Phase IIb)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effectiveness of INCB024360 on enhancing vaccine efficacy by assessing
      cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) specific cellular and humoral immunity.

      II. To determine the effectiveness of Sirolimus on enhancing vaccine efficacy by assessing
      NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity (Exploratory Cohort ONLY) III. Peripheral
      blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T cells.

      IV. Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies. V. Peripheral blood frequency of
      CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T cells.

      VI. Pharmacokinetics of INCB02360 in relation to T cell frequency and function in correlation
      with PFS.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I:

      Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 via intracutaneous injection on day
      1, poly ICLC subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 2, and IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor
      INCB024360 for up to 7 courses.

      PHASE IIb: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 and poly ICLC as in Phase I.

      ARM II: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401, poly ICLC, and IDO1
      inhibitor INCB024360 as in Phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then at 3, 6,
      and 12 months.
