      for the first solution in dose of 30 mL/kg (max 2 L) over 1 hour. Blood was collected at
      baseline (T0), at 60 minutes (T1), 120 minutes (T2), and 240 minutes (T4) from baseline. Time
      to fist void after initiation of fluid and urine volume were also recorded. After wash-out
      period of at least 1 week, crossover studies were performed with another fluid.
