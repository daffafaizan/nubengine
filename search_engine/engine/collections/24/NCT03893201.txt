      (CAC) in a real-world post market evaluation setting in which multiple incompetent
      superficial saphenous truncal veins - namely (great saphenous vein (GSV), short saphenous
      vein (SSV), anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV) - will be treated at the same setting,
      and compression stockings will not be used postoperatively. Unlike previous studies, the
      inclusion criteria for this study will be liberalized, and veins up to 12mm in diameter will
      be treated. As such, ASVS will be the first published prospective trial conducted in Asia on
      a predominantly Asian cohort of patients to report on the performance of CAC for incompetent
      GSV and non-GSV trunks. This study specifically focuses on the initial technical outcomes,
      safety, anatomical occlusion and patient experience with CAC applied with broader inclusion
      of patients than previous trials.
