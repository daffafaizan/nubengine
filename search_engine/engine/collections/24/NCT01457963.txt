      ventilated (MV) patients, leading to underdiagnosis. We estimated the prevalence of PE and
      associations with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) among MV patients.

      Methods: Consecutive MV patients who required thoracic computed tomography (CT) in a single
      ICU. Compression ultrasound of the four limbs was performed within 48 hours of inclusion.
      Curative anticoagulation therapy was given immediately after PE diagnosis.
