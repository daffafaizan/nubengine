      automatically into the peritoneum based on continuous glucose data. All prior intraperitoneal
      pharmacokinetic studies used only concentrated regular insulin, which may be too slow to
      provide full closed-loop insulin delivery without meal announcement. A description of
      intraperitoneal ultra-rapid insulin kinetics, as well as counter-regulatory hormonal factors
      that may counter hypoglycemia is needed. Upper versus lower peritoneal delivery may also
      affect insulin kinetics. A possible benefit of intraperitoneal insulin is restoration of
      glucagon response in longstanding diabetes and clearance of insulin by the liver, both of
      which could provide hypoglycemic rescue in automated insulin delivery systems.
