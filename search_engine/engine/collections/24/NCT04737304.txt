      cohort to be applied to subsequent cohorts. Changes made will be within the boundaries of the
      adaptive elements with clear control mechanisms and guidance for staying within these
      boundaries.

      Part A is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential group study to
      investigate ascending multiple topical doses of BEN2293 in patients with mild to moderate AD.
      Patients will participate in only one cohort.

      Part B is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to investigate
      up to two dose regimens of topical doses of BEN2293 administered for a maximum of 28 days in
      patients with mild to moderate AD.
