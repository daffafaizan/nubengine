      Objective: The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of electromechanical
      exoskeleton-assisted gait training on rehabilitation functional outcomes in patients with
      stroke undergoing therapy in an in-patient rehabilitation facility.

      Background:

      Method: The investigators will study 50 patients with stroke consecutively admitted to a
      designated stroke rehabilitation unit in the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center. All patients
      will receive their daily 3-hours conventional therapy, plus an hour of either exoskeleton or
      over-ground gait training 3 times per week for 60 minutes. Patients were assigned to either
      the experimental (exoskeleton) or the control (over-ground) groups by computer-generated
      randomization. This is an open-label pragmatic trial, where neither the patients nor the
      clinicians could be masked to the intervention. Institution review board (IRB) approval will
      be obtained for the protocol. The demographic data to be collected includes: age, gender,
      race/ethnicity, stroke onset to admission, stroke types (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and stroke
      severity (on the National Institute of Health Stroke Severity [NIHSS] scale. Admission and
      discharge total Functional Independence Measure (FIM), spasticity and depression scores,
      ambulation velocity over 2-minutes (2-MWT) in feet/minute, and discharge disposition. The
      intervention is IndegoÂ® exoskeleton. The primary outcome measures were: changes in the FIM,
      depression and spasticity scores. The secondary outcome measure was discharge disposition.
      Continuous variables were analyzed using Students t-test, ordinal variables were analyzed
      using Mann-Whitney, and the nominal variables were analyzed using Chi-square analyses.
