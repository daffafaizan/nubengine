      informed consent patients will be randomized in two groups: usual care or intra-gastric
      balloon. In the latter, a second randomization will be performed between air-filled balloon
      or water-filled balloon. Six months later, after withdrawal of the balloon (if required),
      laparoscopic gastric by-pass will be performed. Thereafter, patients will be followed during
      6 months.

      On each visit, inclusion, 3 months, 6 months, surgery, 1 month and 6 months post surgery, a
      medical and biological evaluation will be systematically performed.

      The main criteria of judgement is the rate of admission in ICU during more than 24 hrs during
      the 30 days following surgery.

      The secondary criteria of judgement is: the differences in pre-operative weight loss between
      the 2 groups, number of complications occurring during the 30 days after surgery, differences
      in different scales of quality of life (SF36, IWQOL-lite), differences in operative time,
      length of hospital stay, readmissions, and medical cots between the two strategies. Efficacy
      and tolerance of each type of balloon (air-filled or water-filled) will be compared in the
      intra-gastric balloon group.
