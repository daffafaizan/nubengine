      I. The goal of this two-phase study is to assess the rate of grade 2 or higher
      radiation-related skin toxicity in adult patients with breast malignancies after
      administration of alkaline (pH 9.0) or distilled (pH 7.0) water consumed immediately prior to
      and after daily radiation treatments.

      OUTLINE:

      FEASIBILITY PHASE: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a
      week for 6 weeks. Patients drink 8 ounces of alkaline water within 30 minutes immediately
      prior to and after undergoing radiation therapy.

      INTERVENTION PHASE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy QD, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
      Patients drink 8 ounces of alkaline water within 30 minutes immediately prior to and after
      undergoing radiation therapy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy as in arm I. Patients also drink 8
      ounces of distilled water within 30 minutes immediately prior to and after undergoing
      radiation therapy.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
