    
      Participation in the SaPHIR study will be offered to patients admitted to one of the
      inpatient or outpatient adult psychiatric units of the hospitals participating in the study
      (around Nantes), provided that the realization of the RDTs will be possible.

        1. Cross-sectional assessment of prevalence : evaluation of the prevalence of HCV, HBV and
           HIV viral infections All patients admitted to one of the inpatient or outpatient adult
           psychiatric units of the hospitals participating in the study, whatever the psychiatric
           diagnosis and without age limit, may be included in the study, provided that the
           realization of the RDTs will be possible. Only patients who will accept the realization
           of the HCV RDT will be included, in order to be able to respond to the primary objective
           of the study. The agreement to realize the two other RDTs is optional. However, for
           patients who already had a HCV serology performed less than 3 months before inclusion,
           the HCV RDT will not be performed and the data collected for the study will be based on
           the previous serology.

        2. Cohort follow-up of HCV positive patients : evaluation of care pathway and barriers to
           care for hepatitis C Patients who are included in the cross-sectional assessment of
           prevalence of the SaPHIR study and having a positive HCV RDT (or positive HCV serology
           performed less than 3 months ago) will participate in the follow-up of the study.
