      this reciprocal screening protocol based on literature dervied estimates of coprevalence and
      other key factors in a decision tree model to compare costs and outcomes. They measured
      expected outcomes using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and the incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). The current study will involve establishment of the true
      co-prevalence and recalculation of the ICERs and QALYs. Based on their literature derived
      models we previously found an ICER of $34.01/QALY for AAA screening in IA patients and an
      ICER of $6,401.91/QALY for IA screening in AAA patients. Both of these are well below the
      societal accepted threshold of $60,000/QALY. However, both models were sensitive to
      co-prevalence. In the current study the investigators will therefore determine the actual
      cost-effectiveness of performing additional radiographic procedures and genetic counseling.
      The investigators will also bank DNA and RNA for future research.
