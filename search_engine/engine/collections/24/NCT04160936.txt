      and analgesic consumption in patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Patients
      aged between 18 and 65 years with renal stone >2 cm will be included in this study .The
      patients will be divided into two groups. In Group A , the drug will be infiltrated to the
      renal capsule, perinephric fat, muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin under fluoroscopy with
      0.25 percent bupivacaine. This is a widely-used procedure by surgeons in the world. In Group
      B, no anesthetic will be infiltrated after the end of the procedure.
