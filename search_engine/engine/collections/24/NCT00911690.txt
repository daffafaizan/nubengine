    
      Up to 1000 patients, with or without diagnosed cognitive disorders, are asked to participate
      by providing the investigators with blood, urine and saliva specimens to be stored in a Bio
      Bank for future research. Patients will be asked to participate on a yearly basis for up to 5
      to 10 years by providing the investigators with the above-mentioned specimens, and also
      having a physical exam and having some cognitive testing performed at the initial visit and
      yearly visits.

      Examples of the types of research are: new methods for improving the diagnosis and treatment
      of age-related cognitive disorders, new areas of biology, new areas of biotechnology, and
      possibly genetic research. If you do not want your specimens used for any specific type of
      research, you may specify that on the consent form.
