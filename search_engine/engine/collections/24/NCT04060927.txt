      pulmonary toxicities for subjects treated with SBRT who have tumors that move â‰¥ 1 cm in 3
      different cohorts: 1) free breathing with SGRT 2) breath hold utilizing SGRT only; 3) breath
      hold utilizing SGRT in combination with implanted fiducials. Secondary objectives also
      include Estimate reliability of gated SBRT treatments utilizing SGRT vs. SGRT with fiducials
      estimating local control for SBRT in subjects treated in the three different cohorts,
      estimating overall survival, and evaluating quality of life. A safety objective of estimating
      acute and long-term grade 2 or higher non-hematologic toxicities attributed to SBRT/fiducial
      implantation in subjects treated in the three different cohorts will also be explored.
