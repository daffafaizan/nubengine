      follow up in PICU or in pediatric anestesiology clinic, will be included in this prospective
      observational study. Swisstom BB2-monitor and NeoSensorBelts will be used to monitor their
      ventilatory care from arrival to the operation room (prior intubation) to postoperative
      intensive care (until 2 hours after extubation). EIT parameters assessing lung aeration and
      ventilation distribution will be used to assess the quality of invasive ventilation.
