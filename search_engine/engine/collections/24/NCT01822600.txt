      independent risk factor for mortality. Inhibition of gastric acid secretion by intravenous
      proton pump inhibitor infusion can have a positive impact on the prevention of ulcer
      rebleeding after successful endoscopic therapy. However, the rebleeding rate can still be
      high in patients with comorbid illnesses even after proton pump inhibitor usage.
      Hypoalbuminemia has been reported to be a significant predictor of poor prognosis in patients
      with comorbid illnesses. Low serum albumin levels are associated with poor prognosis of wound
      healing and peptic ulcer bleeding; therefore, it is worthy to conduct a head-to-head
      comparison to validate whether administration of albumin can be helpful in improving the
      control of bleeding peptic ulcers, especially in patients with comorbid illnesses.

      The albumin level may reflect upstream pathologic processes, such as stress or
      co-morbidities. Albumin administration may interrupt the downstream chain of poor outcome and
      thus maintain a favorable homeostasis in critically ill patients, and reduce morbidity.
      However, the clinical benefit of controlling peptic ulcer bleeding with exogenous albumin
      remains uncertain, and thus administration of albumin is not widely applied. Accordingly, the
      investigators conducted this pilot intervention to test whether short-term exogenous albumin
      administration can improve the control of peptic ulcer bleeding in hypoalbuminemic patients,
      who are at high risk of recurrent bleeding.
