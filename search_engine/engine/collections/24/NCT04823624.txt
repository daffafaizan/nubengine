    
      This is an adaptive two-stage phase II clinical trial to assess the activity of the
      anti-TIM-3, (T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain) antibody, MBG453, in patients
      with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), not eligible for or progressing on frontline
      therapy.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved MBG453 for myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDS), but it has been approved for other uses.

      The study drug (MBG453) may interact with TIM-3 (an antibody which is a protein that attaches
      to foreign infectious/invading cells and signals the immune system) which might aid the
      immune system's response by helping immune cells recognize, find, and destroy cancer cells in
      the body.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they and their doctor believe they
      are benefiting from the study drug. Participants will then be followed for 12 months after
      their last dose of the study drug or until they withdraw their consent to be contacted.

      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study
