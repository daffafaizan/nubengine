      however, it is associated with very poor prognosis since the initial response is nearly
      always followed by relapse and metastasis. The response to subsequent therapy is very limited
      as is the duration of response in these patients. Patients with SCLC have high rates of
      metastases at presentation suggesting that angiogenesis is particularly important in this
      cancer, furthermore studies have shown that microvessel density and VEGF expression in SCLC
      tumor samples correlate with development of metastases and poor prognosis. Furthermore VEGF
      expression was the only factor that retained a significant inverse correlation with survival
      when assessed in a multivariate analysis.

      Pazopanib is a potent, small molecule competitive inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity
      of (VEGFR 1), VEGFR 2, VEGFR 3, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and c kit, capable of
      inhibiting downstream signalling from these receptors. The IC50 of pazopanib against VEGFR 2
      is 10nm, and the IC50 against VEGFR 1 is <50nm. Currently a number of studies is underway for
      the evaluation of pazopanib in the treatment NSCLC. Administering pazopanib to patients with
      relapsed SCLC offers an attractive choice in patients with very limited therapeutic choices.
      The high rate of metastasis highlights the need for alternative treatments that act directly
      on the growth and invasion of tumors and subsequent development of metastases, rather than
      solely on cell proliferation.
