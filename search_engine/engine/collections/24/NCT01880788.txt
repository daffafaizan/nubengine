      to CSC are genetically distinct from typical CSC patients without neovascularization or
      patients presenting with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to advanced AMD.
      Disease associated markers detecting variants in ARMS 2, Complement Factor H (CFH) Complement
      component 3 (C3), Complement component 2 (C2) , Factor B (FB), VEGFA or other genetic
      polymorphisms associated with CNV will be evaluated to determine if the CSC neovascular group
      is genetically distinct from the CSC group without neovascularization or the advanced AMD
      group.
