      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of duvelisib in combination with nivolumab
      for patients with Richter?s syndrome or transformed follicular lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of duvelisib in combination with nivolumab in Richter?s
      syndrome and transformed follicular lymphoma (overall response rate, progression free
      survival, overall survival).

      II. To determine the toxicity profile of duvelisib in combination with nivolumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate response to duvelisib in combination with nivolumab with
      cytogenetic/fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) abnormalities of the chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma compartments (for patients with Richter?s syndrome)
      at baseline.

      II. To correlate response to duvelisib in combination with nivolumab with baseline
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutation of CLL and lymphoma as assessed in tumor samples and
      cell free DNA.

      III. To determine changes in T, B, and natural killer (NK) cell number and function during
      duvelisib plus nivolumab therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of duvelisib.

      Patients receive duvelisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
