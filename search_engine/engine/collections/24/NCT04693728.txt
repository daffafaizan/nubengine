      assessments and then were randomized to either the study intervention or wait list control.
      Participants who were randomized to the study intervention completed post testing assessment
      measures within two weeks of the final treatment. Participants who were randomized to
      waitlist conditions completed post testing assessment measures within 2 weeks of the end of
      the waitlist condition and then subsequently received the study intervention.
