      that it was difficult to find the cavity because of the concentration of intestinal folds
      caused by the tube pulling after insertion of TET. It is well known that transparent
      cap-assisted colonoscopy is easier to flatten the semilunar folds and improve mucosal
      exposure. Here the investigators test the hypothesis that using transparent cap-assisted
      colonoscopy significantly decreases the second cecal intubation time which not only improve
      work efficiency, but also saves patients' anesthesia time and cost. Thus, the investigators
      design a prospective multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the methodology, efficiency, feasibility and safety of using transparent
      cap-assisted endoscopy for colon TET implantation.
