      - The main hypothesis is that the dietetic intervention in obese children may improve the
      components of the metabolic syndrome by mediation (at least in part) of changes in the
      microbiota.

      Other secondary hypothesis to be demonstrated are:

        -  The microbiota (before the treatment) could be a determinant factor of the metabolic
           syndrome (inflamation, serum lipid profile, insulin resistance) being a key feature
           differentiating the metabolically healthy obese from the obese with metabolic syndrome.

        -  A dietary pattern rich in vegetables and fruits is associated to a gut microbiota
           profile preventing the metabolic syndrome

      How these hypothesis will be demonstrated? A motivational structured intervention to reduce
      weight is applied (under randomized clustered design) to obese children, that are compared to
      an active intervention (not structured) provided by health care professionals, both groups
      during 12 months (+3).

      A baseline and final assessment (before and after the intervention) are performed, in which
      the following information is collected:

        -  Socioeconomics

        -  Anthropometry (weight, height, waist circumference) to calculate the obesity degree (BMI
           z- score) and the presence of abdominal obesity

        -  Body composition: deuterium dilution (in a subsample), bioimpedance, Dual X-Ray
           Absorptiometry and Air displacement pletismography (BodPod)

        -  Blood sample drawn: to analyze lipids profile and insulin resistance

        -  Fecal sample: the gut microbiota diversity and the presence of specific bacteria will be
           analyzed

        -  Dietary intake by a food frequency questionnaire: diet will be analyzed as dietary
           patterns

        -  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (which will be adjusted as z-score)
