      for older adults with self-reported memory problems and chronic pain: Active Brains 1 Active
      Brains 2. We will assess how each program may help in improving coping with pain and coping
      with cognitive functioning. We will explore feasibility, acceptability, and credibility and
      within group changes in physical, emotional and cognitive functioning.

      Each group meets for 8 90 minute sessions over a secure video platform. Each group has 5-8
      participants. Participants receive a treatment manual. There are 2 assessment points:
      baseline, and post program. Assessments involve questionnaires, a walk test, and objective
      step count with ActiGraphs for 1 week.
