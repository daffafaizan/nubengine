      of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. The accumulation of these cysts causes the kidneys to
      enlarge several times the normal size and leads to the eventual loss of renal function and
      ultimately results in renal failure in end-stage patients. This is a disease with
      life-threatening implications to those who have it, and their family members who may also be
      affected. Aside from early anti-hypertensive control and dietary protein restriction, which
      are presumed to offer a modest degree of protection, most surviving patients require renal
      replacement therapy (dialysis and transplant) and suffer from high morbidity and mortality.

      A rationale for use of tolvaptan in these genetic disorders has been proven, in principle,
      through use of a variety of animal models. In these models, tolvaptan is effective in halting
      or reversing the progression of this renal disease.

      The current study is being undertaken in order to evaluate whether tolvaptan, an oral
      vasopressin V2 receptor inhibitor, will maintain an adequate safety profile and show a
      potential clinical benefit by reducing total renal volume in the hopes of making an impact
      upon disease progression.
