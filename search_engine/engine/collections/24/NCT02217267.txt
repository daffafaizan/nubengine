      often resistant to treatment such as opioid, tricyclic antidepressant or anticonvulsant.
      Lidocaine infusion has been the one of intractable neuropathic pain treatment . My hypothesis
      the serial lidocaine infusion can adequate pain control and can prevent chronic pain (central
      sensitisation). Therefore, we designed this prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy of serial lidocaine infusion in peripheral neuropathic pain
      compared with placebo in long term outcome (at 3 month).
