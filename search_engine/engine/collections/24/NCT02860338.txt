    
      From 2008-2013 more than 5,000 patients have been seen by a community-based
      internist/psychiatrist specializing in treating cognitively impaired adults suffering from
      MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease, vascular dementia, combined DAT/VAD, FTD, PD,
      LBD, as well as dementia due to traumatic brain injury (TBI), alcoholism and autoimmune
      diseases.

      Cohort 1 includes patients from this specialist practice who were extensively evaluated with
      a standardized protocol assessment aimed at identifying all reversible and treatable
      conditions adversely affecting cognition, and achieving maximum diagnostic accuracy with
      respect to the underlying dementia pathology. The protocol included physical and mental
      status examinations, neuroimaging (PET scans and/or MRI's with volumetrics), lab tests,
      overnight pulse oximetry, in-lab and ambulatory polysomnography, and gold standard
      neuropsychological testing as well as rapid, in-office cognitive testing. The comprehensive
      treatment protocol attempted correction of all modifiable and metabolic derangements, and
      utilized maximally tolerated FDA approved medications and devices.

      Cohort 2 includes patients who were referred by their primary care clinicians or other
      non-dementia specialists to a neuropsychology practice for a standardized cognitive
      evaluation as part of usual care, but were not treated by a dementia specialist.

      This in-depth retrospective analysis is the first attempt to evaluate the comparative
      effectiveness of dementia drugs and other treatment interventions in a cognitively impaired
      patient group whose baseline metabolic abnormalities were identified, treated and maintained
      optimally throughout the course of care versus a patient group not so intensively assessed or
      managed.

      Outcome measures include objective cognitive testing and functional and behavioral
      assessments correlated with prescribed standard dementia medications, reductions in
      benzodiazepine, narcotic and antipsychotic use, as well as with baseline and interval
      measures of oxygenation adequacy, BNP, CRP, IGF-1, homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, iron
      status, Vitamin D 25-OH, and utilization of oxygen and positive airway pressure treatment.
