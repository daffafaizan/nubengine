      treatment na√Øve patients will be given Selegiline 10 mg/day PO and Sinemet 100 x 3. Treatment
      efficacy will be assessed upon reexamination every 1 month. If adequate symptomatic relief is
      not achieved, the dopaminergic therapy may be increased by 150 mg levodopa until optimal
      effect or a maximum dose of Sinemet 200 x 3. If adequate symptomatic relief is not achieved
      on this dose, the patient will excluded and further followed-up at the regular outpatient
      service. Once optimal effect is reached (i.e. stable treatment for at least 3 months, the
      regime will be frozen for the duration of the study period (52 weeks). Patients will then be
      randomized to receive either Nicotamide riboside or placebo. Both the participants and the
      investigators are masked. The trial will have a 52 weeks (1 year) exposure period, during
      which patients will self-administer NR 500 mg x 2/day, or placebo per os. In addition, all
      patients will take a stable regime of selegiline 10 mg/day plus optimal dopaminergic therapy.
      After the baseline visit, participants will be reassessed at 4, 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks in
      person. Clinical evaluation will be performed by one of the neurologists involved in the
      study and/or the study nurse. The primary outcome of the study is the total score of the
      Movement disorder society Unified parkinson's disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) comparing the
      NR and and placebo group.
