      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) of cabergoline in women with metastatic breast
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). II. Evaluate
      toxicity. III. Correlate serum prolactin levels during therapy with response. IV. Evaluate
      within-patient changes in computed tomography (CT) and bone scan measurements taken at
      baseline and after 2 cycles of treatment.

      V. Evaluate within-patient changes in prolactin receptor (PRLr) expression from baseline to
      after 1 cycle of treatment in those patients who consent to optional repeat biopsy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabergoline orally (PO) twice weekly for weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.
