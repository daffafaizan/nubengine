      with plantar fasciitis were recruited and randomized to group A and group B. Group A was
      treated with focused shock waves alone and group B with a combination of focused shock waves
      and tendon supplement. Pain remission (primary endpoint) and functional recovery (secondary
      endpoint) are monitored in both groups at three time points (Months 0, 3, and 6).
