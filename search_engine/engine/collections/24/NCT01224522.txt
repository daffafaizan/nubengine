      patient matched cutting block we expect better axial alignment of the components.

      Research Objectives:

        -  The primary research objective is to evaluate the axial alignment and component position
           in TKA with use of Smith & Nephew's VISIONAIRE Patient Matched Technology and to compare
           with the alignment when standard instrumentation.

        -  Secondary research objectives include assessing the safety and effectiveness of the
           VISIONAIRE patient matched technology as compared to commonly accepted standard
           instrumentation in patients suffering from symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee joint.

           - Outcome Measures:

        -  Implant alignment and Component position by means of CT-scans

        -  Knee Society Score

        -  EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)

        -  Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)

        -  Oxford Knee Score

        -  Knee-related adverse events

        -  Standard and full leg x-ray

             -  Number of Subjects: 70 (2*35)

             -  Enrollment time: 18 months

             -  Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Patients with osteoarthritis of the knee
                requiring total knee arthroplasty

             -  Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen:

      VISIONAIRE patient matched technology versus the commonly accepted standard instrumentation
      for the Genesis II total knee arthroplasty implant
