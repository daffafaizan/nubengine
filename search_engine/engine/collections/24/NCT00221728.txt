    
      Background. Surgical treatment of multiple or recurrent renal tumors may be complicated by
      renal function impairment. Mini-invasive thermotherapy as radiofrequency (RF), induces
      necrosis of tumoral tissue while sparing normal renal parenchyma.

      Objectives. The main objective is to assess the 5-year local carcinologic efficacy (no
      residual tumor tissue and no recurrence at the site of treatment) of the radiofrequency
      treatment. Secondary objectives are to assess 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy,
      predictive factors of technical success of RF procedures, and the general and renal tolerance
      5 years after treatment.

      Study design. Open label, randomized, parallel-group, multicentric clinical trial (9
      centers).

      Eligibility criteria. Patients with renal tumor in whom a surgical treatment may result in
      renal function impairment.

      Intervention.

      Experimental group: radiofrequency treatment, percutaneous or under laparoscopy, using RF
      3000â„¢ generator (Radiotherapeutics, Boston scientific) under a standardized heating protocol.
      A second procedure is allowed in case of residual tumoral tissue or tumor recurrence.

      Control group: conservative kidney surgery.

      Outcomes. The principal outcome is the 5-year local carcinologic efficacy (no residual tumor
      tissue and no recurrence at the site of treatment, as assessed by tomodensitometry or MRI
      after injection). Secondary outcomes are 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy (local efficacy
      and no metastases), renal function, technical success of RF procedures (no residual tumor
      tissue 2 months after procedure) and tolerance.

      Follow-up. Clinical, biological and imaging follow-ups are scheduled 2 months, 6 months, 1,
      2, 3, 4 and 5 years after the first treatment.
