      scoliosis surgery to evaluate the integrity of spinal cord pathways. Detection of neural
      irritation or injury using motor or somatosensory evoked potentials allows the surgeon to
      modify technique to reverse the insult and proceed without spinal cord compromise. To
      facilitate evoked potential monitoring, anesthetic agents that attenuate the evoked responses
      must be avoided.Several different agents have been studied to try to diminish the acute
      opioid tolerance and/or hyperalgesia seen with remifentanil.

      Two studies investigated the effect of magnesium sulfate on intraoperative
      remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. In both studies, post-operative pain scores and opioid
      consumption were decreased in those patients who received magnesium.

      Our aim is to establish that magnesium sulfate does not adversely affect somatosensory evoked
      potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in patients undergoing correction of
      idiopathic scoliosis. Future clinical trials can then be performed investigating the effect
      of magnesium sulfate on remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia in the same population.
