      supplements (720, 1440 and 2160 mg) potatoes (720, 1440 and 2160 mg) or French fries (2160
      mg).

      During 9 phases, participants will consume a controlled diet with the supplements, potato or
      french fries (every other week for 5 days). On the 4th day, blood and urine samples will be
      taken to monitor potassium uptake and excretion. Measures of blood pressure will be analyzed
      at defined time points throughout the intervention.
