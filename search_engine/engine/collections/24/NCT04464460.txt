      tolerability and PK of TAK-671 in participants admitted to the hospital with a confirmed
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. Each cohort will have 20 participants.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) in a 3:1 ratio to
      receive TAK-671 or placebo in each cohort, which will remain undisclosed to the participant
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Cohort 1: TAK-671 Low Dose

        -  Cohort 2: TAK-671 High Dose

      Enrollment in Cohort 2 will only begin once all 20 participants in Cohort 1 have reached Day
      7 post dose and have received positive review from the internal review committee (IRC) and
      approval to continue enrollment. All participants will receive the standard of care along
      with the study treatment.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 3 months. All participants will be followed up 28
      days after the infusion.
