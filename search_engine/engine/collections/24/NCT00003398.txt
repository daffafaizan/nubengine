      undergoing transplantation with an unrelated or related matched or mismatched antigen donor.
      II. Evaluate the rapidity of engraftment and CD4 count recovery post-transplantation in this
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive total body irradiation (TBI) three or two times a day on days -8 to
      -5. Following TBI, patients receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours daily on days -4 and -3 plus
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour daily on days -2 and -1. Antithymocyte globulin is
      administered by IV over at least 4 hours on days -4 to -1. Patients undergo an allogenic bone
      marrow transplantation on day 0. Bone marrow is harvested from patient's donor, depleted of
      T-cells, and infused. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 4.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 26-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4
      years.
