      Researchers want to better understand how a nighttime snack can affect morning fasting blood
      glucose. A two-period randomized crossover trial will be conducted. Participants will be
      randomized to receive each treatment for 1 week. During the almond butter treatment,
      participants will consume 2 tbsp of almond butter per day as an evening snack. The control
      treatments will be a no-snack control. Fasting blood glucose, as well as glucose trends, will
      be measured using Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM). Participants will also be asked to take
      simple cognitive tests on a study-provided smartphone each day of the study and report their
      daily food intake and physical activity.
