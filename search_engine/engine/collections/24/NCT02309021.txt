      training group and a control group of patients receiving substitution therapy (ST). The
      specific goals of the study are:

        1. To understand the exercise preferences, barriers to participation, motivation,
           experiences and attitudes regarding exercise training in patients under ST.

        2. To examine whether a 12-week exercise programme affects the mental health, subjective
           and objective sleep, quality of life, self-control capacity, substance craving, hair
           cortisol levels, secondary consumption, cardiovascular fitness, blood pressure, lung
           function, resting pulse, and social interaction in patients receiving ST.

        3. To compare the effects of the EX and control conditions on the above-mentioned outcome
           variables.

        4. To examine to what degree the covariates of heroin substitution dose and psychiatric
           comorbidities affect outcome variables.

        5. To explore to what extent objective variables (cardiovascular fitness, pulse, blood
           pressure, lung function, cortisol, objective sleep-EEG-parameters) and
           subjective-psychological dimensions (subjective sleep, social interaction, symptoms of
           depression and anxiety, self-control, substance craving) are interrelated.
