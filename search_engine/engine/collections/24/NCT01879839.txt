      and in succession acute renal failure which is associated with significant morbidity and
      mortality. None of the currently used preventive procedures show a benefit in terms of a
      CIN-prevention.

      Experimental data suggests, that a pre-interventional caloric restriction might provide
      kidney protection in this context. This clinical trial investigates if this phenomenon is
      also applicable in humans. Patients with increased risk for a post-interventional renal
      failure due to known chronic kidney disease are randomized in 2 groups. Patients of the diet
      group receive a calorie restriction to 60% of the calculated daily energy rate from day -4
      until day -1 (included) pre-intervention (day 0 corresponds to day of intervention). Patients
      of the control group receive alimentation ad libitum.

      Primary objective is the increase of serum creatinine in mg/dl 48 h after begin of
      intervention in comparison to baseline value obtained in the morning of the day of
      intervention (day 0) in order to analyse if a pre-interventional calorie restriction as a
      preventive strategy leads to an attenuation of post-interventioal kidney injury.

      Hypothesis: A four day calorie restriction reduces the increase of serum creatinine after
      administration of contrast agent in patients with known chronic kidney disease.
