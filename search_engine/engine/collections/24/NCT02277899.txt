      behavior/risk-factor counseling, and the frequency and time to next follow-up visit, compared
      with either no communication or incomplete communication (communicating only high weight
      status without behavior/risk-factor counseling or a follow-up visit) will predict improvement
      in weight status at one year follow-up, and 2) during pediatrician-patient communication
      regarding weight and weight management, higher patient-centeredness will predict improvement
      in weight status at one year follow-up. The communication content identified will generate
      new information about the most effective content and style of pediatrician-patient
      communication that predict weight-status improvement. Because we prospectively will examine
      clinical practice elements in the one-year interval between well-child visits, acknowledging
      that communication regarding high weight status may initiate assessment of risk factors for
      heart disease (such as high cholesterol and blood sugar), more frequent follow-up visits, or
      prompt a nutrition referral, we will generate novel information about the most effective
      clinical practices and follow-up interval and frequency that predict weight-status
      improvement in overweight children. We also will examine if the content and style of
      communication are related to improvements in diet and lifestyle behaviors at one-year
      follow-up.
