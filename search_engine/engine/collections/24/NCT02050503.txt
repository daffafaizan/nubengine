      intranasal fentanyl in pectin for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain in patients
      with confirmed tolerance of opioid therapy for chronic pain secondary to radiation-induced
      mucositis. The study plans to include 30 evaluable patients from multiple centers throughout
      the country. The trial comprises a screening period, an open titration period, and an
      open-label treatment period in which at least 12 breakthrough pain episodes are to be
      treated.
