      care management intervention for older people with serious mental illness are invited to join
      this study. Half of the individuals have already been randomly assigned to receive the
      intervention and half have already been randomly assigned to continue receiving their usual
      care. The people receiving the intervention receive the skills training module, Using
      Medications Effectively, in 8 group sessions over 8 weeks. The module includes information
      about common medications used for psychiatric and medical illnesses; training on using
      devices to help take medications properly; and instruction on strategies to help incorporate
      medication taking into a daily routine. A trained research assistant conducts pill counts and
      interview sessions with all participants after they sign an informed consent form, 8 weeks
      later, and 3 months after the second interview.
