    
      Primary Objective: To determine if six (6) cycles of pembrolizumab with weekly carboplatin
      and paclitaxel for the 1st line treatment of metastatic head/neck squamous cell carcinoma
      patients increases the radiographic response rate as compared to the historical rate for
      pembrolizumab alone.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To determine if six (6) cycles of pembrolizumab with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel
           for the 1st line treatment of metastatic head/neck squamous cell carcinoma patients
           increases median overall survival (OS) as compared to the historical rate reported for
           pembrolizumab alone.

        -  To determine if six (6) cycles of pembrolizumab with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel
           followed by pembrolizumab alone for the 1st line treatment of metastatic head/neck
           squamous cell carcinoma patients increases the median progression-free survival (PFS) as
           compared to the historical rate reported for pembrolizumab alone.

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of six (6) cycles of pembrolizumab with weekly
           carboplatin/paclitaxel/pembrolizumab alone for the 1st line treatment of metastatic
           head/neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, measured as the proportion of patients with
           discontinuation of any study drug due to any adverse event of any cause, as compared to
           the historical proportion reported for platinum/5FU/ pembrolizumab (33%).
