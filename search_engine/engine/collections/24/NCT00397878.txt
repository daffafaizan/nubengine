      I. Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months in metastatic colorectal
      carcinoma patients receiving daily doses of AZD0530.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the objective response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS) of patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer who are treated with AZD0530.

      II. In patients who consent, both blood and tissue samples will be collected for laboratory
      correlates. Assess in a preliminary manner the association between correlative markers and
      the potential downstream effects of AZD0530 on IL-8, VEGF, specific Src-regulated markers in
      focal adhesions, adherens junctions, and angiogenesis on clinical outcome in pre- and
      post-treatment tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral AZD0530 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
