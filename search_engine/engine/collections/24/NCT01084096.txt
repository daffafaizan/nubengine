      years by two-thirds for 2015 (UN, 2000). Given that 38% of all under-five deaths worldwide
      occur in the first four weeks of life, the goal seems unattainable unless a significant
      fraction of the neonatal deaths are prevented (Darmstadt et al., 2005). Thus, the provision
      of health care during the perinatal period in developing countries is a top priority. Preterm
      birth is a major cause of neonatal mortality, currently responsible for 28% of the deaths
      overall. As the contribution of preterm birth to neonatal deaths is well above 50% (MacDorman
      et al., 2005) in middle and high income countries, it is expected that as low income
      countries improve their development, the relative importance of this cause will increase. One
      of the most powerful perinatal interventions to reduce neonatal mortality is the
      administration of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth.

      The primary objective will be to evaluate whether a cluster-level multifaceted intervention,
      including components to improve the identification of pregnancies at high risk of preterm
      birth and providing and facilitating the appropriate use of steroids, reduces neonatal
      mortality at 28 days of life in preterm newborns, compared with the standard delivery of care
      in selected populations of six African, Asian, and Latin American countries.
