    
      Patients enrolled in the CANTOS trial (with prior acute myocardial infarction [>30 days] and
      elevated C reactive protein levels [CRP>2mg/l]) who also have reduced left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF<50%) and are symptomatic for heart failure (New York Heart
      Association symptoms class II-III) will be offered to take part in this sub-study at the
      Virginia Commonwealth University site.

      As part of the sub-study, patients will undergo a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) at
      baseline prior to initiation of treatment, then repeated at 3 and 12 months, and a
      transthoracic echocardiogram at baseline and at 12 months.
