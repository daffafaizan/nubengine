      (Toradol) on breast reduction and breast reconstruction procedures. Patients will be
      randomized into three groups: group 1 will receive a perioperative dose of ketorolac
      (Toradol, 15mg), group 2 will receive ketorolac (Toradol, 30mg), and group 3 will be the
      control and receive a placebo of saline.

      The patients, surgeons, anesthesiologist will not know whether the patient received ketorolac
      (Toradol) intraoperatively. Patients' pain will be assessed using pain scores in the
      immediate post-operative period, on post-operative day 1, and at their two-week follow up
      appointment. If patients leave the same day then they will only have two pain score
      assessments; on day of surgery and at their two-week follow up. Additionally, patients will
      be asked to assess their average pain (scale of 1-10) in morning and evenings using a patient
      diary for the two week post-op period. The patient's opioid use will be measured by their
      opioid use during their hospital stay, as well as how many prescription narcotic pills the
      patient used to manage their pain at home, as documented using the patient diary.
