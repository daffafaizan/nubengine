      levels of fear-avoidance. Nevertheless, mechanisms of change for exposure treatment are not
      sufficiently investigated. According to the habituation model, the activation of a fear
      structure leads to a habituation of the initial physical response. Therefore, the therapeutic
      recommendation is to focus on the reduction of fear during exposure sessions. According to
      the inhibitory learning approach, however, exposure experiences compete with the original
      US-CS fear association. Therefore, the therapist should maximize the violation of negative
      expectancies. The present study intends to compare both strategies during the exposure to
      pain in an experimental design.
