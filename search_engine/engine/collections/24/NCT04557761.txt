      methods come with several limitations, however. Sutures and staples can be painful, cause
      inflammation that can lead to scarring, and require return clinic visits for their removal.
      Tissue adhesives cannot be used to close wounds under tension, can be associated with
      inflammation, and carry a risk of wound dehiscence. Bandages are also only useful for closing
      superficial wounds under low tension. Therefore, there is a need for improved products to
      close wounds associated with laceration repair.

      The current study will use a prospective randomized controlled design to compare the use of
      sutures to microMend速 to treat lacerations among children 7-17 years. Performance of sutures
      and microMend速 will be assessed by investigators, providers and subjects. Participants will
      be randomized 1:1 between closure of lacerations with microMend速 or sutures. Results from
      this study will help gather further information on the use of microMend速 to close wounds in
      the pediatric population.
