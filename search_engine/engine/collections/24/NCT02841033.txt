    
      This Phase I/II study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of infusion of
      daratumumab in AL amyloidosis, specifically with respect to infusion reactions. In addition,
      the investigators would like to assess organ response with respect to cardiac biomarkers and
      proteinuria, as well as hematologic response and time to next treatment. Participants with AL
      Amyloidosis will receive the drug daratumumab by IV infusion once weekly for two months, then
      every 2 weeks for four months, then once each month. Study treatment may continue until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease
      evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.
