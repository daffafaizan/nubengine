      medication. Pediatric hypertension specialists lack an evidentiary base on which to establish
      definitive clinical practice guidelines for first-line therapy. Significant practice
      variation is an unsurprising consequence. Routine choice of the same first-line therapy for
      most patients with hypertension, absent testing other options, may delay correction of blood
      pressure for months or years. Failure to incorporate patient preferences in medical
      decision-making may also contribute to decreased patient satisfaction and adherence.

      Large parallel-group, comparative effectiveness trials are likely not on the horizon for this
      population. Moreover, heterogeneity of treatment effects would minimize the generalizability
      of such a trial to all patients.

      This is a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial to test whether the n-of-1 trial approach
      is superior to usual care in normalizing blood pressure while minimizing exposure to
      compliance-reducing side effects.
