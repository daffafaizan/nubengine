      of uterine arteries by Doppler (22 - 26 weeks of gestation) in primipara. Patients will be
      stratified according to the results of the uterine artery Doppler measurement, and then
      randomized in two groups A and B. In group A, sFlt-1 concentration will be communicated to
      the obstetrician (+ or -): the threshold of abnormally high plasmatic concentration of sFlt-1
      is 957 ng/mL. In patients with a high plasmatic concentration of sFlt-1 (+), the pregnancy
      will be closely monitored including repeated clinical, biological, and ultrasound
      examinations. Patients with sFlt-1 plasmatic concentration below 957 ng/mL (-) will be
      routinely followed-up.In group B, the result of sFlt-1 measurement will not be communicated
      and the pregnancy will be routinely monitored.Abnormal Doppler recordings in either group
      will result in a close monitoring as per our usual local practice. Urinary PlGF (expressed as
      a ratio PlGF/creatininemia) will also be measured and the results will be analyzed at the end
      of the study. Beside sFlt-1, we will store the plasmatic samples to measure other biomarkers
      that could be relevant in the future (no DNA analysis will be done without a new patient
      consent).
