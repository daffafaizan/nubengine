      efficacy of erenumab in adults with chronic migraine. Participants who completed the 12-week
      double-blind treatment of the parent Study 20120295 (NCT02066415) and met all Study 20130255
      eligibility criteria were eligible for enrollment into this study. Enrollment occurred within
      14 days after the parent study's week 12 visit.

      The initial dose used in the study was erenumab 70 mg every month (QM). The protocol was
      subsequently amended to increase the dose to erenumab 140 mg QM (Protocol Amendment 2).
      Participants who had already completed the week 28 visit (ie, midpoint of the study) at the
      time of Protocol Amendment 2 continued to receive open-label erenumab 70 mg QM for the
      remainder of the study. Participants who enrolled but had not completed the week 28 visit at
      the time of Protocol Amendment 2 increased the open-label erenumab dose from 70 mg QM to 140
      mg QM at the next visit. All participants who enrolled after Protocol Amendment 2 received
      open-label erenumab 140 mg QM throughout the study.

      Participants may elect to participate in a separate clinical home use (CHU) substudy to
      assess subjects' ability to self-administer 140 mg of erenumab for in-home use using either
      two prefilled syringes (PFS) or two prefilled autoinjector/pens (AI/pens). Enrollment in the
      12-week substudy occurred at either week 12 or week 40 of study 20130255. Participants were
      randomized to self-administer erenumab using either the PFS or AI/pen on CHU days 29 and 57
      at home.
