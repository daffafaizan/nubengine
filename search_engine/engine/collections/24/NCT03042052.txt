      diseases. Fifty to eighty percent of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or traumatic
      spinal cord injury (SCI) and more than 60% of patients with myelomeningocele suffer from
      urinary incontinence episodes (UI) due to NDO. NDO is characterized by involuntary detrusor
      contractions during the filling phase, leading to leakage and increase in bladder pressure,
      which can, precipitate renal failure. Detrusor injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®), is
      licensed worldwide and recommended as a second line therapy for the treatment of urinary
      incontinence due to NDO after failure of anticholinergic drugs (Grade A).

      These recommendations are based on the results of international multicentric, randomized
      controlled trials.

      These studies established not only clinical benefits, with a significant decrease of urinary
      incontinence episodes, but also urodynamic benefits.

      There are very few data about the real prevalence of failure of Botox® in the long term.

      Thus, aims of this study were to assess the long-term outcomes of detrusor injections of
      Botox® associated with clean intermittent-catheterization (CIC) for the treatment of NDO and
      to identify risk factors for failure .
