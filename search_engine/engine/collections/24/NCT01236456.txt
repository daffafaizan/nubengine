      peripheral neuropathy that is thought to be immune-mediated. Randomized, placebo controlled
      clinical trials in CIDP demonstrate benefit from treatment with corticosteroids,
      plasmapheresis, and IV Ig. However, not all patients respond to these therapies. IV
      cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, interferons, total lymphoid irradiation, and mycophenolate
      mofetil have been proposed as appropriate therapies for refractory patients.

      Patients with CIDP often respond to immune-modulating treatment. However, the high rate of
      relapse and treatment-related side effects result in poor long-term outcomes for many
      patients. CIDP is assumed to be an autoimmune disease, but the pathogenesis is poorly
      understood. T cell infiltrates are predominantly CD8, suggesting a T cell mediated process.
      There is not, however, restricted T cell receptor Vbeta utilization seen in sural nerve
      biopsies. Immunoglobulin and complement deposits noted on the myelin sheaths support an
      antibody-mediated process. Antibodies to the P0 myelin protein are seen in a minority of
      patients. High-dose cyclophosphamide is believed to eradicate both B and T lymphocytes. This
      therapy does not damage hematopoietic stem cells, which allows for rapid white cell recovery
      without stem cell rescue.
