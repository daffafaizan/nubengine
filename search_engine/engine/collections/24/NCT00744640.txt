    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oxaliplatin in combination
           with gemcitabine and capecitabine (GEMOXEL) in patients with APC

        -  Phase II: to assess any anti-tumor activity of GEMOXEL in patients with APC

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  to assess toxicity and safety of the combination treatment GEMOXEL in patients with APC

      Primary Endpoints:

        -  Phase I: Dose-limiting toxicity

        -  Phase II: Objective tumor response

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Toxicity at MTD according to NCI CTC 3.0

        -  Progression-free survival and Overall Survival
