      52 weeks (i.e. last injection on week 50). Biopsy samples from AD subjects and surgical
      discard samples will undergo molecular profiling. Skin swabs and stool samples will be
      collected and banked for future analysis. The reason to treat patients for 52 weeks is to
      have the ability to correlate early molecular events with clinical outcomes at week 52.
