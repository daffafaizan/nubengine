      three-week preparation by rapid-weight-loss-diet (RWL) to be accepted for bariatric surgery.
      Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in the awake state before and
      after volume-challenge (VC) based on 6ml colloids /kg IBW. Feasibility of standardized VC was
      evaluated by TTE. Dynamic and non-dynamic echocardiographic indices for VC were studied.

      Main outcome measures: Volume-responsiveness and level of venous return before and after
      volume-challenge were assessed by TTE. An increase of stroke volume â‰¥ 13% was considered as a
      volume-responder.
