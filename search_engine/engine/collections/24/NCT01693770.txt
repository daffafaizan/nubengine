      failure of other therapies, our study will be conducted in patients not previously treated
      with EBRT to the targeted lesion.

      This is an important new feature, especially given the advantages of MRgFUS, such as lack of
      ionizing radiation, the ability to conduct treatment on an outpatient basis and the
      possibility to repeat the treatment as necessary.
