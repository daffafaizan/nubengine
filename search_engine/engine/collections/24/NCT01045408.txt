      currently regarded as the gold standard for HP eradication. However, the eradication rate
      continues to be disappointing. Poor patient compliance and bacterial resistance are the main
      factors contributing to treatment failure. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop a
      non-antibiotic alternative therapy to increase the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori.
      Some literatures reported that cranberry may inhibit Helicobacter pylori adhesion to the
      human gastric mucus and may reduce Helicobacter pylori infection in adults. The aims of his
      experiment were to explore the impact of berry extract on triple therapy for Helicobacter
      pylori eradication.
