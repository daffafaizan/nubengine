      homoeostasis. DPP-4 inhibitors have been proved to promote glycemic control without
      increasing risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. In addition, they may improve beta-cell
      function and do not have any known associations with overt cardiovascular or hepatic safety
      risks.

      Addition of sitagliptin to treatment of T2DM patients poorly controlled on insulin +/-
      metformin has been shown to reduce HbA1c while being generally well-tolerated.

      It could be clinically useful to add sitaglipin to treatment regimen of T2DM patients on
      stable therapy with insulin & metformin. Apart from glycemic reduction, secondary effects
      like prevention of weight gain, reduction in insulin dose, improved cardiovascular risk
      profile, etc. may be expected from addition of sitagliptin to treatment.
