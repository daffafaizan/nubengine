      informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent
      will be screened for eligibility for study entry. Patients that meet inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be randomized via block randomization in a double blind fashion and a 1:1 ratio
      to surgical incision infiltration with Bupivacaine (0.5% with 1:200 000 epinephrine) or
      Lidocaine (2% with 1:100 000 epinephrine).
