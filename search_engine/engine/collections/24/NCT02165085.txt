      fragility in seamingly healthy young adults. The disease is caused by a mutation in the
      COL3A1 gene encoding type III collagen, critical to ensure physical resistance to mechanical
      stress of hollow organs. The disease results in increased tissular fragility, responsible of
      spontaneous arterial ruptures and dissections and spontaneous bowel perforations. The
      life-expectancy of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is reduced by these
      recurring accidents. The exact mechanisms that trigger arterial accidents are unknown. Recent
      findings suggest a possible deleterious effect of inflammation and a possible dysregulation
      of the TGF-beta pathway. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify further alterations
      in vascular endothelial and smooth muscular cell signalling/secretion, and to confirm
      previously suggested mechanisms of arterial accidents in vEDS patients.
