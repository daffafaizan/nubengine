      patients with mild and moderate ED in a randomized controlled trial.

      Patients and methods: 38 patients with mild/moderate ED (IIEF-5= 11-21), are being
      prospectively randomized (1:1) to receive 6 sessions of LIST or sham (same: number of
      sessions, time and sound, with out transmitting energy). The patients and who analyzed the
      data are blind to randomization. The following parameters were analyzed: IIEF-5, IIEF-15,
      Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) 2 and 3, Global Assessment Question (GAQ) 1 and Erection
      Hardness Score (EHS) at: baseline (T0), at the end of the 6 sessions (T1); at 6 (T2) and 12
      weeks (T3). During all the study patients were instructed to receive no other treatment for
      ED.

      After ending T3 we expect to treat placebo patients to see impact of changing arm study.
