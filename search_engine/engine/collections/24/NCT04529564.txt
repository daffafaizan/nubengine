    
      Study Design: The study is an observational review of medical records of patients diagnosed
      with unresectable stage III NSCLC in South Korea and Taiwan, participating in an early access
      program (EAP). Physicians having treated patients in the EAP will be asked to recruit these
      patients to have their data abstracted from their medical records. Data will only be
      collected from routine clinical care.

      Data Source(s): Centre staff will extract de-identified data from patient's medical charts.
      All collected data will be retrospective at time of extractions.

      Study Population: Patients diagnosed with an unresectable stage III NSCLC, having not
      progressed after a CRT and who have received at least one dose of durvalumab following the
      CRT within the EAP will be the target population.

      Exposure(s): Clinical characteristics, details of treatments (previous therapies, subsequent
      therapies), durvalumab exposure and serious AESIs.

      Primary Outcome(s): PFS and OS. Sample Size Estimations: A target of 140 patients is
      estimated in the study.
