      performed in the first months of life, when the brain plasticity shows its great
      expressivity, has positive effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this framework the
      early identification of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders is a major
      prerequisite to start very early an intervention programme. To families of infants, born in
      Neonatal Units involved in this study, will be asked with written informed consent, to
      participate in this observational study that aims to early identify, through a rigorous and
      standardized follow-up, infants at high risk for CP. Infants born at term or preterm with
      ultrasonographic evidence of brain injury considered at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders
      will be strictly monitored during the first months of development by the clinical team (Child
      Neurologists and Neonatologists) performing a periodic neurological assessment through
      examination of the Prechtl's General Movement (GMA) and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological
      Examination, at term age and around 3 months of post term age. Moreover, to study more
      accurately the brain injury early identified by ultrasonographic brain exam, within 6 weeks
      post-term age enrolled infants will perform, as recommended in infants at risk, brain
      Magnetic Resonance (RM). During the conventional RM examination, when possible, a fMRI
      perceptive task will be also performed to evaluate possible predictor factors to the
      responsiveness to the early intervention.

      Thanks to the high predictability power of the combination of the clinical observation with
      the neuroimaging infants at high risk of CP will be early detect. Selected infants,
      considered at high risk for CP will have the opportunity to perform an home based and family
      centered early intervention later than 3 post term age.
