      of rotational angiography (RA), but it requires a longer coronary injection compared to
      standard coronary angiography (SA). The risk of complications from the contrast agent (such
      as discomfort, warmth, pain, hypotension and bradycardia) is increased with the use of DARCA.
      It remains to be evaluated whether this approach is also suitable for coronary angiography,
      especially using in the patients with complex coronary lesions. Previous studies revealed
      promising results, but the number of patients included did not provide sufficient statistical
      power to allow a valid comparison of DARCA with SA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the feasibility, safety, clinical tolerance, and hemodynamic effect of DARCA in comparison to
      the well-established SA.
