      role in lipid metabolism which drives cancer cell growth. We have found that the SK inhibitor
      ABC294640 (which is formulated for clinical use as an oral agent) significantly inhibits and
      reverses progression of virus-associated DLBCL in pre-clinical animal models [Qin et a.,
      2014]. In addition, we have found that ABC294640 selectively induces death for virus-infected
      endothelial cells in a laboratory model relevant to KS, with selective sparing of uninfected
      cells [Dai et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2015]. Both DLBCL and KS disproportionately impact
      patients with immune-deficiencies, including HIV infection, for whom standard
      chemotherapeutic approaches are less effective and incur greater side effects. Therefore,
      this trial which utilizes a well-tolerated, oral agent to inhibit SK for DLBCL and KS
      patients may provide a unique approach to treatment.
