    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm tolerability of the combination regimen with the addition of inotuzumab
      ozogamicin to the pediatric-inspired regimen of cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB) 10403.

      II. To determine whether the addition of inotuzumab ozogamicin significantly improves the
      event-free survival (EFS) in patients who achieve an induction response achieved with the
      pediatric-inspired regimen of CALGB 10403, without censoring for transplant. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of inotuzumab ozogamicin on disease-free (DFS) and overall
      survival (OS) in patients who achieve an induction response.

      II. To determine whether the addition of inotuzumab ozogamicin significantly improves the
      event-free survival (EFS) in patients who achieve an induction response achieved with the
      pediatric-inspired regimen of CALGB 10403, with censoring for transplant.

      III. To determine the impact of inotuzumab ozogamicin on minimal residual disease (MRD) and
      correlate this with the EFS, DFS and OS.

      IV. To determine the prognosis based on patients' low-density array (LDA) gene signature in
      terms of EFS, DFS, and OS after treatment with or without inotuzumab ozogamicin when added to
      the C10403 backbone regimen.

      V. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of the addition of inotuzumab ozogamicin to the
      pediatric-inspired regimen of CALGB 10403.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess both the correlation of MRD post-induction and at sequential timepoints with LDA
      signature.

      II. To evaluate the influence of MRD status (detectable vs. not and as a continuous measure)
      in relation to EFS both in the univariate setting as well as adjusting for other clinical
      features including initial white blood cell (WBC), ethnicity, gender and age at diagnosis.

      III. To evaluate the impact of inotuzumab ozogamicin (inotuzumab) on the kinetics of MRD
      during treatment with inotuzumab in patients randomized to the experimental treatment arm.

      IV. To perform genomic analyses to identify and evaluate the incidence and clinical
      significance of recurring novel fusion genes including those associated with the
      BCR-ABL1-like signature and to correlate with MRD status, CR rate, EFS and OS.

      V. To assess whether rs4958351 is correlated with L-asp allergic reaction in the adolescent
      and young adult (AYA) population.

      VI. To assess the incidence of inherited genetic variants in the GR1A1, CEP72, CPA2, TPMT,
      NUDT15, GRIN3A, GRIK1, and other genes (which can be found using a whole genome association
      study [GWAS]), are correlated with increased rates of target toxicities including peripheral
      neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, myelosuppression, neurotoxicity, thrombosis, and
      osteonecrosis, and correlate with treatment discontinuation and other clinical response
      parameters including complete response (CR) rate, EFS, and OS.

      VII. To evaluate asparaginase pharmacokinetics in adolescents and young adults, and
      investigate its correlation with toxicities and treatment outcomes.

      VIII. To investigate the effect of anti-polyethylene glycol (PEG) and anti-agouti signaling
      protein (ASP) antibodies (PEG-ASP) on ASP enzyme activity.

      IX. To measure adherence to oral 6 mercaptopurine (MP) and methotrexate in AYAs with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to examine sociodemographic and behavioral determinants of
      adherence.

      X. To determine the impact of adherence on risk of relapse among AYAs with ALL.

      OUTLINE:

      COURSE I (REMISSION INDUCTION THERAPY): All patients receive allopurinol orally (PO) once
      daily until peripheral blasts and extramedullary disease are reduced and cytarabine
