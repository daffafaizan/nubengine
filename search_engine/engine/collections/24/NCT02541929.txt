           these 6 months.

        -  Participants will receive DHA supplements for the study duration and a compensation for
           each study visit.

        -  Blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of DHA will be measured before and after taking
           DHA.

        -  Brain imaging by MRI will be obtained at baseline and at conclusion of study

        -  This study will help us learn how much of the ingested DHA goes to the brain.
