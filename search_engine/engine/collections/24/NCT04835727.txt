    
      This study is a prospective interventional cohort in clinically quiescence IBD patients in
      Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. At enrollment, clinical information,
      dietary intake, inflammatory markers, and fecal microbiota will be recorded. Dietary intake
      will be assessed by an experienced nutritionist using pictures of food, a dietary
      questionnaire, and patient interviewing. The nutritionist advises the participants to consume
      a semi-vegetarian diet which includes high dietary fiber consumption and low red meat and
      processed food consumption. All patients will be required to send all pictures of food intake
      three days in 1 week before every visit, including two weekdays and one weekend. The dietary
      component will be analyzed using Nutrient calculation computer software INMUCAL-Nutrient V3
      database NB1 (Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University. Nakornpathom. 2013). The study will
      take 1 year including 6 visits (including baseline, 6th weeks, 18th week, 30th week, 42nd
      week, 54th week) for each patient. The primary outcome is the effect of increasing fiber
      diets and decreasing red meat and processed food on maintaining clinical remission in IBD.
      Secondary outcomes are the effect of modifying diet on change of inflammatory markers,
      microbiota, and quality of life.
