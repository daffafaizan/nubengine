      I. To determine doses for the combination of pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) with sorafenib
      (sorafenib tosylate) appropriate for Phase II study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of the combination of pemetrexed and
      sorafenib.

      II. To observe antitumor effects of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pemetrexed disodium and sorafenib tosylate.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) on day 1 every 2 weeks and sorafenib
      tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
