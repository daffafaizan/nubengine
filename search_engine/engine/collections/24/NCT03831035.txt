      trio exome sequencing (less than 16 days between informed consent signature and consultation
      for results presentation to the parents) in 15 infants under the age of 12 months
      hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit. Included patients will have a year of follow-up
      examination.

      The main evaluation criterion is the yield of exome results given to the family before 16
      days. The secondary evaluation criteria are 1/ duration of each step until the results 2/
      diagnosis yield : identification of the etiology 3/ adjustment of medical care allowed by the
      exome diagnosis 4/quantity of blood necessary to achieve diagnosis 5/ duration of hospital
      stay and number of medical consultations in the year following inclusion.

      Exome sequencing will be performed on top of classical analysis ordinarily prescribed.
      Medical care will not be modified until exome results reception. After signature of informed
      consent, blood samples of the infant and both parents will be used for trio exome sequencing,
      which includes 3 steps : the analytical step (blood sample DNA extraction and high-throughput
      sequencing), the bioinformatic step, and the interpretation step.

      The study includes four medical consultations:

      1/consultation with a geneticist for inclusion, 2/consultation with a geneticist to give the
      exome results, 3/ consultation at 3 months after the results for the sanger-confirmation of
      the exome result, 4/ consultation at one year after the inclusion for medical follow-up.
