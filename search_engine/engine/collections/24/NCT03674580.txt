        -  In the first place, that suicidals presents a mental load (cognitive saturation) and an
           activity pain behaviour of their space of the thought by extremely painful peripheral
           cognitive movements (impression that the brain is saturated of thoughts, turbulences,
           internal movements)

        -  Secondly, that suicidals produces a surplus of representations of action, such takes out
           that their vision of the world is saturated of a not integrable kinaesthetic imaging by
           the subject.
