      1:1 ratio: paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy group (TP) and Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome
      Injection/platinum chemotherapy group (PP) (the specific chemotherapy regimens are as
      follows.Chemotherapy to tumor progression or adverse reactions can not be tolerated,
      effective chemotherapy patients with a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy.The primary
      endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were safety and
      overall survival.Also USES the next-generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect patients
      with recurrence after tumor tissues (including chest, ascites, homologous recombination
      pathway in the tumor tissue and peripheral blood ctDNA 11 genetic mutations, rearrangement,
      and so on and so forth, whether patients with analysing the homologous recombination pathways
      for paclitaxel/platinum chemotherapy or Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome Injection/platinum
      chemotherapy has different sensitivity.
