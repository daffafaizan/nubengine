    
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of epcoritamab (GEN3013
      DuoBodyÂ®-CD3xCD20) compared to investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients with
      relapsed, refractory diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma who have failed or are ineligible for
      HDT-ASCT.

      Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1) to either epcoritamab or investigator's choice of
      chemotherapy: R-GemOx (rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) or BR (bendamustine and
      rituximab).
