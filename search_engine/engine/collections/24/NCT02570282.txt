      Screening) and will be scheduled for Visit 1 if eligible. After consent is obtained, study
      participants will undergo Visit 1 at a local gynecology clinic to determine their eligibility
      for continued study participation.

      If the participant meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria,
      they will be scheduled for Visit 2 and Visit 3 of the SST-6007/Placebo Double-Blind, Dosing
      Phase to be conducted at the Sexual Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of Texas at
      Austin. Visit 2 must be within 5 (Â±2) days of Visit 1. One visit will evaluate the
      participant's response to SST-6007 and the other will evaluate the participant's response to
      placebo cream, using the VPP, the Arousometer, and neutral-erotic film presentations. The
      sequence of dosing will be randomly assigned (i.e., placebo cream then SST-6007 or SST-6007
      then placebo cream) according to a computer-generated, randomization. There will be a 4-8 day
      washout period between Visits 2 and 3.

      During each experimental session, physiological and subjective sexual arousal will be
      assessed simultaneously and continuously using the VPP and the Arousometer. Electrical
      activity of the heart will be assessed with an ECG. ECG data will be used to process the VPA
      data. Immediately following completion of each erotic film, subjective sexual arousal,
      subjective perception of genital arousal, and positive and negative affect will be evaluated
      using a self-report 7-point Likert Scale (Film Scale) and the Positive and Negative Affect
      Schedule (PANAS).
