    
      This is a prospective and non-interventional study of participants with ALK+NSCLC. The study
      will seek to determine the real-world differences in the PFS of participants taking
      brigatinib or any FDA approved ALK inhibitor other than crizotinib in routine clinical
      practice and will evaluate participant's quality of life, daily function, general condition,
      and treatment satisfaction.

      The study will enroll approximately 160 participants: 80 participants taking brigatinib, and
      80 participants taking FDA approved ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib. Participants will
      be enrolled in one of the 2 cohorts:

        -  Brigatinib

        -  Any FDA Approved ALK Inhibitor

      This trial will be conducted in the United States. Upon enrollment into the study,
      participants will complete a study-specific Baseline questionnaire and four validated
      instrument questionnaires. After that, participants will complete a study-specific monthly
      questionnaire and four validated instrument questionnaires, which will be made available to
      participants every 30 days. Participants will be sent automatic e-mail reminders every 30
      days when new surveys become available. All participants will receive a notice on completion
      of their participation in the study at approximately 36 months.
