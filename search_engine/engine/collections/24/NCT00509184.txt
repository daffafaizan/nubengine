      combining systemic treatment with the anti CD20 antibody Rituximab (Mabthera(R)) in

      combination's efficacy and safety with an accrual of 85 patients.Primary endpoint of the
      study is progression free survival. Secondary endpoints are response rate to Rituximab,
      complete remission rate at week 18, relapse rate, relapse pattern, relapse free survival,
      overall survival, toxicity and quality of life.
