    
      The aim of the study is to find out if the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) crews are using
      the non-technical skills (teamwork and team leading, communication, decision making,
      situational awareness and task management) in the real practice and how well they use them.
      According to the observations of individual crews by field supervisors the use of
      non-technical skills will be compared between different groups (e.g. resuscitation, trauma,
      medical problems, non-emergency situations etc.). The comparison between the collaborators of
      the study is not the subject of the study.

      Main hypothesis: The EMS crews are using all of the aspects of non-technical skills
      appropriately.

      The field supervision is also the limitation of the study because it is done by different
      observers / supervisors, the observation therefore might by affected by subjective feelings.
      To minimise the subjective view of the situation all of the field supervisors undergo a
      uniform training of non-technical skills and how to observe and evaluate them.
