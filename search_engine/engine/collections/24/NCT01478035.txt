      improvement in therapy.

      Among complications, the presence of seizures may contribute to increase the morbi-mortality.
      Prophylactic phenytoin is used in clinical practice in high risk patients but this use is
      variable because there are not controlled clinical trials demonstrating efficacy along with
      antibiotics and corticosteorids. Pneumococcal episodes are associated to a higher number of
      seizures and a higher mortality especially in elderly patients.

      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the prophylaxis with phenytoin in the prevention of
      seizures in patients with pneumococcal meningitis. Hypothesis: Administration of prophylactic
      phenytoin will reduce the incidence of seizures in patients with pneumococcal meningitis
      older than 50 yrs.

      Methodology: Multicentre, randomized, double blind placebo controlled clinical trial.
      Patients will be included mostly from hospitals from REIPI and CAIBER and randomly assigned
      to receive phenytoin or placebo.

      Sample size has been estimated in 61 patients per group. Antibiotic therapy and ICP
      prophylaxis will be standardized in all centres. Phenytoin administration will be maintained
      during antibiotic therapy. End point will be incidence of seizures during hospital stay and
      overall mortality will be a secondary end-point. Followup visits at 1 and 3 month will be
      performed.
