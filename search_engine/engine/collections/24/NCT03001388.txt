      children with CF significant liver disease and to provide for measurements during clinical
      trials. That global assessment might serve as both a predictor/descriptor of disease course
      but also as a critical biomarker for clinical research. FibroScanÂ® measurement of liver
      stiffness has great potential to fill this void. The underlying hypothesis of this proposal
      is that elastography in addition to US can improved the prediction of the development of a
      nodular liver on US and development of portal hypertension over time in children and young
      adults with CF.
