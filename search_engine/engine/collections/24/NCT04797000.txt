    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Japanese local phase II study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag monotherapy in Japanese adult patients with
      platelet transfusion-dependent lower-risk MDS (IPSS-R very low, low, intermediate risk with
      bone marrow blast count < 5% and cytogenetic very good, good or intermediate risk). Platelet
      transfusion dependence at baseline is defined as receiving platelet transfusion regularly
      with a frequency of 2 or more times within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Platelet
      transfusion should be performed for a patient with platelet counts < 20 X 10^9/L, or with
      hemorrhagic symptoms and platelet counts < 30 X 10^9/L.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of eltrombopag versus placebo in terms of
      the proportion of participants who achieve platelet transfusion independence at Week 24.
