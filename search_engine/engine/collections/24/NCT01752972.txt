      find out an effective drug, the pathogenesis of keratosis should be understood. Spirulina is
      one of the dietary supplements, that improves the symptoms of keratosis. Is this improvement
      related to the levels of zinc, vitamin E and linoleic acid at the site of the keratosis
      (palm)? Ten patients of moderate palmer arsenical keratosis will be treated with spirulina
      powder 10 g/day orally for 12 weeks. Skin extracts will be collected both before and after
      supplementation from the palm and dorsum using a mixture of chloroform and ethanol. Zinc,
      vitamin E and linoleic acid levels will be estimated from the extracts. Similar protocol of
      spirulina administration and the collection of skin extracts will be done in arsenic exposed
      controls (n=10) and healthy volunteers (n=10).
