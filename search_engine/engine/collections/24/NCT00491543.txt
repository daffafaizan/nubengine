    
      Subjects will be male and female, 18 to 75 years old, with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, a
      documented or suspected history of coronary artery disease, and a Haptoglobin type 2-2 (Hp
      2-2) genotype. Subjects on prescribed anti-diabetic and coronary artery disease medications
      may continue to take their medications throughout the study.

      Subjects who qualify will receive active drug (ALT-2074 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg) or placebo
      every 8 hours for 28 days. There will be three sequential cohorts of increasing doses of
      active drug. There will be 2 follow-up visits (Days 35 and 42). Blood and urine tests for
      safety (chemistry and hematology), pharmacokinetics and relevant biomarkers to measure
      inflammation and oxidative stress will be performed throughout the study. Electrocardiograms
      and 24-hour Holter monitoring will also be performed at various time points during the study.
