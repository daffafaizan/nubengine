      losartan (50mg) on social reward in healthy participants will be examined. 90 minutes after
      subjects administrate 50mg losartan or placebo, participants will undergo a social incentive
      delay task. Neural activity will be assessed by the acquisition of functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
