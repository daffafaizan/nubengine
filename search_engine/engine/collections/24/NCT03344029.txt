    
      This study is designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response in terms of
      geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates for the 3 strains (A/H1N1, A-H3N2, and
      B) after a single dose of either the SP Shz TIV or Hualan TIV. Vaccine immune responses will
      be assessed on Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 28 post-vaccination. Solicited reactions will
      be collected from Day 0 up to Day 7 after vaccination, unsolicited non-serious adverse events
      (AEs) will be collected from Day 0 up to Day 28 post-vaccination, and serious AEs will be
      collected from Day 0 up to 6 months post-vaccination.
