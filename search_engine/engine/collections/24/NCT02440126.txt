      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) remains unknown. It is possible that
      persistently high natalizumab levels lead to sustained immune-modulation or suppression
      resulting in an increased PML risk. Since 2010 we have conducted three investigator initiated
      trials (IITs) at our center to measure serum natalizumab concentration, lymphocyte alpha 4
      integrin saturation, and other biomarkers to understand the association of these markers to
      PML risk. A number of the patients who participated in these clinical trials are still
      infusing. These studies have demonstrated that plasma natalizumab concentrations continue to
      rise over time with a plateau effect not yet clearly delineated. Improved drug clearance in
      patients with higher body weight is described in the prescribing information. We have
      accumulated preliminary data suggesting that patients with lower body weight may be at higher
      risk for PML and that this may relate to higher drug concentrations and saturations seen in
      this group. Dose extension may be a viable option to lower drug concentration
      (pharmacokinetic, PK) and saturation (pharmacodynamic, PD) in patients with lower body weight
      to potentially impact PML incidence. In addition to the PK/PD of natalizumab, host related
      biomarkers may allow for more specific PML risk stratification. Further validation of these
      biomarkers is critical for our understanding of their utility.
