      is a persistent problem with a reported incidence as high as 14%. The development of this
      complication necessitates additional surgery in some patients. Numerous etiologies have been
      reported including design of the femoral component. Due to a higher than desired incidence of
      patellar crepitus with the PFC Sigma PS TKA, design modifications of the trochlear groove of
      the femoral component were introduced with the release of the PFC Sigma HP PS femoral
      component. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the incidence of patellar
      crepitus after posterior cruciate substituting TKA utilizing the PFC Sigma vs. the PFC Sigma
      HP PS femoral components.
