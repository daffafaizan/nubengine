        -  To determine the response rate in patients with previously untreated B-cell chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia treated with alemtuzumab and rituximab.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of alemtuzumab and rituximab in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously on days 1, 3, and 5 in weeks 1-18 and
      rituximab IV on day 1 in weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for laboratory biomarker
      studies. Samples are analyzed for surface markers (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD10, CD19, CD20,
      CD25, CD38, CD52, Zap-70) and IgVH by PCR, flow cytometry, and FISH. Samples are also
      analyzed for alemtuzumab and anti-alemtuzumab antibody levels by flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
