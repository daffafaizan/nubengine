      cognitive decline in dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease
      (PD). Deep Brain Stimulation targeting the Globus Pallidus interna (GPi) is an established
      treatment for the motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease, and stimulating the NBM is believed
      to stimulate cognitive function. Targeting these two regions was previously impossible
      because they require different frequency stimulations, but recent developments in DBS
      technology allow for the dual stimulation of these nuclei at different frequencies.

      This phase-II double-blind cross-over pilot trial will investigate the motor and cognitive
      effects as well as the presence of adverse effects of combined NBM and GPi DBS. The main goal
      of this pilot trial is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the multi-targeting
      approach in 6 patients with PDD and disabling motor symptoms.
