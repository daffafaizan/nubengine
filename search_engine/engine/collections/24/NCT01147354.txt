      80 stable patients in the age range of 18-80 years old were found to be eligible for
      enrollment and gave their informed consent to participate in this trial. Subjects were
      excluded if they were prescribed any multivitamins or immunosuppressive drugs or taking
      antioxidant supplements including vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, soy
      extracts and green-tea preparations within 2 months prior to enrollment in the study or if
      they had been hospitalized in the previous month, we also excluded the ones who were pregnant
      or had active infections. The Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences
      reviewed and approved the protocol of this study.These patients were randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio into 2 groups of selenium(200µg) or placebo and were followed for 12 weeks.In order
      to determine the nutritional statuses of all patients, at the baseline, the questions of SGA
      and MIS questionnaire were read to the patients and completed in person by the main
      investigator. The questions of SGA and MIS were also asked by the same person at the end of
      treatment phase.Before the onset of the treatment and after the end of the treatment phase of
      the study, 10cc blood samples were taken from each patient.The blood was taken from the
      patient's arm used for hemodialysis cannula just before the beginning of the hemodialysis
      procedure. The serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 g/min for 5 min and stored at
      -70°C. Serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitive C-reactive
      protein (HSCRP), ferritin, transferrin, homocysteine, calcium , phosphate, parathyroid
      hormone (PTH), albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine as well as hemoglobin (Hb)
      levels were measured in all patients at the baseline and at the end of treatment phase of
      study.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of selenium supplementation on
      oxidative, inflammatory and nutritional markers in hemodialysis patients.
