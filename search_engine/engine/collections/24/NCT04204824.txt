    
      Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common cause of foot pain, affecting an estimated 2 million
      people per year.1 Although there are large numbers of people seeking medical attention for
      this condition, there remains some confusion among health care providers as to the most
      efficacious treatment and some authors conclude that no data solidly supports effectiveness
      of treatment.2 Few randomized control studies have been published with respect to treatment
      of PF with ultrasound. Only one study of this nature was published in 1995 by Crawford et
      al.3 This research found the true ultrasound was no more effective then sham ultrasound and
      the authors concluded that future studies need to clarify ultrasound parameters with respect
      to intensity, duty cycle, frequency, area, duration, dosage, and treatment size.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of ultrasound treatment in addition
      to an exercise program to improve pain and function in individuals with plantar fasciitis.
      The investigator's primary hypothesis is individuals with PF will show a greater improvement
      in pain and function with ultrasound and an exercise program as compared to just an exercise
      program alone.

      Research Questions for each outcome measure:

      1. Following the four week intervention period, the experimental or the True Ultrasound group
      (TUG) group will show a greater improvement in their pain rating during two different time
      intervals: Pain in the previous 24 hours and with initial steps in the morning, as well as
      three different functional activities: Pain during single limb stance, 30 minutes of standing
      during ADLs, and walking 1000meter (.62miles) according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      compared to the control group.

      2 Following the four week intervention period, the experimental group, TUG, will show an
      improved percentage of level of function in ADLs and sports as measured by the Foot and Ankle
      Ability Measure (FAAM) as compared to the control group.

      3 Following the four week intervention period the experimental group, TUG, will demonstrate
      an improved range of motion (ROM) of ankle dorsiflexion in subtalar neutral as measured by a
      goniometer as compared to the control group.

      4 Following a four week intervention period the experimental group, TUG, will demonstrate an
      increase in ankle strength of the Anterior Tibialis, Posterior Tibialis, Peroneus Longus,
      Peroneus Brevis, and Gastrocnemius as measured by a hand held dynamometer as compared to the
      control group.
