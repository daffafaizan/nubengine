      most efficient agents widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.The general
      clinical benefits observed in therapy with MF seem to be greater than expected. They induce
      osteoblast cells to promote early bone formation through AMP kinase (AMPK) activity.
      Moreover, in a recent in vitro study, MF facilitated in the proliferation of MG63 osteoblast
      like cells. Thus, their action in stimulating bone formation has justified their use in the
      treatment of perimplantitis.
