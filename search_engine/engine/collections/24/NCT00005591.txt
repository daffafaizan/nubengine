      response, and quality of life of patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas when treated with cetuximab and gemcitabine. II. Determine the
      safety and toxicity profile of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive a test dose of cetuximab IV over 10
      minutes followed by a 30 minute observation period. Following observation, patients receive a
      loading dose of cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours followed 1 hour later by gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes weekly for 7 weeks. Following 1 week of rest, patients with stable or responding
      disease continue treatment for a maximum of 6 months. During subsequent courses, patients
      receive maintenance doses of cetuximab IV over 1 hour weekly for 8 weeks. Gemcitabine IV is
      administered over 30 minutes weekly for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest, and then
      repeated for a total treatment course of 8 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after
      each course of therapy, and at 3 months after therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months
      until evidence of disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
