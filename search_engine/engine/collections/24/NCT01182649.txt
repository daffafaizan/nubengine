      second-generation DES have been designed with the goal of improving safety and efficacy.
      Everolimus, a sirolimus analogue, is released from a open cell, thin-strut, cobalt-chromium
      frame. A significant reduction in cardiac events was noted in patients with the
      everolimus-eluting stent compared with those who had a paclitaxel-eluting stent. Sirolimus
      eluting stent was the first available drug eluting stent and is the most tested. Therefore
      the investigators compared the safety and efficacy of the everolimus-eluting and sirolimus
      eluting stents in unselected patients in real world practice.
