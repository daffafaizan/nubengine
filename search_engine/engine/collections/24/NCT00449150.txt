      of cetrorelix pamoate that provides prolonged improvement in BPH-related signs and symptoms.

      Patients will enter a 4-week run-in no-treatment observation period to confirm severity and
      stability of voiding symptoms based on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).

      Patients will then be allocated to study drug in a double-blind, randomized, double-dummy,
      placebo-controlled fashion.

      Patients will be administered an IM injection of study drug at Week 0, 2, 26 and 28 and will
      be followed up to Week 52.

      Then, in an open label fashion, patients will be administered an IM injection of study drug
      at Week 52, 54, 78 and 80 and will be followed up to Week 90.
