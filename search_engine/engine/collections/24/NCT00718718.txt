      that the participant receives), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the
      medication has a real effect in a clinical study) study. This study will be conducted in 2
      parts (Part A and Part B). Each part consists of 3 phases: screening (approximately 1 month
      prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (Part A: 22 weeks and Part B: 24
      weeks), and follow-up phase (approximately 4 months after the last administration of study
      medication). In Part A, participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive CNTO
      136 100 mg and placebo for 22 weeks. All participants in Part A, will be crossed over at Week
      12 from placebo to CNTO 136 (for Group 1) and from CNTO 136 to placebo (for Group 2). In Part
      B, participants will be randomly assigned to 5 groups to receive placebo and/or 1 of 3 doses
      of CNTO 136 (100mg, 50mg or 25mg) for 24 weeks. Participants in Part B, Group 1 will be
      crossed over at Week 12 from placebo to CNTO 136. All participants should be maintained on a
      stable dose of MTX for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of study medication through Week
      24. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, clinical
      findings, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be
      approximately 42 weeks.
