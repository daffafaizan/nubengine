      either directly, or by measuring gastric or urinary bladder pressure. However, in patients
      with morbid obesity, the correlations between gastric and urinary bladder pressures with IAP
      have not been addressed. The investigator's aim was to assess the correlations between IAP
      and gastric and urinary bladder pressure in patients with morbid obesity, at normal and
      elevated levels of IAP, and to examine the effects of increasing IAP and patient position on
      hemodynamic and respiratory parameters.
