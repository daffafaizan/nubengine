      CNS. Patients will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to receive either DHPG or no
      study drug treatment. All babies in the study will receive standard of care treatment and
      clinical, diagnostic, laboratory, safety, and follow-up evaluations. Follow-up evaluations,
      including hearing and eye exams and developmental assessments, will be done periodically
      until the child reaches 5 years of age. The degree of improved hearing among surviving
      patients will be a primary measure of drug effectiveness.
