      interfering with certain cell structures and killing the cancer cells. Abraxane is the first
      albumin-bound taxane particle of approximately 130 nanometers that takes advantage of
      albumin, a natural carrier of water-insoluble molecules (e.g., various nutrients, vitamins,
      and hormones) found in humans. Albumin is a protein that acts as the body's key transporter
      of nutrients and other water-insoluble molecules and selectively accumulates in tumor
      tissues.

      The delivery of chemotherapy/hormone therapy in a setting of androgen-independent prostate
      cancer has demonstrated: survival benefit associated with a PSA decline and tolerable
      toxicity, thus strongly suggesting that disease modifying potential exists. Preclinical data
      supports the benefit of simultaneous chemotherapy/hormonal therapy and androgen deprivation.
      The stage is set for chemotherapy/hormonal therapy to be given earlier in men with prostate
      cancer. Data suggests a transformation from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent
      phenotype is mediated by the expansion of an androgen-independent clone already present at
      the time of androgen deprivation. If this model is correct, it would be feasible to bring
      chemotherapy/hormonal therapy up front when the corresponding tumor burden is minimal.

      It is hoped that by bringing therapy against all components of the tumor initially, the
      emergence of androgen-independent growth will be delayed, ultimately prolonging patient
      survival. This study will test this hypothesis of Abraxane plus hormonal therapy followed by
      standard hormonal therapy.
