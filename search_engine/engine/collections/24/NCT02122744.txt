      determines a reduction of frequency of migraine in a previous study. After 2 weekly sessions
      for a month, the investigators demonstrated a reduction of 47% in migraine frequency. In this
      study, the investigators aim to compare rTMS QP effect with the placebo effect and to
      evaluate if rTMS QP is capable to induce changes in VEP, CHEPS and QST.
