      increasing incidence. It includes two major forms, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC), which are distinct chronic bowel-relapsing inflammatory disorders (Gharagozloo
      et al., 2015). Ulcerative colitis (UC) is limitd to Mucosa and cause continuous bowel
      inflammation (Celikbilek et al., 2013) While Crohn disease is more complex because of its
      transmural inflammation and it is characterized by skip lesions, which are diseased sections
      of bowel next to uninvolved areas(Nishijima David L; Wisner, David H; Holmes, James F, 2016).
      The prevalence of IBD is highest in the second to third decade of life with another peak in
      the 60-70- year-old group.(Silva et al., 2016) Non-invasive tests, such as C reactive protein
      (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and white blood cells (WBC) are therefore being
      increasingly recognized as important markers for initial diagnosis and disease activity
      detection.(Gao et al., 2015) In recent years, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR),
      calculated as total neutrophil count divided by total lymphocyte count, NLR represents two
      different immune pathways and can be easily derived directly from a standard blood
      test..(Argeny et al., 2018)
