      galantamine is unique since it has a dual mode of action: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
      and modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.As Parkinson's disease (PD) impacts
      frontal systems, executive cognition rather than memory function (mediated by medial
      temporal) would be the targeted area for potential improvement. This single center, double
      blind, placebo controlled study compares a group of PD patients treated with galantamine to a
      group of PD patients who are not treated with this medication on a series of cognitive tasks
      that examine attention and executive control.
