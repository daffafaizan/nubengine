      headache, central/neuropathic), prevalence, location, duration, and associations with
      demographic, injury severity, current level of functioning and comorbidities in participants
      followed in ten Centers participating in the National Institute on Disability, Independent
      Living and Rehabilitation Research and the Department of Veterans Affairs TBIMS Databases; 2)
      Identify extreme groups based on responses to pain (interference and perception of
      improvement with treatment), or chronic pain extreme phenotypes, in order to define the key
      differences between those who have a good outcome and those who do not, across factors
      related to injury, pain severity/location, demographics, and treatment history; and 3)
      Identify treatment practices by clinicians who treat comorbid TBI and chronic pain to
      determine gaps in availability/accessibility of guideline level treatment, highlighting
      underserved populations where applicable.

      Results from this study will provide a more detailed picture of the problem of chronic pain
      after TBI by examining the types of pain that occur after TBI, which may be multiple types of
      pain for a subset of individuals, as well as the frequency of comorbid conditions.
      Identifying extreme phenotypes, such as demographic, individual, and treatment factors
      associated with those who have chronic pain but have minimal interference compared to those
      who are significantly impacted by pain, will allow us to identify treatment targets
      (behavioral, cognitive, biological, and molecular) to advance a personalized medicine
      approach to treatment unlike any approach in TBI and chronic pain to date. Outcomes from this
      study will include educational materials on chronic pain and pain treatment to benefit
      patients, family members, clinicians, and policymakers. Data from this study will have a
      direct impact on clinical practice, informing future work, and promoting understanding of
      constituent factors in extreme phenotypes.
