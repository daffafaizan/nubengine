      obstacle for examination, positioning for receiving neuroaxial anesthesia and postoperative
      mobility and physiotherapy.

      With the introduction of ultrasound in regional anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks,
      regional analgesia float to the surface as a substitute for opioids with less side effects.
      Of the many techniques to provide regional analgesia for hip fractures; fascia iliaca block
      was widely used with good results. In 2018 Pericapsular Nerve Group Block was introduced to
      provide regional analgesia for hip fractures with interesting results.

      In this study the investigators are going to compare Pericapsular Nerve Group Block and
      Fascia Iliaca Block to find the best way to provide analgesia for elderly patients with hip
      fracture in the pre- and post-operative periods.
