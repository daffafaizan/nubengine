    
      This is a multicenter, randomized (study medication assigned by chance), active-controlled,
      parallel, 3-arm study. Patients will be randomly (allocation to treatments available by
      chance) assigned in 3:5:5 ratio to receive one of three treatments groups. The three
      treatment groups are: Group 1 - CNTO 1275 45 mg dosing at weeks 0 and 4, Group 2 - CNTO 1275
      90 mg dosing at weeks 0 and 4, Group 3 - Etanercept 50 mg two times per week through week 12.
      The total duration for each participant will be up to 64 weeks (approximately 16 months). The
      active-controlled portion of the study is from Week 0 to Week 12 during which the efficacy
      and safety of etanercept and 2 dose levels of CNTO 1275 will be evaluated. Treatment after
      Week 12 is dependent on Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) response at Week 12 and initial
      treatment assignment. Patients will receive 2 subcutaneous injections of CNTO 1275 (either 45
      or 90 mg doses) or twice weekly injections of etanercept during the first twelve weeks of the
      study. Patients may receive two additional doses of CNTO 1275 (either 45 or 90 mg doses) up
      to week 44.
