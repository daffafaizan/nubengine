    
      This is an open-label multicenter trial for patients with severe haemophilia A with
      inhibitors to FVIII and without inhibitors as control. The trial consists of 4 periods:
      Screening, Stage A, Stage B and Safety Follow-up.

      After signing informed consent, patients are assessed for eligibility during a Screening
      period lasting up to 21 days.

      All eligible patients enter Stage A - Regimen estimation. The non-inhibitor patients receive
      a single IV injection at a dose of 35 IU/kg FVIII reconstituted with Water For Injection.
      Following a 4-day wash-out period, these patients as well as patients with inhibitors receive
      a single IV injection of FVIII-PEGLip at a dose of 35 IU/kg FVIII + PEGLip 22 mg/kg to
      determine the duration of haemostatic cover and therefore required injection frequency to
      prevent bleeds.

      Stage B - multiple dosing: all patients receive injections of FVIII-PEGLip for 6 weeks at a
      frequency determined in Stage A for each individual patient.

      Safety follow-up: 15 and 30 days after the last injection of FVIII-PEGLip, patients are
      contacted for any adverse events or bleeding episodes.
