      regimens for acute PID. Women with acute PID will be randomized to one of two treatment
      regimens. One group of women will receive a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg,
      doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 14 days, along with placebo tablets orally twice a
      day for 14 days. The second group of women will receive the same doses of ceftriaxone and
      doxycycline, and metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 14 days. The primary objective
      is to compare the eradication of anaerobic organisms from the upper genital tract in women
      with acute PID who receive standard outpatient antibiotic treatment to the eradication of
      these organisms from the upper genital tract in women who receive standard outpatient
      treatment along with a two-week course of metronidazole. Women will be followed for one month
      for clinical outcomes, and will undergo assessment for clearance of microorganisms from the
      upper genital tract. Our hypothesis is that an antibiotic treatment regimen that includes
      anaerobic coverage will more effectively clear anaerobic organisms from the endometrium in
      women with acute PID compared to a standard antibiotic treatment regimen lacking effective
      antibiotic coverage against anaerobes.
