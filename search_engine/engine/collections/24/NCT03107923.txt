      myocardial contractile reserve can predict adverse outcome after TAVI. We intend to examine
      preoperative myocardial contractile reserve by use a low dose dobutamine test and relate this
      to pre-existing myocardial focal and diffuse myocardial fibrosis detected by new cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods and new echocardiographic methods. These measures
      will be primarily related to long term (12 months) mortality.
