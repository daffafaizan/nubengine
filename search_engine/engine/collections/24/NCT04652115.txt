    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, two-cohort, phase 2 pilot study that will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of defibrotide in clinically severe COVID-19. The defibrotide dose
      that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of post-HSCT VOD/SOS (6.25 mg/kg IV q6 hours)
      will be used.

      Cohort 1 will consist of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by PCR and radiography,
      who are hospitalized with an oxygen requirement (either supplemental O2 or mechanical
      ventilation), are not on therapeutic dose anticoagulation, and require no more than one
      vasopressive agent to maintain hemodynamic stability. Cohort 2 will consist of patients with
      COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by PCR and radiography, who are hospitalized in the ICU and are
      at elevated risk of hemorrhage and/or hypotension, the former defined as a requirement for
      therapeutic dose anticoagulation for active thrombosis, ECMO, or CRRT, and the latter defined
      as a requirement for two vasopressive agents to maintain hemodynamic stability.

      In cohort 2 only, a 6+6 dose de-escalation design will be utilized, in which if 2 of 6 DLTs
      are experienced in the first 6 subjects, the dose will be reduced from 6.25 mg/kg IV q6hrs to
      10mg/kg/d CIVI. If there are 0 or 1 DLTs in the first 6 subjects at the FDA-approved dose,
      another 6 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose. Grade 3/4 hemorrhage and significant
      new hypotension will be considered DLT's.
