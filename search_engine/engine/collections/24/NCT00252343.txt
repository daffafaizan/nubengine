      SR58611A (350 mg q12) compared to placebo in patients with generalized anxiety disorder
      (GAD), using escitalopram (10 mg qd) as a positive control. This is an 8-week, double-blind,
      randomized, 3-parallel-group, placebo- and escitalopram-controlled, study.A 1-week, placebo,
      single-blind period precedes the 8-week randomized treatment period. A Safety Follow up Visit
      (Segment C) is scheduled 1 week after the acute treatmentperiod (Segment B) or early
      termination. This trial is designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      SR58611A to placebo. In this study, escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) antidepressant, is used as a positive control and has been chosen as the comparator
      agentas it is approved for treatment of GAD at a dose of 10 mg once daily.
