      microbiome. The participants use two sprays: one spray containing the bacteria, and the other
      nothing (placebo). Participants do not know which spray they have. They use one spray during
      one month, and meanwhile take samples of their underarm microbiome (for sequencing), volatome
      (for GC/MS analysis) and odor (for odor panel analysis). Samples are stored in the freezer
      and brought to the university after one month, when they receive the second spray. The
      bacterial spray contains bacteria that are correlated with good underarm odor.
