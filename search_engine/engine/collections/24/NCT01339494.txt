      General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Texas Children's Hospital. Each time they will
      stay for five days, during which a special diet will be provided. Nitric oxide production
      will be measured by stable isotopes infusion technique that involves placing small tubes in
      veins (IV catheter), blood sampling, and injecting a harmless stable isotope. Stable isotopes
      are forms of normal compounds that can be measured accurately. They are not radioactive and
      there are no known risks to giving them; they are already part of your body in small amounts.

      During the first admission nitric oxide levels will be measured, then arginine
      supplementation will be provided for 48 hours, after which nitric oxide levels will be
      re-measured to determine the effect of arginine supplementation. During the second admission,
      the effect of citrulline supplementation will be measured.

      Who can participate in the study? Adults or children affected with MELAS syndrome and
      carrying the DNA change that causes the condition (3243 A>G mutation) can participate. Adults
      without MELAS disease will be recruited to participate as control subjects.
