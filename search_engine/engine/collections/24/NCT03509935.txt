    
      This is a single-center randomized clinical trial to be performed at the Adult Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU) of the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo
      Horizonte. The ICU is a clinical-surgical unit that has 18 beds with admission of
      approximately 100 patients per month, being 70% surgical patients and 30% clinical patients.
      Postoperative patients who meet the inclusion criteria reported below will be randomized to
      guide therapy according to ultrasound findings at the bedside versus a group that will not
      perform this method. Serum and urine samples will be collected in three times: admission
      (T0), after 12 hours (T1) and after 24 hours (T2) to analysed urine and serum biomarkers.
