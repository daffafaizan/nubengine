      that equi-minimum alveolar concentration of various volatile anesthetic agents may produce
      different spectral entropy or bispectral index values. However, there were no studies that
      demonstrate the difference of hypnotic potency using power spectral analysis of
      electroencephalographic signals (e.g., spectral edge frequency 95%, total power, % value of
      each bandage). The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare hypnotic effect of
      sevoflurane and desflurane at equal minimum alveolar concentrations using power spectral
      analysis of the electroencephalogram.
