    
      The need for this trial arises out of 1) the rapidly increasing number of pts > 60 years of
      age with AF accompanied by symptoms and morbidity, 2) the failure of anti-arrhythmic drug
      therapy to maintain sinus rhythm and reduce mortality, 3) the rapidly increasing application
      of radio-frequency catheter ablation without appropriate evidence-based validation, and 4)
      the expanding impact of AF on health care costs.

      This study will randomize up to 2200 patients to a strategy of catheter ablation versus
      pharmacologic therapy with rate or rhythm control drugs. Each pt will have 1) characteristics
      similar to AFFIRM pts (≥65 yo or <65 with >1 risk factor for stroke, 2) Documented AF
      warranting treatment, and 3) Eligibility for both catheter ablation and ≥2 anti-arrhythmic or
      ≥2 rate control drugs. Pts will be followed every 6 months for an average of approximately 5
      years and will undergo repeat trans-telephonic monitor, Holter monitor, and CT/MR studies to
      assess the impact of treatment.

      The CABANA trial will disclose the role of medical and non-pharmacologic therapies for AF,
      establish the cost and impact of therapy on quality of life and will help determine if AF is
      a modifiable risk factor for increased mortality.
