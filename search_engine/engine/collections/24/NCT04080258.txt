    
      Headache is one of the most common medical complaints in childhood, with migraine and
      tension-type headaches (TTHs) being the most frequent diseases. The prevalence of
      tension-type headache (TTH) varies from 10% to 25% in school children and adolescents.
      Therefore a range varying from 0,1% to 5,9% of this population presents chronic tension-type
      headache, occuring at least 15 days on a monthly basis.

      The tension-type headache is most likely multifactorial. In children, a connection seems
      possible between tension-type headache and psychosocial stress, psychiatric disorders,
      muscular stress, or oromandibular dysfunction.

      The treatment of tension-type headache covers a systemic approach that includes both
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, such as biobehavioural management, and patient
      and family education regarding lifestyle modifications to develop and/or maintain healthy
      habits. Efficacy of these therapies is still unclear. Complementary therapies could be a good
      support to pharmacologic treatment. Osteopathic treatment results effective in some
      paediatric conditions, but in primary headache the possible efficacy is still unknown.
