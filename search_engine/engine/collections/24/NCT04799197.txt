      combination prevention intervention to improve HIV prevention continuum outcomes including
      the development of community-informed strategies for subsequent RCTs. We will conduct a
      one-arm pilot of the adapted multicomponent trauma-informed intervention named "Kickin it
      with the Gurlz." We will collect feasibility and acceptability data related to identifying,
      recruiting, enrolling, intervening with, and retaining participants (i.e. recruitment length,
      screening procedures, feasibility of conducting sessions, intervention acceptability,
      retention rates, feasibility of verifying self-reported and medical chart review data on PrEP
      use, and exit interviews with participants and staff at program conclusion). We will recruit
      30 participants into the pilot study. Participants will complete baseline, end of program,
      and 3-month post-intervention follow-up surveys. Exit interviews and interviews with key
      stakeholders will identify strategies for implementing trauma-informed HIV prevention
      efficacy trials with transgender women of color within close-knit communities, such as
      acceptable and feasible control conditions, acceptable and feasible violence and gender
      affirmation screening, biomedical confirmation methods, contamination concerns, and potential
      changes needed within existing health care systems.
