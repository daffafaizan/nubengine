      hemorrhage with a varied incidence about once in every 200 live births. It is considered one
      of the causes of the increased need for blood transfusion and cesarean hysterectomy. PPH due
      to PP typically starts during cesarean section (CS) in the placental bed, at the lower
      uterine segment mostly after placental separation. Proceeding for cesarean hysterectomy can
      be the only effective line of management in spite of the associated high morbidity rate.

      Tranexamic acid is a lysine analog which acts as an antifibrinolytic via competitive
      inhibition of the binding of plasmin and plasminogen to fibrin. The rationale for its use in
      the reduction of blood loss depending on the implication of the coagulation and fibrinolysis
      processes implicated in the control of PPH. However, concerns about possible thromboembolic
      events with parenteral administration of TA have stimulated increasing interest in its
      topical use.
