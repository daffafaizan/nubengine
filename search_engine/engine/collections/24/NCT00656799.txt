      complex in participants with severe renal impairment. A dose of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex was
      administered 15 minutes after administration of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Blood and dialysate
      samples were collected before, during and after hemodialysis/filtration, for calculation of
      clearance of sugammadex-rocuronium complex and assessment of rebound.
