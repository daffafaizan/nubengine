      rate increase during the past 30 years . It is the leading cause of death of cancer in man
      and 2nd in women. With the development of gefitinib and erlotinib, EGFR-TKI (epidermal growth
      factor receptor -tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is the most successful novel drugs developed for
      the treatment of these patients in recent years, especially for NSCLC patients in Asia
      including China. Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of Chinese scientists and
      clinician. It appears to be at least as good as gefitinib in terms of efficacy and better in
      terms of safety in phase I/II trials. In this study, a randomized, double-blind, gefitinib as
      control, multi-center phase III trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      icotinib in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients after failure of 1 or 2 chemotherapy.
      PFS (progress free survival) is the primary end-point with OS (overall survival), ORR
      (objective response), TTP (time to progress), HRQOL and safety as the secondary end-point. A
      total of 400 patients will be recruited. EGFR and K-ras gene mutational analysis as well as a
      population PK study have also been proposed.
