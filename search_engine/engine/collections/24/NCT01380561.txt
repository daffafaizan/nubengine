      in healthy male volunteers. The purposes of this study is to determine the excretion of total
      [14C] derived radioactivity and the metabolite profile after a single oral dose of [14C]
      asimadoline as well as to identify and quantitate the metabolites of asimadoline in plasma,
      urine, and feces after single and multiple oral doses of asimadoline.
