      characterized by calcification of dermal arterioles.

      There are significant gaps in the understanding of the pathophysiology and risk factors for
      calciphylaxis. At present, there is no effective treatment. Uncertain pathobiology, rare
      incidence and lack of collaborative approach have been some of the major limiting factors
      towards treating calciphylaxis.

      The Partners Calciphylaxis Biorepository (PCB) aims to address these gaps within
      calciphylaxis research by utilizing existing and, when necessary, developing new
      infrastructure to support the consent of patients and the collection of dedicated samples for
      a calciphylaxis repository.

      This repository is working in collaboration with the Partners Biobank as they will still be
      receiving samples from the PCB and storing them and distributing them according to their own
      procedures.
