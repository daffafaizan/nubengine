      is as much as 48 weeks for common conditions like gallstones, inguinal hernia and sinus
      pilonidalis. Electronic standardised referrals sent by the Norwegian Healthcare Network, and
      booking of surgery by the general practitioner might be a way to reduce the waiting time and
      increase the cost effectiveness of outpatient surgery.

      The trial is designated as a randomized controlled trial were selected patients (inguinal
      hernia, gall stone disease and sinus pilonoidalis) referred to the university hospital, were
      either randomized to direct electronic referral and booking for outpatient surgery (one
      stop), or using the traditional patient pathway where all patients are seen at the outpatient
      clinic several weeks before surgery.
