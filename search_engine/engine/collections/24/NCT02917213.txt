    
      An acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a clinical situation that entails an increased risk
      of both subclinical and clinically devastating cardioembolic events. This increased risk of
      embolic phenomena may be related to blood stasis caused by alterations in the blood flow
      inside the left ventricle (LV) after AMI. Using flow velocity measurements obtained by
      cardiac MRI and Doppler-echocardiography it is possible to quantify the stasis in the LV and
      assess its relation to the risk of embolic events. The ability of cardiac imaging (cardiac
      MRI and Doppler-echocardiography) post-processing tools to predict embolic events in a cohort
      of 92 patients with a first AMI and left ventricular dysfunction shall be addressed. The
      potential confusion generated by the possible existence of paroxysmal AF will be controlled
      by implanting cardiac monitoring devices in random order in a subset of patients.
