      expected to improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
      Tislelizumab is a new immunotherapy agent with independent intellectual property rights in
      China, which is highly efficient and safe. It is of great value to combine Tislelizumab with
      ablation to reduce the risk of recurrence in HCC patients. In this study, early-stage HCC
      patients with high risk of recurrence would be included and randomly assigned to receive
      ablation plus Tislelizumab or ablation alone. The tumor recurrence, overall survival and
      safety would be observed and recorded to analyze whether Tislelizumab can reduce the
      recurrence rate.
