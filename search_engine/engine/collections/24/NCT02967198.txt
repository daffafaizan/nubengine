      percutaneous liver biopsy is very important technique to confirm the diagnosis of focal
      hepatic lesion whether benign or malignancy.

      For successful and safe procedure, safe access route and lesion visibility are essential ,
      and the conditions are usually evaluated on pre-procedure planning ultrasonography (USG).
      However, these procedure is sometimes aborted due to limited sonic window of various cause
      and challenging identification of small isoechoic tumors or hepatocellular carcinomas among
      dysplastic nodules . Therefore, precise targeting and assuring safe route would be of
      clinical importance. In this preliminary study, investigators attempted to determine US and
      CT/MR fusion technique would be able to improve RFA or liver biopsy feasibility in patients
      with liver tumors in comparison with conventional US alone technique.

      In addition, to assess intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of a new point shear-wave
      elastography method (pSWE, S-shear wave) and compare its accuracy in assessing liver
      stiffness (LS) with another pSWE technique (ARFI).
