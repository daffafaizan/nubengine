      overuse of the biceps muscles. The long-term accumulated and poor repaired trauma causes
      myofascial trigger points in the related muscles. Common symptoms are pain in the anterior
      shoulders and radiating pain in the biceps. Pain can be further elicited with lifting,
      pulling and repetitive overhead activity. Therefore, it can have a major impact on the
      patient's activity of daily life.

      Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN), as one of the dry needle treatments, performed by swaying a
      disposable Fu's subcutaneous needle parallel to the underlying muscles after penetrating the
      skin to the subcutaneous fascia. With the reperfusion activities, myofascial pain and soft
      tissue pain caused by myofascial trigger points can be decreased effective simultaneously. So
      far, there is no solid research or clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment
      yet.

      We will conduct the randomized, open label experiment to evaluate the immediate, short-term,
      and long-term effect of FSN. Outcome measures include visual analog scale, shoulder pain and
      disability index, pressure pain threshold, muscle tone changes and ultrasonographic evaluaton
      of biceps peritendinous effusion.
