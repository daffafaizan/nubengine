    
      This study is dedicated to investigate the impact of routinely prescribed hypoglycaemic
      treatments on the prevalence of severe retinopathy and to seek possible biomarkers of severe
      retinopathy. Hypoglycemic treatments taken by the patients are those prescribe by the usuel
      diabetogist in the context of routine care.

      The study includes T2D patients according to ADA criteria treated with any kind of
      hypoglycemic treatment and attending a diabetes center (three in Marseille: Department of
      Endocrinology, Hôpital Nord, Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Marseille and Service
      d'Ophtalmologie, Hôpital Saint-Joseph and Service de Diabétologie, Hôpital Saint-Joseph, and
      two in Paris : Centre Universitaire du Diabète et de ses Complications Hôpital Lariboisière,
      Université Paris 7, Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Paris and Service d'Endocrinologie,
      Diabétologie et Nutrition, Hôpital Bichat).

      It consists of two visits: Visits1 "Inclusion" and Visits 2 "three years after the
      inclusion". In each visit, the investigators will collect results of eye examination (fundus)
      and annual diabetes check up including anthropometric data, routine biology, diabetes
      complication status as well as medications taken by the patients (past and current). A
      bio-banking (blood, urine and hairs) will be also collected. Primary objective : to compare
      the prevalence of severe DR in patients exposed to incretin therapy (GLP-1 analogs or DPP4
      inhibitors) to that in non-exposed patients at baseline.

      Secondary objective: To compare the proportion of patients who worsen DR between V1
      (inclusion) and V2 (after 3-yr of treatment) in patients exposed to incretin-based therapy
      from baseline vs non-exposed patients: patients with no DR or mild to moderate non
      proliferative DR at V1 who progress to severe DR at V2.

      To evaluate whether the concentrations of angiogenic/inflammatory molecules and circulating
      endothelial and inflammatory cells are associated with severe DR in relation with the use of
      GLP-1 based therapy at V1 and V2.
