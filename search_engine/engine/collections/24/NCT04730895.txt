      the expected long term side effects of spike protein based vaccine which may vary from
      thrombosis, platelet aggregation, autoantibodies against ACE2, to lung damage and other ACE2
      expressing cell damage. This clinical study is conducted on 360 adult male and female
      participants, Here, we submitted this clinical trial depending on studies with up to date
      literature guidance to indicate that 13 cis Retinoic Acid will provide complete protection
      against COVID-19 and will be better option for effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine owing to
      its ability to induce mucosal IgA antibodies that are less prone to ADE phenomenon and
      responsible for passive mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract. Retinoic acid strengthens
      mucosal immunity via inducing IgA antibodies and considered potent IgA isotype Furthermore,
      its impact on ACE2 receptors, Memory T cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, Neutrophil Chetnotaxis,
      Interferon Type1, Thrombin, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), toll-like receptor 3
      (TLR3), mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), papain-like protease (PLpro), and
      Interleukin 6 ( Il-6).

      The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly binds with the host cell surface Angiotensin-converting
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitating virus entry, invading and
      replication.[1][5][6][7][8][9][10].Further analysis even suggested that COVID-19 recognizes
      human ACE2 more efficiently than SARS-CoV increasing the ability of COVID-19 to transmit from
      human to human [11][12] Upregulation of human ACE2 enhanced and induced disease severity in a
      mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, demonstrating that viral entry into cells is a critical
      step[13][14] Receiving Vaccine based on COVID-19 spike protein may increase the risk of
      Cellular ACE2 autoimmunity via production of autoantibodies . Many studies demonstrated that
      autoimmune response to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2) induced by forced presentation
      of the ACE2 protein in a complex with CoV Spike protein in Fc Receptor positive Antigen
      Presenting Cells in the lung [3][4] According to this we hypothesis that spike proteins
      produced by Vaccine based on the spike protein which would potentially bind to the elevated
      levels of soluble ACE2 enzyme. This complex of spike protein with multiple soluble ACE2
      enzymes which is similar to COVID-19 binding with cellular and soluble ACE2 will be presented
      to macrophages to highlight antigens for antibody production. It is very possible that Abs
      will be produced that target the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 of host cells enzyme. The
      combination of the virus spike protein or vaccine spike protein with the soluble ACE2
      receptor becomes antigenic, which may cause the formation of antibodies against not only the
      virus spike protein or vaccine spike protein , but also parts of the ACE and ACE2 receptor.
      Therefore we hypothesize that Vaccines based on the spike protein might initiate
      Autoantibodies and T cells to ACE2 via binding of spike protein particles produced by vaccine
      with its receptors ACE2 and The development of autoantibodies to ACE2 might make damage to
      the host epithelial cell in lungs and the other different organs which express ACE2 in lung,
      heart and kidney would lead to inflammation at those sites. This pattern of lung injury also
      occurs in Pulmonary Hypertension secondary to Scleroderma with elevated levels of anti ACE2
      antibodies.[73][78].In addition, we expect that any drug upregulation of ACE2 as in diabetic
      and hypertensive patients will increase the risk of autoantibodies in case of immunization by
      Vaccine based on the COVID-19 spike protein. As a result we think that covid-19 vaccine
      developer should use a suitable ACE2 modulator to decrease this possible risk via helping in
      formation of antibodies targeting spike protein not antibodies targeting ACE2 and spike
      protein complex which may increase the risk of cellular ACE2 auto antibodies , The COVID-19
      vaccine may be altered each year to counter changes to circulating strains therefore, the
      possible risk of cellular ACE2 damage by autoantibodies produced by vaccine based on COVID-19
      vaccine may increase with vaccination .After searching, we found a study analyzed a broad set
      of 672 clinically approved drugs for treatment in cell lines demonstrated that isotretinoin
      was the potent and strongest downregulator of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
      receptors [15] and further, studies reported that it may prevent the cellular entry of
      SARS-CoV-2 and can be a taken as a targeted therapy in COVID-19 [16][17][18]. The primary
      isomers of RA formed in vivo are 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) and All-trans-Retinoic Acid
      (atRA) and; each binds separate RA receptor types, thus acting upon a select subset of genes
      [76]. 13cRA is a synthetic form that may function similar to the other produced isoforms, or
      by isomerization to atRA and 9c RA. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear; in
      other words, therefore we hypothesis that isotretinoin binds directly to ACE2 receptors and
      leads to its downregulation via blocking ACE2 binding capacity and this mechanism may lead to
      block of COVID-19 binding to cellular and soluble ace2 receptors
