      within the visual ways.

      Symptomatic and asymptomatic retinal axonal loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) have largely been
      described. Many recent optical coherence tomography (OCT) studies have suggested that
      subclinical retinal axonal loss (no past history of optic neuritis [ON]) observed in MS
      mainly due to inflammatory and demyelinating lesions within the optic radiations and a
      retrograde transsynaptic degenerative process. None of these studies clearly tried to
      investigate the role of asymptomatic optic nerve lesion(s) in subclinical retinal axonal loss
      occurence.

      The main objective of the study is to measure the exact role of silent optic nerve lesion in
      the occurrence of silent retinal axonal loss by performing OCT, brain and optic nerve MRI.
      The study will focus on a cohort of patients without recent disease activity in order to
      exclude or minimize the risk of recent and old lesion occurence on the visual ways, which
      could be a bias in our analysis.
