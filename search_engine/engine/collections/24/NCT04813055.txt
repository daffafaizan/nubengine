    
      This is an observational, prospective, single centre study. This registry aims to evaluate
      long-term clinical success of EUS-guided therapeutic interventions (T-EUS), as well as
      adverse events, and clinical and technical variables asociated with clinical success and
      adverse events.

      For the purpose of this registry, the following procedures will be considered to be T-EUS
      procedures:

        -  EUS-guided collection drainage

        -  EUS-guided biliary drainage

        -  EUS-guided gallbladder drainage

        -  EUS-guided gastro-enterostomy

        -  EUS-directed ERCP

        -  EUS-guided pancreatic duct drainage

      Each patient will be assigned to a procedure following standard clinical practice, in most
      instances following a routinely multidisciplinary discussion.

      All patients eligible for the abovementioned clinical indications, but finally undergoing
      alternative procedures (e.g. surgical interventions, percutaneous interventions or other
      endoscopic procedures) will be proposed to be enrolled in the registry as "controls". The
      same variables will be collected, with the exception of technical variables related to the
      EUS-guided intervention.
