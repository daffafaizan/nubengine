    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and toxicity of lenalidomide, umbralisib and
      ublituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) or
      mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) for patients with relapsed or refractory
      follicular lymphoma (FL) treated at the RP2D.

      II. Determine duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment
      failure and overall survival (OS) for patients with relapsed or refractory FL treated at the
      RP2D.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide and umbralisib.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and umbralisib PO QD
      on days 1-28. Beginning in cycle 2, patients also receive ublituximab intravenously (IV) over
      90 minutes to 4 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a partial or
      complete response after cycle 6 continue treatment of lenalidomide PO QD and umbralisib PO QD
      for 12 additional cycles, and ublituximab IV on day 1 of subsequent even cycles (8, 10, 12,
      14, 16, and 18). Patients with stable disease after cycle 6 may continue on treatment for an
      additional 12 cycles at the discretion of the investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 8 weeks, and then every
      6 months for 2 years.
