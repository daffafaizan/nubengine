      modification intervention that incorporates rehabilitation approaches to improve the
      participation of physical activities (PA) among sedentary older adults with type 2 diabetes.
      The intervention is developed based on well-established health behavior theory (i.e.,
      self-regulation) and the conceptual framework from the World Health Organization, with
      several innovations not previously investigated in this population. The intervention:

        1. is tailored based on individual's unique patterns of daily PA performed within his/her
           environment as opposed to the total amount of PA performed in a day or a recall of
           activities over some time period;

        2. uses an accelerometer-assisted, field-based method to address the individual's unique
           physical and social environment;

        3. is delivered by a trained occupational therapist in brief counseling sessions, which can
           be easily translated into real clinical settings; and

        4. addresses participation, a patient-centered outcome that is associated with quality of
           life but has received limited attention outside of rehabilitation research.
