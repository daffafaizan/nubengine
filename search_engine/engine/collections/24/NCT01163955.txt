      two-sided coin to determine the sitting position of the test subject. If the flip reveals a
      "heads", the child will be instructed to sit in a chair; chairs will be appropriately sized
      to allow the child to rest his/her feet on the ground. If the flip reveals a "tails", the
      child will be instructed to sit on a small carpet piece that measures 2-feet by 2-feet. Each
      test subject will be taken to their gaming station which will sit approximately 8 feet away
      from a 55-inch flat screen television that will be on a 30-inch table and handed a wireless
      controller. Two gaming stations will be available with one featuring the game Lego Batman and
      the other featuring Lego Indiana Jones with both gaming stations testing simultaneously. The
      test subjects will be told they can play for 5 minutes with a Physical Therapist at each
      station to monitor and record the test subjects' positioning.
