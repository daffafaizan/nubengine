      molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are recognized by cells of the innate immune system via
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) . The LPS / TLR4 interaction induces the secretion of a variety
      of proinflammatory cytokines. Among them, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a major cytokine, and
      alterations to its secretion has been associated with various diseases, such as periodic
      syndrome associated cryopyrin (CAPS), gout, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis.

      The release of IL-1β is controlled by a molecular platform protein, known as the inflammasome
      name. The canonical protein (that is to say conserved in evolution) of the inflammasome NLRP3
      are NLRC4 and that engages the ASC adapter protein to activate caspase-1, which promotes the
      cleavage of interleukin IL-1β. Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli cause
      non-canonical activation of caspase-1, caspase-11In involving more NLRP3 and AUC. In mouse,
      caspase-11 is essential to the immune response to gram-negative bacteria, but bacterial PAMPs
      that are responsible for triggering of the non-canonical inflammasome remain to be
      identified. It has recently been shown that caspase-11 is involved in the death of the mice
      subjected to septic shock. The mouse model requires caspase-11-dependent mechanism,
      caspase-independent -1 since the CASP1 - / - mouses are also susceptible to LPS as wild type
      mice. A key question to be answered is whether LPS triggers similar events in human cells. If
      this is the case, this knowledge may be useful in drug development for treatment of sepsis.
