    
      This is a single center exploratory imaging study involving up to two intravenous microdoses
      of [18F]F-AraG (the second tracer dose is optional) followed by whole-body PET-CT imaging in
      participants 18 years of age and older with recent SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and COVID-19 at least
      14 days following onset of symptoms. The primary objective is to determine the anatomical
      distribution of [18F]F-AraG in participant with convalescent COVID-19 approximately 4 weeks
      and 5 months (optional, 4 months following first PET imaging visit) following onset of
      symptoms (N = 20). Tracer activity will also be compared with sex and age-matched uninfected
      historical control participants enrolled in prior studies. Up to 20 participants will be
      enrolled in this study who will be identified in the UCSF LIINC longitudinal COVID-19 cohort
      study. Each participant will undergo one PET-CT scan following 50 +/- 10 minutes uptake
      following a single bolus injection of [18F]F-AraG. A second optional [18F]F-AraG dose and
      PET-CT will be offered approximately 4 months following the initial imaging time point.
