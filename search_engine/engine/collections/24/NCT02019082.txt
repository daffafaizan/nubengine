      enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to electrical stimulation (ES, n=10) or sham ES
      (placebo, n=10) groups. ES group received cathodal direct current for 1 h/day, 3 days/week,
      for 4 weeks (12 sessions). Blood sample was collected for VEGF and NO measurement in the
      first and last treatment sessions before and after intervention. Wound surface area (WSA) and
      skin temperature were measured at 1st, 6th, and 12th session.
