      increase in annual incidence with age. With the advent of direct oral anticoagulants, the
      management of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has evolved in recent years and
      these treatments are widely prescribed. There are studies comparing the different
      anticoagulant treatments used in venous thrombosis, which show no inferiority of treatment
      (injectable or oral) compared to others. Drug delivery modalities have been shown to affect
      adherence, and thus treatment efficacy. It seems fundamental to focus on patients' drug
      preferences in VTE to ensure the best possible compliance. These preferences seem to depend
      on the personal history of each patient. In addition, no studies have been conducted on
      patient preferences for anticoagulant therapy for VTE: this is the goal of the
      "anticoagchoice" study.
