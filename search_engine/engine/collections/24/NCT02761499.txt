      short and long term clinical performance and safety in subjects receiving primary total hip
      arthroplasty (THA) with the U-Motion II+ Acetabular System and UTF Reduced Stem. The
      acetabular and femoral components will be uncemented. Study outcomes will be analyzed and
      published when 1.) all enrolled and implanted subjects complete their 6-week follow up, 2.)
      all implanted subjects complete their 2-year follow up, 3.) at the conclusion of the study.

      It is anticipated that up to 200 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 sites. The subjects
      will be evaluated at predetermined intervals: baseline, procedure/ discharge and 6 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post treatment for primary analysis and annually
      up to 5 years for device survivorship. The estimated study duration from first enrollment
      through completion of the final report is expected to be approximately 7 years.

      This study will be conducted at up to 5 investigational sites in the United States with
      previous clinical research experience and with adequate population of orthopedic patients
      requiring primary total hip arthroplasty.
