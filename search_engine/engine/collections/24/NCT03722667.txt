      an Technology-Based Component Only arm and TechSuPPorT on self-management behaviors, BP
      control, and HRQoL outcomeson cognitive task switching between the DMN and TPN neural
      networks using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging
      (DTI). Both groups will be exposed to the three Technology-based components: (a) six weekly
      web-based modules focused on improving African Americans' knowledge and skills of
      hypertension management; (b) personalized medication adherence support (SMS reminder
      messages, adherence feedback, health and lifestyle tips) through Medisafe, a smartphone app;
      and (c) self-monitor BP with study provided BP monitor. Participants in the TechSuPPorT arm
      will receive the three Technology-based components plus positive psychological training, a
      structured online training and skill building techniques to promote optimism, resilience,
      well-being, and self-confidence.
