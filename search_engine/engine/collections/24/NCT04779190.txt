      Therefore, a major goal of SIS treatment is to reduce pain and improve upper extremity
      function. In this prospective, randomized controlled, single-blind, interventional trial, a
      total of 60 patients with SIS who met the eligibility criteria are going to enrolled in the
      study. Eligible participants are going to randomly assign to one of the three groups by an
      independent blinded researcher, using a computer-generated random numbers and allocation
      ratio of 1:1:1: the LLLT group (LG, n = 20), the ultrasound therapy group (UG, n = 20), and
      the control group (CG, n = 20). Participants are going to evaluate before training, and at
      the 1-month follow-up and 3-month follow-up using the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for
      pain during activity, at rest, and at night, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index
      (SPADI).
