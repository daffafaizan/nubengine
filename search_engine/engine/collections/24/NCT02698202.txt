      comparing the performance of tomosynthesis plus 2D Digital Mammography vs usual care (2D
      digital mammography) in respect to incidence of advanced cancers (interval and following
      round) and interval cancers. The investigators also will measure detection rates,
      specificity, interval cancers, advanced cancers occurring as interval cancers or at
      subsequent screens and allowing to estimate overdiagnosis. In Reggio Emilia a
      population-based screening program is active. It invites all women from 45 to 74 years old
      for a 2D digital mammography (2 projections, double reading) every 2 years (annually from 45
      to 49).

      Women will be asked for informed consent when they attend the mammography. I they accept they
      will be randomised to one of the two arms.

      All examinations will be read by two independent radiologists, in case of discordance a third
      reading is asked.
