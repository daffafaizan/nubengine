    
      Total 105 patients were recruited and randomized to receive either real or sham-tDCS. Real
      experimental groups were divided into two types; Pre-tDCS group and Simultaneous tDCS group.
      Two groups are again divided into three groups; Dual stimulation group, Unilateral
      stimulation group and Sham control group, respectively.

      In Pre-tDCS group, total a sessions of the tDCS stimulation was done for each three subgroups
      and visual inattention training was followed after that. In Simultaneous tDCS group, tDCS and
      visual inattention training was done simultaneously. For each subgroups, tDCS was attached at
      following locations; unilateral cathodal tDCS on unaffected PPC(postparietal cortex), P3 ,
      dual cathodal tDCS on P3 and anodal tDCS on affected PPC, P4.

      The patients were initially evaluated at baseline, immediately, 60min, 120min, 24 hrs after
      the training session.
