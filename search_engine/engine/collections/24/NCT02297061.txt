      associated with hip fracture surgery is much greater than that observed intra operatively.
      The total blood loss depends on the type of fracture and associated surgery. Extra-capsular
      fractures treated with an intramedullary nail are thus associated with the largest hidden
      blood loss with a median of approximately 1500 ml . This hidden blood loss is primarily
      associated with the trauma and fracture itself and not, as such, with the surgical procedure.

      Postoperative anaemia necessitating transfusion and a haemoglobin level below 8 g per dL, in
      hip fracture patients, are both associated with an increased mortality Controversy remains on
      the benefits and indications for transfusion in this group of patients.

      There is currently no viable method of identifying patients at risk of transfusion. The on
      admission haemoglobin level has been shown to be falsely reassuring . TEG has to our
      knowledge only been used in one previous study of hip fractures. The outcome measure in this
      study was thromboembolic events. We have not been able to identify any studies on the use of
      TEG, INR, APTT or other tests as predictors of blood loss in hip fracture patients.

      Clinicians would greatly benefit from a tool to predict the at-risk patient on admission. TEG
      has been suggested as such a tool. Bolliger et al suggests that TEG can be used in
      goal-oriented algorithms to optimize targeted transfusion therapies in trauma patients or
      patients undergoing major surgery. We hypothesize that TEG can be used for this purpose in
      patients with hip fracture. These patients can have large blood losses and they sustain the
      double trauma of a hip fracture and major orthopaedic surgery.
