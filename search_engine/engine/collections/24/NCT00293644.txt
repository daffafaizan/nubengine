      throughout pregnancy in 20% of women. 1%-3% of pregnant women experience the extreme form
      called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), described as intractable vomiting associated with weight
      loss of more than 5% of pre-pregnancy weight, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances which
      may lead to hospitalization. Treatment involves administration of antiemetics once NVP
      occurs. Although there is wide evidence of fetal safety of several antiemetic medications,
      women and health professionals are often reluctant to use antiemetics due to a heightened
      misperception of teratogenic risk. Diclectin速 is a prescription drug in Canada specifically
      indicated for treatment of NVP. Our preliminary research has shown Diclectin速 to be effective
      for pre-emptive treatment for NVP symptoms in women who experienced severe NVP/HG in their
      previous pregnancy. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Diclectin as a pre-emptive
      treatment for NVP and HG in a randomized controlled trial. In the Pre-emptive Treatment
      Group, as soon as a patient becomes aware of the present pregnancy, and before the NVP
      starts, she will take an initial Diclectin速 dose, followed by standard dosing to match
      symptoms once NVP develops. In the Standard Treatment Group women will take Diclectin速 only
      at appearance of symptoms. A natural history control group will also be included. This study
      will determine whether pre-emptive use of Diclectin will reduce the incidence of severe forms
      of this syndrome/HG.
