      L-arginine supplementation on recreationally trained female participants. In particular, it
      will compare performance outcomes and blood markers among two intervention groups (BFR and
      BFR+Arg) and a control group (CON). All group will participate in the same training regimen.
      The control group will train and ingest a placebo pill. The BFR group will train with BFR and
      ingest a placebo pill, and the BFR+Arg group will train with BFR and ingest an L-arginine
      pill. All placebo pills will be Maltodextrin. The performance outcome is leg press 1RM, while
      the blood markers are growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. This analysis will provide insight as
      to whether or not L-arginine supplementation in addition to blood flow restriction training
      improves performance and muscle hypertrophy measure more than blood flow restriction training
      alone.
