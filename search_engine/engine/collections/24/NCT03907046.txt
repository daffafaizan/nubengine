    
      ASPIRE is a randomized, double-blinded, phase III clinical trial designed to test the
      efficacy and safety of anticoagulation, compared with aspirin, in patients with a recent ICH
      and high-risk non-valvular AF (CHA2DS2-VASc score â‰¥ 2). Seven hundred patients will be
      enrolled over 3.5 years and followed for study outcomes for a minimum of 12 months and
      maximum of 36 months. The primary efficacy outcome is any stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic) or
      death from any cause. The secondary efficacy outcome is the change in the modified Rankin
      Scale score. Recruitment will take place at sites coordinated through the NIH/NINDS
      StrokeNet.
