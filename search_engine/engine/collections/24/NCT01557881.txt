      I. To acquire PET/MRI scans of 100 patients which will be compared with PET/CT scans of the
      same subjects. The PET/CT scans will be used to provide the gold standard for evaluating the
      image quality and quantitative performance of the PET/MRI scans. After comparison and
      evaluation of the imaging capabilities and performance of the sequential PET/MRI imaging
      system for these 100 subjects, a second cohort of hundred consecutive subjects may be
      necessary and again comparisons made to the current standard of PET imaging, PET/CT. This
      validation of the attenuation correction methods and quantitative accuracy of the PET/MRI
      device compared to PET/CT will be a continuous iterative process that will result in
      optimized performance of the PET/MRI and will be a key step in its becoming available to
      other clinical research projects both within the Seidman Cancer Center as well as in other
      institutions.

      OUTLINE:

      After undergoing standard PET/CT, patients undergo PET/MRI.
