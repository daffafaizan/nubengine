    
      OBJECTIVE:

      To study if there is a defect in internal monitoring of eye movements in patients with
      schizophrenia.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Patients with schizophrenia and normal controls.

      DESIGN:

      Patients and controls will be asked to follow targets to remembered locations and their eye
      movements will be monitored.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Eye movements will be examined for evidence of internal monitoring (corollary discharge)
      defects which would result in mislocalizing remembered targets.
