      care settings. In this context, a number of devices and manual techniques have been used to
      remove pulmonary secretions and re-expand collapsed areas. This study was designed to
      evaluate whether manual rib cage compression improves airway clearance and respiratory
      mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients. In a randomized crossover trial, 20
      mechanically ventilated patients underwent thoracic manual compression and control
      intervention (normal ventilation) at the same day. The main outcomes were sputum production
      and the changes in respiratory mechanics.
