      bearing total hip arthroplasty (THA) using Delta TT cup. Specifically the study intends to
      address the following research topics:

        1. The incidence of squeaking after CoC THA using Delta TT cup.

        2. The dislocation rate and survival rate of CoC THA using Delta TT cup.
