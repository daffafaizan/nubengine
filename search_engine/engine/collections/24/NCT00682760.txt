      assessed as the number (%) of patients with improved SS of more than 1 score at 4 weeks
      post-injection. Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the change in scores from
      baseline on the SS, closing force of eyelids, and functional visual status at 4 weeks
      post-injection. The duration of action (days), the time interval between injection and the
      moment that the patient felt the need for retreatment were also assessed as secondary
      efficacy outcomes.

      The number (%) of patients with improvement of SS (primary efficacy outcome) and the change
      in scores from baseline at 4 weeks post-injection on the severity of spasm, closing force of
      eyelids, and functional visual status scores were not different between the KbtxA and Botox
      groups in the analysis of both the ITT and PP populations. Also, the duration of action was
      similar following KbtxA and Botox injections (two sample t-test, p=0.835). For the
      non-inferiority trial on primary efficacy outcome, KbtxA was not inferior to Botox in either
      the ITT or PP populations, as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (-1.76% for ITT,
      -1.64% for PP) was over the -15% threshold.
