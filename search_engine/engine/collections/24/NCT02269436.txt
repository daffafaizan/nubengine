    
      This is an open-label, follow-on phase 1 study to assess the long-term safety and
      tolerability of continuous i.c.v administration of sNN0029 infusion solution in patients with
      ALS.

      Eighteen patients who previously participated in study sNN0029-003 will receive continuous
      administration of 4 μg sNN0029/day via i.c.v. infusion with the Medtronic SynchroMed® II
      Infusion System. The sNN0029 infusion solution is intended to be an add-on treatment to other
      treatments for ALS.

      The assessments performed at the last visit in study sNN0029-003 will serve as the baseline
      values for patients included in study sNN0029-004 and be the start of sNN0029 treatment for
      all patients (Study Day 1; Visit 1). In order to not reveal the blind in study sNN0029-003,
      the patients will return to hospital on Day 3 and stay to Day 6 (Visit 2). During these days,
      the sNN0029 begins to exit the i.c.v. catheter tip in the ventricle of the brain.

      Patients will return to the hospital on Day 11 (Visit 3) for a refill of sNN0029 and
      adjustment of the infusion pump flow rate. After this, the patient will return to the clinic
      on Day 39 (Visit 4) for a sNN0029-refill of infusion pump and assessments. Thereafter the
      patients will visit the hospital on a monthly basis (every 28 days ± 2) to perform refills
      and make assessments every 3 months.

      Treatment in study sNN0029-004 may continue unless safety concerns warrant discontinuation of
      therapy, until patients choose to withdraw from the study, experience treatment related
      toxicity or intolerance, are deemed to be unsuitable to continue treatment by the
      investigator, or die
