      foot. Historically, there have been several options to treat this condition surgically, but
      the current standard for advanced hallux rigidus is first MTP anthrodesis. Newer joint
      preserving procedures offer patients effective relief of pain and improving functional
      outcomes as well as maintaining, and potentially improving, range of motion for the first MTP
      joint. Osteochondral autograft transfer has been shown to be an effective treatment for
      hallux rigidus, and involves harvesting a small cylindrical osteochondral graft from a site
      remote of the first MTP joint and transferring the graft to the head of the first metatarsal.
      A new synthetic cartilage implant, Cartiva, has been shown to have equivalent functional
      outcomes, pain scores, and complications to anthrodesis, but the first MTP range of motion in
      the Cartiva group was maintained or even improved in some patients.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing synthetic cartilage
      implantation versus osteochondral autograft transfer for treatment of first
      metatarsophalangeal (MTP) arthritis. The hypothesis is that clinical range of motion, pain
      scores, subjective clinical outcomes, and complications will not be clinically inferior with
      the synthetic cartilage implant group compared to the osteochondral autograft transfer group.
