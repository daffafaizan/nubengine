      transplantation. We propose to carry out a pilot study whose objectives are to determine the
      safety and efficacy profile of sirolimus in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).
      Current therapy for FSGS has limited efficacy. Sirolimus was selected for the following
      reasons: 1) sirolimus reduces proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells, 2)
      sirolimus reduces fibrosis in experimental models of liver and kidney disease, 3) sirolimus
      is a potent immunosuppressive, and other immunosuppressives including glucocorticoids and
      cyclosporine have shown some efficacy in FSGS, and 4) sirolimus may have a direct
      anti-proteinuric effect, as suggested by in vitro studies. We will recruit up to 30 patients,
      including adults and children greater than or equal to 13.0 years of age. The study design is
      open label, with therapy for one year using doses adjusted to achieve trough levels of 5-15
      ng/mL during the first 4 months and if a complete remission is not achieved and sustained,
      10-20 ng/mL during the remainder of the study. The primary outcome will be reduction in
      proteinuria, categorized as complete remission and partial remission, comparing baseline
      values and 12 month values. The study will recruit patients in two groups: 1) a drug washout
      group, for patients who can tolerate receiving no immunosuppressive therapy for 4 weeks prior
      to initiating sirolimus therapy, and 2) a drug overlap group, for patients who cannot
      tolerate cessation of immunosuppressive therapy due to severe edema or other complications of
      nephrotic syndrome; these patients will receive prednisone for up to 6 months while taking
      sirolimus (with a target of prednisone less than 20 mg QOD by month 3) or will receive
      cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil for up to 4 weeks while initiating
      sirolimus therapy.
