      cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Results from a previous study suggest that paced
      heart segment characteristics do predict this response and our ability to identify venous
      pathways to optimal segments is feasible using cardiac CT and MRI. In an ongoing feasibility
      study we are using these capabilities to guide the delivery of CRT lead systems to optimal
      myocardial targets. A computer software program has been developed that can create an
      interactive, 3D integrated cardiac model of coronary vein anatomy, myocardial scar and
      mechanical dyssynchrony. Although this feasibility study is ongoing, early results show this
      method of guiding the CRT leads to optimal targets with these individualized models to be
      safe and effective.

      This trial will be a larger multi-centre randomized blinded trial to determine the
      therapeutic impact of MRI guided Left Ventricular and Right Ventricular lead placement with
      respect to improving clinical response rates for CRT.
