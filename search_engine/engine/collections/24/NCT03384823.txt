    
      The first phase assesses single ascending doses for EDP-938 (active drug or placebo) in
      healthy subjects. A "fasted" and "fed" two-part cohort will also assess food effect.

      The second phase assesses multiple ascending doses (active drug or placebo) for 7-days in
      healthy subjects.

      Each cohort within each phase will enroll a total of 8 subjects who will be randomized to
      receive EDP-938 or placebo. The cohort assessing food effect will enroll 10 subjects
      randomized to receive EDP-938 or placebo.
