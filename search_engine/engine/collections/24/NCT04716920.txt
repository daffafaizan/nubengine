    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week Tai Chi
      intervention for relieving aromatase inhibitor (AI)-induced arthralgia in women with breast
      cancer (BCa).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients attend Tai Chi exercise classes over 1 hour twice weekly (BIW) and wear a Fitbit
      device for up to 12 weeks. Patients are encouraged to complete self-practice over 30 minutes
      and record practice times daily in a diary log form. Patients also join a Facebook private
      TaiChi4joint group where they receive instructional videos matching the progress of weekly
      classes for at-home practices and peer support in Tai Chi engagement.
