      infection. The immune system is activated by both pathogen-associated and host-derived
      molecular patterns. A strong response of neutrophils is engaged and both innate and adaptive
      immune system homeostasis are strongly affected. Neutrophils are able to produce high
      concentrations of inducible reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to an oxidative stress.
      ROS can be released extracellularly at the site of infection or intracellularly in the
      phagolysosome. At early phase of sepsis, immature granulocytes are present in the bloodstream
      and could help to predict sepsis deterioration. However, it has also been shown that they are
      less efficient than mature granulocytes in ROS production and phagocytosis. ROS are potent
      stressors for bacteria and can directly or indirectly damage DNA. Bacteria can protect
      against DNA damage through the SOS response, which is a coordinated cellular response
      regulated by a repressor, LexA, and a sensor/activator, RecA. The bacterial SOS response is
      involved in acquisition of resistances to antibiotics through increasing frequencies of
      spontaneous mutations or increasing the expression of resistance and adaptation genes. The
      hypothesis that the low-level production of ROS by immature granulocytes in the early steps
      of sepsis could be beneficial for both the host, as a high level of ROS induce organ damage
      and dysfunction, and the pathogen, as low concentrations of ROS would be able to induce the
      SOS response allowing bacteria to enhance an adaptive response. The main objective it is to
      evaluate the level of ROS produced by the immature granulocytes in septic patient. Then, it
      will be assess if it could promote antibiotic resistance expression via SOS-induced integron
      gene cassette rearrangements.
