      will be treated with Mitomycin-C as described here. The patients with an identified gene
      mutation will also be provided with genetic counseling.

      Patients with BRCA2 gene will be treated with Mitomycin-C (MMC) on Day 1 at a dose of 10mg/m2
      intravenously. This will be repeated every 28 days, which is one cycle. Expected adverse
      events and appropriate dose modifications are described in this section. Treatment will
      continue until disease progression, serious toxicity, patient withdrawal or maximum
      cumulative dose of 60 mg/m2.

      Primary Objectives:

      1. To determine the 6-month survival of patients with previously untreated advanced or
      recurrent adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with BRCA2 mutations that are treated with single
      agent Mitomycin-C (MMC) chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the response rate, six-month progression free survival rate,
           progression-free survival and survival of patients with previously untreated advanced or
           recurrent adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with BRCA2 mutations who are treated with
           single agent MMC chemotherapy.

        2. To describe the toxicity of MMC in this patient population.

        3. To explore pharmacogenetic factors that may influence the toxicity and efficacy of MMC
           in this patient population.
