      reality-based training VAP-S on the ability to run errands in a real supermarket in
      individuals with stroke. Virtual environment provide useful way to explore planning and
      secondly to examine the effectiveness of using VR in the assessment of cognitive planning for
      patients. A virtual supermarket was designed in which participants carried out a task close
      to daily activities: a test of shopping list. Of the 70 subjects (7 centres), 35 randomly
      allocated to the control group, and the other 35 subjects randomly allocated to the
      experimental group. Subjects will be evaluated by a therapist who will not be involved in the
      training program and did not know about the subject's group assignment.

      Statistical analysis : We will calculate descriptive statistics for the clinical
      characteristics of each group. We will use to compare the baseline demographic
      characteristics, the pretraining and posttraining variables between groups,
      independent-samples t-tests for means and Chi-square tests for frequencies. A significance
      level of 0.05 is set for all analyses.
