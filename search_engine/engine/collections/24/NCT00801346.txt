      Primary

        -  To determine the incidence and prevalence of the components of metabolic syndrome (e.g.,
           obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance) in pediatric patients with
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission.

        -  To determine the trajectory of the onset of these components over a 1-year period in
           patients undergoing maintenance therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To identify potential associations between components of metabolic syndrome and fatigue,
           health-related quality of life, family history, nutrition, and physical activity.

        -  To identify potential biomarkers that are associated with clinical features of metabolic
           syndrome.

        -  To evaluate whether patients will show a decrease in IGF-1 levels.

      OUTLINE: This is a two-part study. Patients are enrolled in either part 1 or part 2.

        -  Part 1: Patients undergo physical exam measurements (e.g., body mass index, waist
           circumference, and blood pressure) at baseline (during maintenance course 1) and at 12
           months (during maintenance course 5). Patients also undergo blood sample collection at
           baseline and at 12 months to measure laboratory markers (e.g., fasting lipid profile,
           fasting insulin and glucose, IGF-1, leptin, and adiponectin levels). Patients or their
           parents complete a family history questionnaire at baseline and questionnaires to assess
           physical activity, quality of life, nutritional intake, and fatigue at baseline and at 6
           and 12 months.

        -  Part 2: Patients or their parents complete a family history questionnaire at baseline.
