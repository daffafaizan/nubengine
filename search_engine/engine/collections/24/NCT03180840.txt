    
      This is an open-label switchover study to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics
      of pegunigalsidase alfa treatment of 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks in patients previously treated
      with enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT): agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta, for at least 3
      years and on a stable dose (>80% labelled dose/kg) for at least the last 6 months. Following
      screening, patients will be enrolled and switched from their current ERT to receive
      intravenous (IV) infusions of pegunigalsidase alfa 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks (total
      of 14 infusions). At the time of enrollment, premedication, if used for the agalsidase alfa
      or agalsidase beta infusions before enrollment, will be continued using the same
      premedication regimen during the first infusion with pegunigalsidase alfa and then will be
      gradually tapered down at the Investigator's discretion during the next infusions based on
      protocol-specified criteria. First infusions of pegunigalsidase alfa will be administered
      under controlled conditions at the investigation site. Based on the protocol-specified
      criteria, patients will be able to receive their pegunigalsidase alfa infusions at a home
      care setup once the Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor agree that it is safe to do so.
      Safety and efficacy exploratory endpoints will be assessed throughout the 52-week study. In
      the case of clear clinical deterioration, the treatment may be changed to 1.0 mg/kg every 2
      weeks at the Investigator's discretion and discussion with the Medical Monitor.
