      of increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes including death. A cohort study has found that
      respondents with cancer were significantly more frail compared to those without cancer. A
      plausible explanation is both cancer itself and the therapies used to treat it add additional
      stressors that challenge a patient's physiologic reserve. A systematic review has revealed a
      high prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in older cancer patients, with the median
      estimates of 42% and 43%, respectively. Cancer treatment can hasten survivors' aging process
      and increase their risk of developing frailty, thus placing cancer survivors at heightened
      risk of such poor health outcomes as falls, fractures, and disability. This calls for
      effective interventions that would improve frailty in older cancer survivors.

      Qigong, a type of mind-body intervention, is particularly suitable for older adults, as it is
      implemented without aerobic and musculoskeletal strain. This equipment-free form of exercise
      is ideal for settings with limited resources, as well as for the frail elderly, because it
      can be performed at home at any time, reducing such barriers as weather, transportation, and
      cost. Meta-analysis suggests that Baduanjin is beneficial in the general population in terms
      of improved quality of life, balance, handgrip strength, and trunk flexibility. To our
      knowledge, there is no evidence on qigong's effects for improving well-being of pre-frail and
      frail older cancer survivors. Our aim is therefore to conduct a pilot study for testing out
      the feasibility and acceptability of a qigong intervention to the elderly cancer survivors.
