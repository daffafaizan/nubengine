    
      -  To cross-sectionally compare characteristics (duration and amount of lower limb loading)
           of STS movements among 4 arm placement conditions (arms on armrests/devices, arms on
           knees, arms free, and arm crossed over chest) in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate reliability (inter-rater, intra-rater, and test-retest), standard error
           of measurement and minimal detectable changes of the STSST and FTSST in ambulatory
           patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate concurrent validity and factors associated with ability of the STSST and
           FTSST in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate the ability of the STSST and FTSST to predict the risk of falls over 1, 3
           and 6 months in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To investigate internal and external responsiveness of the STSST and FTSST to detect
           changes on walking ability over 1, 3 and 6 months in ambulatory patients with SCI.

        -  To estimate the minimal clinically important difference or clinical significance of the
           FTSST in ambulatory patients with SCI.
