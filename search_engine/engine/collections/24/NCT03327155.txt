      and to work towards the virtual elimination of HIV transmission in Australia by 2020. This
      extraordinary goal relies on two anti-retroviral therapy (ARV)-related interventions, in
      addition to traditional behavioural prevention. The first of these interventions, HIV
      treatment as prevention targeted at HIV positive people, has been ramped up over the last few
      years, and is approaching maximal levels of population impact. Despite this, new HIV
      diagnoses in Australia have been approximately constant over the last four years. Critical to
      the new strategy's success is the population-based, targeted roll-out of HIV PrEP. PrEP
      involves taking one pill daily of co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC). TDF/FTC has been extensively used in millions of people with HIV
      for more than 15 years.

      This large-scale study aims for the rapid roll-out of TDF/FTC to individuals at high risk of
      HIV, who will comprise mostly gay and bisexual men (GBM) but will also include small numbers
      of heterosexuals, people who inject drugs, and transgender men and women. The drug will be
      used according to existing Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health
      (ASHM) HIV PrEP Clinical Guidelines.

      By rapidly rolling out this new intervention as rapidly as feasible, and following
      participants for up to two years on treatments, we expect a reduction in new HIV diagnoses in
      WA due to decreased infection in the on-treatment cohort, and to the interruption of chains
      of transmission to others not receiving PrEP. The rapid and large-scale roll-out of PrEP is a
      critical component of working towards the virtual elimination of HIV transmission by 2020.
