      within cells. Many of the clients of Hsp90 (such as Akt, Bcr-Abl, EGFR, Flt-3, c-Kit and
      PDGFR Î±) are oncoproteins or important cell-signaling proteins, and therefore are critical
      for tumor cell growth and survival. Inhibition of Hsp90 results in degradation of these
      proteins, which abrogates growth and survival signaling and leads to tumor cell death.
