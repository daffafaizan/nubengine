      pharmacokinetic study. Subjects receiving either lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir
      as part of their antiretroviral therapy will have a pharmacokinetic study performed over
      12-20 days to examine whether coadministration of lopinavir and atazanavir alters the
      pharmacokinetics of either agent. The safety of these agents in combination will also be
      explored.
