    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, four-arm, crossover study with double-blind
      design.

      At Visit 1 (week -1) patients will be assessed for eligibility for study participation.
      Subjects will be advised that study entry cannot be fully determined until the completion of
      the screening period when all exclusion/inclusion criteria are entirely assessed. Subjects
      will perform Visit 2 as soon as their laboratory results of Visit 1 are available. At
      baseline (Visit 2/Day 1), a total of 300 subjects whose eligibility is confirmed will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the treatment groups (aspirin upon awakening, aspirin
      at bedtime, or placebo--half on awakening, half at bedtime). Subjects will start a first
      double-blind treatment phase with a total duration of 6 weeks. During this period the
      subjects will be receiving either aspirin 100 mg or placebo at two different circadian times
      (either after awakening from nighttime sleep or before bedtime) until the end of this study
      phase (Visit 3). After this first treatment phase, all subjects will undergo a 2-week
      wash-out phase with placebo. At Visit 4 (week 8), all subjects will be crossed-over in terms
      of the circadian time, but keeping their original treatment (either aspirin or placebo), and
      followed up for a second treatment phase of 6 weeks.

      The study duration including all the phases will be 15 weeks.

      Safety and efficacy will be assessed at the end of every treatment phase, i.e., at Visits 3
      and 5. Safety will also be assessed by phone calls 2 weeks after the initiation of each
      active treatment phase (weeks 2 and 10). Subjects may be requested to attend the clinic for
      further evaluation on those weeks if they present any adverse effect.
