      substance specific treatment is low. A pilot study revealed elevated prevalence rates in
      general hospital patients compared to the general population and a positive attitude of
      patients suffering from DPD towards counseling. Brief intervention delivered in general
      hospital might be useful to promote discontinuation of prescription drug use and utilization
      of formal help.

      Objectives: To test the efficacy of a brief intervention based on Motivational Interviewing
      in proactively recruited general hospital patients randomly allocated to an intervention or a
      control group. Methods: Patients aged 18 to 69 years are proactively recruited in surgical
      and internal wards of two general hospitals in the northern German city of LÃ¼beck. Patients
      with regular use of prescription drugs in the last three months and/or prescription drug
      dependence or -abuse are randomly assigned to two conditions: (1) an intervention group with
      two counseling sessions based on Motivational Interviewing plus one individualized feedback
      based on the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change (TTM) or (2) as usual care. Outcome
      measures are reduction or discontinuation of prescription drug use and utilization of formal
      help. The efficacy of the intervention will be examined within a 3 and a 12 month follow up.

      Expected impact: Findings are expected to provide evidence for brief interventions for
      prescription drug misuse to be used in primary care. This would be the first international
      results confirming such an approach in the field of prescription drug misuse. If a brief
      interventions would be effective, this could enhance secondary prevention for this under
      served population. Therefore, data are of great public health interest.
