      from LASIK performed using the Phorcides surgical planning software with Contoura
      topography-guided ablation in both eyes of subjects with myopia and myopic astigmatism
      seeking refractive surgery for distance correction. Data will be compared to published
      results for wavefront optimized LASIK and LASIK performed with Contoura using other
      refractive algorithms.

      The hypothesis is that use of the Phorcides planning software will result in a higher
      percentage of eyes with residual refractive cylinder â‰¤ 0.25D than will be achieved with
      wavefront-optimized (WFO) LASIK. It is also expected that unaided postoperative visual acuity
      and visual symptoms will be improved.
