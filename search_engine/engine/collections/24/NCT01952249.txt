    
      Phase 1b portion was completed; Phase 2 portion was not initiated.

      Subjects must not have received prior weekly paclitaxel or more than 3 prior chemotherapy
      regimens in the Phase 1b portion of the study and more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in
      the Phase 2 portion of the study. Prior to enrollment, subjects will undergo screening to
      determine study eligibility. In the Phase 1b portion of study, 3 subjects will be treated at
      each dose level if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed. If 1 of 3 subjects
      experiences a DLT, that dose level will be expanded to 6 subjects.

      If 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, no further subjects will be dosed at that level and 3
      additional subjects will be added to the preceding dose cohort unless 6 subjects have already
      been treated at that dose level. Subjects will be assessed for DLTs from Days 0-28. Dose
      escalation for newly enrolled subjects, if appropriate, will occur after all subjects in a
      cohort have completed their Day 28 DLT assessment. After the final patient in the Phase 1b
      portion of the trial has completed their Day 28 DLT assessment, 50 subjects will be enrolled
      in the Phase 2 portion of the study and treated with demcizumab at the highest dose level
      that had < 2 DLTs in the 6 subjects.
