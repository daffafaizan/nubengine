    
      Design: A pilot pre-post study in 20 students by comparing students' performance before and
      after MI training session.

      Setting: Bicêtre Hospital, Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, France.

      Interventions: Students received three four-hour sessions of a basic MI training over a one
      week period. The students interviewed for 15 minutes a caregiver playing the role of a
      patient, six weeks before and three weeks after the training.

      Main outcome measures: Global scores by two independent raters who used the Motivational
      Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) 3.1.1 code, perception of student's empathy by the
      caregivers (CARE questionnaire), self-efficacy of students to engage in a patient-centred
      relationship (SEPCQ score), and student's satisfaction with the odds of achieving the target
      goal.
