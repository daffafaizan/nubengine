      serious adverse events. The use of a checklist in the operating theatre has demonstrated its
      benefit in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality Regarding transmissions between
      caregivers, numerous studies have shown the great difference between the medical data of a
      patient in their file and the information transmitted.

      The authors recommend using checklists in order to standardise transmissions. This work
      highlighted the beneficial role in terms of carers' satisfaction, quantity and quality of
      information transmitted. On the other hand, no study has looked at the reduction of immediate
      postoperative complications in post anaesthesia care units (PACU).
