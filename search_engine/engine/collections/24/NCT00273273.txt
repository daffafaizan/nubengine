      HIV-1 infection. When new antiretrovirals (ARVs) are developed, information on kinetics is
      collected in adults, and then in children, but often the adolescent age group is
      under-represented in initial or even later pharmacokinetics studies, so specific data on
      appropriate drug doses to use in adolescents may be lacking; it is assumed that they should
      receive the adult dose. Furthermore, as newer drugs are used in combination regimens, more
      information becomes available on drug interactions that might not have been initially
      anticipated. This information is usually generated in studies of adults, with little or no
      specific information in children or adolescents. This is an open-label, 24-hour, single-dose
      pharmacokinetic study.
