           between dopamine (DA) D2 receptor (D2R) occupancymeasured by positron emission
           tomography (PET) with [11C]raclopride and brain activity inferred by pharmacological
           magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) in the human brain, and to assess the relative
           sensitivity and specificity of the neurovascular coupling for slow (oral) versus rapid
           (intravenous, IV) stimulant methylphenidate (MP) delivery. Secondary objectives are to
           assess the associations between behavioral measures (heart and respiration rates and
           blood pressure, motor and sleep parameters, and neuropsychological testing variables),
           D2R occupancy and fMRI signals.

        -  Study population: 10 healthy males and 10 healthy females 18-55 years old will be
           included.

        -  Design: Double-blind. Participants will undergo simultaneous PET/phMRI, to evaluate
           dynamic changes in D2R occupancy by DA with [11C]raclopride and in bloodoxygenation-
           level dependent (BOLD) signals, under MP or placebo (PL). The participants will be
           scanned on 3 different occasions: 1) oral-MP (60 mg) and iv PL (3 cc saline), 2) oral-PL
           and iv-MP (0.25 mg/kg in 3 cc sterile water) and 3) oral PL and iv PL, which will be
           carried in different study days with at least 48 hours between them and their order will
           be randomized across subjects. Participants and researchers will be blind to the nature
           of the stimulant drug (MP/PL).

        -  Outcome parameters: The scale factor between the distribution volume ratio (DVR) and the
           BOLD signal in the dorsal and ventral striatum for the slow and fast MP challenges.
