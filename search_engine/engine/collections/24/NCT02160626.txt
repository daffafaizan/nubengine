    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of two
      concentrations of A-101solution when applied to individual seborrheic keratosis (SK) lesions
      (target lesions) compared with a matching A-101 Solution Vehicle.

      Each subject will have 4 target lesions on the trunk/extremities.

      A further objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two concentrations of A-101
      solution and its matching vehicle when applied to SK target lesions on the trunk/extremities.
