      I. To assess the effectiveness of the DISCO app on prompting patient-oncologist treatment
      cost discussions during patient-physician interactions (as observed in video recordings),
      patient outcomes related to financial toxicity immediately after the patient-oncologist
      interaction, and at a 3-month follow up.
