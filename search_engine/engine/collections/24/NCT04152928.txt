        1. The PET/MR system will provide dynamic PET images of at least comparable quality
           compared to PET/CT. Dynamic PET/MR will be feasible, with the 45 minute dynamic PET
           acquisition occurring during the MR sequences, eliminating the need for the patient to
           undergo two separate lengthy studies.

        2. Diffusion and perfusion parameters extracted from MRI sequences will provide information
           that improves the process of Ki evaluation.

        3. The use of advanced statistics methodologies, such as those used in radiomics, to
           correlate Ki data with diffusion and perfusion data will provide a quantification tool
           that will improve staging, prediction and monitoring after treatment.

        4. Parametric Patlak Ki images calculated from the dynamic series of PET images will show
           better contrast between tumors and normal tissue, as compared to contrast in the
           conventional static images obtained from the last time frame of the dynamic image
           series. Tumors identified on the static PET image will be visualized at least as well on
           Patlak Ki images, and possibly additional tumor foci may be identified. MRI should
           assist in confirming and interpreting such findings.

      Research plan Population: 50 patients with NETs that have evidence of at least one abdominal
      lesion with diameter greater than 2cm. All patients will be aged 18 years or older of both
      sexes.

      Inclusion criteria: Patients with confirmed NET. Exclusion criteria: Patients younger than 18
      years; pregnancy; other known active malignancy; contraindication to MRI tests or intravenous
      contrast agents.
