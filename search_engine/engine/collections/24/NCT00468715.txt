      Primary

        -  Determine the 6-month efficacy rate of bicalutamide as first-, second-, or third-line
           therapy in patients with androgen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor- and
           progesterone receptor-negative metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Evaluate changes in estradiol, total and free testosterone, and sex-hormone binding
           globulin in response to androgen blockade in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate tissue, including cytokeratins 5/6 and 17, SPDEF, ALCAM, ERBB2, FGFR4, and
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA), using immunohistochemical analysis in patients treated
           with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a open-label study.

      Patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving complete response, partial response, or stable disease may continue to receive
      bicalutamide as above at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection for correlative studies. Samples are
      analyzed for hormonal levels, including estradiol, total testosterone, free testosterone, and
      sex-hormone binding globulin, and proteins, including ALCAM, SPEDF, and CK 5/6, by
      immunohistochemical analysis at baseline, after course 1, and at the end of the study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
