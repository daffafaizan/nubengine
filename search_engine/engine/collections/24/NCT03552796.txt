      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dosing (RP2D) of
      intravesical sEphB4-HSA administration.

      II. To describe the dose limiting toxicities and adverse event profile of intravesical
      sEphB4-HSA administration in patients with bladder carcinoma in situ (CIS) and/or high grade
      T1/Ta bladder cancer (BCa).

      III. To describe the pharmacokinetics of intravesical sEphB4-HSA administration.

      IV. To explore the anti-tumor activity of intravesical sEphB4-HSA administration as
      manifested by responses to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive sEphB4-HSA intravesically over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, and again at 3
      and 6 months.
