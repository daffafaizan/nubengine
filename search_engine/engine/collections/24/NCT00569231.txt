      approved. The primary goal of this work was to assess the safety of Candin as an
      investigational new drug (IND) for the treatment of warts. In addition, clinical resolution
      of treated and untreated warts was evaluated and immunologic responses were examined using an
      ex vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-γ ELISPOT) assay in order to elucidate the
      immunologic mechanisms behind the successful regression of warts in patients undergoing
      Candin injection immunotherapy.
