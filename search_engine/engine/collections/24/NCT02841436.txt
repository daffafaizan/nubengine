      ablate tumor by fenestrating the cancer cell membrane by electric pulse. The anti-tumor
      effect does not result from thermotherapy, so is also not diminished by adjacent vessels.
      Several pre-clinical and clinical studies have already demonstrated IRE is a safe and
      effective treatment, and the adjacent tissue such as vessels and ductal structures will be
      spared. Recently, IRE had been used to treat pancreatic cancer successfully, and the safety
      is satisfactory. The system has been approved as safe by the European Union (EU) in 2008 and
      received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2010. However, there are still few
      experiences in using IRE for tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this study, the investigators will
      perform IRE for inoperable patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancers. They will
      receive IRE during the operation of palliative bypass operation including
      choledochojejunostomy and/or gastrojejunostomy. The investigators will evaluate the potential
      side effect and ablate effect of tumors, and also follow-up the patients for 2 years to
      evaluate the overall survival. The investigators will appraisal the clinical feasibility and
      advantage of the system by this study.
