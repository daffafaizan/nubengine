      examine the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin on brain function, meditation,
      spirituality, and psychology. The majority of the study procedures -- including screening,
      preparatory meetings, placebo and psilocybin sessions, and a large battery of behavioral and
      psychological measures -- will be conducted at the investigator's laboratory at the
      Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) on the Johns Hopkins Bayview campus. The brain
      imaging procedures will be conducted at F.M. Kirby Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger
      Institute (KKI).
