      be included.

      On the operation day patients are going to be evaluated in the preoperative preparation room.
      For anxiety evaluation the modified yale preoperative anxiety scale will be used. After this
      first evaluation patients are going to be separated randomly into two groups; group R
      (routine) and group C (cartoon). All patients are going to be premedicated with midazolam.
      The first group will receive their premedication straight after the first evaluation and
      their response will be recorded as easy, moderate, difficult, does not accept. Group C will
      choose a cartoon movie (5 different movies are recorded and will be shown through a tablet
      PC)) and will begin to watch it. After 5 minutes they will receive their premedication and
      their response will also be recorded. After 30 minutes a physician will try to insert an IV
      line and the response of the child will also be evaluated and recorded as easy, moderate,
      difficult and does not allow. Afterwards the patient will be transported into the operation
      room. In the operation room anesthesia will be induced via Sevoflurane and the response to
      mask anesthesia will be evaluated with the mask score as it is described before in previous
      studies. Patients in Group C will continue to watch the cartoon movie until the induction of
      anesthesia. And the modified yale score will also be reevaluated and recorded.

      The family anxiety will be evaluated with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale.

      The family and the child will also be interviewed separately, 4 prepared standard questions
      will be asked in order to understand how the family described the operation.
