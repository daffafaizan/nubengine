      cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have a poor survival outcome. Donor lymphocyte infusions
      (DLIs) to induce graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects have a limited survival benefit.

      Extensive preclinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of sodium bicarbonate on
      metabolic fitness of leukemia-reactive T cells in GvL AML models. Therefore, the
      investigators aimed to investigate a potential benefit of Bicanorm (Sodium bicarbonate)
      treatment accompanying DLIs in relapsed AML patients. The investigators determined the
      metabolic and immune phenotype of T cells isolated from patients receiving DLIs before and
      after Bicanorm (Sodium bicarbonate) treatment.
