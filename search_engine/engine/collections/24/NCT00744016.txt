    
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study evaluating
      the effectiveness and safety of eMG 1.5 g given once daily (QD) compared with placebo in
      approximately 300 subjects with demonstrated remission from UC. Eligible subjects are
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio (active:placebo) to receive 1 of 2 treatments: 1.5g eMG QD (four
      capsules total) or matching placebo capsules QD for 6 months.

      The study consists of a Screening phase (completed within 7 days prior to randomization), a
      Treatment phase (6 months), and a Follow-up visit (2 weeks after end-of-study [EOS] visit).
      The Treatment phase consists of 4 scheduled study visits: Visit 1 (Baseline)/Randomization
      (Day 1), Visit 2 (Month 1), Visit 3 (Month 3), Visit 4/EOS (Month 6).

      Primary objective:

      To compare the maintenance of remission from mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) as
      measured by rectal bleeding and endoscopic mucosal appearance after 6 months of treatment
      with encapsulated mesalamine granules (eMG) at 1.5 g QD, as compared with placebo.

      Secondary objective:

      To compare the safety and tolerability of long-term dosing with eMG at 1.5 g QD as compared
      with placebo in the maintenance of remission from mild to moderate UC.
