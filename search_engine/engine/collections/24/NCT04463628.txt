      SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection. For cystic fibrosis, as for many chronic diseases, this
      disruption is twofold. On the one hand, it affects daily life due to the closure of schools
      and the introduction of national lockdown, but also the hospital, which has profoundly
      changed its procedures, which are almost completely focused on the care of patients with
      Covid-19. This forced transformation was at the expense of its usual role including the
      management of chronic diseases such as cystic fibrosis. It has an impact on patients'
      consultations cancelled, rescheduled or replaced by teleconsultations, hospitalisations
      whether scheduled or during acute exacerbations which are more complicated to organise.
      Access to treatments is also more difficult (physiotherapy), which can affect compliance.
      Confinement also profoundly changes the lives of our patients. It changes the way individuals
      can apprehend their disease and its integration into their everyday life, studies or
      professional projects. Finally, it is the confrontation with a potentially fatal infection
      that reminds us of the risks and consequences of a potentially severe chronic disease.
