      a very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet. The researchers will test whether adding the
      following experimental components will enhance the intervention's ability to improve health
      outcomes: (1) active vs. periodic self-monitoring of dietary intake using an "app"; (2)
      training vs. no training in positive affect; and (3) training vs. no training in mindfulness
      and mindful eating.
