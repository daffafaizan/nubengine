      (SCI), predominantly in the first months after lesion. In SCI animal models, autoantibodies
      are pathogenic and their titers rise up at the time when spontaneous recovery stops. The aim
      of this study is to determine the autoantibody profiles after SCI and to infer their relation
      with functional recovery. To achieve this, autoantibody profiles, biochemical, hematological
      and immune-related parameters (cytokines, chemokines and growth factors) will be determined
      from a serum blood sample and functional recovery will be evaluated accordingly to
      standardized scales.
