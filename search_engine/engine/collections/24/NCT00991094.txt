      I. To prospectively collect data on acute and late toxicities (including second malignant
      neoplasms) in patients treated with proton therapy.

      II. To collect and store the corresponding radiation dose distribution and imaging data in
      order to correlate normal tissue response with dose distribution.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To derive and refine dose-response relationships for normal tissue toxicity after proton
      therapy.

      II. To document and compare symptom burden weekly during treatment and twice a month for 3
      months after therapy, using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergoing standard of care proton therapy are assessed for toxicities weekly during
      proton treatment, then from 1 to 3 times up to 90 days from the start of treatment and
      annually thereafter. Patients also complete questionnaires over 15-20 minutes at baseline,
      weekly during treatment, and every 2 weeks during follow up for up to 3 months.
