      million CD34 cells/kg by second day of apheresis with intravenously administered AMD3100
      among patients receiving primary therapy for myeloma with lenalidomide. Secondary Objectives:
      I. Safety and tolerability of intravenously administered AMD3100. II. Rate of failure to
      mobilize. Outline: Patients receive plerixafor IV on days 5-8 and filgrastim subcutaneously
      on days 1-8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion
      of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
