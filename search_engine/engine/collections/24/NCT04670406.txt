      guided online acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention combined with
      psychoeducation on quality of life and mental health of people with spinal cord injury (SCI)
      who experience psychological distress. After the pretest evaluation, eligible participants
      will receive 8 weekly sessions, including 6 ACT sessions and 2 psychoeducation sessions,
      delivered by trained coaches through Zoom videoconferencing. Each session lasts for one hour.
      Primary outcome measures will be psychological distress measured by the Depression, Anxiety
      and Stress Scale (DASS)- 21 and Spinal Cord Injury - Quality of Life (SCI-QOL). A one-time
      interview at the completion of the 8 sessions will be conducted to explore participants'
      experiences in the sessions.
