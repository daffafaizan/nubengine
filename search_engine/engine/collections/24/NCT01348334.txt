      different types of mesh materials between 2004 and 2007. Group I consisted of 48 patients in
      whom Vypromesh速 (Ethicon,USA) was used; Group II consisted of 48 patients in whom
      Ultrapromesh速( Ethicon,USA) and Group III consisted of 48 patients in whom Prolene light
      mesh速 (Johnson&Johnson,USA) was used. The data of the patients and the success of the
      operation were evaluated based on 24hr pad test, ICIQ-SF scoring, and Korman questionnaire
      analysis.
