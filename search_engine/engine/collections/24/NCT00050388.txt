      receive an injection of Allovectin-7速 by needle, directly into your tumor. This will be
      repeated 14 days later. The injections may be given in a doctor's office. A week later, you
      will undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Your tumor will be measured before Allovectin-7速
      treatment and before surgery to see if Allovectin-7速 was effective in shrinking it. This will
      be done by general physical exams and scans (such as X-ray scans). There will also be tests
      on the removed tumor to see if Allovectin-7速 helped to boost the immune system to attack the
      cancer.
