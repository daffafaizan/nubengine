      therapies. The study investigators herein propose to conduct a prospective clinical study
      using a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, anodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS), in combination with swallowing exercises for improving dysphagia due to
      an acute-subacute hemispheric infarction, and obtain data on safety and effect of 2 different
      doses of tDCS, on swallowing physiology and behavior. Dysphagia from hemispheric strokes
      occurs due to disruption of the cortical projections to the brainstem swallowing centers
      while recovery of swallowing functions have been shown to be mediated via the reorganization
      of the swallowing cortex in the unaffected hemisphere. A recent pilot study conducted by the
      investigators demonstrated the safety and feasibility of applying 5 consecutive daily
      sessions of anodal tDCS for 30 minutes to the swallowing cortex on the unaffected hemisphere
      in the acute-subacute stroke phases and showed a promise in improving dysphagia, when
      combined with swallowing exercises. The proposed research will be used to further confirm
      safety of this technique in early stroke phases and explore alternative, more effective doses
      for promoting swallowing recovery prior to its examination in any confirmatory trials. The
      investigators will use the study cohort to examine important subject specific parameters
      which influence response to the proposed intervention in dysphagic stroke patients. The
      overall aim of this study is to gather additional safety data on cumulative sessions of tDCS
      in acute-subacute phases of stroke, obtain information about effects of this intervention on
      important physiological and clinically relevant swallowing parameters, examine possible dose
      effects, and identify candidates who are more likely to benefit from this intervention. The
      experience gained from this project will guide planning of future confirmatory trials that
      use relevant clinical outcomes to assess potential benefits of this intervention and utilize
      important subject specific parameters to refine study inclusion criteria and aid in severity
      adjusted analysis.
