      device groups of 6 subjects each or into the control group containing 12 subjects. Patients
      in the device arm will receive one session of 3-to 24-hour continuous IOP monitoring with
      SENSIMED Triggerfish®. SENSIMED Triggerfish® monitoring will begin at 18h ± 2 hours for all
      patients. SENSIMED Triggerfish® will be installed randomly on right or left eyes. During
      SENSIMED Triggerfish® monitoring on one eye, GAT and/or Perkins IOP measurements will be
      taken in the fellow eye every 3 hours. Outside this time they will receive GAT and/or IOP
      measurements every 3 hours in both eyes until the end of the 24-hours period. Patients in the
      control group will receive GAT and/or ICare PRO IOP measurements every 3 hours for 24 hours
      in both eyes.
