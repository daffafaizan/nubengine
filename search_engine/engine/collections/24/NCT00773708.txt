      the increase in the rate of lymphocyte cell death (Badley AD, Blood. 2000; 96:2951-64).
      Increased lymphocyte death is associated with the level of activation of the immune system
      (Gougeon ML. Nat Rev Immunol. 2003: 3:392-404), along with the disregulation of the cytokine
      network and a plethora of cytotoxic effects induced by HIV proteins (Badley AD, Blood. 2000;
      96:2951-64). Hence, cell death can be observed in vivo not only in CD4+ cells, which are the
      main target of HIV, but also in CD8 T cells. Current knowledge suggest that immune activation
      and different mechanisms of cell death play a determinant role in T-lymphocyte (CD4+) loss
      during HIV infection and recovery after HAART (Bofill M et al AIDS. 1996 :827-34).

      Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) induces a decline in the level of immune
      activation and lymphocyte apoptosis in HIV-infected patients as a result of a reduction in
      viral replication (Kolber MA, et al, Clin Immunol. 2007 [Epub ahead of print]). This
      reduction contributes to the recovery of immune system associated with antiretroviral
      therapy. In addition to this effect, which is induced through the reduction in viral load,
      antiretroviral therapy has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis in different cell
      types, inhibiting or activating the process and influencing treatment efficacy and toxicity
      (Petit F, et al.Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2005. 26:258-64).

      Interestingly, it is not always true that antiretroviral therapy and viral suppression are
      associated with progressive immune recovery. Approximately 30% of patients present a
      paradoxical response to treatment, achieving progressive increases in immunity (measured by
      CD4+ count) despite failing to achieve viral suppression, or, vice versa, patients who
      maintain or reduce CD4+ cell count despite achieving viral suppression. Indeed, it is well
      known that higher CD8 activation is associated with fewer treatment-mediated CD4 gain. Each
      10% increase in activated CD8+HLADR+CD38+ mean 90 fewer CD4 cell gained (Hunt PW et al J
      Infect Dis. 2003. 187:1534-43). The failure of recover CD4 T cells may rely on a incomplete
      viral suppression than could be responsible for increased immune activation and lymphocyte
      death. Recently, it has been pointed out that intensification strategies may be useful in
      reducing activation and improving CD4 T cell recovery (Kolber MA, et al, Clin Immunol. 2007
      [Epub ahead of print]).
