    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the response rate in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal
           cancer treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Assess time to progression (TTP), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS)
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine in
           patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Exploratory

        -  Evaluate the effect of this regimen on the biomarkers of angiogenesis.

        -  Assess the effect of this regimen on wound angiogenesis.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12, oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours on day 1, and bevacizumab IV over 1-1Â½ hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 14
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
