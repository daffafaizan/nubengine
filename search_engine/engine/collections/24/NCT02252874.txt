      However, as we age, our physical and visual function would gradually deteriorate even in the
      absence of health or eye problems. Improving elderly balance control through different
      training is one way to prevent falls. In our project, we investigate the use of action video
      games, which is easy-to-find and entertaining, as a visual function trainer to improve
      balance of older adults.

      We hypothesize that the training would show an improvement in both balance and dynamic
      vision. Our primary hypothesis is that postural sway in static and dynamic balance measures
      will improve after action video-game intervention. For secondary outcome measures, we
      hypothesize that the training will improve dynamic visual function (as measured by dynamic
      visual acuity and dynamic contrast sensitivity), and visual attention measures (as measured
      by useful field of view, multiple object tracking and spatial attention).
