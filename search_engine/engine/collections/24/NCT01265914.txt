    
      FP-01.1 is composed of a mixture of synthetic peptides, modified with a fluorocarbon vector,
      which is anticipated to enhance the immune properties of the drug, and allows differentiation
      from recent investigational interventions by avoiding the use of adjuvant. The peptide
      sequences, derived from internal influenza-A proteins, were selected based on the presence of
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes and a high degree of conservation across all influenza strains,
      using a proprietary bioinformatics approach, and, it is proposed, will enable FP-01.1 to
      universally treat influenza-A -infected populations.

      This study is the initial exploration of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity response
      of FP-01.1 in healthy volunteers. Ascending doses of FP-01.1 will be assessed.
