      cream), as a topical treatment for pain associated with mild to moderate acute soft tissue
      injury of the upper and lower extremities to serve as a confirmatory trial. The first
      completed Phase 3 study showed efficacy and safety of TDLP-110 compared to placebo in
      improving the patient assessment of pain.
