    
      A retrospective chart review of 26 eyes of 23 patients with recurrent corneal erosions
      treated by PTK from 1996 to 2000 was performed. All eyes had failed to respond to
      conventional therapy. Data regarding the preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), symptomatic relief, incidence of recurrence, and
      complications arising from the laser treatment were analyzed. The mean duration of symptoms
      prior to PTK was 18 months (range, 8 to 36 months). The corneal epithelium was debrided, and
      laser ablation was performed to a depth of 5 micron with an ablation zone of 7 to 9 mm, using
      the Technolas 217C Plano Scan excimer laser. Mean postoperative follow-up was 12 years
      (range, 10 to 14 years).
