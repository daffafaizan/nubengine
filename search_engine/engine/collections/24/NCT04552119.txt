    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, post-marketing, observational, case series study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HEALICOIL Knotless Suture Anchors in subjects with
      rotator cuff tendon repair. Approximately 160 subjects will be enrolled at up to 6 sites.
      Safety monitoring will include documentation device- and surgery-related AEs. Efficacy will
      be monitored by assessment of post-operative follow up, clinical complications, reoperation
      rate, EQ-5D-5L, and pain VAS.
