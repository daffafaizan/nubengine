      The intervention group received 30 min of conventional occupational therapy (OT) and 30 min
      of the mobile upper extremity rehabilitation program using a smartphone and a tablet PC
      (MoU-Rehab). The controls (n = 12) received conventional OT alone for 1 h per day.
      Rehabilitation consisted of 10 sessions of therapy, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks. The outcome
      measures (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity [FMA-UE], BrunnstrÂ¨om stage [B-stage]
      for the arm and the hand, manual muscle testing [MMT], modified Barthel index [MBI],
      EuroQol-5 Dimension [EQ-5D], and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) were assessed at the
      beginning and end of treatment, and at 1 month. User satisfaction was evaluated by a
      qestionnaire.
