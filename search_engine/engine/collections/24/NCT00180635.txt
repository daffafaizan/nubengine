    
      Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by resident and inflammatory cells in the respiratory tract by
      the enzyme NO synthase (NOS), which exists in three isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible
      NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS. NO production is increased in patients with COPD, and the
      production of NO under oxidative stress conditions generates reactive nitrogen species that
      may amplify the inflammatory response in COPD.
