      (Children of mentally ill parents) for children and adolescents of psychiatrically ill
      parents aged between 3 and 19 years at the seven participating centres in regular care. The
      intervention aims at reducing children's psychopathology and enhancing their quality of life
      in a sustainable way and, moreover, aims at introducing especially remarkable children and
      adolescents to an early intervention.

      The study represents a prospective, randomized and controlled multicenter study (RCT),
      contrasting one intervention group and one control group (TAU = Treatment as usual) by
      measurements at baseline and after six, 12 and 18 months. Within the data collection, the
      perspective of the psychiatrically ill parent, the partner, each child and the therapist will
      be considered. Children between 3 and 9 years of age will be evaluated only by the parents
      and the therapist, from 10 years on, an additional self-report form will be filled out by the
      child. The measurement will be ruled out indirectly (for the pre-post-measurement) as well as
      directly (at the end of treatment).

      For each endpoint, one comprehensive mixed model will be fitted to the data containing the
      baseline value and further relevant patient characteristics as covariates, the random group
      as factor and cluster (center, therapy group, family) as random effect. Missing values will
      be treated by direct imputation to allow an intention-to-treat analysis.
