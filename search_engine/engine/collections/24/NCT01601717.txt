      (DA) release and stimulates midbrain reward centers. The proposed work represents an
      important research effort with considerable public health significance in that it will
      evaluate a compound targeted specifically at DA transporter (DAT) inhibition for the
      treatment of METH dependence. The knowledge gained may ultimately support development and
      implementation of evidence-based treatments for METH dependence, a drug abuse problem with
      tremendous public health impact.

      One therapeutic strategy is to develop and test compounds that normalize (increase) DA to
      determine if treatment with these drugs reduces METH use. A similar approach has been
      proposed as a treatment for cocaine dependence (Howell and Wilcox 2001; Mello and Negus
      1996), another disorder associated with abnormally low DA activity (Martinez et al. 2007). In
      an effort to identify a DAT selective inhibitor, a number of 3-phenyltropane analogs were
      synthesized by RTI International. Among these, preclinical studies have shown that RTI-336
      produced cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects and reduced cocaine self-administration
      in rats, and produced dose-dependent suppression of cocaine self-administration in rhesus
      monkeys.

      RTI-336 recently received IND-approval (75,778) for preliminary safety testing in healthy
      male volunteers, and is scheduled to be completed by February 2009. Subsequent to this
      effort, RTI-336 will be evaluated in a phase I trial involving cocaine-dependent volunteers.
      The current application puts forth, for the first time, a proposal to evaluate the
      preliminary efficacy of this very promising candidate medication in non-treatment-seeking
      METH-dependent volunteers.
