    
      Part 1: HCV genotype 2 or 3: participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with
      weight-based RBV for 12 weeks. Participants will be randomized in equal proportions to: no
      PEG (Arm 1), PEG for 4 weeks (Arm 2), PEG for 8 weeks (Arm 3), or PEG for 12 weeks (Arm 4).

      Part 2: HCV genotype 2 or 3: participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily (monotherapy)
      for 12 weeks (Arm 5), or SOF 400 mg once daily with PEG and weight-based RBV for 8 weeks (Arm
      6); HCV genotype 1: null responders (did not respond to their prior treatment) will receive
      SOF 400 mg once daily with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 7).

      Part 3: HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive (Arm 8) or HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment-experienced
      participants (Arm 9) will receive SOF 400 mg once daily in combination with weight-based RBV
      for 12 weeks.

      Part 4: HCV genotype 2 or 3 treatment naive participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily
      with weight-based RBV for 8 weeks (Arm 10) or SOF 400 mg once daily and 800 mg RBV for 12
      weeks (Arm 11). HCV genotype 1 null responders will receive SOF 400 mg once daily, ledipasvir
      (LDV), and weight based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 12). HCV genotype-1 treatment naive
      participants will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with weight-based RBV and LDV for 12 weeks
      (Arm 13).

      Part 5: HCV genotype 1 null responders will receive SOF 400 mg once daily with GS-9669 500 mg
      once daily and weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 14). HCV genotype-1 treatment naive
      participants receive SOF 400 mg once daily with GS-9669 500 mg once daily and weight-based
      RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 15).

      Part 6: HCV genotype 1 null responders with Stage F4 fibrosis will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 12
      weeks (Arm 16) or LDV/SOF FDC with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 17). HCV genotype 2 or
      3 treatment-naive participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks (Arm 18). HCV genotype 2
      or 3 treatment-experienced participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks (Arm 19). HCV
      genotype 1 hemophiliacs will receive LDV/SOF FDC with weight-based RBV for 12 weeks (Arm 20).
      HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC with weight-based RBV
      for 6 weeks (Arm 21). HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive participants will receive LDV/SOF FDC
      for 6 weeks (Arm 22).
