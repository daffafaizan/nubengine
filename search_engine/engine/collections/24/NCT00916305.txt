      recommendations of offspring or friends. Staff will be given information about the study and
      asked to provide an email address if the recruits are willing.

      After obtaining informed consent online, participants will be randomized to active
      intervention i.e. an audio video demonstrating

        -  Normal hearing

        -  Temporary hearing damage after one night at a loud club

        -  Noise-induced hearing loss after repeated exposure (e.g. repeated clubbing for several
           months)

        -  Tinnitus related to noise exposure

      Controls will watch the same video with an unaltered soundtrack.

      Baseline data on listening habits and volumes will be collected prior to the intervention and
      again at 2 and 4 weeks. All data will be collected using an online system (survey monkey). At
      no point will researchers meet participants who will also not be known to each other.

      Compliance will be assessed as participants will have to give a comment at the end of
      listening to the intervention.

      Primary outcome: reduction is the proportion of time young people spend listening to music at
      a dangerous level i.e. equivalent to >80dB for 8 hours per day for 5 days a week
