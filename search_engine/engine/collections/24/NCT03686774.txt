    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label study in patients undergoing mastectomy.
      Patients included in this trial will receive memantine or not. For patients in the
      "memantine" group, the treatment will be given in titration (maximum dose of 20 mg/day).
      Concerning the comparator group, patients will be followed in the same way as those in the
      "memantine" group except that they will not receive the study treatment. Whether it is the
      "memantine" group or the "usual care" group, visits will be scheduled under the usual
      following conditions of the participating center.
