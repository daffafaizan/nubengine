      explicit plans for opioid taper by primary care providers are effective at promoting tapering
      or discontinuation, and if they are effective, which components account for their
      effectiveness. Patients receiving long-term opioid therapy (LtOT), who are candidates for
      tapering, often perceive a low risk of overdose and a high risk of increased pain with opioid
      tapering. They fear opioid withdrawal and lack of effectiveness of non-opioid therapies. For
      patients with opioid tapering experience, support from family and a trusted health care
      provider eased opioid tapering. Many patients report improved quality of life following
      taper.

      Little data exists on the optimal opioid taper strategy, including: use of long or
      short-acting opioids, frequency of clinic visits, use of adjunctive medications and the role
      of psychological support. Recent initiatives to reduce high-dose opioid use at Kaiser
      Permanente Washington offer an opportunity to study the effect of opioid taper plans and
      their components in an integrated care system with an electronic health record including all
      health encounters and pharmacy dispensing.

      This study will report the proportion of LtOT patients who successfully taper compared to a
      similar group of LtOT patients who don't achieve tapering or discontinuation of tapering. We
      will also evaluate whether taper plans, defined by the patient's primary care provider,
      increase the likelihood of successfully tapering comparing the two groups cited above.
