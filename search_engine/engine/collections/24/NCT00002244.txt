    
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups to receive 4 IV treatment cycles of either
      WF10 or control (physiological saline solution). Patients are monitored throughout the study
      for: a) clinical progression; b) number, duration, and cause of hospitalizations; c) quality
      of life; and d) density of CD38 antigen on CD8+ T cells. Patients receive treatment for 11
      weeks but will continue to be followed for a maximum of 96 weeks. During the follow-up
      period, patients are evaluated initially at Week 18, then at Weeks 24, 36, and 48. If the
      study is continued beyond Week 48, follow-up visits are conducted at Weeks 72 and 96.
