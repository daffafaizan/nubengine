      efficacy yields 80% approximately, but its mecanims of action remains poorly understood. In
      particular, SNS does not restore anal squeezing contraction nor it increase anal tone.
      Recently, using a porcine model, it was shown that SNS changed colonic permeability,
      suggesting that SNS may activate the enteric nervous system (ENS).

      The investigators hypothtized therefore that SNS could act on enteric nervous system (ENS).

      To verify this hypothesis, the investigators will collect biopsy samples from patients before
      and after implantation for SNS. The investigators will assess whether SNS induces changes in
      ENS, and if this is correlated to SNS efficacy.
