      the intervention, attention control strategies (e.g., adolescents' 'own best efforts' at
      managing arthritis), and outcome measures; (3) determine adolescents' perceptions regarding
      acceptability of the web-based intervention; and (4) obtain estimates of treatment effects in
      primary (HRQL) and secondary (knowledge, coping, self-efficacy, stress, treatment adherence,
      pain) outcome measures to inform the calculation of appropriate sample size for the future
      RCT.

      We hypothesize that adolescents with JIA in the web-based intervention will demonstrate: (a)
      improved HRQL; (b) increased disease-specific knowledge; (c) improved coping, self-efficacy,
      and adherence to prescribed management; and (d) decreased pain and stress compared to
      adolescents in the attention control group
