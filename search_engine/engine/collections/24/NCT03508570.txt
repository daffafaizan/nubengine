      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of intraperitoneal (i.p.) nivolumab in
      combination with ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicities, and immune-related adverse events
      associated with i.p. checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

      II. To estimate the clinical benefit rate (rate of partial response [PR], complete response
      [CR], and stable disease [SD] using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
      version 1.1 modified to include immune-related response criteria) for the expansion cohort.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine blood based transcriptional changes associated with pharmacokinetics (PK)
      time points and determine their correlation with serum drug concentrations, clinical
      response, and immune related adverse events.

      II. To determine baseline and on-treatment molecular alteration (ribonucleic acid [RNA] and
      protein) associated with i.p. and nivolumab (Nivo) (for the expansion cohort).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive nivolumab i.p. over 90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Cycles repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive nivolumab as in group I and ipilimumab i.p. on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for at least
      100 days.
