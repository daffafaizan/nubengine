      MEN1611 in combination with Trastuzumab with/without Fulvestrant in female and male patients
      affected by advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Fulvestrant will be added to
      the post-menopausal patients with hormone-sensitive disease.

      MEN1611 is an investigational drug which blocks a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide
      3-kinase) involved in cancer cells growth. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MEN1611 given
      as single agent was assessed in a phase I trial in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This Phase IB will start with a dose escalation part (Step 1) to identify the MTD of MEN1611
      given in combination with Trastuzumab with/without Fulvestrant.

      The study will continue with a cohort expansion (Step 2) to investigate the anti-tumor
      activity of the selected MEN1611 dose level considered to be tolerable by a Safety Review
      Committee.
