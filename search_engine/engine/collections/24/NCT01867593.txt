      screening tests or procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and
      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out
      that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or
      procedure recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. The screening process will
      include the following: A medical history, performance status, physical exam, routine blood
      tests, assessment of your tumor, diagnosis confirmation and pregnancy test. If these tests
      show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study
      treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate
      in this research study.

      Within 3 weeks after your surgery you will undergo a MET-PET scan to define residual
      metabolic activity.

      After completion of radiation therapy at 1,3,5,7,9 and 11 months following radiation therapy
      you will undergo: a medical history, physical exam, assessment of your tumor by MRI,
      documentation of your current dose of steroids, blood tests and an evaluation for side
      effects.

      At one month after the completion of radiation therapy you will undergo the second and final
      MET-PET scan to assess response to therapy.

      After the 11 month follow-up visit, we would like to keep track of your medical condition for
      the rest of your life as part of our routine care. If we no longer see you in person in the
      clinic, we would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you
      are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every year helps us look at
      the long-term effects of the research study.
