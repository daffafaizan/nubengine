      intervention or PCI) involves both risk and inconvenience, and thus it represents a classic
      "preference-sensitive" situation, in which treatment decisions should be aligned with the
      patient's preferences.

      In this project the investigators will develop the first comprehensive, patient-reported
      measure of decisional quality for CAD that is feasible to implement in a variety of settings.
      The investigators will accomplish this by: 1) Identifying the key elements to capture
      decisional quality and identifying candidate questions to address these elements, using
      patient and expert feedback; 2) Pilot testing a preliminary instrument in a diverse patient
      population to assess measurement properties and select a reduced set of candidate questions
      for further testing; and 3) Establish the reliability and validity of a new comprehensive
      decisional quality measure for single and repeated examinations. This will result in a
      multidimensional decisional quality instrument for patients with CAD that will be ready for
      implementation into routine care.
