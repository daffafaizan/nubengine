    
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is non-receptor tyrosine kinase with restricted cellular
      expression largely limited to B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and mast cells or basophils. Btk is a
      critical component of the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling network and is crucial for B cell
      development. Investigation has revealed that some B cell lymphomas and CLL depend on BCR
      signaling, suggesting that interruption of such signaling could be a promising therapeutic
      opportunity in B-NHL, CLL and WM.
