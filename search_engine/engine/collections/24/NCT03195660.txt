      Study (CAT-HF) was a randomized controlled clinical trial in the United States and Germany.
      It was designed to evaluate the effect of ASV in hospitalized heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF)
      patients on a global rank endpoint of survival free from CV hospitalization and improvement
      in functional capacity measured by 6-minute walk distance. Analysis of the 126 subjects that
      were randomized showed a neutral result for the primary endpoint; however, in the
      pre-specified analysis of the primary endpoint by LVEF strata, there was a favorable
      statistically significant difference in the HFpEF subgroup (p=0.036).

      Although the CAT-HF study showed a positive signal in the HFpEF subgroup, these patients
      represented a small percentage of the randomized subjects in the study. The current study
      aims to show that by applying newer technologies to support adherence, as well as focusing on
      the lessons learned in CAT-HF to identify and recruit HFpEF patients, acceptable adherence to
      ASV therapy can be achieved in HFpEF patients.
