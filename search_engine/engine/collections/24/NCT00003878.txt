        -  Determine the local recurrence rate in patients with supratentorial metastatic brain
           tumors undergoing surgical resection treated with polifeprosan 20 with carmustine
           implant (Gliadel wafers).

        -  Determine the incidence and time to recurrence at distant sites within the CNS in these
           patients after this treatment.

        -  Determine the median, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year survival of these patients on this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of cognitive function loss of these patients on
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of CNS and systemic toxic effects of these patients
           on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive up to 8 polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implants (Gliadel wafers)
      implanted in the resected tumor cavity.

      Patients are followed on day 7 or day of discharge, at 1 month, 3 months, every 3 months for
      21 months, and then for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 30 months.
