      (SEMF) technique to acquire full thickness gastric tissues successfully and safely in
      preclinical studies.

      The proposed study will assess the efficacy and safety of the innovative endoscopic technique
      for the acquisition of full thickness gastric muscle wall biopsies. Having access to full
      thickness biopsies will allow an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of
      gastrointestinal diseases such as functional gastrointestinal disorders, gastroparesis,
      pseudoobstruction and other motility disorders. This information is essential to development
      of more targeted and effective therapy than currently available. Despite the high prevalence
      of functional gastrointestinal disorders and its significant impact on social and health care
      costs, the underlying cause is not well understood and there is no effective specific
      treatment to successfully alleviate patient symptoms.
