      Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone(TRH). TRH is distributed widely in the brain, and exerts
      variety of central nervous system effects as well as endocrine activity such as releasing of
      Thyroid Stimulating Hormone(TSH) and Prolactin. Based on these actions, studies have been
      attempted for the treatment of various neurological diseases such as refractory epilepsy,
      cerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebellar ataxia and so on. C-Trelin OD
      tablet 5mg (Taltirelin Hydrate) for the clinical trial is a commercially available drug that
      was approved by Ministry of Food and Drug Safety(MFDS) based on the safety and efficacy.
      However, the studies with this medicine were conducted before 1997, and the evaluation
      criteria for the efficacy was quite different from the current evaluation criteria.

      In this clinical trial, K-SARA as an objective evaluation criteria validated in Korean
      patients is used to confirm the efficacy of C-Trelin to improve ataxia, and to prove safety
      by evaluating changes in clinical laboratory data and adverse events.
