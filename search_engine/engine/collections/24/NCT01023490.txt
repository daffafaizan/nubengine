      Vitamin D is naturally produced by skin exposed to ultraviolet B. Despite the fact that
      Israel is a sunny country, a majority of all patients, and particularly those with pain, have
      inadequate intake of vitamin D.

      Vitamin D therapy is easy for patients to self administer, well tolerated, and very
      economical.

      In this study, we'll check whether vitamin D will lead to a decrease in pain intensity in
      patients suffering from chronic low back pain.
