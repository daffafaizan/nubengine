    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate in patients with HSD effects of treatment
      with phlebotomy rules with lifestyle and dietary rules versus lifestyle modifications alone
      on peripheral insulin resistance (assessed by hyperinsulinemic clamp).

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  to study in all patients with HSD the relationship between the amount of iron
           intrahepatic and degree of peripheral insulin resistance and liver before therapeutic
           intervention.

        -  to study and compare the effects of phlebotomy treatment versus no treatment on:

             -  Plasma levels of adipocytokines,

             -  Plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers and markers of insulin resistance,

             -  The serum ferritin,

             -  The post-hepatic clearance of insulin,

             -  The surface of the abdominal visceral fat and subcutaneous abdominal.
