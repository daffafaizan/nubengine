      the safety and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous injection as compared to a single,
      intramuscular injection.

      A total of 110 healthy participants (55 per group) will take part in this study.

      Each participant will be randomly (like flipping a coin) assigned to receive one of the
      following :

        -  A single injection of TAK-850, subcutaneously , or

        -  A single injection of TAK-850, intramuscularly.

      Participants will make up to 3 visits to the study site. Total duration of this study is 22
      days.
