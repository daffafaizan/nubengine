      pulse wave velocity ( PWV), augmentation index ( AI), flow-mediated dilation ( FMD) and
      myocardial perfusion ( contrast enhanced ultrasound CEU) before and 2 hours after ingesting a
      mixed meal (40% of each subject's daily estimated caloric need, with 50%, 30%, 20% from
      carbohydrates, fat and protein, respectively).

      DM1 subjects will have 2 study admissions:

      A) DM1 subjects will have an injection of insulin 15 minutes before ingesting a mixed meal.

      B) DM1 subjects will have an injection of insulin 15 min after ingesting a meal .
