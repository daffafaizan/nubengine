      use disorder patients will be recruited prior to leaving detoxification and/or short-term
      residential programs. Screening and baseline data (focused on demographics, diagnosis and
      service utilization) will be collected prior to discharge, and follow-up data (focused on
      opioid use) will be collected at weeks 1, 4 and 8 following discharge.
