        -  Determine the systemic and normal tissue toxicity of photodynamic therapy with HPPH in
           patients with early stage or centrally obstructing non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of HPPH.

      Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients undergo laser light therapy via
      bronchoscopy on day 3.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of HPPH until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-17 patients will be accrued for this study within 2
      years.
