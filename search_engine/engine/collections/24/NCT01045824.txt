      traditional psychiatry diagnosis, genetics and long term brain change researches will help to
      unveil the secret of schizophrenia and other factors. The advantage of comparative gene
      hybridization is that chromosome copy number alterations can be detected; this technique has
      been widely applied in many researches, such as cancer, mental retardation screening and
      autism. As we known, we are the first one use this technique in chromosome abnormality
      research for family history schizophrenic patient, this study also is the first one to track
      the relationship of long term brain function alteration and chromosome abnormality in Taiwan.
