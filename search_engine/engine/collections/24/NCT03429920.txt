      soybeans that might help in managing heart disease. The rationale for this study is to reduce
      the risk factors of heart disease in high risk individuals by using soy supplements. The
      dietary supplement intervention trial is a randomized, 2x2 cross over design with 24 subjects
      in free-living conditions. There will be a two week run-in (acclimation period) after which
      subjects will be randomized to receive either QCAN powder or placebo powder for 12 weeks.
      Following a two week wash out period, subjects will be switched over(cross over) to alternate
      treatment. Thus, the interventions of the study will last for a total of 28 weeks.
