      desacylated ghrelin (DAG) levels during long-term exercise in adolescent population. Our
      previous study showed that combined exercise program in overweight children increases DAG
      with unchanged AG. This study aimed to explore the effects of a 12-week combined exercise on
      GOAT, AG, and DAG in obese girls.
