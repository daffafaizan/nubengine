    
      ANAIS (Alimentaci√≥n Normal con Ajuste de InSulina) is a Spanish version of the DAFNE
      programme, performed in patients with type 1 diabetes. ANAIS is a randomised, controlled,
      parallel trial.

      ANAIS is a group-based, therapeutic education programme for type 1 diabetes based on a
      flexible insulin regime adjusted to the patient's food intake.

      Participants with type 1 diabetes and an HbA1c between 7 and 10% were recruited from the
      outpatient clinics in a tertiary care center. They were randomised (opaque, sealed envelopes,
      2:1 ratio) to attend the training course immediately (immediate ANAIS) or a year later
      (delayed ANAIS).

      The main outcome was HbA1c at one year. Secondary outcomes included lipids, weight,
      hypoglycemic events, treatment satisfaction, quality of life and self-defined objectives.
