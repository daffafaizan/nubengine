      allowing translocation of gram-positive bacteria in secondary lymphoid organs. While this
      has, until recently, been considered an undesirable side-effect, it may also represent one
      mechanism by which chemotherapy stimulates an effective anti-cancer immune response. The
      purpose of this research is to test whether bacteria that normally live in the intestines
      play a role in fighting cancer. It is believed that the development and behavior of these
      immune cells may be influenced by bacteria and other microorganisms living in the gut. In
      turn, the activities of these immune cells could work with anti-cancer therapies to make them
      more, or less, effective. The hypothesis is that gut microbial composition can influence
      immune response to the tumor, resulting in inter-individual differences in the response to
      anti-cancer therapies.
