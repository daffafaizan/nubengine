      and the complex treatment, in the intervention group. The complex treatment will be based on
      health education, aerobic physical exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy, during 12 weeks

      response and of the size of the standardized effect and multivariate logistic regression

      Qualitative socio-constructivist study to identify the improvement aspects of the
      intervention according to the results obtained and the opinions and experiences of the
      participants (patients and professionals). The sampling will be theoretical with 2 discussion
