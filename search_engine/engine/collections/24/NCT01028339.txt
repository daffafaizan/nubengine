      deleterious, particularly through hyperdiuresis and risks of hypovolemia. It also needs
      volume compensation and induces logistical problem because of needs of high infused volume to
      achieve osmolar load and avoid hypotension. Finally, some recent studies tend to prove
      superiority of hypertonic saline versus mannitol on the prognosis of TBI. especially through
      modulation of inflammatory reactions mechanisms and apoptosis.

      We would like to prove non inferiority of hypertonic saline versus mannitol after TBI to
      allow its large utilization, especially by field military doctors with specific logistical
      problems. For that, more than the single Intracranial Pressure, we want to study effects of
      HS vs mannitol not only on PtiO2 but also on cerebral microdialysis which gives informations
      on focal metabolism with profiles of ischemia, metabolic crisis, hyperglycolysis (possible
      reflect of neuronal restoration) and normality.
