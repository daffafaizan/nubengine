      diagnosis of hip fracture and a A1c performed within 3 months of the event admitted to Changi
      General Hospital, Singapore from 1st Jan 2005 to 31st Dec 2010were included in the study. As
      the present study was targeted at looking at an association between the glucose lowering
      effect of medications on A1C levels and subsequent hip fracture risk, exclusion criteria
      included patients who wereduplicate cases, traumatic fractures, newly diagnosed T2DM
      patients, and those on diet control.

      The information on discharge diagnosis was taken from the Discharge Register of the Hospital.
      It includes all diagnosis of the patient upon discharge. The diagnosis of patients is coded
      using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system. All patients admitted with
      the diagnosis of neck of femur fracture (8208 ICD-9), inter-trochanteric fracture (82021
      ICD-9), sub-trochanteric fracture (82022 ICD-9), transcervical fracture (82003 ICD-9), and a
      secondary diagnosis of diabetes (250 ICD-9) were identified from the register.

      Out of 932 patients initially identified, 31 were duplicates, 10 were admitted for a
      traumatic fracture, 136 had no recent A1C level. Of the remaining 757 patients, 162 on diet
      control and 12 newly diagnosed with diabetes were excluded. The final list of cases consisted
      of 581 patients, 157 men and 427 women, mean age 76.3 Â± 8.7 years.

      Controls were selected from a register of patients managed for diabetes from a similar period
      (1st Jan 2005 to 31st Dec 2010) at Changi General Hospital outpatient clinics (N=4,522). For
      each case, one control subject, matched for sex and within 2 years of age, was randomly
      selected from the register. Inclusion criteria included patients taking oral hypoglycemic
      agents or insulin, and exclusion criteria were patients with a history of hip fractures.

      Information on the baseline characteristics and exposure variables were collected by the same
      methods in cases and control subjects, using the computerised medical records and discernment
      of the medical notes.

      The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
