      refractory to standard therapy will be enrolled in this study. In dose-escalation cohort,
      subjects will be enrolled sequentially into four dose cohorts receiving a single dose of
      YYB101 (0.3, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg; 3 or 6 subjects per dose cohort) and will be entered the
      4-week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics. If no dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) is observed during the 4-week period, YYB101 administration will be resumed at
      the same dose level every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      development. After the completion of the dose-escalation cohort, additional subjects will be
      enrolled into a dose-expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      phase II dose (RP2D) for further exploration of safety, tolerability, efficacy and
      pharmacodynamics.
