      They were randomized into experimental and control groups. The experimental group will be
      submitted to intra-articular infiltration of six facet joints. The control group will be
      submitted to intramuscular injection of six lumbar paravertebral points. After the
      randomization, all subjects will be assessed by an investigator blinded to the groups. The
      assessment will be taken just before the interventions (T0) and them 7 , 30 , 90 and 180 days
      after the interventions. The following assessment instruments will be used: pain visual
      analogical scale (VAS) (0-10cm), pain visual analogical scale during extension of the spine
      (VAS E) (0-10cm), Likert scale for improving (0-5), percentage scale of subjective improving
      perception(0-100%), Rolland-Morris questionnaire (0-24), short health survey questionnaire
      (SF36), accountability of medications taken for back pain: analgesics and non-steroidal
      antiinflammatories (NSAIDs).
