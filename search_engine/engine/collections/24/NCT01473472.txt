      the study:

        -  a first enrollment phase for at least 300 participants to ensure the possibility for
           recruitment in France and Canada and to validate the tools put into place as part of the
           trial to enroll and follow participants

        -  a second phase of 1600 additional participants. This extension phase started on July
           2014.

      The recruitment has been suspended following the recommendations of Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board (DSMB): the placebo arm has been stopped and Truvada was available for all
      the participants of the trial since November 2014. The initial protocol was amended and 361
      participants were enrolled in the open-label phase. Sub-studies were proposed to the
      participants:

        -  Sub-study on the outcome of participants receiving sofosbuvir/ledipasvir treatment for
           recent HCV infection (protocol amendment on April 2015)

        -  Randomized sub-study to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis
           on sexually transmitted infections (protocol amendment on July 2015)

        -  Sub-study to evaluate Truvada adherence with Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS)
           (protocol amendment on December 2015)

        -  Sub-study on drugs use and the impact on sexual behavior and Truvada adherence (protocol
           amendment on December 2015).
