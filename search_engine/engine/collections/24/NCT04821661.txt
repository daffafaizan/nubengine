      (for example, the urinary tract, the respiratory tract or vascular lines) but in some
      situations the source of bloodstream infection is not readily apparent. It is normally
      associated with fever, rigors and signs of infection at the portal of entry of bacteria into
      the blood. It is sometimes associated with sepsis. Bloodstream infection is highly
      significant and is associated with mortality rates of between 10 and 25%.

      For some infection types (for example, Staphylococcus aureus) a longer duration of bacteria
      being present in the blood is linked to higher mortality. With traditional microbiologic
      techniques, bloodstream infection with gram-negative bacteria is usually quite brief.
      However, new culture independent bacteraemia detection systems (such as T2 magnetic resonance
      assay) are more sensitive than traditional blood culture systems and may show that
      gram-negative bacteraemia is more prolonged in some patients than has previously been
      thought. This observational study will investigate the correlation between the duration of
      bloodstream infection using traditional blood culture techniques with:

        1. The T2 magnetic resonance assay, a new culture independent bacteraemia detection system.

        2. Persistence in abnormalities of vital signs.

        3. Persistence in elevation of the white cell count and inflammatory biomarkers.

        4. Persistence in inflammatory biomarkers as measured by the SeptiCyte RAPID test It will
           also correlate each measure of the duration of bacteraemia with mortality, length of
           stay and the long-term outcome of a patient.
