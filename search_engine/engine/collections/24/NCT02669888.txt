      children. AD is characterized by itchy and dry skin that affects approximately 5 to 20% of
      children in the world. Currently, corticosteroids are the most widely prescribed medication
      in treating AD; however, there are concerns regarding the side effects such as skin atrophy,
      telangiectasia, striae, folliculitis and adrenocortical suppression that inhibits growth in
      children. Many patients and families seek complementary and alternative medications such as
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In TCM, indigo naturalis has been used to treat various
      infectious and inflammatory skin diseases for hundreds of years. Ancient TCM literature has
      recorded that indigo naturalis is also effective in treating facial eczema (AD) in infants.

      The aims of this project are: (1) To evaluate the efficacy of indigo naturalis ointment in
      treating AD topically; (2) To evaluate the safety of indigo naturalis ointment in treating AD
      topically; (3) To investigate whether indigo naturalis ointment treatment is associated with
      a change in total IgE, cytokines, eosinophils, and CRP in patients with AD; (4) To evaluate
      whether indigo naturalis ointment treatment improves the quality of life in patients with AD.
