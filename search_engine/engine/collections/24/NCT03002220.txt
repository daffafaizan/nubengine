    
      Primary objective:

      To assess the efficacy of radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with mCRPC who have progressed
      while on abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment.

      Primary endpoint:

      To determine the efficacy of radium-223 in terms of radiological rPFS.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Safety profile.

        -  To determine the association between AR-V7 status (positive vs. negative) and PFS.

        -  To establish the relationship between CTCs number with radium-223 efficacy.

      Secondary endpoints:

      Safety AEs will be evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) version 4.0 [20]. Grade 3 or 4 AEs and serious
      adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed to determine the safety and tolerability of the
      various combinations of drugs.

      Efficacy

        -  Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) depending on AR-V7 status.

        -  Overall survival (OS).

        -  Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE).

        -  Time to PSA progression according to the ALSYMPCA study criteria.

        -  Determination percentage of PSA progression.

        -  Alkaline phosphatase level response (AF), normalization of alkaline phosphatase level,
           according to the ALSYMPCA study criteria.

      Molecular aspects

        -  Assessment of AR-V7 mutation evolution during the study treatment.

        -  Determination changes in CTCs number during the study treatment.
