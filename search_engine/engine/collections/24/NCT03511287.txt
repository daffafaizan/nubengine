      pulmonary rehabilitation program for patients with advanced lung disease. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate, the effects of inspiratory muscle training program in inspiratory
      muscle function, functional capacity, quality of life, lung function, breathing pattern and
      chest wall motion in patients with advanced lung disease. It is a quasi-experimental study
      with longitudinal design. Patients with advanced lung disease from the advanced lung disease
      and pre lung transplantation ambulatory performed home-based high intensity interval IMT for
      8 weeks (two sessions per day, daily). In each session patients executed two times 30 breaths
      with one-minute rest between them. Resistance was set to the highest tolerable according to
      scores pointed by the patient on the Borg score (between 4 and 6) aiming 50% of actual pimax
      or higher. An experienced physiotherapist was responsible for weekly adjustments on the
      resistance of training as well as new assessment of maximal inspiratory pressure. Patients
      were evaluated before the inspiratory muscle training, after 8 weeks of training and at
      follow-up which was performed 3 months after the end of the intervention. Patients were
      evaluated by the same experienced researcher in all three moments of the study. Evaluations
      were performed in the Laboratory of research and evaluation of cardiorespiratory performance
      of Federal University of Minas Gerais.
