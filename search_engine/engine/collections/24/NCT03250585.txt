      exhaled breath condensate (liquid) to measure levels of a biomarker, secretory phospholipases
      A2 (sPLA2) in people with sickle cell disease during an attack of acute chest syndrome. sPLA2
      levels have been reported to be much higher in persons with acute chest syndrome and might be
      useful to diagnose and to evaluate the effects of therapy.

      Serial monitoring of plasma sPLA2 levels might lead to earlier or more accurate detection of
      acute chest syndrome and monitoring of its progression or improvement in patients with sickle
      cell disease. However, there is a significant inherent risk of frequent blood collection
      further dropping the blood (hemoglobin) levels of an already anemic patient. If sPLA2 can be
      measured in exhaled breath condensate, this non-invasive and well-tolerated sample collection
      might allow for serial monitoring of the enzyme without depleting the patient's already
      diminished blood supply.
