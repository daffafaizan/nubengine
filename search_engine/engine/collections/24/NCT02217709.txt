      I. To assess the proportion of patients with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer (BCR-PC)
      treated with phenelzine (phenelzine sulfate) who achieve a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      decline of >= 50% from baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor potential toxicities and/or beneficial effects on quality of life of phenelzine
      in prostate cancer patients.

      II. To assess time to radiographic disease progression for patients with recurrent prostate
      cancer treated with phenelzine.

      III. To collect blood and other samples to study the relationship between MAO activity and
      prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive phenelzine sulfate 30 mg by mouth (PO) twice daily (BID) (starting dose of
      15 mg daily escalated to 30 mg BID over 16 plus or minus 5 days). Patients who have been
      treated at 30 mg BID for over 3 cycles with resolution of any and all toxicities to grade <
      or = 1 may increase the dose to a maximum of 45 mg BID at the discretion of the treating
      investigator. Treatment may continue in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3
      years.
