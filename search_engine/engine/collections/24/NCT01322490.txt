    
      BNIT-PRV-301 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, global Phase 3 efficacy trial
      of PROSTVAC in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic, castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer. It is a 3-arm study and will evaluate overall survival in two separate
      comparisons, PROSTVAC plus adjuvant dose GM-CSF versus controls, and PROSTVAC without GM-CSF
      versus controls.

      Patients will be randomized with equal probability into one of three double-blind arms. The
      intended interventions for randomized patients are:

        1. (Arm V+G) PROSTVAC-V/F plus adjuvant dose GM-CSF

        2. (Arm V) PROSTVAC-V/F plus GM-CSF placebo

        3. (Arm P) Double placebo
