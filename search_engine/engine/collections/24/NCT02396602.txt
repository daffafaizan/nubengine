      family planning, we have prototyped a digital application ("app")-miPlan-to be used in the
      clinic waiting room prior to a contraceptive visit. The goal of this research is to refine
      the app and conduct a randomized controlled trial of the miPlan intervention vs. standard
      care contraceptive counseling. The aim of this study is to understand miPlan's impact in
      terms of contraceptive knowledge, intentions and behaviors. The primary outcome is LARC
      uptake, which will be measured via chart review at clinic discharge, i.e. immediately
      following a patient's family planning visit. The secondary outcomes are contraceptive use at
      discharge (measured via chart review immediately following patient's family planning visit),
      self-efficacy and decisional balance (both measured via adapted validated scales for each)
      for highly effective contraception post-app use (measured immediately following intervention
      and prior to contraceptive counseling session), contraceptive satisfaction (measured at 3
      months post baseline), and intention to continue method use (measured at 3 months post
      baseline). The research will consist of baseline activities as well as a three-month
      follow-up call.
