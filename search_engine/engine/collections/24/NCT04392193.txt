      patients, including tumors in the heart, but not for treating heart rhythm disorders. The use
      of proton radiation therapy to treat heart rhythm disorders including VT and ventricular
      fibrillation (VF) is new and investigational; however, the FDA has approved proton therapy to
      treat abnormal rhythm disorders for this study. The development of a proton radiation therapy
      approach could be of substantial value in providing alternative therapy to either drug
      therapy or catheter-based ablation. With appropriate development, this therapy may be
      successful in the primary or secondary elimination of arrhythmias.

      Participants will be followed at 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24-month intervals following
      treatment throughout the trial.

      Participant involvement will last approximately two years from the time of the proton
      radiation therapy procedure or until the last subject enrolled completes a 24 month
      follow-up.
