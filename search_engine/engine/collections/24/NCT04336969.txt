      investigator's clinical practice to sustain tight glucose control from the onset of type 1
      diabetes (T1D) and optimize patient reported and psychosocial outcomes. The investigators
      will define a program (4T - Teamwork, Targets, Technology, and Tight Control) translatable to
      Pediatric Diabetes clinics in the United States that reduces HbA1c and T1D burden and
      improves patient well-being.
