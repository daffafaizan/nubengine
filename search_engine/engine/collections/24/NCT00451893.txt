      diminishing frequency of reoperations. Randomized controlled trials indicate that hernia
      repair with an open mesh technique has a shorter learning curve, is cheaper and may give less
      recurrences than laparoscopic hernia repair in general surgical practice. Furthermore, local
      anesthesia has significant advantages for both the patient and the health related economy
      compared to general anesthesia and regional anesthesia. The experience of the last decade
      within the field of groin hernia surgery has focused interest on quality of life and
      postoperative pain (especially chronic pain). Chronic pain is defined as pain that remains 3
      months after the operation. Recent studies indicate that one third of all patients operated
      on for inguinal hernia have some degree of chronic pain and that 4-6 % of patients have pain
      interfering with daily activities one year after surgery.

      In the present study a heavy-weight polypropylene mesh will be compared with a light-weight
      partly absorbable mesh. In an expertise-based randomized control trial patients will be
      randomly allocated to two groups of surgeons, each group well trained to use one of the two
      meshes.
