    
      The study consists of a 12-week observation period, a 1-week (acceptable window: 5-9 days)
      transitional period, a 12-week study treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period.
      Subjects who have been receiving riluzole since before the enrollment are allowed to
      continuously receive riluzole during the 12-week observation period (with the dosage
      remaining unchanged), and stop receiving riluzole from the beginning of the 1-week
      (acceptable window: 5-9 days) transitional period. After the completion of the transitional
      period, subjects whose total ALSFRS-R score decreased by 1 to 3 points during the 12-week
      observation period will receive bosutinib for 12 weeks to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of bosutinib in ALS patients. All ALS drugs including riluzole will be
      prohibited during the bosutinib treatment period.

      In this study, 3 to 6 ALS patients will be enrolled in each of the 4 bosutinib dose lelvels
      [100 mg/day (dose level 1), 200 mg/day (dose level 2), 300 mg/day (dose level 3), or
      400mg/day (dose level 4)] to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug
      (bosutinib) under a 3+3 dose escalation study design. The dose will be escalated by 1 dose
      level at a time; no skipping will be allowed.

      Dose escalation and MTD will be determined by the safety assessment committee comprising
      oncologist, hematologist, ALS Expert based on the incidence of DLT in 4 weeks of treatment
      among 3 subjects enrolled (6 subjects if additionaly enrolled) in each dose level. RP2D will
      be determined by the safety assessment committee upon completion of 12-week study treatment
      in all subjects in all dose levels.
