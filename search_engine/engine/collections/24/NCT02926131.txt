           done for routine SBR) BR-501 total bilirubin meter, the quantitative test for SBR
           currently used, will be kept in a controlled environment while the new bilirubin test
           (Bilistick system) will be exposed to tropical conditions.

        2. Trained nurses will use the Bilistick system observed by a qualified laboratory
           technician; Usability of the Bilistick system by the trained nurses will be evaluated
