    
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common and treatment options at present are limited.
      Recurrence of HCV infection after liver transplantation is inevitable and disease progression
      is rapid when compared with disease in the non-transplanted liver.

      Studies of ITX 5061 in vitro have shown it to be a potent inhibitor of HCV entry into
      hepatocytes, through blocking the interaction of the virus with scavenger receptor BI
      suggesting it may reduce graft re-infection rates after liver transplant.

      There are no studies of treatments to block host receptors for HCV and the investigators
      hypothesize that ITX 5061 will modulate HCV kinetics in the early phase post liver
      transplant.
