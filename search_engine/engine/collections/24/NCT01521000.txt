      in patients with pre-clinical lymphedema can halt the progression of lymphedema.

      Secondary Objectives:To evaluate whether bioimpedance is an accurate, reliable method to
      measure pre-clinical and clinical lymphedema.

      Tertiary Objective: To determine whether bioimpedance analysis is better than the gold
      standard of volume displacement to measure lymphedema.
