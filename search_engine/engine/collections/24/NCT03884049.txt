    
      Rationale:

      Transcatheter arterial embolization has recently been proposed as an efficacious therapy for
      therapy-resistant osteoarthritis of the knee, providing substantial pain reduction at
      short-term as well as long-term follow-up up till 4 years.

      A potential working mechanism of treatment effect is that the normalization of the amount of
      blood vessels and blood flow achieved by embolization reduces inflammation, resulting in pain
      reduction

      Objective:

      The main objective is to assess whether transcatheter arterial embolization of neovessels in
      patients with symptomatic knee OA results in significant pain reduction after 4 months
      compared to sham treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that novel transcatheter arterial embolization of neovessels is
      a feasible, effective, and safe treatment for patients with symptomatic radiographic knee OA,
      resulting in significant improvement of pain symptoms in a period of 4 months follow-up
      compared to sham embolization.

      Secondary objectives are

        1. to assess whether reduction of neovessels is related to pain relief,

        2. to explore whether decrease of inflammation is a mediating factor between neovessel
           reduction and pain relief,

        3. to assess whether transcatheter arterial embolization reduction of neovessels decreases
           peripheral and central pain sensitization and

        4. to assess whether transcatheter arterial embolization improve the outcome at 1, 4, 8 and
           12 months compared to placebo of the: ICOAP, painDETECT, EQ-5D-5L questionnaires and NRS
           for pain.
