      endocrine therapy for hormone receptor positive early-stage breast cancer. The planned sample
      size is 180 participants. The study includes a "window treatment" phase followed by a
      treatment phase. In the window phase, participants will be treated with a two-week course of
      tamoxifen (Arm A) or letrozole (Arm B). In the treatment phase participants will be
      randomized to receive endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib (Arm C) or endocrine
      therapy alone (Arm D) for a total duration of 24 weeks. Premenopausal patients with either
      invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma will be eligible to enroll directly into the treatment
      phase of the study. The study has two co-primary objectives: 1) To evaluate the difference in
      anti-proliferative activity of letrozole versus tamoxifen measured by changes in Ki67 from
      baseline to research biopsy (day 15) within cohorts of hormone receptor positive breast
      cancer for patients with invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma. 2) To evaluate the pathologic
      complete response (pCR) of endocrine therapy plus palbociclib and of endocrine therapy alone
      in breast cancer patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive invasive breast cancer.
