      hormones. Studies completed in adult patients have shown abnormal hormone levels in critical
      illness can contribute to how long patients stay in the intensive care unit, how severe their
      illness is and whether or not they survive. In children hormones are produced differently and
      have different functions. Depending on the particular illness in question hormonal
      dysfunction may have grave clinical consequences.

      Thus far, there have been few studies that have examined neuroendocrine dysfunction in
      children. The aim of our study is to identify the common hormone responses in children, and
      to identify any connection between hormone levels and outcomes (likelihood of child staying
      in the intensive care unit for multiple days, etc.).

      To explore these aims we will draw blood from all critically ill patients admitted to the
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and check various hormone levels. Only those patients
      who require blood samples as part of their admission will have blood tests for certain
      hormone levels. No change will be made from established standard of care for a patient's
      particular critical illness.

      The study is designed to examine hormone responses to critical illness and identify a
      connection between hormone levels and severity of illness. Based on these lab values we
      intend to lay a foundation for further studies that may more clearly explain the role of
      hormones in critically ill children, and possibly the introduction of hormone replacement in
      critical illness.
