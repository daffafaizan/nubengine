      for advanced prostate cancer. One of the most significant side effects of the use of androgen
      ablative therapies has been a decrease in bone mineral density, potentially placing patients
      at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. It is prudent to anticipate this adverse
      effect of therapy and to minimize its severity with appropriate and timely pharmacologic
      intervention. Zometa is a bisphosphonates and bisphosphonates are effective inhibitors of
      osteoclastic bone resorption. Recent studies have shown that other bisphosphonates were able
      to reduce the bone loss observed after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment with a GnRH analogue. An
      unanswered question remains, however, in how frequently these agents should be employed in
      clinical practice.

      This is a three-arm randomized trial of Zometa速 on bone mineral density in subjects with
      stage D prostate cancer undergoing androgen ablation therapy. If subjects are enrolled in Arm
      1, the GnRH analogue would be administered every 3 months for 1 year. Four milligrams of
      Zometa速 would be administered IV over 15 minutes 7 days prior to beginning androgen
      deprivation therapy. If subjects are enrolled in Arm 2, the GnRH analogue would be
      administered every 3 months for one year, and 4 mg of Zometa速 would be administered IV over
      15 minutes at month 6. If subjects are enrolled in Arm 3, the GnRH analogue is administered
      every 3 months for 1 year, with 4 mg of Zometa速 administered IV over 15 minutes monthly for 6
      months, beginning at month 6.
