      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the
      combination of AZD6244 (selumetinib) and cyclosporin A (cyclosporine) in adult patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in this patient
      population.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of the combination. III. To evaluate the selected
      biomarkers of drug effect in patients with advanced solid tumors or refractory metastatic
      colorectal cancer (CRC).

      IV. Evaluate the activity of the combination in terms of objective response rate (per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of selumetinib followed by a phase Ib
      study.

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day -7 of course 1 and then on
      days 1-28 (one dose on day 1 only). Patients also receive cyclosporine PO BID on day -3 of
      course 1 and then on days 1-28 (one dose on day 1 only). Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
