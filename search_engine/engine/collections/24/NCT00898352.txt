      node irradiation for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva in patients having
      positive groin nodes.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Surgery. Deep pelvic node dissection on sides containing
      positive nodes only. Arm II: Radiotherapy. Megavoltage (1 MeV or greater) to bilateral groin
      and pelvic nodes.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Anticipated annual accrual is approximately 200 patients, with an active
      phase estimated at 2.5-3 years. Protocol closed July 1984.
