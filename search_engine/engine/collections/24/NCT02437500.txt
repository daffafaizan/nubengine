      in Study SERES-004 and experienced a CDI recurrence within 8 weeks of receipt of study drug.
      In addition, SERES-005 has been amended to expand access to treatment with SER-109 to an
      intermediate-size patient population of adults 18 years of age or older with recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) (a serious disease), who would have qualified for the
      SERES-004 study.
