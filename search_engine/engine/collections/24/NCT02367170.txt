      intensity inspiratory muscle training and low intensity inspiratory muscle training group.
      This research study will last up to 28 days in 24 mechanically ventilated patients with CCI.
      The goal is to determine if the research participants can respond to a training program by
      improving weaning outcomes from the ventilator. This will be determined by measurement of
      breathing muscle strength with magnetic stimulation, measurement of diaphragm thickness with
      ultrasound, inspiratory muscle training, and blood and urine samples.
