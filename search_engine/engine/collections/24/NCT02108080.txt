      brain behavioral, structural, functional, and connectivity (structural and functional)
      information, on all NIAAA research participants, referred to hereinafter as Characterization
      Imaging Instruments (CII); a) to determine how individual differences in brain structure and
      evoked responses relate to generalized trait personality and behavior differences (as
      assessed by psychometric questionnaire instruments and behavioral measures); and b) to
      determine whether these individual differences relate specifically to genetic polymorphisms
      in genes governing neurotransmitter activity. Thus, our goal of the CII is to identify the
      brain structural, functional, behavioral, genetic, and other phenotypic factors that are
      associated with alcoholism.

      Study population: Non-treatment seeking adult volunteers and inpatient participants with
      alcohol dependence (ADs). Inpatient ADs refer to individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent
      through DSM-IV-RT criteria or at least Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder as determined by DSM-5.

      Design: This study will require one visit that will include an MRI scan (if the participant
      is determined to be eligible for the scanner) consisting of a whole brain structural MRI,
      Diffusion Tensor MRI, Resting State MRI (rsMRI) as well as several task-based functional
      MRIs, while performing computerized behavioral, motivational, and cognitive/emotional tasks.
      If the participant does not qualify for the MR scans, he/she will perform only the
      computerized behavioral, motivational, and cognitive/emotional tasks outside the scanner.
      These instruments include instruments in common with a similar protocol at NIDA.

      Outcome measures: The outcome measures are differences in behavioral responses using standard
      statistical methods, in brain structural data in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
      signal measured using standard techniques and analyzed using established image analysis
      approaches and software tools such as AFNI, SPM, FSL, DTI, Studio, etc. Secondary outcome
      measures are to compare the genetic, behavioral and phenotypic factors to imaging and
      behavioral data acquired across other protocols.
