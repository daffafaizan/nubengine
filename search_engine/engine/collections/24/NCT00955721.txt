      Sorafenib in the treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer. Since there are no data on the
      combination of these three agents, the investigators plan to evaluate the safety in a run-in
      phase I portion in order to define the recommended phase II dose (RPTD). The phase II trial
      will enroll 40 patients at the RPTD level within 2 years in order to provide a preliminary
      estimate of progression-free survival (primary endpoint of the trial) in the target
      population.
