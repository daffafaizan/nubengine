      and clinical findings of tonsillar exudate and hyperemia.

      10-20% of patients seen by their family physician, have acute tonsillitis due to streptococci
      group A. In Denmark, Centors criteria and the Streptococcal antigen test (Strep. A-test) are
      gold standard in the diagnostic process of streptococcal acute tonsillitis. Although the
      sensitivity and specificity of the Strep. A-test is biochemically high, its clinical
      reliability is reduced due to several influential factors. Moreover, studies suggest that
      4-10% of patients are tested false-negative based on clinical criteria and the Strep A-test.

      Fusobacterium necrophorum are suspected to be the cause of acute tonsillitis in teenagers and
      young adults (5-15%). However, there is no rapid test available for this bacterium. Since
      tonsillar surface swab is not included in the diagnostic standard, family physicians get no
      information about infection due to Fusobacterium necrophorum or other pathogens.

      C-reactive protein, leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count as diagnostic markers are
      examined with variable results. Procalcitonin is a relatively new marker of bacterial
      infection, which has the advantage of more rapid and specific induction compared to the other
      markers.
