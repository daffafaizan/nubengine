      stroke outcome as well as stroke-related comorbidities. Yet, clinical trials describing the
      extent and time course of microbiome changes after stroke are currently not available.
      Moreover, the impact of post-stroke dysbiosis on metabolic changes and the systemic immunity
      are unexplored.

      Therefore, the primary objective of this trial is the characterization of gut dysbiosis
      progression in ischemic stroke patients during a 3 month follow-up period .

      The secondary objectives include the identification of dysregulated gut microbiome
      metabolites and key immune cell populations in addition to the clinical progression of the
      study participants during the 3 month follow-up period after disease onset.

      In order to elucidate the differential impact of lesion size on immune and microbiome
      homeostasis, separate patient cohorts with mild and severe stroke will be studied.

      Furthermore, to control for the effects of temporary focal neurological deficits and stress
      induced microbiome and immune changes, patients with stroke mimics and transient ischemic
      attacks (TIA) are being recruited to the control group.
