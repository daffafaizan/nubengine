      including parental demographics and altruism score, in families with healthy children
      attending two pediatric practices.

      Also, in the cohort of families with baseline vaccine hesitancy, to assess the effectiveness
      of a pilot educational intervention focusing on the development of herd immunity for
      pediatric oncology patients by measuring:

        1. The change in vaccine hesitancy scores pre- and post-intervention.

        2. The rate of influenza vaccine uptake compared to historic controls from previous
           influenza seasons.

      Another aim is to explore the relationship between baseline influenza vaccine hesitancy rates
      and baseline altruism scores. Effectiveness of this intervention is dependent on parental
      altruism levels; therefore, the study team also seeks to determine if there is an association
      between parental altruism and vaccine hesitancy for their children.

      This is a single-arm prospective cohort study. The study will enroll legal guardians of
      children who are influenza vaccine-eligible to measure their vaccine hesitancy scores,
      altruism scores, and the impact of an educational intervention focused on herd immunity on
      the guardians' vaccine hesitancy score.
