      for atrial fibrillation. The electronic patient records of FinCV-study patients are reviewed
      to collect data on anticoagulation, number of cardioversions as well as mortality and stroke
      data. We seek to explore the possible association between the frequency of AF paroxysms in
      low stroke risk patients and the occurrence of death, stroke and major bleed as well as the
      net clinical benefit of anticoagulation. Data collection is performed by reviewing electronic
      patient records.
