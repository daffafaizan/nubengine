    
      Venous thromboembolic disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thrombolytic
      therapy has been shown to be a successful treatment modality, however its use is somewhat
      limited due to the known risk of hemorrhage (overall 22%, with up to 3% intracranial
      hemorrhage), and suggested risk of distal embolization where large mobile thrombi are
      encountered. In patients where either thrombolysis is contraindicated or unsuccessful and
      conventional therapies inadequate, bulk thrombectomy may be considered. Until recently this
      was primarily achieved with surgical thrombectomy; however the Angiovac device is posited to
      offer a minimally invasive alternative.

      This registry will collect data on patients in whom the Angiovac device was placed into the
      body for management of inferior vena cava (IVC) clots, right atrial (RA) masses or pulmonary
      emboli (PE) will be included.

      This registry is to capture high quality patient safety and effectiveness data on use of the
      Angiovac device for 3 separate, but overlapping conditions; a) Iliofemoral and Caval DVT, b)
      Right heart masses, and c) PE. The goal will be achieved by capturing a concise set of
      immediate and short-term functional and clinical outcome data for all patients who have the
      angiovac catheter deployed into the vascular system.

      Any center performing Angiovac procedure and wishing to contribute patient data will be
      offered participation in the registry. These core sites will be required to submit the
      registry protocol for Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. Once documentation of IRB
      approval has been received, centers may transmit their data via secure REDCap (Research
      Electronic Data Capture) database in accordance with federal regulations in the Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA
