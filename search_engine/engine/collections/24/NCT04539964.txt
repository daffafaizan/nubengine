      sham-controlled, multicenter pivotal study enrolling 250 subjects at 40 study centers across
      the U.S. The study will assess the safety and efficacy of the SetPoint System (study device)
      for the treatment of adult patients with active, moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to biologic or targeted synthetic
      Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs). The study device contains a miniaturized
      stimulator (implant) that is surgically implanted inside the left side of the neck on the
      vagus nerve (implant procedure). The implant delivers a small amount of electricity
      (stimulation) to the nerve. All eligible subjects will undergo the surgery under general
      anesthesia. Half of the subjects will receive therapeutic stimulation (the active treatment
      group) and the other half will receive non-therapeutic sham stimulation (the sham control).
      Stimulation will be delivered for 1 min once per day for 12 weeks. Subjects will return for
      six follow-up visits. All subjects completing Week 12 will be offered participation in a
      long-term, open-label extension study. All subjects not achieving ACR20 improvement at Week
      12 will be eligible for rescue therapy.
