      proposed project is a significant extension of the growing literature on Internet
      interventions to reduce problem drinking, which established their feasibility and
      acceptability, with evidence of efficacy especially in the university drinking setting. Most
      brief online interventions for problem drinking have incorporated self-assessment and
      tailored normative feedback, and some offer cognitive behavioral exercises. Only one
      web-based intervention to date targeted AEP risk. In that study, a static Internet
      presentation of AEP risk reduction intervention materials was compared to the same
      intervention delivered by mail in a quasi-experimental design. The web delivered and mailed
      versions of this self-guided change intervention significantly reduced AEP risk. The proposed
      intervention will build on this study as well as existing alcohol Internet intervention
      findings and extend the focus to a new population with a new goal (AEP prevention) by
      targeting both drinking AND ineffective contraception. It will also incorporate significant
      enhancements compared to the static web-based self-guided change intervention for AEP by
      adding dynamic, interactive, and feedback elements that mirror the interaction in successful
      face-to-face interventions.
