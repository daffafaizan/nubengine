      in animal models. In this context apoptosis has specifically been observed in sinusoidal
      endothelial cells and hepatocytes, and this has also been associated with an increase in
      activated caspase-3 in liver tissue extracts. The use of caspase inhibitors to prevent
      apoptosis during liver storage and transplantation may reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury and
      hence improve graft function after transplantation. Suppression of apoptosis by caspase
      inhibitors may also allow for longer ischemic times allowing organs to be transported greater
      distances. In addition, suppression of apoptosis may lower the risk involved in using
      suboptimal donor organs.
