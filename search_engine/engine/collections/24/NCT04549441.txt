        2. The process of the experiment A. Include participants into this study, they will be
           randomized into general anesthesia or WALANT group B. The maximum (toxic) dose of
           lidocaine was 7 mg/kg. Make distal radius fracture for an example, the solution used in
           the WALANT technique consisted of 20 ml of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:50,000, which
           were mixed with normal saline to give a total of 40 ml. A set of baseline parameters,
           including pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory
           rate, and oxygen saturation, was obtained during the entire surgery. At the same time,
           preoperative intravenous antibiotics with 1 g cefazolin were given for each patient as
           prophylaxis. The amount of blood loss was based upon the amount in a suction container
           in the operation room. In addition, the investigators will measure the participant's
           intraoperative subjective satisfaction and pain assessment.

      C. After surgery, the participant needs to stay in the in-patient department for one day. The
      investigators will provide routine prophylactic antibiotics and oral pain pillar.
      Postoperative pain, sensory, and motor function assessment.
