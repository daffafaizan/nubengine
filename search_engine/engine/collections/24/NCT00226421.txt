      oxymorphone extended release (ER)and enter an open-label treatment phase.During the
      Open-Label Titration Period (up to 28 days), patients will receive daily oxymorphone ER PO
      q12h. Patients stabilized on a dose that provides adequate pain relief will be randomized to
      either continue on the stabilized dose of oxymorphone ER or receive placebo in a double-blind
      fashion for a total duration of 12 weeks.
