      using an "opt-out" approach at the emergency room of the CHUM and to determine the rate of
      new positive HIV and HCV cases. A sub-analysis will focus more specifically on HCV in the
      Quebec equivalent of "baby boomers" (1945-1975) since this is the group that was targeted in
      the United States. The second phase of this study will evaluate the effectiveness of the
      linkage to the healthcare system for people diagnosed with HIV or HCV and how fast these
      people are taken care of and put on treatment.
