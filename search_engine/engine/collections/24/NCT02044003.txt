    
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of delivery and placement of the
      Innovasc Tack Intravascular Staple System on vascular flaps in the SFA, created by
      percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty

      Safety will be evaluated as the 30-day (or hospital discharge date, whichever is longer) rate
      of major adverse events defined as the composite endpoint of death, device embolization, the
      occurrence of surgery related to the device, device related occlusion of the artery, or major
      unplanned amputation of the ipsilateral lower extremity.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using the Innovasc Tack
      Intravascular Staple System to permanently secure vascular flaps.

      Secondary Evaluation of Feasibility (technical success) of the Innovasc Tack Intravascular
      Staple System (procedure and device) will be evaluated acutely by the following:

        -  Feasibility is defined as the ability to accurately place the Plaque Tacks and resolve
           post-PTA dissection flaps prior to the conclusion of the procedure, as demonstrated by
           angiography

        -  Acute technical success: Acute luminal patency during the revascularization procedure
           using standard angiography which demonstrates that the lumen of the artery at the
           location of tack implant remains patent at the conclusion of the procedure.

      The additional objectives of the study are to assess additional parameters as follows:

        -  Long term success will be assessed at one (1) month and three (3) months by evaluation
           of post-implant stability of the Plaque Tack relative to vascular or external landmarks
           at 30 days and 3 months via standard x-ray.

        -  Patency at 30 days and 3 months via duplex scanning or angiography, whichever deemed
           most appropriate for follow up of each individual patient by the principal investigator.
