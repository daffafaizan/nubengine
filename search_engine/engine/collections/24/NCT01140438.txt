      the onset of diabetes takes place approximately after 30 years of age, where there is
      presence of beta-cell directed antibodies (mostly anti-GAD) and where there is no clinical
      need for insulin treatment during the first 6 months after the diagnosis of diabetes.

      The aetiology and treatment of LADA patients is much less elucidated than is the case for
      type 1 diabetes (DM1) and type 2 diabetes (DM2). LADA constitutes about 10 % of the total
      diabetic population in many countries. LADA is therefore more common than insulin-requiring
      DM1.

      LADA patients lose beta-cell function faster than patients with DM2. Residual beta-cell
      function in DM1 is coupled to better metabolic control with lesser degree of hyperglycemia,
      lesser frequency of hypoglycaemic events and lesser diabetic complications.

      To retain beta-cell function in LADA patients is thus highly desirable.

      There are several strategies to retain beta cell function. One therapeutic strategy is to
      induce some degree of "beta cell rest" by treatment with exogenous insulin. Several
      observations indicate that such a strategy can have beneficial effects.

      This is a Scandinavian multicenter non-blinded clinical trial with 78 participants with newly
      diagnosed LADA. Participants will be randomized to either insulin- or per oral antidiabetic
      treatment. Participants will be followed up for 2 years after inclusion. Beta cell function
      and glycemic control will be monitored.
