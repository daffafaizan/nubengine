      thickness are two main issues for early glaucoma detection. A recently developed imaging
      device, the Cirrus HD OCT, offers more detailed informations about retina architecture
      including optic nerve head. To calculate the RNFL thickness, the software of the Cirrus HD
      OCT supposes an ideal optic nerve head. However, in the cases with not ideal optic disc
      configuration, the measurement of the RNFL thickness is not correct. Because the measurement
      of the RNFL thickness is extremely sensitive to the position of measurement, patients with
      the tilted disc are in danger of misdiagnosis. In the present study, we want to correct the
      RNFL thickness measurement according to the optic nerve head configuration using the Cirrus
      HD OCT. If the corrected RNFL thickness is more sensitive to detect the localized RNFL
      defect, the present software should be upgrade to reflect the optic nerve head configuration.
