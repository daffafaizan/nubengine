    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study to determine the composite response rate
      of BXCL701 administered orally and daily, combined with PEMBRO, in patients with mCRPC with
      either SCNC or adenocarcinoma phenotype. The study will also assess other efficacy
      parameters, such as rPFS, PSA PFS, OS and DOR, as well as the safety of the combined
      treatment. The study will consist of 2 stages:

        1. Lead-in Stage - in which the safety and tolerability of the combination of BXCL701
           administered once daily (QD) on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle plus PEMBRO 200 mg
           administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of every 21 days will be assessed and confirmed
           in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In Cohort 1,
           the initial dose level of BXCL701 will be 0.4 mg; if there are no safety concerns, this
           will be escalated to a total daily dose of 0.6 mg.

        2. Efficacy Stage (Simon 2-Stage) - in which patients will be treated with BXCL701 combined
           with PEMBRO. Patients will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on phenotype.

             -  Cohort A: Patients with any Small Cell/Neuroendocrine features, either de novo or
                treatment-emergent included mixed SCNC.

             -  Cohort B: Cohort B: Patients with adenocarcinoma and no evidence of small cell or
                neuroendocrine features.

      Lead-in Stage:

      Patients will be observed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1. Three patients
      will be treated initially with 0.4 mg BXCL701 plus PEMBRO:

        -  If there are no DLTs in Cycle 1, the dose of BXCL701 will be escalated to a total daily
           dose of 0.6 mg in the next cohort of 3 patients.

        -  If â‰¥1 of the 3 original patients has a DLT in Cycle 1, after a discussion between the
           sponsor and the investigator, either 3 patients (if 1 patient experiences a DLT) or 6 to
           9 patients (if 2 or 3 patients experiences a DLT) will be added at the 0.4 mg BXCL701
           dose level. For this expanded 0.4 mg cohort:

             -  If less than one-third of the patients experience a DLT, consideration will be
                given to dose escalation to 0.6 mg BXCL701 plus PEMBRO

             -  If one-third of the patients experience a DLT, the Efficacy Stage can commence

             -  If more than one-third of the patients experience a DLT, a discussion will be held
                between the investigators and sponsors as to how to proceed.

      Efficacy Stage:

      After assessment of the safety and confirmation of the BXCL701/PEMBRO dose schedule (i.e.,
      either 0.6 mg, 0.4mg, or an intermediate total daily dose of BXCL701) to be used in the
      subsequent stage, the Efficacy Stage will begin. Eligible patients will receive BXCL701 QD on
      Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle plus PEMBRO 200 mg administered IV on Day 1 every 21 days.
