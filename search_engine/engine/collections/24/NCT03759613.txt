    
      Thirty individuals with lower extremity burn injury and sixty healthy subjects will be
      included in this study. Participants with burn injury will be included if they are aged of
      18-50, able to walk independently at least 10 meters. Healthy subjects will be included if
      there are no orthopedic, neurological or musculoskeletal disorders that affect gait.

        1. Group: 30 Patients with burn injury

        2. Group: 30 healthy subjects (When evaluating the gait analysis, their arm will not be
           restricted (Their natural walking)

        3. Group : 30 healthy subject (When evaluating the gait analysis, their arm will be
           restricted )

      Participants will evaluate with the following assessment tools: Demographic data; age,
      gender, height, body mass index; burn characteristics; type of burn injury, degree of burn
      injury, localization of burn injury and total burn surface area will be recorded.

      All subjects' gait analysis will be conducted via GAITRite (computerized) system.

      GAITRite system for gait parameters (step length, stride length, base support, step time,
      cycle time, cadence, velocity, single support, double support, swing ( % of gait cycle) and
      stance (% of gait cycle), Tampa Kinesiophobia scale for kinesiophobia level, visual analog
      scale for pain, a scale that developed by us for arm swing will be used.

      These evaluations will be applied one time for participants. These evaluations will be made
      within 5 days following burn injury.
