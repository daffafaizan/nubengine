      spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)?

      Specific aims:

        1. Create a genomic DNA and plasma biobank for individuals diagnosed with SCAD.

        2. Identify inherited and de novo/new mutations that underlie SCAD.

        3. Identify common genetic variants that confer risk for SCAD.

      Long term objective:Discover molecular and cellular mechanisms of SCAD and develop biomarkers
      to enable prediction and prevention.

      The purpose of the research is to identify mutations (defects in the genetic blueprint) that
      cause tears in blood vessels that supply the heart. Some mutations may be inherited (passed
      on) from a parent without an apparent blood vessel problem while others may develop for the
      first time in the affected person. The study includes individuals diagnosed with spontaneous
      coronary artery dissection, their biological parents, and relatives with fibromuscular
      dysplasia, arterial aneurysm, or arterial dissection.

      Adults with SCAD will be identified both retrospectively and prospectively.Confirmation of
      the diagnosis by review of coronary angiography will be required before proceeding with the
      informed consent process and blood or saliva sample procurement.
