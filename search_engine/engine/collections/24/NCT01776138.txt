      high-risk invasive bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with or without preoperative
      chemotherapy.

      Secondary objectives will include an exploration of the association between functional
      status, surgical complications, and laboratory markers with complications and survival. In
      addition, exploratory analyses may evaluate the association of expression of the senescence
      marker p16INK4a and the morbidity and mortality associated with treatment.

      Patients will be asked to complete a Geriatric Assessment (GA) and FACT-Bl serially over the
      course of the study in order to evaluate their functional status and quality of life during
      the course of treatment. Additionally, complications will be tracked in an inpatient and
      outpatient setting using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) complications
      grading system.
