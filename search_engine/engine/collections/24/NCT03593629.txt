      testing every three months is costly for both clinics and participants. The investigators
      propose using HIV self-testing to replace quarterly clinic-based HIV testing for participants
      on PrEP, eliminating half of clinic visits and saving staffing and participant costs. The
      investigators want to understand the effect that reduced clinic contact frequency (resulting
      from HIV self-testing) has on PrEP adherence or completion of HIV-1 testing, overall and in
      subgroups.

      The investigators will enroll roughly 495 eligible individuals on PrEP: 165 men and 165 women
      in HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and 165 women at risk of HIV-1 infection (priority
      populations for PrEP delivery in Kenya and more generally in Africa).

      In this study, participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to either six-monthly
      clinic visits or quarterly clinic visits. Participants randomized to six-monthly clinic
      visits will receive a 6-month supply of PrEP and either two blood-based HIV self-tests
      (blood-based HIV self-testing arm) or two oral fluid HIV self-tests (oral fluid HIV
      self-testing arm). Participants randomized to quarterly clinic visits will receive a 3-month
      supply of PrEP and get tested for HIV by a healthcare professional at the clinic (standard of
      care arm)

      Study outcomes, measured at Months 6 and 12, include PrEP adherence (defined as the detection
      of PrEP in dried blood spots as well as persistence in refilling PrEP), HIV-1 testing, and
      safety (including side effects and social harm).
