      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dinaciclib given in combination with
      epirubicin in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the predictive value of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein (MCL-1), low
      molecular weight cyclin E (LMW-E), and tumor grade as predictors of biologic response (i.e.
      induction of apoptosis) in tumors treated with therapy.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy. III. To determine the effects of therapy
      on proliferation as measured by proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki67) and apoptosis as
      measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay
      (TUNEL).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dinaciclib.

      Patients receive dinaciclib intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and epirubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
