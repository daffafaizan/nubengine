    
      Design:

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) with aluminum hydroxide
      suspension (alum) as adjuvant in a three-injection regimen. The hypotheses are that the
      vaccine will be safe and tolerable and will induce detectable immune responses. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine at three
      doses administered with alum. Secondary objectives are to evaluate humoral and cellular
      immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine regimens.

      Study Products:

      VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) was developed by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC),
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The soluble HIV-1 envelope
      product consists of an HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer variant, derived from clade A, strain
      BG505, with stabilizing mutations and engineered disulfide bonds, specifically recognized by
      broadly neutralizing antibodies and resists gp120 conformational change caused by CD4
      binding. Injections will be administered intramuscularly (IM) and subcutaneously (SC) in a 1
      mL volume by needle and syringe. The product is provided at a 500 mcg/mL concentration in 3
      mL glass vials filled to 1.2 +/- 0.10 mL. Adjuvant is an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum)
      provided in a sterile, pyrogen-free suspension at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 3 mL glass
      vials filled to 0.7 +/- 0.10 mL.

      Subjects:

      Healthy adults ages 18 to 50.

      Study Plan:

      Subjects will receive VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP at doses of 100 mcg or 500 mcg, both with 500mcg
      alum field mixed, administered via IM or SC injections. A dose escalation evaluation will
      occur to ensure the safety data support proceeding to the higher dose. Subjects will be
      evaluated for safety and immune responses through blood collection at specified timepoints
      throughout the study. The study schema is below:

      --------------------

      Group 1: Subjects = 3; Route = IM; Dose (mcg) = 100; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Group 2: Subjects = 3; Route = SC; Dose (mcg) = 100; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Group 3: Subjects = 5; Route = IM; Dose (mcg) = 500; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Group 4: Subjects = 5; Route = SC; Dose (mcg) = 500; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Total = *16 Subjects

      **500 mcg of alum will be field mixed with Trimer 4571 for all groups

      *Up to 25 subjects may be enrolled if needed to evaluate safety or immunogenicity.

      Duration:

      Subjects will be followed for 40 weeks.
