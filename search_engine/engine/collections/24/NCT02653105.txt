      alteration. Two genes are being studied: BRCA1 and BRCA2.

      The national program for breast cancer screening target women 50 to 74 years but does not
      include women with significant risk factors. However in identifiable risk situations, breast
      cancer incidence is increased: and it affects 1 in 4 women with certain risk histological
      lesions and more than 1 in 2 women carrying a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.

      Studies have shown that the olfactom√©dine 4 (OLFM4) is highly overexpressed in tumors
      compared to healthy tissue. The OLFM4 might therefore be a marker for early detection of
      breast cancer. We wish to determine the positive predictive value of OLFM4 seric dosing of
      patients at risk with respect to imaging.
