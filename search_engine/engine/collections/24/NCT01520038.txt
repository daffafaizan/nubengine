      the United States. The primary objective of the feasibility/Phase I portion of the study is
      to establish the feasibility and safety of proton and the safety of IMRT. Safety will be
      based on acute toxicity. The primary objective of the phase II study is to generate estimates
      of the local failure rate for intermediate and high risk patients treated with either proton
      therapy or IMRT. The study, however, is not explicitly designed to compare outcomes of proton
      therapy and IMRT. Secondary objectives include further evaluation of acute and late toxicity,
      quality of life and estimation of overall survival.
