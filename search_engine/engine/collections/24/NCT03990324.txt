      of two groups: stretching group (n = 30), or control group (n = 30). The stretching group
      received a standardized manual stretching protocol. The control group did not received
      intervention. Pre and Post-test measurements were recorded for both groups. Within group
      differences and group by time interactions were evaluated for Cervical range of motion ROM
      and myofascial sensitivity. The immediate improvement in active ROM of the cervical spine may
      prompt clinicians to consider the sequencing of treatment. Stretching prior to active
      exercises may allow for active exercise through a larger ROM. Future research is needed to
      evaluate the immediate effects of stretching in the symptomatic population.
