      cause of preventable death in developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly
      increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. As
      the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and
      effective preventive measures are not implemented. Despite the availability of
      antihypertensive agents, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one third
      of patients continue to maintain control successfully.

      Treatment algorithms for essential hypertension commonly include thiazides or thiazide-like
      diuretics, either alone or as part of combination treatment. Chlorthalidone is a commercially
      available, orally administered thiazide-type diuretic agent.

      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker developed by Takeda to
      treat participants with essential hypertension.

      This study will compare the safety and tolerability of azilsartan medoxomil plus
      chlorthalidone (TAK-491CLD) fixed-dose combination to olmesartan medoxomil plus
      hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination.
