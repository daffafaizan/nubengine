      One MRI scan will be with bladder full, the other will be with bladder empty. During
      treatment: patients will have two or three MRI scans per week at their convenience. MRI scans
      will be scheduled close to radiotherapy treatment times to minimise inconvenience for the
      patient. On the same day they have an MRI scan, they will also have a CBCT at the time of
      treatment. None of the images will be used to alter or influence the treatment the patient is
      receiving. If the patient feels that the imaging schedule is too inconvenient, they will be
      given the option to reduce the frequency of the scanning or to withdraw from the study.All
      the images will be loaded onto a password secure server. The MRI scans will be fused to the
      planning CT scan using bone-to-bone matching. Tumour and intra-pelvic organs will be
      contoured on the MRI scans. The contours will be used to create surface meshes of each organ
      and with research software, we will be able to model the motion and deformation of these
      organs over the course of radiotherapy. Using this data, we will be able to simulate the dose
      impact of the organ motion on different intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans. We will also
      explore the impact of bladder & rectal filling on tumour motion.
