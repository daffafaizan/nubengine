      nifurtimox after a single oral dose (120 mg) administered under 3 types of fed conditions
      (low fat, dairy products, and high calorie and high fat), as well as fasted conditions, to
      assess relative bioavailability. It was chosen to allow a direct inter-study comparison of PK
      data obtained in previous studies.

      A secondary objective of the study was to assess the relative bioavailability of 2 different
      dose levels of nifurtimox, given as a single oral dose, in a second group of patients.The
      second treatment group addressed a biopharmaceutical aspect for which no study data have been
      obtained to date. In order to assess the relationship between dose and exposure (linearity of
      PK), an analysis of the dose range of 120 mg to 240 mg was chosen to close the knowledge gap
      for this dose range.
