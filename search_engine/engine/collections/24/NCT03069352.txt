      cell responsible for fighting infections). Successful treatment of AML is dependent on what
      subtype of AML the patient has, and the age of the patient when diagnosed.

      Venetoclax is an experimental drug that kills cancer cells by blocking a protein (part of a
      cell) that allows cancer cells to stay alive. This study is designed to see if adding
      venetoclax to cytarabine works better than cytarabine on its own.

      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (treatment unknown to patients and doctors),
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study in patients with AML who are 18 or more years old and
      have not been treated before. Patients who take part in this study should not be suitable for
      intensive induction chemotherapy (usual starting treatment). Abbvie is funding this study
      which will take place at approximately 125 hospitals globally. In this study, 2/3 of patients
      will receive venetoclax every day with cytarabine and the remaining 1/3 will receive placebo
      (dummy) tablets with cytarabine.

      Participants will continue to have study visits and receive treatment for as long as they are
      having a clinical benefit. The effect of the treatment on AML will be checked by taking
      blood, bone marrow, scans, measuring side effects and by completing health questionnaires.
      Blood and bone marrow tests will be completed to see why some people respond better than
      others.
