      rate of 10-20%. Surgical resection with curative intent remains the most effective treatment
      for this disease. To improve the survival, a better treatment approach is in need to manage
      patients with oesophageal cancer. Unfortunately, the use of preoperative adjuvant
      chemotherapy or adjuvant radiotherapy does not confer any survival benefit to patients with
      localized oesophageal cancer as proven in most randomized studies. However, the combination
      of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has greater clinical efficacy in achieving complete
      pathological regression of the tumour as well as the response rate as shown in our
      preliminary results. In fact, treatment of squamous oesophageal cancer by primary
      chemo-irradiation without surgery is now feasible.

      We propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and the
      patients' survival by comparing primary chemo-irradiation without surgery versus standard
      surgical resection as the treatment for squamous oesophageal cancer. Those patients with
      residual cancer after primary chemo-irradiation will have salvage oesophagectomy to control
      the disease. Over a 3-year period, a total of 80 patients will be recruited from 4 different
      hospitals with 100 patients being randomized into each treatment arm. Treatment outcomes will
      be compared on an intention-to-treat analysis basis.
