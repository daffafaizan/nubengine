      in this study. Subjects that are to be treated clinically with coronary artery stenting will
      be randomized to receive a loading dose of clopidogrel versus ticagrelor after diagnostic
      angiography but prior to stenting. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed after
      stenting and the presence of blood clots inside the new stent will be measured and compared
      between the groups
