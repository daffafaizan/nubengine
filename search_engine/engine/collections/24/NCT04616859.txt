      people. Energy drinks (ED) are usually combined with alcohol with the intention of
      counteracting its effects. However, most studies have not shown a reduction in drunkenness
      and consumption is related with engagement of risk-taking behaviours like driving under
      alcohol effects. It is already known that alcohol concentrations and effects are higher in
      women than in men even after adjusting dose by weight.

      The relevance of gender in the acute effects of alcohol associated with ED consumed in a
      binge-drinking pattern has been poorly studied. A randomized clinical trial will be conducted
      in healthy volunteers (1:1) and four treatment conditions will be administered: alcohol+ED,
      alcohol+placebo of ED, placebo of alcohol+ED and placebo of alcohol+placebo of ED. Subjective
      and physiological effects, driving related skills, and alcohol and caffeine concentrations
      will be measured along an 8-hours period. A pilot study has been conducted with the first 6
      volunteers to select the alcohol doses. In the definitive study 70 g of alcohol in men and 55
      g in women will be used.
