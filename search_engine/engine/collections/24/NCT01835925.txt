      adenocarcinomas with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation can be targeted with
      an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor achieve striking and durable responses and improved
      survival. Another example is the identification of the echinoderm microtubule-associated
      protein-like 4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions which have led to significant
      therapeutic gains in the small percentage of patients with lung adenocarcinoma whose cancers
      exhibit this mutation. Specific mutations have been found in colon cancer and specific drugs
      targeting these gene alterations are in development. As future therapeutic protocols specific
      for these mutations are developed, patients who agree may be notified of their eligibility
      for these studies.

      The aims of this study are to link mutational analyses with clinical outcome. It is
      recommended that patients receive 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 (modified FOLFOX) and 50.4 Gy
      radiation with concurrent fluoropyrimidine.
