      Prieto", SLP, Mexico.

      The simple size for pilot study was been calculated in 20 patients, according with Browne for
      not knowing the variability of the treatment. 10 patients in the group of Polypropylene mesh
      (Prolene ®), braided monofilament thread, macropore, weight of 108.1 g/m2, fibres diameter of
      0.53 mm, tensile force of 156.6 N/cm, with a pore of 1.6 mm2, in different size of 15 x 15
      cm, 20 x 20 cm and 30 x 30 cm, and 10 patients in the group of mesh of PEBD (mosquito net),
      braided monofilament thread, macropore, ,weight of 53.7 g/m2, fibers diameter of 0.48 mm,
      tensile force of 42.7 N/cm and pore of 1.8 mm2, in different size 15 x 15 cm, 20 x 20 cm and
      30x 30 cm donated by Dr. Ravindranath R. Tongaonkar. The sterilization were done in ethylene
      oxide.

      The randomisation for allocation the type of mesh for each patient was realized with numbers
      generated by computer with the program R version 3.0.2 with the simple function.

      The statistical analysis was carried out by the programs: JMP 8 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
      NC, USA) and R 2.15.1 23.

      The ventral hernia repair were carried out with standardized technique, placed the mesh int
      the preperitoneal or retromuscular space fixing with 2-0 poplypropylene suture and le fe
      active-close drainage, 30 minutes before the incision, prophylactic antibiotic 1gm of
      cefalotin was administered, in both groups, the patient was discharge at the first
      postoperatory day with drainage and retired at the first review at 1 week and recited at one,
      three, six and twelve months for reviewer.

      The descriptive analysis of categorical variables was expressed with frequencies and
      percentages; the numerical ones with normal distribution in averages and standard deviation,
      the variables with distribution not normal with medians and status (maximum and minimal
      values). The values of p<0.05 were considered to be significant.

      This study was evaluated and accepted by the Committee of Investigation and the Committee of
      Ethics, with number of record 42-17.
