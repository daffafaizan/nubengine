      atherosclerotic disease. This study aimed to investigate whether elevated serum sST2 level is
      related to coronary plaque components detected on coronary computed tomography angiography
      (CCTA) and plaque vulnerability in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients.
      167 lesions in 120 non-ST elevation ACS patients were prospectively enrolled and evaluated by
      CCTA in this study. Blood were taken from antecubital vein during patient's hospitalization
      for angiography. Serum sST2 level was measured by commerical ELISA kits (Presage ST2 Assay
      Kit, Critical Diagnostics). CCTA were performed using a 320-slice CT scanner (Aquilion ONE,
      Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). Coronary plaque components were analyzed cross each
      of the lesions using commercialized software package (QAngio CT, Medis, The Netherlands).
