    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the risk of graft rejection associated with the addition of fludarabine
      (fludarabine phosphate) to a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen for patients with
      malignant diseases treatable by allogeneic stem cell transplantation and compare this rate to
      that observed among patients previously treated without fludarabine.

      II. To estimate the rate of grade acute II/IV graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD
      in patients treated with low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine, peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) infusion and immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days - 4
      to -2 and undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. (Note: Patients who have had an autologous
      transplant within 90 days prior to day 0 will not receive fludarabine phosphate.)

      PBSC INFUSION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSC transplant on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      35 with a taper to day 56. Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27.

      POST TRANSPLANT DONOR LYMPHOCYTE INFUSION (DLI): Patients with stable mixed chimerism on day
      56, and without evidence of GVHD, undergo DLI IV over 30 minutes on day 65. Patients without
      a complete response, full donor chimerism, and GVHD after 2 months undergo further DLI at
      higher cell numbers. Up to 6 DLIs may be given 65 days apart.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months
      and then annually thereafter.
