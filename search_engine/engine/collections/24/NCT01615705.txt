      in about one third of patients after an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Affected
      patients have chronic leg pain and swelling, and sometimes develop skin ulcers. Poor
      understanding of the pathophysiology and predictors of PTS has hampered progress in its
      prevention and treatment. Biomarkers reflective of inflammation, genetic thrombophilia and
      coagulation activation may be of value in predicting PTS development in patients with DVT;
      they may also provide insight into understanding the underlying mechanisms of PTS, which
      could result in the development and testing of novel therapies to prevent and treat PTS.
