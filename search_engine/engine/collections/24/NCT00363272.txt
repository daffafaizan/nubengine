      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of ispinesib in
      pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.

      II. Define and describe the toxicities of ispinesib in these patients. III. Characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of ispinesib in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of ispinesib. II. Determine the relationship
      between CYP3A4 gene polymorphisms and pharmacokinetics in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ispinesib IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ispinesib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood and tumor sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and gene
      polymorphism correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.
