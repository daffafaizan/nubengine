    
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 2 study of pralatrexate with vitamin B12 and folic
      acid supplementation in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have failed
      prior treatment(s).

      The start of study treatment is defined as the initiation of pralatrexate administration.

      Pralatrexate will be administered as an intravenous (IV) push over 3-5 minutes on days 1 and
      15 (Â± 1 day at each time point) of a 4-week cycle (ie, every [q] 2 weeks). The initial dose
      of pralatrexate will be 190 mg/m2. Dose reduction to 150 mg/m2 with further reduction to 120
      mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 will be allowed for defined toxicity (see Section 7.3). If 100 mg/m2 is
      not tolerated, pralatrexate must be discontinued.

      Patients will receive vitamin supplementation consisting of vitamin B12, 1 mg intramuscular
      (IM) q 8-10 weeks and folic acid 1-1.25 mg by mouth (PO) once a day (QD). Patients must have
      received 1 mg vitamin B12 within 10 weeks prior to the initiation of pralatrexate and have
      received 7 days of 1-1.25 mg folic acid PO QD prior to the initiation of pralatrexate.

      Vitamin supplementation will continue throughout the study and for at least 30 days after the
      last administration of pralatrexate.
