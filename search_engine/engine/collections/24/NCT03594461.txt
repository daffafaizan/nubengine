      rate of functional blindness in many developed countries. Modalities to treat nvAMD have been
      based on monthly dosing. For many patients, this modality is adequate and they can achieve a
      dry macula. A subset of patients can even have their treatment intervals extended. There is,
      however, a subset of patients with recalcitrant neovascularization for whom IAI fails to
      produce a dry macula even with q4w dosing. An intense dosing schedule for a short period of
      time could decrease fluid activity in these patients.
