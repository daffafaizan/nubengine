      study such pressure changes are examined in a mechanical lung model and in a population of
      ICU patients on mechanical ventilation. A systematic recording of airway pressures, tidal
      volumes and blood gases are carried out during ordinary therapeutic procedures requested by
      the staff physician. No additional study interventions are carried out.

      The aim of the project is to examine negative effects of pressure/volume changes.
