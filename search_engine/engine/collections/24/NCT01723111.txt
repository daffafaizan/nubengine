      than HD patients. In addition, it was also known that the level of oxidative stress and
      inflammatory cytokines tended to be lower in PD patients than HD patients. And hepcidin
      synthesis is markedly increased during inflammation. Altogether, Lower ESA requirement in PD
      patients may be associated with lower hepcidin level due to lower inflammatory state compared
      with HD patients.
