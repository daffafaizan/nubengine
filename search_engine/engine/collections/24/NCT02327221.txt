    
      During double-blinded phase, the treatment consists of 2 intravenous (i.v.) administrations
      of antigen-specific autologous T regulatory cells or placebo:

        -  Group A: 1.10e4 cells and 1.10e4 cells

        -  Group B: 1.10e6 cells and 1.10e6 cells

        -  Group C: 1.10e7 cells and 1.10e7 cells

        -  Group D: Placebo and Placebo

      During double-blinded phase, two i.v. administrations of study drug (Ova-Treg) will be
      administered, one at week 0 and another one at week 8 for the group A, B and C. Two
      injections of Placebo will be administered, one at week 0 (V4) and another one at week 8 for
      the group D. During double-blinded phase, all the patients will be followed during 16 weeks.
      This will be followed by an additional period of 16 weeks when the patient is expected to
      receive two additional administrations of Ovasave at 10e6 cells dose (Open-label phase),
      except if refused by the patient or not recommended by the Investigator, representing the
      follow-up phase. These third and fourth administrations will be performed for all groups (A,
      B, C and D) with an injection of Ovasave at 1.10e6 cells administered at week 16 and week 24.
      A patient who didn't receive the 2 first administrations during the double-blinded phase
      cannot receive the third and the fourth administration during Open-label phase.
