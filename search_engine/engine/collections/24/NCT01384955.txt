      physiotherapy methods are recommended and popular in some countries (Spain, Germany, Poland),
      while in others bracing and observation are standard (North America, Australia, the UK,
      Scandinavia. Neither of the methods have been shown to be definitely effective. Considerable
      evidence indicates that bracing can lead to psychological stress, poorer body image and self
      - esteem and reduce overall quality of life in adulthood. As to physiotherapy and physical
      exercises, such evidence is limited, especially long term follow up studies are not
      available.
