      Amphinex will be given 4 days prior to the fixed dose of bleomycin administered by
      intravenous infusion. The illumination, with red light (laser 652 nm), to the tumour surface
      and a margin of 2-3 mm outside the tumour surface, will be performed after bleomycin
      administration.

      There will be no comparative procedure in this study. Dose escalation will proceed according
      to a modification of Simon's accelerated titration design. The number of patients recruited
      depends on the DLT experienced. A total of 6 patients will be included at each dose level if
      no more than 1 patient experiences DLT.

      Additional cohorts may be added pending the outcome of the previous cohorts and discussions
      between the investigators and the Sponsor. The primary goal of the study is to assess the
      safety and tolerance of the Amphinex and determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of
      Amphinex as a PCI therapy in combination with bleomycin treatment.
