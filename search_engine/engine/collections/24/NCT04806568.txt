      affecting up to 65 percent of patients with MS (PwMS). Cognitive changes can be the only
      behavioral index of MS activity. But how accurately and timely can these be captured? The
      existing clinical tools are subjective and do not have the dynamic of prognosis. It remains
      uncertain how much change in cognitive status is required to translate into a meaningful
      clinical outcome and how long it may subsequently take to become apparent. Moving towards a
      holistic approach, MS-NEUROPLAST aims to further expand previously-published prognostic
      marker candidates and previous work of the applicant and the members of the research team and
      employ a group of methodologies for interventions and applications which will quantify via
      real-world assessment the MS-related cognitive changes in order to characterize not only
      decline but given the right dosage of stimulation improvement as well.

      MS-NEUROPLAST has three main objectives:

      (i) Utilize state of-the-art neuroimaging and network science measures to more thoroughly
      understand neural indices of cognitive impairment in PwMS.

      (ii) Evaluate the efficacy for treating MS-associated cognitive deficits using a computerized
      cognitive training treatment by determining the differences, between subjects treated with
      cognitive training and controls, on network science measures indexing network efficiency or
      collapse and on the performance of a battery of neuropsychological tests that are frequently
      impaired in MS.

      (iii) Investigate the dissociation of the cortical mechanisms related to training-induced
      plasticity and maladaptive reorganization (namely separate good from bad), by taking into
      account the homeostatic capacity of the human organism as a whole and thus examining whether
      the correlation of the neurophysiological and cognitive indices with longitudinal digital
      biomarkers of daily functional status can capture the underlying pathology.
