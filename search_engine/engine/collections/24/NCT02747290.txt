      To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide BBN-RGD was synthesized from bombesin(7-14)
      and c(RGDyK) through a glutamate linker and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body
      PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD and
      diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-BBN-RGD PET/CT in patients with primary and/or metastasis
      prostate cancer.
