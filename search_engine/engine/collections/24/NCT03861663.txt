      medical care, in facilities such as the intensive care unit (ICU), US unit, and/or other
      departments. Subjects may or may not have a clinical indication for ultrasound scanning as
      part of their regular medical care and will be required to meet the inclusion criteria and
      none of the exclusion criteria. If a subject has a clinical indication for ultrasound exam,
      the routine exam will be performed with the standard equipment, and an additional exam will
      be performed using the investigational ultrasound device.
