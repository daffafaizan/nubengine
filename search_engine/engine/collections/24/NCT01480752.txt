    
      sixty qualified samples (initial estimate which will be come more accurate after the pilot
      study on 6 patients) will be divided randomly in three groups which all of them will have an
      inferior Alveolar injection and before the beginning of the treatment the primary group will
      receive an injection of 0.4 mL ( 0.2 mL in mesio buccal and 0.2 mL in disto buccal) of
      Lornoxicam and the second group will be injected with 0.4 mL of normal saline( 0.2 mL in
      mesio buccal and 0.2 mL in disto buccal) ,in third group we will only pretend the injection
      but actually there is no substance injected ,making the patient believe that there was an
      injection . Then the patients' pain will be evaluated with visual Analogue Scale analysis
      (VAS) 0-170 mm in time intervals of 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the treatment.
