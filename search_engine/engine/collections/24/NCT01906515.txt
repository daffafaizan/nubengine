      group (Control Group) or an intervention group (SpHb Group). The Control Group received
      typical anesthesia care including estimated blood loss (EBL) assessment and intraoperative
      hemoglobin measurements from the central laboratory (Hb). Blood samples were taken when EBL
      was ≥15% of total blood volume. RBC transfusion was initiated if Hb was ≤10 g/dL and
      continued until the EBL was replaced and Hb >10g/dL was confirmed. The SpHb Group followed
      the same transfusion practice as the Control Group except the anesthesiologist was guided by
      the addition of SpHb monitoring with blood samples still taken pre- and post-transfusion.
      Additionally, the absolute and trend accuracy of SpHb compared to Hb was evaluated. Potential
      cost savings from reduced RBC utilization will be calculated if occured.
