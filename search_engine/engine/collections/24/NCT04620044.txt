      and 7th grades of secondary school. However, due to the very large population, 3 secondary
      schools were selected. It was decided to select a sample from these three secondary
      schools.The children included in the sample were likely to be in different groups. Also, no
      intervention would be applied to children in the control group. There could be problems such
      as children labeling each other. To avoid these problems, the groups are divided into
      schools. The three schools where the research will be conducted were determined by lot
      method. The first school formed the Kaledo game group, the second school the nutrition
      education group, and the third school the control group. BMI was determined by making
      anthropometric measurements of the children attending these schools. These students were
      stratified according to their overweight and obese status and gender. According to the power
      analysis, the minimum sample size for the experimental and control groups was calculated as
      57 for each group. In this context, the sample size for each group was planned to consist of
      64 people, taking into account incomplete and incorrect data and absenteeism. In this study
      population, students up to the sample size (n = 64) determined (32 overweight students and 32
      obese students) by Power analysis for each school were determined by drawing of lots method.
      Later, the interventions defined in the groups were initiated.
