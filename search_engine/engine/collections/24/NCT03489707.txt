      home-based vs clinic-based DNA screening of anal canal exfoliated cells among Milwaukee HIV+
      and HIV- men who have sex with men and transpersons aged â‰¥25 years. At study entry, persons
      randomized to arm 1 will receive a home-based collection kit in the mail at 0 and 12 months
      and those in arm 2 will attend a clinic where a clinician will collect the exfoliated cell
      specimen at 0 and 12 months. Then, persons will receive HRA-directed biopsy to assess
      precancerous lesions by study arm. We hypothesize that a majority of persons will comply with
      annual screening with increased compliance among persons in the home-based arm vs
      clinic-based arm. The proposed research could indicate that annual HPV DNA screening and
      subsequent HRA are acceptable to MSM and transpersons; thus, we will determine how high-risk
      persons are identified for HRA in light of limited HRA resources. The duration of each
      participant's activities is expected to be 12 months. The study is expected have participant
      activity from 2019 to 2023.
