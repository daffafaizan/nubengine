      and are safe for sustained use. The Study of Oxytocin in ASD to improve Reciprocal Social
      Behaviors or (SOARS-B) will test a very promising potential treatment-intranasal oxytocin-for
      ASD's fundamental social communication deficits in a large, group of verbal and nonverbal
      children. SOARS-B will also provide information about the regulation of DNA methylation and
      transcription of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), as well as other genes relevant to
      oxytocin's CNS activity, as a function of time and in response to oxytocin treatment. These
      data will fill a key gap in our understanding of oxytocin's role in ASD and its ability to
      alter epigenetic modifications of the OXTR.
