      Our study design was a randomized single-blind controlled study of 6 weeks including
      inpatient ambulatory subacute and chronic stroke patients. Sample size was calculated by
      Raosoft, Inc. Clinically meaningful difference was considered 20% for all outcome measures.
      The original sample size was estimated 45 patients to detect a statistically significant
      difference between groups. Considering the drop-out, fifty-one patient were included. The
      patients were randomly assigned to one of three training group by a researcher (ARO) using
      the function of Microsoft Office Excel software.

      In this randomized-controlled study, eighty patients were assessed in terms of eligibility
      criteria, and 51 patients were included in the study. The patients were evaluated by two
      physiatrists in Istanbul Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Education and Research Hospital
      and referred to the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Unit of the same hospital. Enrollment
      period was between November 2014 and December 2015.

      Blinding:

      During the consent process, participants were advised that they would be randomized to one of
      three intervention groups. To minimize exposure between groups, the Robot-Assisted Gait
      Training and Conventional Training programs were administered in different sections of the
      rehabilitation center. The 2 trial physiotherapists could blinded to intervention group. All
      treatment schedules were planned by another researcher. All outcome assessments were
      conducted by a blinded assessor located offsite. Trial staff instructed participants to avoid
      mentioning anything about their intervention to the assessor. Patients were asked not to
      shear any information about treatment between each other.
