      response to stage IV human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer
      before and during treatment. This study will test a new method for monitoring treatment. The
      investigators will use [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at previously diagnosed stage IV breast cancer
      and image up to three times during therapy. FDG is a non-natural amino acid with a
      radioactive tag that is used clinically for staging of disease. However, the role of
      FDG-PET/MRI for imaging response in breast cancer is not currently clear. PET/MRI is a new
      imaging technique that combines PET and MRI into a single study.
