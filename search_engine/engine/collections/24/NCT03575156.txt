      potentially life-threatening auto-immune systemic diseases. There is an urgent need to
      describe prognostic factors and to discover new therapeutic pathways. Microparticles (MPs)
      are small extracellular vesicles formed from activated cells including endothelial cells and
      platelets. Preliminary data from our lab indicate that these MPs might play a key role in SLE
      and SSc physiopathology. In fact, MPs from patients with SLE aggregates with T regulator
      lymphocytes (LTregs) and decrease their activity, thereby promoting auto-immunity. Some works
      also indicate that MPs might cargo DNA to the immune system, also promoting auto-immunity.
      The investigators hypothesized that MPs levels might be a prognostic factor in SLE and SSc
      and that studying the molecular mechanisms involved could provide new therapeutic targets.

      Our study will recruit 100 patients with SLE or SSc followed in Bordeaux University Hospital.
      Among classical disease activity information, blood and urine samples will be collected at
      each visit to study circulating microparticles. Fundamental research will be realized on
      patients' sample to study molecular mechanisms involved.

      Clinical and biological disease activity, treatment and outcomes will be studied in
      correlation with MPs to describe their potential prognostic role. Patients will be followed
      at regular intervals as their usual follow-up would request. No extra visit will be needed
      and blood samples will be drawn at the same times as those drawn for clinical purposes.
