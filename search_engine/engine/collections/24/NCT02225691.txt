      consistently been demonstrated to confer benefits, and is considered an essential part in the
      management of diabetes. In China, utilization of SMBG among diabetes patients is low. Even
      among those who perform SMBG regularly, the daily testing frequency falls short of those
      recommended in international and national clinical guidelines. There is thus a need to create
      the awareness of the benefits of SMBG and at the same time establish a SMBG regimen that is
      deemed practically feasible and cost effective for diabetes patients.

      Paired testing entails the act of measuring glucose level before and after an event that may
      impact the glucose level in a patient, e.g. meals, exercise, medication adjustment, and
      thereafter responding to any abnormal glucose levels/patterns by modifying lifestyle and/or
      medication.

      This study aims is to evaluate the effect of introducing paired testing on actual testing
      frequency, glycemic control, psychosocial and behavioral aspects of poorly controlled
      diabetes patients in China.
