      morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Impaired cardiac function preoperatively
      predisposes patients to low cardiac output syndrome. Levosimendan acts by a different
      mechanism than traditional inotropes and its preoperative use could improve the outcome of
      patients with cardiac failure. Specifically, it promotes vasodilation of coronary, pulmonary
      and systemic vessels, has an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effect and enhances cardiac
      contractility by improving the response of the myofilaments to intracellular calcium.

      The aim of this retrospective study will be to investigate the effect of the preoperative
      administration of levosimendan on the outcome of patients with compromised cardiac function
      undergoing cardiac surgery.
