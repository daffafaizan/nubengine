      and adjuvant treatments with curative intent such as radiotherapy, hormone therapy,
      chemotherapy, immunotherapy, have reduced the incidence of breast cancer specific mortality.
      Despite this, breast cancer remains the main cause of cancer mortality in Europe. The primary
      cause is due to metastases development in different organs, such as lung, liver, bones and
      brain. A significant decrease in mortality in breast cancer patients is likely to be achieved
      by preventing the formation of metastases or by implementing the efficacy of their treatment.
      Radiotherapy is one of the pillars of breast cancer adjuvant treatments with important
      survival benefits.

      Mutual and dynamic communications between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME)
      influence the development and evolution of the tumor as well as the appearance of distant
      metastases. The mediators of the immune and inflammatory response that constitute TME, as
      well as mediators of tumor progression, are also considered "targets" of future therapeutic
      strategies.

      Radiation applied to the preserved breast during radiotherapy treatment activates numerous
      molecular cascades in tumor bed adjacent cells causing an inflammatory state. During this
      process, pre-clinical studies demonstrated CD11b + and CD11b+cKit+cells mobilization in the
      blood. These cells are involved in numerous processes during tumor progression/control and
      metastases development. The results allow us to investigate the development of innovative
      therapeutic and monitoring strategies. The clinical repercussions would consist in
      identifying new predictive and prognostic targets in breast cancer.
