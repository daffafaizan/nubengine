      determined with Scheimpflug tomography (Pentacam HR) after penetrating femtosecond
      laser-assisted keratotomy (pFLAK) and laser lens surgery. The anterior corneal astigmatism,
      posterior corneal astigmatism and total corneal refractive power were determined before, 1
      month and 3 months after lens surgery. Vector analysis according to the Alpins' method was
      used to calculate surgically induced astigmatism (SIA).
