      children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as part of the collaborative research structure
      of the Autism Treatment Network (ATN). A major goal of the ATN is to conduct clinical
      research that will have a significant impact on the daily lives and functioning of
      individuals with ASD and to address immediate concerns of parents. Children with ASD
      experience high rates of sleep disturbance, which likely contribute to the severity of their
      daytime cognitive and behavioral dysfunction and to poorer quality of life for them and their
      families.

      As a step toward addressing sleep problems in ASD, we propose to test the hypothesis that
      children with ASD and sleep problems will have a delay in MT onset and/or have decreased MT
      secretion over 24 hours compared to normal controls.

      Primary endpoint: Characterize the endogenous MT profiles in children with ASD:

      We predict that results from this study will reveal lower levels of metabolized MT in
      children with ASD when compared to normal children. In addition, we anticipate that children
      with ASD will have delayed MT onset or altered circadian phase.

      Data from this study will provide important information concerning circadian rhythm
      dysregulation in ASD and will support the development of future studies using MT to modify
      and correct abnormal circadian rhythms.
