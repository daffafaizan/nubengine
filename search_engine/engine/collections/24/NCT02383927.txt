    
      This Phase II study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in
      subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic, relapsed and/or refractory tumors
      that carry HRAS mutations and for whom there is no curative therapy available. Subjects with
      information available on tumor HRAS status previously generated are eligible. All subjects
      must consent to provide at least 10 tumor slides from a prior diagnostic biopsy for a
      retrospective testing of HRAS gene status at a central facility.

      Subjects will be enrolled into three nonrandomized cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Malignant thyroid tumors with HRAS mutations (cohort is closed).

        -  Cohort 2: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck Cancer with HRAS mutations.

        -  Cohort 3: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) with HRAS mutations other than HNSCC
