    
      Short-term Objectives include:

        1. Establishing the criterion-related validity of the Traumatic Brain Injury-4 (TBI-4)
           questionnaire in the Veteran homeless population using the Ohio State University
           TBI-Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID) (Corrigan et al., 2007) as the gold standard for
           establishing traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnosis.

        2. Identifying the prevalence of those that screen positive for a lifetime history of TBI
           among homeless Veterans.

        3. Comparing psychiatric outcomes (psychiatric hospitalizations, suicide attempts and
           deaths, and clinical contacts) and psychosocial outcomes between those with and without
           a lifetime history of TBI.
