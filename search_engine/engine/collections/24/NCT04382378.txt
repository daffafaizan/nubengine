      ventilation, factors predisposing to the development of skeletal muscle wasting and acute
      muscle atrophy. Strategies to attenuate this process must be used. The neuromuscular
      electrostimulation (NMES) leads to the application of electrical currents in the skin aiming
      at muscle contraction, has beneficial effects for the population of critical patients.
      However, the number of contractions induced by NMES to attenuate the loss of muscle mass in
      this population is not yet established. This randomized controlled trial with 120 patients
      that will be randomized to one of the 3 study groups: 100 continuous daily contractions
      (100Cd), 50 continuous daily contractions (50Cd) and control group. Muscle thickness,
      NMES-induced strength, and clinical and functional parameters at the time of discharge from
      the ICU and hospital discharge will be assessed daily. The results of this project will
      provide an important contribution to the understanding of the mechanisms associated with NMES
      treatment as a tool to minimize the effects of muscle disuse, as well as providing scientific
      support for the clinical use of this resource in the treatment in the light of the policies'
      health system.
