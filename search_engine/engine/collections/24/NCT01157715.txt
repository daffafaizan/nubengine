      States and other western countries. A quantity of documents indicate that neovascularization
      promoted by VEGF is main cause of visual acuity decline. Patients are starving for a new drug
      which can notably improve VA with less administration frequency and lower treatment cost.

      The new drug Recombinant Human VEGF Receptor-Fc Fusion Protein (KH902) is a gene fusion
      protein. The pre-clinical researches and phase I study show that KH902 is effective and safe
      in inhibiting the growth, migration, pullulation of vascular endothelial cells and
      neovascularization induced by VEGF.

      This study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of multiple injections of KH902 at
      variable dosing regimen in patients with CNV due to neovascular AMD. Based on the
      characteristics of KH902 and results from KH902 Phase I study as well as reference to
      clinical trials of similar drugs, it is determined that KH902 is administrated at
      0.5mg/eye/time and 2.0mg/eye/time.
