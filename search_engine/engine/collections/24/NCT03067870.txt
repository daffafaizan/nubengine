      typically results in swollen and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen after rest.
      Most frequently, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on
      both sides of the body. RA affects between 0.5-1% of adults in the developed world with
      between 5-50 per 100,000 people newly developing the disease each year. Onset is most
      frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. The goal of
      treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall
      functioning and quality of life.

      Herein, the investigators study the safety and efficacy of the immunomodulatory effects of
      bone marrow-derived stem cells administered intravenously and the regenerative and repair
      potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells transplanted into the joints of patients with RA.
