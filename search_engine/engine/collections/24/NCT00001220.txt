      for laryngeal penetration or aspiration because of abnormal oropharyngeal functioning and
      thus are at risk for aspiration pneumonia and its serious effects. By providing
      identification of the components of the abnormal swallow, and comparing swallowing across
      tasks, we may avoid aspiration and can instruct patients on preventative or compensatory
      swallowing techniques.

      We will study the oral, pharyngeal and upper esophageal phases of swallow using both
      ultrasonic imaging and videofluoroscopy in patients with neurologic, genetic, systemic, and
      neuromuscular conditions. Most of the previous studies of swallowing have utilized only one
      diagnostic imaging technique and have thus provided an incomplete swallowing assessment as
      each procedure has unique, but limited capabilities for visualizing the anatomy and
      physiology of the swallow.

      We also plan to compare discrete and continuous swallowing in these populations. While the
      motor physiology for discrete swallowing (i.e., single swallow) has been well studied, little
      is known about the details of oral, laryngeal, and pharyngeal coordination during sequential
      swallowing as a part of continuous drinking--a common event in everyday eating. A portion of
      the protocol will study the effects of fast-paced movement sequencing on the coordination of
      the tongue, velum, larynx, and pharynx during continuous drinking. Videofluoroscopy and
      ultrasound may be paired or used individually to collect data from normal subjects and
      patients with known dysphagia while they perform sequential and discrete swallowing tasks. A
      number of timing and displacement measurements of the structures activated during these tasks
      will be made from the digitized video images of each swallow, and analyses will be carried
      out subsequently across tasks and subjects.
