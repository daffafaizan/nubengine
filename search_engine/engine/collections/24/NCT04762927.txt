      measures. Known-groups validity will be demonstrated by differences in DEMMI scores between
      patients who were not able to walk and those who were able to walk with or without walking
      aid. Predictive validity of DEMMI at admission for functional independence at discharge from
      rehabilitation will be estimated. The minimal clinically important difference of DEMMI,
      responsiveness and floor or ceiling effects will also be estimated.
