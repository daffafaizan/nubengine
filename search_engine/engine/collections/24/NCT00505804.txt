      delirium and agitation are usually prevented using analgesic and sedative drugs which
      essentially render the patient unconscious. This is appropriate in the context of aggressive
      treatment of pathophysiological instability, which often requires multiple painful
      procedures. However, after the underlying pathophysiological problem has resolved, patients
      sometimes remain delirious and agitated. This often requires ongoing heavy sedation, which in
      turn necessitates continued mechanical ventilation, and can worsen the (temporarily masked)
      delirium. Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator associated
      pneumonia and other life threatening complications.

      The drug most commonly used to treat delirium is haloperidol, which reduces hallucinations
      and unstructured thought patterns, but also reduces the interaction with the environment.
      Haloperidol has significant side effects, including extrapyramidal reactions (in 1-10% of
      patients), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (in which it is the cause in 50% of cases), and
      prolonged QT syndrome (which can precipitate fatal arrhythmias).

      An ideal sedative agent in this context would have fewer side effects, relieve agitation
      without causing excessive sedation, and be easily titrated. An analgesic action might allow
      less opioid use, also lessening delirium. Early studies in other contexts suggest
      dexmedetomidine has all these properties.

      The investigators hypothesise that patients with ICU-associated delirium after the resolution
      of their underlying pathological process who receive dexmedetomidine will be able to be
      extubated earlier than those who receive haloperidol.
