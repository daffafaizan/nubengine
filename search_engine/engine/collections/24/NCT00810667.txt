    
      Lu AE58054 is a selective 5-HT6 antagonist that is currently being investigated for treatment
      of conditions of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Substantial experimental
      evidence suggests that selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists may be effective in treating
      cognitive deficits since they have been shown to improve performance in various animal models
      of cognitive function and are known to enhance cholinergic and glutaminergic neuronal
      function.

      Lu AE58054 has been investigated in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia, is
      generally well tolerated and has a benign side-effect profile. Moreover, no safety concerns
      or issues have been identified to date.

      The study is designed to provide data on the efficacy, safety and cognitive properties of Lu
      AE58054 as augmentation therapy to risperidone in patients with schizophrenia. Efficacy will
      be assessed in patients who are in a stable phase of their illness, but with a predefined
      minimum and maximum level of symptoms that will allow them to be included in the study.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the investigational medicinal product
      (IMP) or placebo as add-on therapy to their existing risperidone treatment.
