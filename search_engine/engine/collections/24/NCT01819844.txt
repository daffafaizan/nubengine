      closed-loop control system in insulin sensitive subjects with type 1 diabetes, insulin
      sensitive subjects with type 2 diabetes (TTD > 1u/kg/day), and subjects with type 2 diabetes
      and substantial insulin resistance (<2 u/kg/day). The results of this study will help to
      design future studies, exploring the use of the closed-loop system for BG control in
      hospitalized patients, including those with diabetes or hyperglycemia of critical illness.
