        1. To investigate the ability of qEEG to suspect suicidal potential in patients diagnosed
           with major depression.

        2. To test the ability of some psychological and cognitive elements in determining the
           likelihood of suicide in such patients.

        3. To give an objective and more reliable method than traditional questionnaires to assess
           the seriousness of suicidal ideations in patients suffering from depression who usually
