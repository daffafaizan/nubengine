      strategy for the treatment of high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Lymphoid acute
      leukemias (ALL) are considered malignant clonal diseases of the hematopoietic stem cells, and
      represent a therapeutic challenge due to the high relapse rate and mortality using
      conventional chemotherapy regimens. Many studies have shown a decrease in relapse and an
      increase in overall survival with allogeneic HSCT, however, despite the fact that results in
      ALL have improved in the past years, achieving complete remission (CR) in approximately 75%
      of the patients, the relapse rate remains high and long term survival is lower than 50%
      depending on age and disease characteristics. On the other hand, it has been stated that
      relapse is higher when an allo-HSCT is performed in second CR, obtaining poorer results
      compared to performing HSCT in first CR, although better than chemotherapy alone (87%
      probability of relapse).

      It is necessary to implement strategies that increase efficiency of pre transplant
      conditioning regimens in patients diagnosed with ALL undergoing an allo-HSCT in order to
      reduce relapse and increase overall survival. The hypothesis is that adding gemcitabine to
      the standard institutional conditioning regimen (reduced BUCY 2) in patients with ALL
      undergoing an allo-HSCT, the relapse free survival as well as the overall survival will
      improve, because it has been demonstrated in other malignant hematological diseases that
      gemcitabine plus two alkylating agents, facilitates synergism with busulfan and melphalan,
      inhibiting the DNA damage repair and causing a higher cytotoxic effect.
