    
      Induction chemotherapy: idarubicin (12mg/m2/day intravenous), intermediate-dose cytarabine
      (500mg/m2/12h, intravenous) and etoposide (100mg/m2/day, intravenous) in 3+7+3 schedule. This
      induction therapy is repeated if complete remission (CR) is not achieved after the first
      course of treatment.

      Consolidation therapy: mitoxantrone (12mg/m2/day, intravenous, days 4, 5 and 6) and
      intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h from day 1 to 6).

      Risk-stratification according to cytogenetics, courses to CR and availability of an
      HLA-identical sibling:

        -  Patients in the favorable cytogenetics group [t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16)] are treated
           with high-dose cytarabine (3g/m2/12h, intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5).

        -  Patients in intermediate cytogenetics group (normal karyotype and a single course to
           achieve the CR) receive an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant,
           regardless of having an HLA-identical sibling.

        -  The remaining patients are considered in the high-risk group and are treated with
           autologous or allogeneic PBSC transplantation depending on the availability of a sibling
           donor. In allotransplants, CD34+ cell selection of hematopoietic cells is performed.
