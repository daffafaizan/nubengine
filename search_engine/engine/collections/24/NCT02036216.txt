      necrosis of neoplasm cells with the rapid enlargement and relatively shortage of blood
      supply. So, identifying tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic changes in cfDNA on this
      status, such as gene mutations, deletions, methylation alterations and microsatellite
      alterations, may be more specific for us to diagnose the neoplasms in early phase. This
      phenomenon also appears in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have
      shown that cfDNA level is associated with intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis in HCC
      patients and examined some cfDNAcharacteristic changes, such as p161NK4A, RTL, RASSF1A,
      LINE-1 and GSTP1. Thus is useful for us to explore the specific cfDNA in HCC. For a high
      sensitivity and specificity detection, we will use technologiesdeveloped at Stanford Genome
      Technology Centerto find more characteristic gene mutations, methylation alterations or other
      changes (3). In this study, we willinvestigate thesecharacteristic changesin cfDNA and
      primary tumor lesions.

      Study arrangement:

      Collect the DNA samples from the plasma, blood cells and solid tumor tissues in the patients
      with HCC.

      Detect the DNA sequence from the samples of plasma, blood cells and solid tumor tissues.

      Identify cancer specific variations in cfDNA and primary tumor lesions. Date analysis and
      investigate these characteristic changes. Evaluate the application in early diagnosis,
      treatment monitoring and prognosis for HCC.
