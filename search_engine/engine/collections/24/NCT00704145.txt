      off-label indications. To date no studies have detailed the in-vivo completeness of DES
      coverage at different time points. The objective of this prospective study is to measure the
      completeness of strut coverage and vessel wall response (neointima disomogeneity, acquired
      late incomplete strut apposition) at different time points following paclitaxel-eluting stent
      implantation, in patients with multivessel disease treated with staged PCI procedures.
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) that detects smaller degrees of stent strut coverage more
      accurately than IVUS will be used at different time point. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
      will be performed as per normal practice at any index procedures and 9 months elective
      follow-up.
