      migraines triggered by pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-38 (PACAP38) as well as
      on biochemical markers for mast cell degranulation in migraine patients. Also, to investigate
      the occurrence of migraine in migraine patients after infusion of PACAP38 in lower dosages
      than previously investigated. As this has never been done before it is unknown how a lower
      dose of PACAP38 will affect 1) the incidence of migraine attacks, 2) the accompanying
      symptoms, 3) head pain characteristics, and 4) debut and duration of migraine attacks.
