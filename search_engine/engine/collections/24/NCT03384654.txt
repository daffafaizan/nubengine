      the study drug. Participants with B-cell ALL/LL will receive treatment until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or achievement of CR followed by hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT). Participants with T cell ALL/LL will receive treatment for up to 2 cycles.
      If disease progression is confirmed, then the participant will discontinue study treatment,
      complete the End of Treatment Visit, and enter the Posttreatment Period. For those
      participants who discontinue study drug prior to disease progression, disease evaluations
      will continue to be performed every 8 weeks until subsequent anticancer therapy is initiated.
