      colitis (UC), affects 3 million Americans. In approximately 25-30% of patients, onset of
      these chronic diseases occurs prior to the age of 20. Despite medical advances in new
      therapies, the clinical remission rate on biologics is less than 50% and a significant number
      of patients will lose response to anti-TNF therapy over time. In addition, patients that
      require a change in therapy will have a lower response rate to a different biologic.
      Additional therapies and mechanisms that affect disease activity need to be investigated to
      identify complimentary treatments that can further impact remission rates without increasing
      side effects such as lymphoma.

      Environmental factors, such as stressor exposure, can exacerbate mucosal inflammation.
      Patients with IBD report a lower quality of life, as well as increased anxiety and
      depression. Psychological interventions may improve disease activity. This study will test,
      using a randomized clinical trial (RCT) design, whether biofeedback intervention will
      attenuate disease activity. If efficacious, this study will provide a rationale for
      establishing biofeedback as a complimentary therapy to standard of care to ameliorate
      stress-induced increases in chronic inflammation.
