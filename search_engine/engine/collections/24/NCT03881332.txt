      (AKI) is well documented and known to complicate recovery from surgery.

      Accurate, direct measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may provide a tool to
      monitor perioperative onset of rapidly changing renal function. This may subsequently lead to
      design of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of earlier intervention with the
      aim to reduce the incidence of perioperative AKI.

      Recently a protocol for continuous infusion of low-dose iohexol (CILDI) as a measure of GFR
      in stable patients over a range of GFR (28-128 mL/min/1.73 m2) has been developed. Accuracy
      of this infusion protocol was confirmed with the single bolus injection (SBI) method. Data
      also showed that the continuous infusion protocol of low-dose iohexol is an accurate and
      precise method when measuring changing GFR even in critical ill patients with variable AKI
      risks. Accordingly, SBI and CILDI together now allow us to explore unanswered research
      questions related to perioperative change in renal function.
