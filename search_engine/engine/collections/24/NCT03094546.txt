      pathological conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      all of which are a growing public-health concern with devastating social and economical
      effects. Polyamines supplementation and corresponding up-regulation of autophagy (i.e.,
      cellular protein degradation pathways) may be a key target of intervention against
      age-related memory decline. The study will investigate whether a polyamine-enriched dietary
      supplementation (through capsule intake) could provide positive effects on cognitive function
      and biomarkers of elderly individuals (60-90 years old) with subjective cognitive decline
      (SCD).
