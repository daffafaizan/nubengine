      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved lenalidomide for your
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. Lenalidomide is a chemotherapy drug
      that belongs to a class of drugs called immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), which modify a
      participant's immune response in order to treat cancer. Lenalidomide alters the body's immune
      system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support
      tumor growth. Therefore, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide
      has been shown to restore the immune cells' ability to attack and kill tumor cells
      Lenalidomide is approved by the FDA to treat certain cancers including multiple myeloma and
      myelodysplastic syndrome.
