        -  Determine the clinical and pathological response in women with newly diagnosed, locally
           advanced operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising
           paclitaxel and carboplatin.

        -  Evaluate specific biomarkers for prognostic value and as markers for response/resistance
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients with non-palpable lymph nodes undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy within 4 weeks
      before beginning neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      All patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo lumpectomy or modified radical mastectomy. Patients with a positive sentinel
      lymph node biopsy or palpable axillary adenopathy undergo axillary lymph node dissection. All
      patients undergoing lumpectomy or mastectomy with high-risk disease also undergo
      radiotherapy.

      Patients refusing lumpectomy or mastectomy due to persistence of disease may undergo core
      needle biopsy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
