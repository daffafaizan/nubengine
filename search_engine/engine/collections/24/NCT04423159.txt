      sudden onset of acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to severe dehydration and ultimately
      death if not treated. Zambia, has continued to experience cholera outbreaks in several parts
      of the country. In order to curb the disease outbreaks, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
      recommended introducing cholera vaccination as a supplementary cholera control measure
      together with other prevention and control strategies, in endemic areas as well as in other
      places at risk for cholera outbreaks. OCV has recently been introduced to Zambia where a
      large population was vaccinated with 1 dose of Shanchol®, and about 6 months later over 70%
      individuals traced to receive a second dose.

      Considering the annual outbreaks of cholera in Zambia, there is urgent need to determine
      whether Shanchol® is able to elicit a sufficient and specific immunological response in
      individuals who received OCV in Zambia. This study will also help the investigator understand
      whether there are immune response differences based on genetics and may indicate whether some
      people may need more vaccine regimens than others.

      Objective 1: To profile cholera specific antibody status of a population at risk of cholera
      before and after receiving 1st and 2nd dose of shanchol ® oral cholera vaccine (OCV)
      Objective 2: To profile and characterize cholera specific B and T lymphocyte phenotypes among
      the immunized Zambians Objective 3: Develop and evaluate a non-invasive proxy measure of OCV
      immune responses Objective 4: To measure the protective value of immunizing HIV-infected
      individuals through measurement of the neutralization capabilities OCV generated antibodies
      Objective 5: To assess the impact of ABO blood groups on cholera antibody generation
