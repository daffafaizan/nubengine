      study will answer different questionnaires of the study before radiosurgery and at 3, 6, 9
      and 12 months after the treatment of brain metastases. Baseline examinations will be done
      before receiving the treatment during the hospitalisation for the Gamma Knife treatment, and
      then they will be repeated at the evaluation visits which are classically done every 3
      months. MRI's will also be performed every 3 months. In this way, no additional travel or MRI
      will be carried out as part of the study.
