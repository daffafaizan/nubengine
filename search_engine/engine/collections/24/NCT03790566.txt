      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol. Epidural anesthesia is the gold standard for
      analgesia for open abdominal surgeries, however difficulties in application and possible
      complications deter clinicians from utilizing this method. Safe and effective alternatives to
      epidural anesthesia has been a critical and popular focus of clinical research in recent
      years. Transversus abdominus plane (TAP) block is an alternative technique shown to be
      effective in pediatric open abdominal surgeries.

      Erector spinae plane (ESP) block was described as an effective block for multi-dermatome pain
      after thoracic surgery. It is emerging as a safe and easy-to-perform alternative to epidural
      anesthesia for pelvic, abdominal and thoracic surgery.

      During an open pyeloplasty, the flank incision goes through the transversus abdominus plane,
      where the local anesthetic is injected for TAP block. This may weaken the analgesic effect of
      the block. In the ESP block, local anesthetic diffuses cranio-caudally through the fascia of
      erector spinae muscles and the flank incision does not disturb this plane. We aim to compare
      the effectiveness of ESP block with TAP block in open pyeloplasty patients.
