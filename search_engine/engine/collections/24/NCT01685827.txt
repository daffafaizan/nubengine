    
      Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a life-threatening and neglected disease.

      Few treatment options are currently available for stage 2 (meningo-encephalitic stage) HAT,
      with NECT being the most commonly used one since 2010. Though NECT represents a significant
      improvement over current therapies, it is still far from ideal given the environment in which
      HAT patients live (remote, poor areas with little health infrastructure, if any, and
      difficult logistics). There is an urgent need for less toxic and more easily manageable
      compounds to treat this fatal disease.

      Fexinidazole is a 2-5-nitroimidazole, formulated for oral administration, which has been
      shown to possess in vitro and in vivo activity against both T. b. rhodesiense and T. b.
      gambiense parasites.

      Predicted CSF concentrations reached target levels after repeated dosing. Its efficacy and
      safety must now be tested in patients with stage 2 HAT.
