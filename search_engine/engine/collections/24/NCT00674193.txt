      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of dactinomycin in infants, children, and
      adolescents with cancer.

      II. To identify demographic or physiological factors that are determinants of dactinomycin
      disposition.

      III. To characterize the PKs of vincristine (VCR) in infants, children, and adolescents with
      cancer.

      IV. To identify demographic or physiological factors that are determinants of VCR
      disposition.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the correlation of dactinomycin and VCR systemic exposure metrics with toxicity
      outcomes.

      II. To explore the PK, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenetic relationships of dactinomycin and
      VCR in children with cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood and urine collection prior to, periodically during, and after
      treatment with dactinomycin and vincristine for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and
      pharmacogenetic analysis. Samples are analyzed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry assay. Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is isolated
      and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and genotyping assays for genetic variation in
      genes relevant to the pharmacology of dactinomycin and vincristine.

      After the final pharmacokinetic sample is collected, patients are followed for up to 6
      months.
