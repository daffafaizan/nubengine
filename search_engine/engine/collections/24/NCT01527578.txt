      healthy controls to participate in a study involving brain imaging and psychological
      assessments and questionnaires. The study will involve phone interviews, cognitive testing
      and questionnaires, genetic testing, physical exam, photographs, non-invasive brain imaging
      sessions (MRI and MEG). The study can take up to 17 hours to complete, and there may be up to
      5 study visits to UCSF and UC Berkeley.
