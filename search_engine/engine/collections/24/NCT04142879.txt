    
      This study will be a multicenter, multi arm, prospective randomized study to evaluate the use
      of Viz. The study will enroll all subjects that present at all participating centers that
      meet the study inclusion/exclusion during the period of study evaluation. All subject imaging
      (CT) data will be pushed to Viz and evaluated by Viz. Randomization will occur at the time of
      image processing by Viz that indicates the subject is positive for LVO per the software
      criteria (anterior location). Subjects randomized to the standard of care arm of the study
      will not receive any information via an automated notification from Viz. Subjects that are
      randomized to the Viz arm of the study will have an automated message sent to the enrolling
      center contacts. Subjects will be followed for 90 days post treatment. Data evaluation may
      occur at regular intervals throughout the study and at the completion of the study period.
