      aneurysm. Patients for whom surgical intervention is deemed necessary will be approached for
      participation in the study. After signing informed consent, they will be randomized to
      receive a document that will serve as a decision aid (option grid). If they are randomized as
      controls they will receive a standard information booklet. Patients will be given a few
      minutes to read through the option grid choices, and will have the chance to ask questions
      about the two possible treatments (cerebral aneurysm clipping, cerebral aneurysm coiling).
      The remainder of the interaction between patient and provider will not be affected in any
      other way. The physician is free to make any recommendations based on their best judgment,
      and the patient is free to choose based on their preferences. The visit with the patient will
      be voice recorded and (immediately after the completion of the encounter) will be scored
      based on the OPTION score, which assesses patient participation in the shared decision making
      process.

      Patients will be interviewed again preoperatively on the day of the operation, immediately
      postoperatively, and 30-days postoperatively (via telephone). Performance on secondary
      outcome measures will be recorded.

      Variables will be analyzed using Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the
      nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Logistic regression will be
      performed, for each binary outcome. Linear regression will be performed for each continuous
      outcome.
