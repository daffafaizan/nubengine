      COVID-19 patients, NLR has been linked to the severity of the patient's clinical status, and
      an increase in NLR is reported to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality.
      Pain is a frequently seen symptom at the onset of viral infections and throughout the course
      of the disease. Although the pain mechanisms triggered by viral pathogens are not yet
      entirely understood, pain is thought to arise as a result of direct activation of nociceptor
      neurons by pathogens and their interaction with molecular ligands. Toll-like receptor 7
      (TLR7), a pathogen recognition receptor that plays an important role in immune responses to
      viruses by binding to viral RNA, is known to be involved in pain development in different RNA
      virus infections. Park et al. showed that extracellular micro RNAs activate nociceptive
      neurons via the TLR7 pathway. Although these mechanisms have been demonstrated for different
      viral infections, the viral pathogenesis leading to pain in COVID-19 is still unclear. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of headache and muscular pain in
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and to determine the relationship between these symptoms and
      inflammatory parameters.
