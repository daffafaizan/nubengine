    
      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT): P-STAIR (23 sessions) vs.
      supportive counseling (SC) (23 sessions). Eligible cases are randomized to P-STAIR and SC in
      a 1:1 ratio. Participants will be mothers receiving family preservation services (FPS), with
      a child in the age range of 1-8 years old, and PTSD (with/without depression). Symptom
      progress will be measured at pre-treatment, two in-treatment assessments (9 weeks and 16
      weeks), post-treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up.
