      it is assumed that denervation might improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Some
      clinical studies have shown that glucose metabolism is improved in patients with resistant
      hypertension both 1 and 3 months after denervation, and fasting glucose, insulin and
      C-peptide decreased significantly as did insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR. But in some
      clinical studies, denervation did not lead to a significant improvement of insulin
      sensitivity â‰¤12 months after treatment, and no effect in systemic sympathetic activity was
      observed after denervation. Therefore, the efficacy of denervation on glucose metabolism is
      still in controversy. The investigators wish to investigate the effect of multi-electrode
      catheter-based endovascular denervation on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in
      patients with T2DM.
