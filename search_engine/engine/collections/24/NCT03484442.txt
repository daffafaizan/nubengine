      varied presentations and multiple causes . Patients usually present with non-specific
      abdominal symptoms and laboratory findings, which leads to delayed diagnoses . Therefore,
      diagnostic imaging has emerged as one of the most crucial components in the diagnostic
      work-up of suspected

      Recent technical advances have made computed tomography angiography the modality of choice in
      the setting of suspected Acute mesenteric ischemia.computed tomography angiography is a rapid
      and non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing intestinal vasculature and bowel . computed
      tomography angiography allows early diagnosis and differentiation between occlusive and
      non-occlusive causes, which is important to direct therapeutic approach . Overall, combining
      vascular and bowel assessment results in a high diagnostic accuracy . A recent meta-analysis
      showed a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 96% . However, this meta analysis also
      showed that the prevalence of confirmed .Acute mesenteric ischemia is less than 25% among the
      patients referred to computed tomography angiograph in the setting of suspected Acute
      mesenteric ischemia .Knowledge of the prevalence and the demographic distribution of
      alternative diagnoses in the remaining three-fourths of patients without Acute mesenteric
      ischemia is important for appropriate patient care. computed tomography angiograph is
      considered to allow for a variety of acute alternative diagnoses, ensuring timely triage of
      these patients.
