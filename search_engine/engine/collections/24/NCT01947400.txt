    
      This is a process of change study, which will compare HCAHPS patient satisfaction surveys
      before and after the Hospitalist receives AIDET physician-patient communication training.
      Once the Hospitalists agree to participate in the study, they will receive AIDET training by
      a Studor Group certified trainer. Both before and after the training intervention,
      Hospitalists' use of the AIDET method will be validated by having patients complete anonymous
      questionnaires during their hospital stay.

      All HCAHPS surveys will be conducted by an external patient satisfaction survey vendor, and
      information will be de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist.
      Validation questionnaires will be distributed by administrative staff, and will also be
      de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist.
