      prostatic urethral implant for the treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) that
      arise due to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), secondary to the presence of Benign Prostatic
      Hypertrophy (BPH). Effectiveness will also be measured. It is intended that the features of
      the Zenflow Spring will provide an effective office-based treatment and management therapy
      for BPH with little or no side effects.
