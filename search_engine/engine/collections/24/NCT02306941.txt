      associated with impaired quality of life. In adults with IBS, internet-delivered CBT leads to
      reduced symptoms and increased quality of life, but studies in children are lacking. This
      pilot-study aim to evaluate the treatment effects and feasibility of an internet-delivered
      CBT-program for adolescents with FAP and FD.

      Method: Pilot study with a pre-post-design and no control group. The internet-delivered
      CBT-program will last for 10 weeks and include weekly therapist support, consisting of online
      messages and telephone calls.
