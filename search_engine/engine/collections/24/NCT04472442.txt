      as compared to HIT alone; 2) improvements in gait quality and motor coordination during
      walking, and 3) changes in measures of community participation and integration. To test these
      hypotheses, the proposed crossover, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) is
      designed to test the effects of safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of HIT+AIH. In
      this phase I-II trial, patients >6 months post-BI with mobility deficits will be allocated to
      5 weeks (15 sessions) of HIT+AIH or HIT alone. Blinded assessments will be performed prior to
      and following training paradigms to address 3 specific aims.
