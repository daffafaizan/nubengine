      and parent outcomes among Palestinian refugees in Beirut, Lebanon. This evaluation employs an
      innovative, mixed-methods bio-behavioral approach to investigate the associations among
      social contexts; maternal, child and family functioning; and reduction in violence through
      the promotion of harmonious family relationships. The results of this study have implications
      for improving the lives of and reducing violence for the hundreds of thousands of families
      with young children living in fragile contexts. We hypothesize that when MOCEP is implemented
      with fidelity (i.e., delivered as intended by design), participating families will experience
      reduced violence in their homes and have better individual and intra-family outcomes than
      families who do not participate in the program.
