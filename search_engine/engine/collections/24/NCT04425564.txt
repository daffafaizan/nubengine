      Egyptian CRC cancer patients diagnosed at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University
      between January 2016 and June 2018). Patients were randomly treated with either classic XELOX
      (arm A) or with capecitabine (2000 mg daily x 8 weeks) and oxaliplatin (30 mg/m2 weekly X 8
      weeks) then 2 weeks rest (arm B). Toxicities and the survival analysis after two years for
      both regimens were recorded. Blood samples are taken from both groups to assess
      pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its relation to dosing.
