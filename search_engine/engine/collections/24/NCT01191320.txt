    
      A phase IIB, multi-center, randomized, parallel, placebo- and active-controlled trial in
      adult male subjects with secondary hypogonadism who have been treated with OHAs but are not
      in glycemic control. All subjects currently treated with exogenous testosterone will
      discontinue at screening for at least 21 days and remain off testosterone for the course of
      the study. One hundred twenty to 150 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three
      treatment groups according to a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will receive one of two dose strengths
      of Androxal or placebo in addition to their usual dose of mono- or combination OHAs for three
      months. Following an initial screening period, subjects will return monthly for 3 months and
      1 month later for a follow-up visit.
