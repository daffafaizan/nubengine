      Bariatric surgery is a common procedure. Data on patient related outcome beyond loss of body
      weight are scarce. The question arises which patient is at specific risk for an unfavorable
      outcome after bariatric surgery.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to investigate variables possibly associated with impaired outcome
      and increased patients' interference after bariatric surgery. Which patients are at risk for
      clinically meaningful impaired daily living?

      Methods

      Patients will be enrolled in a prospective observational study. Data will be collected in a
      registry with documentation of patient, surgery, anesthesia and analgesia related variables
      including preoperative status and postoperative patient reported outcome with a follow-up
      period up to 5 years after bariatric surgery.

      Patients fill in standardized validated outcome questionnaires at predefined time points. The
      registry provides the basis for large scale analyses and benchmarks for several parameters.

      Variables to be considered are pain scores after surgery, patient reported outcome, pain
      related interference after surgery (Brief Pain Inventory), quality of life (SF-12), long-term
      outcome, chronic (neuropathic) postsurgical pain, BMI, psychological questionnaires, surgery
      and patient related variables, including genetic variants.
