      risk for severe primary VZV infection (chickenpox) and VZV reactivation (shingles). A
      non-live, recombinant subunit Herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix; GSK vaccines) was recently
      licensed for the prevention of shingles in people aged 50 years or older and was shown to
      induce both cellular and humoral immunity. As both components of the immune system are
      important for protection against VZV, the investigators plan to study the humoral and
      cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine after organ transplantation in VZV-seronegative
      patients. Indeed, the current live VZV vaccine is contraindicated after transplantation;
      therefore, the non-live recombinant varicella-zoster subunit vaccine, if shown to induce
      cellular and humoral immunity, could potentially be offered to VZV-seronegative transplant
      patients.
