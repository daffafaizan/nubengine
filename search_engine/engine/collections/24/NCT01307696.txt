      small and medium ventral hernias using PVPâ„¢. All patients operated between March 2009 and
      February 2011 at the participating centers, will be evaluated and described. Patients will be
      evaluated by clinical investigation, questioning and ultrasound. The investigators' main
      focus will be the incidence of complications related to the use of the device, during the
      first year. Also the investigators look at recurrence rate at 12 months, occurrence of pain
      at 12 months and foreign body feeling. The trial can be seen as a quality control of a cohort
      of patients treated with an innovative mesh device. No sponsoring from the company J&J will
      be asked or accepted.
