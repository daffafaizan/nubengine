      (PONV). We want to test if it is indicated to associate dexamethasone and ondansetron in
      obese patients having bariatric surgery under total intra-venous closed-loop anesthesia.

      Two groups to be studied: one will receive 4 mg dexamethasone at the end of the anesthetic
      induction and 4 mg ondansetron at the end of the surgical procedure, one will receive normal
      saline.

      One hundred twenty consecutive patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who
      give written informed consent to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to one of
      two experimental groups using a 1:1 ratio.

      Patients will be continuously monitored in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) and the
      medical floor for a total of 24 hours post operatively. Episodes of nausea, vomiting and
      administration of rescue therapy for either nausea or vomiting will be recorded and time
      stamped. In addition, severity of nausea will be evaluated by the patient using a standard
      verbal response scale (VRS) ranging from 0-10, 0 being no nausea and 10 being severe nausea.
      Rescue therapy for PONV episodes will consist of 4 mg ondansetron followed by 0.625 mg
      droperidol if necessary.
