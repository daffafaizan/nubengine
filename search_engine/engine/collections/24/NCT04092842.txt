      results are suboptimal, because reconstructive techniques are performed in less than 5% of
      them. Objective: To demonstrate that the placement of a silicone prosthesis in partial
      defects generated by breast cancer conservative surgery improves the aesthetic result,
      compared to the usual surgical technique, safely, reproducibly and compatible with adjuvant
      treatments.

      Methodology: Prospective randomized clinical trial, controlled with blind evaluator.
      Inclusion criteria: Women with breast cancer candidates for conservative surgery.
      Intervention: In the cases the study technique will be carried out consisting in the filling
      of the defect with a silicone prosthesis of size adjusted to it (2-4cm). Controls: usual
      surgical procedure. Main result variable: aesthetic results (visual analog scale) according
      to the patient, surgeon and blind external evaluator. Secondary variables: surgical
      complications, local complications derived from adjuvant treatments, rate of local
      recurrence, rate of reintervention due to affected margins, behavior in mammographic
      follow-up, professional satisfaction and impact on quality of life.
