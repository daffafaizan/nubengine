      and sample collection is done every two weeks for two months (4 times in total) with a final
      follow-up one year after the participant's inclusion in the study. Participants complete
      questionnaires before each sample collection. The baseline questionnaire captures demographic
      data, medical history, behavioral and psychological data, and socio-economic status.
      Participants provided information on medical history, history of allergies, smoking, and
      chronic medication taken regularly. COVID-19-related data and environmental conditions of the
      household were obtained.
