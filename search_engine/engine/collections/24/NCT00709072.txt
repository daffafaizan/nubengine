      Therefore it is crucial to prevent relapse following treatment in the early years. This study
      will investigate predictors of relapse and assess the effectiveness of a simple two-weekly
      user-friendly reminder to parents, about when and how to address any re-occurring stuttering
      after treatment. Results from the study may help to prevent stuttering relapse in this age
      group in the future.
