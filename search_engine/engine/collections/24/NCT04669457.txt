      will receive Dexmedetomidine intra-nasally at a dose of 1 mcg/kg, approximately 15-25 minutes
      before entering the operating room or Group B which will receive Midazolam orally at a dose
      of 0.5 mg/kg (with a maximum dose of 20 mg), approximately 10-15 minutes before entering the
      operating room. Each subject will receive a Drug Acceptance scale, and Parental Separation
      Anxiety Scale (PSAS) mask Acceptance Scale to identify the differences in markers associated
      with pediatric delirium. End tidal Sevoflurane value during the surgery and at the time when
      patient leaves the OR, amount and dose of oral/rectal acetaminophen given in PACU, child's
      behavior for 48 hours post-operatively, and documented intake of oral analgesics will be
      collected to identify the reduced need for post-operative analgesia and behaviors associated
      with extended pediatric delirium.
