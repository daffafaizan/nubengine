      perioperative transfusion is common. Various strategies have been employed to decrease
      intraoperative blood loss and reduce transfusion in children undergoing PSF. The
      intraoperative administration of the antifibrinolytic drug epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA)
      is one such strategy that has been shown to be effective in this regard. This study will
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of EACA in children undergoing PSF at CHOP who receive EACA at
      the standard dose reported in the literature for this population and currently in use at
      CHOP.
