      cancer who are progression free at 4 months after receiving ISIS 5132 or ISIS 3521. II.
      Determine duration of response to these treatment regimens in this patient population. III.
      Evaluate toxicities and tolerability of these treatment regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number
      of prior therapies for metastatic breast cancer (1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms. (Arm I closed 12/22/99) Arm I: Patients receive ISIS 5132 IV continuously
      over 21 days. (closed 12/22/99) Arm II: Patients receive ISIS 3521 IV continuously over 21
      days. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After every 2 courses, patients are evaluated for response. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months the next 3 years, then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 68 patients (34 per arm) will be accrued in this study (Arm I
      closed 12/22/99).
