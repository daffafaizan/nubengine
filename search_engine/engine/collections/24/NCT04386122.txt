    
      This study is a randomized, single-dose, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover study in
      24 fed healthy subjects with an at-least-6-day washout period. The drug level in serum is
      detected by High-performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to determine Cmax, AUC0-t and Tmax.
      Safety are evaluated during drug administration, blood sampling time, washout period and 1
      week after the end of blood sampling for any adverse drug reactions.
