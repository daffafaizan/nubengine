      and connective tissue techniques in modulating systemic inflammation. Another objective is to
      evaluate the existence, at baseline, of a correlation between the inflammation indices and
      the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet.

      Methods. 34 patients were recruited, and divided into three groups. The control group
      followed the normal rehabilitation protocol. The other two groups were subjected, in addition
      to the standard treatment, to manual lymphatic drainage treatment or connective tissue
      techniques. The outcomes (PCR, ESR, Oedema) were recorded in three stages: upon entering the
      hospital, 1 week after entry and at follow-up 21 days after surgery.
