      poorly understood. Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate customized
      interventions for hypertension are performed, it will be unknown whether the observed
      preliminary effects of general mindfulness interventions on blood pressure reduction could be
      much more effective with a tailored approach. Consequently, this study proposes to conduct a
      behavioral intervention study to evaluate whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
      customized to prehypertensive and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide
      clinically relevant reductions in blood pressure.

      This customized intervention is called Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction (MB-BP).
      The study follows the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, where targets
      likely proximally affected by the intervention are identified, that should also have effect
      on the longer-term outcomes (e.g. blood pressure, mortality). The selected targets,
      consistent with theoretical frameworks and early evidence how mindfulness interventions could
      influence mental and physical health outcomes, are measures of self-regulation including (1)
      attention control (specifically the Sustained Attention Response Task and Mindful Attention
      Awareness Scale), (2) emotion regulation (specifically the Pittsburgh Stress Battery and the
      Perceived Stress Scale), and (3) self-awareness (specifically the Heart Beat Detection Task
      and Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness). Based on the degree of target
      engagement, MB-BP can be further customized to better engage with the targets as needed.
