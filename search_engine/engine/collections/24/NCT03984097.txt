    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-079. TAK-079 is being tested to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) when added to 1 of 2 standard
      backbone regimens (LenDex or VRd) with newly diagnosed NDMM for whom stem cell
      transplantation (SCT) is not planned as initial therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 participants. Participants will be non-randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  TAK-079 and LenDex

        -  TAK-079 and VRd

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 36 months. Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent alternative anticancer
      therapy, to permit the detection of any delayed AEs.
