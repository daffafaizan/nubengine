      comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and ocular. However, the results of studies of ocular
      findings in AA are controversial.

      Several ocular alterations have been previously reported in patients with AA ranging from
      minor punctate opacities to cataract. However, there are contrasting opinions on the
      significance of these lenticular changes. In addition, Horner syndrome, pupil ectopia, iris
      atrophy, fundus changes , bilateral keratoconus, iris changes and retinal changes have been
      reported in AA.

      Dermoscopy is a noninvasive, diagnostic tool which visualizes subtle patterns of skin lesions
      not normally visible to the unaided eye. Characteristic dermoscopic finding of AA included
      black dots , tapering hair corresponding to " exclamation mark hairs " , broken hairs ,
      yellow dots , and clustered short vellus hairs ( shorter than 10 mm).

      Since ocular affection can be a profound morbidity factor in patients with AA, we will search
      deeply in this study about this correlation in order to conclude the value of ocular
      screening in each and every patient with AA.
