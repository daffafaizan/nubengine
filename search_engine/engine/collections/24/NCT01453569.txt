      psychological, physical or economic aspects. Research indicates that the disease is
      associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. Currently used treatments offer a small
      symptomatic benefit. No treatments to delay or halt the progression of the disease are, as of
      yet, available. The investigators suppose sodium oligo-mannurarate capsule to be effective to
      halt the progression of the disease.
