      unclear. In addition, mainstream treatment relies on implantable devices and medication.
      China Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias Study is a nation-wide complex consisting of several
      interrelated studies, with the aim of building a risk stratification as well as an efficient
      and economic strategy for early prevention and treatment.

      Inherited Ventricular Arrhythmias Registry, as a part of China Malignant Ventricular
      Arrhythmias Study, is an observational, prospective, multi-center registry, aiming at
      exploring the correlation between genotype and phenotype for inherited structural ventricular
      arrhythmias, thus helping molecular diagnosis and risk stratification of these conditions.
      500 patients with definitive diagnosis will be recruited consecutively from 10 major
      arrhythmia centers distributed in 6 areas in China. At study entry, participants will be
      interviewed and asked to sign the informed consent. Demographic characteristics, medical
      history, clinical features, laboratory tests, imaging pictures, medications, procedures, and
      in-hospital outcomes of patients will be abstracted from medical records by well-trained
      staffs. At the same time, blood samples will be collected to detect biological markers, like
      genes, inflammatory factors ,etc. Once enrolled, the participants will receive follow up
      every 6 mouths about condition of arrhythmia, medication, clinical events, etc.
