      the QT interval. The QT interval is the time between the contraction and relaxation of the
      chambers of the heart, called ventricles, which collect and pump blood. The use of some drugs
      can lead to serious issues such as QT interval prolongation (lengthen) and potentially
      serious arrhythmias (abnormal heart beat), and sudden death. Therefore, it is important to
      study effect of medications on the heart.

      The drug, Moxifloxacin, will be introduced as a control to be able to compare the effect, if
      any, that CXA 101/tazobactam might have on participant's heart.Moxifloxacin is an approved
      antibiotic commonly used to treat common bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin is known to
      slightly increase the electrical conduction of participant's heart.
