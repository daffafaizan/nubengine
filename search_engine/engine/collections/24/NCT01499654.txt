    
      Subjects in this study will proceed to the nuclear cardiology laboratory for their scheduled
      nuclear stress test. After informed consent is obtained, the study doctor or research staff
      member will ask detailed questions about the subject's current health, medications and
      medical history, and the subject's medical chart will be reviewed including results of any
      previous nuclear images.

      For the test, a small catheter (tube) will be placed in a vein in the subject's arm to
      administer the radioactive imaging agent, Tc-99m sestamibi. Subjects will be given half (1/2)
      of the normal Tc-99m sestamibi dose and then the study staff will obtain resting images
      pictures of the heart. After this set of images, the subject will be given the remaining half
      of the radioactive imaging agent followed by a second set of images.

      After this, the subject will then undergo the stress portion of the test in the usual manner
      as prescribed by the referring physician.
