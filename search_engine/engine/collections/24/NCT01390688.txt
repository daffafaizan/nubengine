      200 individuals in age 40-65 years are recruited and categorized into 3 groups: 1. Type 2
      Diabetes, 2. Impaired glucose Tolerance and 3. Normal Glucose Tolerance. Groups are supposed
      to be age and BMI-matched.

      Measurements of systemic BDNF, cogntive function (memory, attention and langue), fitness,
      bodycomposition, glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation are done.

      Multiple regression analysis are perfomed to explain variablity in cognitive function, with
      age, visceral fat and BDNF as explanotory varibales.
