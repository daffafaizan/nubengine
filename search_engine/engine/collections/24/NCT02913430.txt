      mutation in plasma in patients treated with Fulvestrant plus palbociclib compared to
      tamoxifen plus palbociclib.

      Patients with ER+ breast cancer who had 1 to 3 prior lines of endocrine therapy and up to one
      line of chemotherapy for MBC, excluding fulvestrant and tamoxifen, will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive fulvestrant 500mg IM Q28 days with one extra dose on Day15 of the first
      cycle (as a loading dose) plus palbociclib 125mg/day PO on a 21 days on/7 days off schedule
      or tamoxifen 20mg PO daily plus palbociclib 125mg/day PO on a 21 days on/7 days off schedule.
