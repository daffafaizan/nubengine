      program will be delivered in a computer game like format over a school-based intranet system
      (i.e., networked computers linked to a school-based server), which enables users to interact
      individually with the program and to share their experiences by receiving immediate feedback
      on both their own responses and those of their classmates' collective responses. The delivery
      of this computer-based programs assures fidelity of implementation. Each activity (component)
      ultimately included in the program will be continually developed and tested to assure that it
      is effective at changing the targeted theoretically based etiological mechanism (risk
      factor). Development will include an experimental assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of
      each component and only effective components will be included in the program. The 7th grade
      version of Click CityÂ®: Alcohol program will consist of 12 effective components delivered in
      six sessions over a three-week period. This will be followed by two 8th grade booster
      sessions, consisting of a total of 5 components delivered over a one-week period. Educational
      newsletters to parents and teacher guides will be developed to accompany the program. The
      investigators will conduct a randomized efficacy trial with 26 middle schools. Half of the
      schools will use the newly developed program and the other half will use the programs that
      they usually do to teach about Alcohol.
