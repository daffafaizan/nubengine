      freezing of gait (FOG), can arise later in the Parkinson's disease (PD) course and cause
      significant disability. Ultimately, patients are at risk for falls and can become socially
      isolated due to their mobility limitations. These symptoms tend not to respond to high
      frequency STN-DBS. However, lower frequency stimulation (60-80Hz) of the STN in treating gait
      disorder and/or freezing of gait has demonstrated benefit. This study potentially can expand
      knowledge of 60hz DBS while improving its utilization in combination with PD
      medications-enabling sustainable and possibly predictable therapeutic benefit.
