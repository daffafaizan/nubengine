      laboratory tests and radiological investigations. The cornerstone of this decision is to
      control sepsis and inflammatory condition before surgery. This issue made surgeons favor
      longer interval between incidence of ECF and definite surgical treatment. In some cases there
      may be a hidden place for infection or continuation of the inflammatory situation without
      clear signs, which necessitated the presence of a possible indicator helps in making the
      surgical decision. Serum C-reactive protein is the common inflammatory marker used to exclude
      inflammatory condition. Although its level is within normal range but some cases showed high
      recurrence rate when the level exceeded certain as the investigators believed in their study.
      Now the investigators can say that the perioperative serum C-reactive protein level can be
      used as an objective parameter for helping to make surgical decision and reduce recurrence of
      ECF.
