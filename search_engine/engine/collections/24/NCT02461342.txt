      which genetic, environment and its interactions associated with cardiovascular autonomic
      neuropathy (CAN) in general Chinese population. A total of more than 2000 participants were
      recruited by using multiple stages sampling (first cluster sampling and then simply
      sampling). Data involved in variables of genetic, environment were collected. Every
      participant was complete DNA extracted and genotyped by using single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP). Cardiovascular autonomic functions were measured by using short-term heart rate
      variability (HRV) to evaluate the outcome of CAN. Genetic analysis were employed to evaluate
      genetic variants, environmental risk factors and its interactions for CAN.Univariate and
      multiple variables analysis have been performed to examine potential environmental and
      genetic risk factors of CAN.
