    
      Patients with a dilated left atrium (left upper chamber of the heart) that undergo mitral
      valve surgery may be at risk for the development of atrial fibrillation after surgery.

      Atrial fibrillation (also known as "A-Fib" or AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm which may cause
      symptoms such as pounding sensations in your chest, dizziness, fatigue, chest pain and/or
      shortness of breath. AF patients are at a higher risk of developing a stroke.

      Participants who sign informed consent will be randomized into one of two groups by chance
      (as in the flip of a coin).

      Approximately 77 patients will undergo their mitral valve operation along with Pulmonary Vein
      Isolation (a treatment group) and 77 patients who do not undergo Pulmonary Vein Isolation at
      the time of their mitral valve surgery (a control group).

      The treatment group will undergo operation for mitral valve disease with an additional
      procedure called Pulmonary Vein Isolation using a device that delivers radiofrequency energy
      to the heart muscle in order to create scar tissue to block electrical impulses that can
      trigger episodes of AF.

      The control group of patients will undergo operation for mitral valve disease without the
      additional Pulmonary Vein Isolation.
