      develop PTSD following an accident (Blanchard & Hickling, 2004). Based on conservative
      estimates, past research, indicates that MVA-related PTSD may affect 2.5 to 7 million persons
      in the United States (Blanchard & Hickling). Furthermore, two seminal epidemiological studies
      (Kessler et al., 1995; Norris, 1992) that focused on causes of adult PTSD identified MVAs as
      the most frequent trauma resulting in PTSD. For these reasons, MVA-resultant PTSD represents
      a significant public health problem that needs not only to be thoroughly understood, but
      addressed with successful mental health treatment options (Beck & Coffey, 2007; Blanchard &
      Hickling, 1997, 2004; Bryant et al., 1998; Taylor et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2001).
      Although there is empirical literature on the treatment of PTSD following an MVA, additional
      efficacious and rigorously conducted studies with statistical underpinnings are required to
      determine the results that can be expected from alternative models of care (Beck & Coffey;
      Blanchard & Hickling, 1997, 2004).
