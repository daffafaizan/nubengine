      restrict their participation in daily physical activities. Children with hemiplegic CP may
      experience a variety of concomitant health conditions including, movement difficulty,
      postural and balance instability, muscle spasticity, difficulty with motor planning and
      control, and cognitive impairments. They also have diminished force generation, debilitated
      proprioception around the core, lack of enough harmonization in core musculature, and
      diminished capacity to adjust coupling between the trunk, pelvis, and hip stabilizers leading
      to diminished proficiency of movement.

      According to the concept of motor learning, training is considered to be most effective when
      the training task is specific to the intended outcome, as optimal improvement in function
      involves the practice of task-specific activities. Due to the shift in focus on functional
      movements rather than muscle activity or movement patterns, there has been a task-oriented
      approach which is based on the system model of motor control providing motivation due to
      specific achievements that can be made.

      Task-oriented circuit training effectively provides various sensory stimulation and promotes
      functional activities for stroke patients; however, more attention is becoming directed to
      children with CP to examine the effect of the task-oriented circuit training program on
      functional performance in children with CP. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine
      the effect of rehabilitation delivered as a task-oriented circuit exercise program on
      kinematic parameters of gait, pelvic symmetry, and trunk endurance in children with
      hemiplegic CP.
