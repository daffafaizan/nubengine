    
      This feasibility and acceptability study will assess the rate of consent to, adherence to,
      and side effects from a therapy study in a randomized trial comparing bright white light
      (BWL) to dim red light (DRL). Four questionnaires will be distributed to patients and/or
      their parents, depending upon the questionnaire, to study the fatigue, quality of life, mood
      symptoms, and side effects of the BWL/DRL intervention in adolescents and young adults being
      treated for solid tumors, including lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the feasibility and acceptability of a BWL intervention compared to a DRL
           standard comparison group in adolescent/young adult solid tumor and lymphoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the effect size of this intervention on measures of fatigue in order to
           design a larger clinical trial of efficacy of a randomized control trial of BWL versus
           DRL intervention for fatigue in pediatric oncology patients.

      OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the effect of participant location (inpatient, hospital-based housing, or home)
           on adherence.

        -  Estimate rates of depressive symptoms.

        -  Describe quality of life.
