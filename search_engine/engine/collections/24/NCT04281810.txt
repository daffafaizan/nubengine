      TEDS group received muscle electrical stimulation for 30 min/session/day throughout the
      intervention. Weaning parameters (tidal volume, respiratory rate, and rapid shallow breathing
      index) and respiratory muscle strength (Pimax, Pemax) were assessed. The hospitalization
      outcome, including weaning rate and length of stay, was followed up until discharge.
