      marketed for its hemostatic properties. It is used in our practice to achieve hemostasis at
      the site of the vaginal cuff closure during laparoscopic hysterectomy. While the hemostatic
      properties of oxidized regenerated cellulose are well known and documented, there is newer
      research to suggest that oxidized regenerated cellulose may have antimicrobial activity. One
      In vitro study investigated the antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose
      products against multiple antibiotic resistant microorganisms and found that the
      antimicrobial affect of the oxidized regenerated cellulose products was significantly greater
      than that of the controls. There are a limited number of studies investigating the
      antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose products in vivo (and none in
      gynecologic surgery).
