      Spanish populations. To date, no studies evaluating the TPMT variant allele frequency in the
      Hispanic population have been reported. Hispanics are a growing part of the patient
      population treated in the United States. Characterization of the proportion of patients with
      variant genotypes in this population is important since Hispanic children represent a
      significant proportion of children being treated with thiopurines.

      A single 3 cc heparinized blood sample will be obtained for TPMT genotyping. The sample will
      be obtained either simultaneously with a clinical sample, at the time of an otherwise
      medically indicated intravenous catheter placement or scavenged from excess blood remaining
      following clinical laboratory testing.
