      in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients will be
      enrolled in 6 patient cohorts with a 6+3 design and a 28 day DLT period. Doses of
      relacorilant, enzalutamide will be adjusted based on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Once a
      safe dose with appropriate drug levels (PK) has been established, the cohort will be expanded
      to a total of 12 patients to refine safety and PK at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
