    
      A written informed consent will be obtained from patient's parents or guardians.
      Randomization will be obtained using computer-generated sequence. Concealment will be
      obtained using opaque envelopes.

      On arrival to the preparing room, patients will be randomized into one of the two groups:

      - NTG group or, Control group

      Ultrasound examination:

      The diameter of radial artery will be measured using a linear, high frequency probe (12 mHz)
      of Simens machine. Measurement will be obtained in the short axis plane at the point with
      maximal pulsation. The point will be marked to guide the post-intervention examination. The
      operator will be an experienced single operator blinded to the study group. Measurements will
      be obtained in both limbs at baseline (before application of NTG patch application,30
      minutes,60minutes after NTG application After induction of anesthesia, radial artery will be
      punctured by 22-g catheter by an experienced anesthetist
