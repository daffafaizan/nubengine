      effective, targeted cancer drugs are taking center stage in cancer care. Yet the
      investigators system for clinical testing of new agents has not kept pace with the revolution
      in cancer biology.

      Stratification by genotypic and phenotypic abnormalities further divides histological cancers
      into a myriad of clinically distinct subtypes. As cancer therapies become more selective, and
      the intent to treat populations and the predictability of patient presentation decrease,
      clinical trial enrollment becomes more difficult by traditional methods. A breakout solution
      is needed in clinical research methodology, to create a more efficient means of developing
      new cancer drugs in the US. Improved methods for the systematic, prospective screening of
      cancer patients are needed to identify the subsets of patients whose tumors express molecular
      markers targeted by precision therapeutics. This protocol will evaluate clinical samples of
      cancer tissue to identify the molecular abnormalities present in individual patients' cancer.
      In this context the investigators objective will be to enable physicians to more thoroughly
      characterize the molecular abnormalities underlying cancer and to connect eligible patients
      to precision treatments as part of optimal care.

      By making trials more accessible and utilizing technology wisely, it should be possible to
      match cancer patients to appropriate treatments, including clinical trials, within a
      clinically relevant timeframe to bring research opportunities into consideration for best
      clinical care.
