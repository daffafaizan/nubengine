    
      8 elderly subjects (50 to 80 years old) who live at home and had a stroke more than 9 months
      prior to participation, who may also suffer from mild cognitive impairments and may be
      depressed, will be recruited. Their 8 caregivers will also be recruited at Kessler
      Foundation.

      Participants will train on the BrightBrainer system for 4 weeks in their home, doing a total
      of 20 rehabilitation sessions. Sessions will consist of playing therapeutic games using both
      the impaired and unimpaired arms. Sessions will progress in duration from 20 minutes to 40
      minutes of actual play. Before and after the 4 weeks home therapy, participants will travel
      to the Kessler Foundation (West Orange, NJ) and undergo standardized motor, cognitive, and
      emotive clinical evaluations.
