      I. To determine the effect of different doses of hydroxychloroquine on markers of autophagy
      in prostate tumor.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the distribution of autophagic activity within prostate cancer tissue.

      II. To determine the utility of beclin-1 as a marker of autophagic activity. III. To assess
      markers of apoptosis in tumor tissue. IV. To perform deep-sequencing on prostate tissue
      obtained at the time of surgery.

      V. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a biochemical endpoint of clinical activity.

      VI. To determine the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in pre- and post-treatment
      blood samples.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (PLANNING PROSTATECTOMY): Patients in Group I are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14 days and then
      undergo prostatectomy.

      ARM II: Patients receive a higher dose of hydroxychloroquine PO thrice daily (TID) for 14
      days and then undergo prostatectomy.

      GROUP II (ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE): Patients receive hydroxychloroquine PO QD. Treatment
      continues until the beginning of local therapy or for up to 1 year.
