      follow up)

      Method: Two phases, corresponding to Summer and Winter, respectively, of cross-sectional
      telephone survey on the Hong Kong general population using a structured questionnaire to
      collect information on the choice primary care doctors, illness rates, primary care service
      utilization rates and self-reported process and outcomes of consultations. A longitudinal
      study for 12 weeks was carried out on a sub-sample of the cross-sectional study subjects to
      collect data to cross-validate cross-sectional data. Univariate and multivariate regression
      analyses were used to determine whether there was any difference in service utilization
      rates, process and outcomes among people using different types of primary care doctors.
