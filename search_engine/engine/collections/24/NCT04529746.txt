      Wade, 2006) was adapted to directly discuss diversity within cultural appearance ideals
      (including race, gender identity, sexuality, ability, and age) and the individual and
      collective impact of pursuing exclusive appearance norms.

      The feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the EVERYbody Project was assessed in an
      initial randomized-controlled trial. College students within a university in the Pacific
      Northwest United States were invited to participate in programming (universal intervention
      target).

      Professional delivery of the two-session EVERYbody Project was compared to a waitlist control
      condition. Intervention groups were facilitated by one "expert" (faculty or staff with body
      image expertise) and two college student co-facilitators. Mixed methods assessment included a
      comparison of changes in quantitative eating disorder risk factor outcomes across
      randomization conditions and among students with marginalized identities at pre-intervention,
      post-intervention, and one-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews assessed the impact of the
      program on participants with marginalized identities. Feasibility and acceptability of the
      program was assessed to evaluate the appropriateness of the EVERYbody Project within
      universal college student audiences.
