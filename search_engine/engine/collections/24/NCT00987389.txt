    
      Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are
      syndromes of primary systemic vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies
      (ANCA). Together, these syndromes are grouped as ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (AAV).

      Plasma exchange, a method of rapidly removing potentially pathogenic ANCA and other mediators
      of inflammation and coagulation, has shown promise as an adjunctive therapy in AAV to improve
      early disease control and improve rates of renal recovery in severe disease. Glucocorticoids
      (steroids) are a standard of care in the treatment of AAV. High doses of glucocorticoids
      early in disease, although reduce disease activity due to their anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive properties, also increase the risk of infection, particularly in the
      elderly and in the presence of uremia. There is no randomized trial data to guide
      glucocorticoids dosing.

      Patients with severe new or relapsing AAV and pulmonary hemorrhage and/or renal disease will
      be eligible for this trial.

      Subjects participating in this study will be randomized to receive one of the following
      groups;

        1. Plasma exchange - 7 exchanges and, either standard or low-dose glucocorticoids or

        2. No plasma exchange and, either standard or low-dose glucocorticoids

      All studies will receive standard remission-induction therapy with either cyclophosphamide or
      rituximab.
