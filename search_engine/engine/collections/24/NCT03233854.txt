    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of producing CD19/CD22-CAR T cells meeting the established
      release criteria.

      II. Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR T cells
      that meet established release specifications in adults with hematologic malignancies
      following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine) conditioning regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the ability of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells to mediate clinical activity in adults with
      B cell malignancies.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the frequency of CD22+ expression on lymphoma cells, and determine site density
      when possible.

      II. Analyze alterations in early B cell development induced by immune pressure exerted via
      CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.

      III. Evaluate whether subjects receiving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells relapse with loss or
      diminished expression of CD19 and/or CD22, when feasible.

      IV. Measure persistence of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells in the blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF), and explore correlations between anti CD19/CD22-CAR T cell properties and CAR T
      cell efficacy and persistence.

      V. Establish the utility of chromatin structure and epigenomic technology to characterize CAR
      T cell therapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -3. Patients then receive CD19/CD22-CAR T cells IV
      over 10-20 minutes on day 0. Patients that benefited from the first dose of CD19/CD22-CAR T
      cells, had no unacceptable side effects, and have enough cells left over may receive 2 or 3
      additional doses of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up daily until day 14, twice per
      week until day 28, at 2 months, at 3 months, every 3 months until month 12, every 6-12 months
      up to year 5, and then annually for years 6-15.
