    
      Interventions (2 groups): Experimental group (TENS group): the treatment will consist of
      stimulation of the leg (frequency of 10 Hz, Biphasic, with a pulse width of 200 µs, maximal
      intensity below motor threshold), 45 minutes per day, in the morning before the exercise
      rehabilitation programme, for 3 weeks, 5 days per week. Control group (group SHAM): the
      stimulation placebo will be delivered according to the same modalities as for the TENS group
      but with a voltage level that vanishes automatically after 10 seconds of stimulation.

      15 days of interventions (TENS or SHAM) between J0 and J23, End of study for patient at
      J24-J25, two days for the last analyses who are the same of inclusion's visit J0.

      Primary outcome: walking distance (metres) measured on a treadmill with a standardized
      protocol. Secondary outcomes: transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) measured during a
      Strandness exercise test, peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) (ml.min.kg-1), endothelial function
      (EndoPAT®), ankle-brachial pressure index, body mass index, lipid profile (LDL-C, HDL-C,
      Triglycerides), fasting glycaemia, HbA1c, WELCH questionnaire.
