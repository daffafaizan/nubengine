      oscillometric cuffs, the need for a continuous cuffless alternative for blood pressure home
      monitoring at a global scale is paramount. Such a device would not only improve the global
      control of blood pressure, but more generally, it could have a larger social impact by
      improving the comfort and reducing the stress for the clinical management of hypertensive
      patients.

      In the present study the investigators seek to investigate, as a primary purpose, to evaluate
      the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure measurements via a watch-like optical sensor and
      compare these to standard monitoring (arterial line).
