      surgery when they quit smoking at least several weeks before surgery. Nicotine replacement
      therapy (which relieves cravings for cigarettes) and support by healthcare professionals have
      been shown to help patients quit smoking, particularly when encountering a major health event
      (e.g. surgery). In addition, quitting smoking in preparation for surgery sometimes results in
      quitting for a longer period of time after surgery, giving these patients the health benefits
      of long-term smoking cessation such as reduced rates of cancer and heart disease.

      The preadmission clinic at St. Joseph's Health Care, London, Ontario, is assessing how
      effective a new 'Stop Smoking' program is for patients preparing for surgery. The program
      will include brief counselling in the clinic, smoking cessation brochures, six weeks of free
      transdermal nicotine replacement therapy and a referral to the Canadian Cancer Society's
      Smokers' Helpline telephone advice line. Patients that are smokers and preparing for their
      elective surgery will be invited to join the study, then be assigned to a group that either
      participates in the program or not. These groups will then be compared in terms of success at
      quitting smoking and complication rates around the time of surgery.
