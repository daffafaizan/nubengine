        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck treated with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil.

        -  Determine response (unconfirmed, confirmed, complete, and partial) and time to treatment
           failure in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by cisplatin IV over 30 minutes
      on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1-4. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response
      (CR) receive 3 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
