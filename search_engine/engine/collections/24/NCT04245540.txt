      encapsulated Tabebuia avellanedae every day for 2 months, as well as effects of the treatment
      on quality of life, pain intensity, and pain interference, in 12 generally healthy women aged
      18-45 with PDM. Outcomes of this study include questionnaires to evaluate: safety and
      tolerability using standardized adverse events scales (primary); participant reported
      measurements of quality of life, pain intensity, and pain interference around menses
      collected on validated instruments (secondary); and blood concentration of PGE2 and
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (tertiary). The protocol followed the SPIRIT guidelines
      and fulfilled the SPIRIT checklist.
