        -  Determine the complete and overall response rate in patients with B-cell chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia treated with rituximab and sargramostim (GM-CSF).

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on CD20 antigen expression and soluble CD20 levels
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease status

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 4, 11, 18, and 25 and sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      subcutaneously on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 36, 38, 40,
      43, 45, 47, 50, 52, and 54 (course 1). Patients with responding disease may receive an
      additional course of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 130 patients will be accrued for this study.
