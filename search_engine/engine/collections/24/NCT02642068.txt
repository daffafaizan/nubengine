    
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common (3-10%), early-onset, clinically
      and genetically heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder with lifelong neuropsychological
      deficits. Despite extensive research in adult ADHD in western countries, there has been no
      published data about adult ADHD in Taiwan except the PI's and colleagues' previous works on
      pharmacotherapy in adults with ADHD and only few endophenotype studies based on adults with
      ADHD in the world. The ultimate goals of this 5-year project are to identify which
      neuropsychological, functional and structural connectivity, and neurophysiological variables
      can be effective endophenotypes (biomarkers) for ADHD based on unaffected sibling (1st-3rd
      years) and follow-up (4th-5th years) designs. With the accomplishment of the following study
      goals, this study will be the first study on the topics of neuroimaging and
      neurophysiological endophenotypes on adult ADHD using advanced imaging techniques (i.e.,
      Tract-based autonomic analysis, TBAA) and comprehensive clinical and neurocognitive data.
      This proposal has one primary aim and four secondary aims:

      Primary Aim:

        1. To validate structural (assessed by TBAA using diffusing spectrum imaging, DSI) and
           functional connectivity (assessed by resting-state fMRI) in frontostriatal,
           frontoparietal and other circuitries, and neurophysiological functions (assessed by
           stop-signal event-related potential [ERP]: N2, P3, ERN, Pe) as effective imaging
           endophenotypes by demonstrating the intermediate position of unaffected siblings between
           ADHD probands, and age-, sex-, handedness-, and IQ-matched adult neurotypical and
           association with DAT1 and NET (SLC6A2) variants;

           Secondary Aims:

        2. To validate the executive functions (EF), sustained attention (SA), intraindividual
           variability (IIV), visual-spatial memory (VM) as effective neurocognitive endophenotypes
           by demonstrating the intermediate position of unaffected siblings between ADHD probands,
           and adult neurotypical;

        3. To examine the developmental trajectory and stability of neuropsychological functions
           and structural and functional connectivity from childhood to adolescence and young
           adulthood;

        4. To correlate the data from structural (morphometric, cortical thickness, gyrification,
           fiber tract integrity) and functional connectivity (rsfMRI), neuropsychology (Executive
           function, visual-spatial memory, sustained attention, variability), neurophysiology
           (Stop-signal ERP) and ADHD core symptoms stratifying by the presence of ADHD, presence
           of DAT1 and NET (SLC6A2) variants, proband-unaffected sibling dyads, and different
           developmental stages.
