      top of the scleral flap and beneath the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule at the end of
      trabeculectomy. The pores in the scaffold matrix range from 20 to 200Âµm, a size that is
      suitable for fibroblasts to grow randomly, through the body of the matrix without causing
      scarring. The space occupied by the collagen matrix scaffold creates room for the development
      of a filtration bleb. Immediately after implantation, the collagen matrix is absorbed with
      the aqueous humor that brings a certain pressure press on the top of the scleral flap which
      makes the dynamic balance for the aqueous system keep the IOP in the right side. The collagen
      matrix is bio-degraded within 90 days and will leave a physiologic space for the filtration
      bleb to facilitate control of intraocular pressure (IOP).
