      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) with advanced solid tumors
      (including central nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic
      disorders that harbor genetic alterations in the FGFR1/2/3/4 pathway.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with JNJ-42756493
      (erdafitinib) with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or
      histiocytic disorders that harbor genetic alterations in the FGFR1/2/3/4.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in children
      with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      III. To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib)
      in children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erdafitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
