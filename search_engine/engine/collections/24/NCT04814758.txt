      3T MR scanner or 1.5T MR scanner, using 8-channel body coil. A standard MRI study of the
      abdomen with contrast enhancement is performed. DWI (diffusion weighted) images are included
      in the standard investigation package and consist of diffusion maps (DWI 3b) with 3 b-factors
      (50; 600; 800 or others, optional). Then, using Philips workstation (ISP 9.0, Philips,
      Netherlands), DWI mapping and ADC values collection (mm2/s) are performed. The placement of
      region of interest (ROI) is selected in the kidney mass in a solid and cystic area with a
      size up to 100 mm2. The values are entered in the table due to the stage of the chemotherapy.

      After the preoperative abdomen MRI, a surgical treatment is performed. Histological material
      is directed to the pathologist, who carried out the histological staging by the malignancy
      degree (low, intermediate, high). The data is entered into the database and the relationship
      between ADC values and histological degrees of malignancy of nephroblastoma is investigated.
