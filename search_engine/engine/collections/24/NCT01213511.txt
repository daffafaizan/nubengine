      activation of inflammatory systemic response can result in clinically relevant organ
      dysfunction. Regarding the central nervous system, prolonged hypoperfusion and
      microembolization during conventional CPB have been related to postoperative neurologic
      impairment with an incidence varying from 30% to 60%. This clinical scenario covers a
      spectrum from a transient subtle cognitive dysfunction to a permanent stroke. Postoperative
      cognitive decline (POCD) is characterized as impairment in attention, cognition, recognition,
      orientation, memory, and learning. It may result in prolonged hospitalization, increased
      morbidity and mortality, while it has an adverse impact on quality of life after surgery.

      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a continuous and noninvasive monitoring of
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). Recent studies have shown a significant
      relationship between intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation, indicative of cerebral
      ischemia, and early POCD in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting (CABG) with
      conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC). In an attempt to reduce CPB-inherent side
      effects, a minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) system was developed and it is evaluated
      in clinical practice. The aim of this pilot study was to define whether there is a difference
      in early postoperative neurocognitive functioning between patients being operated for CABG on
      MECC versus CECC systems as well as whether this can be attributed to improved cerebral
      perfusion intraoperatively.
