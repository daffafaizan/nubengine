      injury. Vision can be compromised because of local injury to one or both optic nerves,
      diffuse brain injury, and/or limitation in eye movements because of dysfunction of cranial
      nerves. These typical injuries may compromise any of the neural pathways that subserve
      afferent or efferent visual function. Self-reports of vision loss include diplopia, visual
      field loss, light sensitivity, reading problems and contrast sensitivity (color and
      luminance) loss. This project will pursue the following aims: 1) Identify the relationship
      between functional vision loss in everyday vision tasks (reading, visual search, way finding)
      and the characteristics of potential visual impairment (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity,
      visual fields, stereoacuity, eye movement disorders) associated with TBI; and 2) Determine
      the ability of the vision rehabilitation interventions (both monotherapy and combination
      therapy) to improve functional vision outcome measures that reflect everyday visual tasks.
      The vision rehabilitation interventions incorporated into this study will be Vision
      Restoration Therapy, NVT Eye Scanning Therapy, and standard Eccentric Viewing Training. These
      therapies are rehabilitative interventions prescribed for Veterans in Polytrauma
      Rehabilitation Centers, Blind Rehabilitation Centers, and advocated for VA Medical Center TBI
      clinics.
