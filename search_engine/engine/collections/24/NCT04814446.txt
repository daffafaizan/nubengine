      warts in case reports and some case series. Very recently, the Journal of the American
      Academy of Dermatology (JAAD)-the journal with the highest impact factor in the
      dermatological field- has published a review of all the cases reported in the scientific
      literature. The authors were strongly in favor of the use of the vaccine in case of
      difficult-to-treat warts and have highlighted the need for clinical trials. In the
      literature, 80 patients have been described with cutaneous warts treated by qHPV or nHPV with
      more than 50% of efficacy.Our hypothesis is that vaccination by nonavalent vaccine against
      HPV could lead to a complete resolution of difficult-to-treat palmo-plantar warts patients of
      more than 15 years and 3 months of age.
