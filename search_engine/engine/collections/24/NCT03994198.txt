      loads) to improve performance. In study 1, the investigators will determine whether 4-min and
      20-min time trials are repeatable and whether they (individually or collectively) relate to
      1-hour time trial performance. For Study 2, the investigators propose that proper nutrition
      (with a focus on the dose, timing, and quality of protein) can help mitigate the stress of
      overreaching, which will improve performance. Thus, the investigators will compare the
      effects of two diets that differ in terms of protein servings (dose, timing, quality). In
      Study 2, skeletal muscle biopsies will be collected to determine how dietary protein
      intervention impacts the quality and quantity of skeletal muscle mitochondria in response to
      intense training.

      For study 1, the objective is to determine the reliability and validity of 4-min and 20-min
      time trial performance (mean power output).

      For study 2, the objective is to (1) determine whether following an optimal protein diet
      during a period of intense training will, relative to a typical diet: (1) improve measures of
      exercise performance, (2) improve sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, and immune
      function, (3) improve the quality and quantity of skeletal muscle mitochondria.

      Study 1 is a reliability and validity experiment designed to assess the key outcome measure
      in study 2.

      Study 2 is a randomized, crossover study. Participants will, in a randomized order, complete
      both conditions, separated by a 4-day washout period.
