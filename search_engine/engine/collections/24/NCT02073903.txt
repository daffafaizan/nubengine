      by the medicine teams at MSKCC. It is expected that during that time they will care for at
      least 20 LEP patients who meet our inclusion criteria. There are no specific target numbers
      for any of the included languages. During the following 5-6 weeks, the phones will be
      installed by the 10 house-staff teams and approximately an additional 20 LEP patients who
      meet the protocol inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Therefore, in the first half of this
      study about 20 LEP patients and 40 practitioners (two practitioners per LEP patient) will
      provide data and the same numbers will account for the second half of the study after the
      intervention is instituted. There will be no randomization of patients or physicians. The
      only data that will be analyzed are those questions from the surveys to assess communication
      effectiveness with LEP patients. The number of patients who are interviewed will depend on
      MSKCC inpatient census at the time of study.
