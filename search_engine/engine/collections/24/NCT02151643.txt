      phosphate binding agents. The available clinical and non clinical evidence suggests that PT20
      binds phosphate and prevents its uptake more efficiently than other phosphate binding drugs
      and may therefore either reduce the pill burden associated with controlling phosphate levels,
      or result in lower phosphate levels with the same pill burden.

      The this study is the first to investigate the efficacy and safety of PT20 in subjects with
      dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD).
