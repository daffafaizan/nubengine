      using standardized educational and communication tools to assist in communication of genetic
      test results to family members, 2) utility of the communication tool, and 3) the impact of a
      patient focused information sheet on the knowledge of genetic testing in women who attend the
      women's oncology clinic. Genetic counseling is recommended for all women with a diagnosis of
      ovarian cancer, most patients with pre-menopausal diagnosis of breast cancer, and in younger
      women with uterine or other gynecologic malignancies. Women with a diagnosis of breast or
      gynecologic cancer who elect to undergo genetic testing will be approached to participate in
      this study. If they consent, they will be provided with two information handouts (FORCE
      sharing worksheets) and family letter template. Participants will complete a baseline
      knowledge survey prior to receipt of these materials. At a second visit, they will complete
      the knowledge survey again. Knowledge surveys will be scored and pre and post test scores
      will be compared with a paired t-test. Feasibility will be assessed by tracking the number of
      patients approached to participate, the number who sign consents, and the number who complete
      the study.
