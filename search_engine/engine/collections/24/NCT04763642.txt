      surgical procedures because of its minimally invasive nature and number of benefits such as
      reducing postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and earlier return to work. Current
      advances in technological innovation and surgical strategies have made surgical procedures on
      the pancreas a routine practice. However, the use of new surgical techniques in pancreatic
      surgery has been slow due to the complexity of the operations and the steep learning curve
      required for their use. For example, minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomies (MIPD) have
      not yet become widespread. Due to these interventions have a complex reconstructive stage
      MIPD are still performed in a very few centers by specialized surgeons.

      Although laparoscopic PD was first described in 1994 and the robotic approach in 2003, MIPD
      still account for less than 14% of all DPE cases. The multicenter randomized controlled trial
      (LEOPARD-2) for the first time compared laparoscopic and open pancreatoduodenectomy for
      pancreatic or periampullary tumors. The study that involved 99 patients did not reveal the
      superiority of laparoscopic PD (LPD) and provided an estimated mortality of 6%; 5 patients
      died in the laparoscopy group and 1 patient died in the group open PD. The trial was stopped
      early due to high mortality in the migratory invasive interventions group. Therefore,
      advantages of minimally invasive procedures for removal of pancreato-biliary zone tumors
      remain controversial.

      In our study, we analyzed perioperative surgical outcomes and short-term survival outcomes in
      patients undergoing MIPD, including LPD and robotic PD (RPD), as well as "open" proximal
      pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD).
