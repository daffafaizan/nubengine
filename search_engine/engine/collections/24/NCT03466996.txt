      group. Randomization will be performed using computer software with 1:1 group allocation. We
      anticipate 26 participants in each group.

      The control group will receive the current standard of care transition program which includes
      goal-setting at their annual Multidisciplinary Spina Bifida Clinic visit. Additionally, they
      will receive encouragement e-mail and text messages. These messages will be sent at 2 weeks,
      3 months, 6 months, and 9 months from last in-person appointment.

      The intervention group will participate in face-to-face video telemedicine visits, in
      addition to routine yearly visits to the Spina Bifida Clinic. These 30-minute visits will
      occur at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 9 months from last in-person clinic appointment. The
      visits will consist of structured counseling using a plan-do-study-act cycle approach to
      incrementally adopt elements of a well-planned transition. Using qualitative notes from each
      session, I hypothesize that I will be able to identify common themes or challenges across
      patients and develop adjunctive education, support, and monitoring tools for patients and
      families in transition. I will collaborate with experts from orthopedic surgery, physical
      medicine and rehabilitation, urology, neurosurgery, nutrition, and psychology to develop
      content for educational tools.
