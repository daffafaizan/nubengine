      weight-bearing and a group of complex movements during ordinary life activities and even in
      vigorous sports making it susceptible to different traumatic injuries.Knee pain is considered
      as one of the most common complaints of patients presenting to clinical practitioners.There
      are many structures within the knee which can cause pain. By far, one of the most common
      causes of knee pain is a meniscus tear.The meniscus is the most important cushion in the
      knee; It plays an important bio mechanical role in axial load distribution of the knees. If
      the meniscus is injured and the cushioning is lost, arthritis and pain can occur.Menisci can
      tear due to traumatic injury or degenerative wear, meniscal root tears are a type of meniscal
      tear in the knee where the tear extends to either the anterior or posterior meniscal root
      attachment to the central tibial plateau. They often tend to be radial tears extending into
      the root.The medial meniscal posterior root tear can occur especially in middle-aged or older
      patients who have a single event of posteromedial painful popping sensation during light
      activities.Magnetic resonance imaging is well established as the best imaging modality for
      evaluating a patient with suspected meniscal pathology, involving the medial meniscal
      posterior horn root.In recent years, posterior meniscal root tears have received increasing
      attention in both Arthroscopic and Magnetic resonance study. All sequences of Magnetic
      resonance imaging should be reviewed, but T2 weighted coronal sections should provide the
      best visualization of the posterior roots. The Magnetic resonance findings of a medial
      meniscal posterior radial root tear are shortening or absence of the root (ghost sign) on
      sagittal images and a vertical fluid cleft with truncation sign and features of meniscal
      extrusion on coronal images.

      It is very important to avoid errors in diagnosing meniscal root tears. So interpreting
      Magnetic resonance examinations of the knee need to be aware of the attachments of the
      menisci and to understand the normal variations in meniscal anatomy that may resemble a
      meniscal tear.

      Tears of the meniscal root are relatively uncommon, occurring in 2.2% - 9.8% of patients
      undergoing Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee.However, it is important that these tears
      be diagnosed as several complications of meniscal root tear, including meniscal extrusion,
      secondary osteoarthritis, and subchondral insufficiency fracture.
