    
      Main objective To investigate the effects of soluble corn fiber (SCF) supplementation on bone
      mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in pre-pubertal boys and girls.

      Secondary objectives

      The secondary objectives are:

      To investigate changes in bone formation and bone resorption markers in response to soluble
      corn fiber supplementation in the diet of prepubertal boys and girls consuming adequate
      calcium intake vs placebo To investigate changes in body composition in response to soluble
      corn fiber supplementation in the diet of prepubertal boys and girls consuming adequate
      calcium intake vs placebo

      Hypothesis Soluble corn fiber would lead to improved BMC and BMD accrual in pre-pubertal
      children compared to placebo.

      Study design The proposed study is a double blind, randomized, single center, parallel design
      trial

      Duration of study The duration of the study intervention would be 12 months
