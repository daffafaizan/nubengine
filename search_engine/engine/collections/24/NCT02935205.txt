      I. To assess the toxicity of indomethacin and enzalutamide when given in combination, and to
      determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response that is defined as a 50% or more
      reduction from the baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response as determined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
      criteria (PCWG2).

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with indomethacin and
      enzalutamide.

      III. To evaluate molecular correlatives for patient response and outcomes through the
      analysis of patient baseline tumor specimens (diagnostic biopsy) along with serial blood
      specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and indomethacin PO twice daily
      (BID) or QD. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
