      pathogenesis. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no definitive evidence to date
      conclusively demonstrating a link. The only way to test this hypothesis is to have access to
      the intestinal tissue of T1D patients at very early stages when beta-islet cell destruction
      is still ongoing. Furthermore, to prepare for large prospective studies it is critical to
      determine whether there is a peripheral blood signature for intestinal inflammation. Finally,
      because enteroviral infections have been implicated in T1D pathogenesis, this study provides
      a unique opportunity to determine whether there is a dysregulated response to innate stimuli
      associated with viral infections and whether evidence of transcriptional signatures
      indicative of viral infections in the gut is correlated with disease. Finally, we will take
      advantage of this pilot study to collect samples that can be used for microbiome, virome and
      metabolic studies.
