      obese. Obesity contributes to chronic diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease [CVD],
      hypertension, cancer, and osteoarthritis) and to escalating health care costs. Weight loss
      can have a substantial impact on reducing these conditions. Substantial efforts have been
      made in developing effective short-term weight loss programs using behavioral treatments.
      However, long-term maintenance of weight loss continues to be problematic - many individuals
      regain the weight lost within a year. Innovative intervention options are critically needed
      to help people successfully maintain weight loss and to fight the obesity epidemic.
      Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches-mind-body, energy healing, and
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches may hold great promise for helping improve the
      maintenance of weight loss.
