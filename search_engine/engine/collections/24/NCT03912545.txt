    
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The QStat Cartridge was developed to
      monitor hemostasis in patients that may experience a range of coagulopathies of various
      etiologies including fibrinolytic defects. These patients include the trauma and obstetric
      hemorrhage populations. The cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing
      different sets of reagents, which provide four measurements performed in parallel yielding
      five parameters that depict the functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This single-center, prospective, observational pilot study will evaluate the performance of
      the Quantra System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to standard coagulation tests and
      comparable measures using conventional viscoelastic testing methods.
