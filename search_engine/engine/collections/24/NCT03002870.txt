    
      Patients seen at Saint Louis University Center for Endometriosis (which has offices locations
      at St. Mary's, St. Luke's and the SLU-UMG clinic - all of which are in the SLU Epic system),
      and operated on for endometriosis, suspected endometriosis, pain and/or infertility at St.
      Mary's hospital (only).

      A preoperative questionnaire will be provided to the subject. Questions from the survey
      include information on baseline demographics, severity and type of pain, and previous medical
      and surgical history. Operative data will also be collected and analyzed.

      A post-operative questionnaire will be administered to the participants at 6 months, and then
      at regular yearly intervals after the surgery by a secure on-line process using the RedCap
      software. Improvement in quality of life and pain scores will be analyzed.

      Specimens will also be collected and stored for future testing regarding diagnosing, and/or
      staging of endometriosis, suspected endometriosis, pain and infertility.
