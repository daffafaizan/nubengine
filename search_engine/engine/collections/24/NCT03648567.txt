      immunodeficiencies, with variable clinical and immunological settings, but globally
      characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia with significant reduction of Immunoglobulin G levels,
      often associated with a decrease in Immunoglobulin A and/or Immunoglobulin M levels, coupled
      with inability to produce antibodies in response to infection and/or immunization. VCID is
      the most common primary immunodeficiency, with an estimated prevalence between 1/10,000 and
      1/50,000. With the introduction of high-dose, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulins,
      number of infections, along with morbidity and induced mortality, has declined sharply in
      recent years. Conversely, non-infectious complications, such as autoimmune manifestations,
      inflammatory bowel diseases, enteropathies, hepatitis, lung disease and lymphoproliferation
      (up to lymphoma), increased considerably, reaching 70% of patients.

      Granulomatous Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease is a non-infectious complication that can
      occur during the evolution of VCID and which is usually the pulmonary manifestation of a
      systemic polyclonal lymphoproliferative disease. GLILD contained both granulomatous and
      lymphoproliferative histopathologic patterns such as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia ,
      follicular bronchiolitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia. In recent series, approximately 8 to 22%
      of patients develop GLILD in VCID, and this complication is associated with increased
      mortality.

      Although there are now more studies conducted in the adult population, those in the pediatric
      population are only currently case report. To the best of our knowledge, very little data is
      available on this specific lung disease in the pediatric and young adults population.
