      disease (ESRD). The average waiting time for subjects to receive a "deceased donor" kidney
      transplant is 3-5 years. Currently, there are about 60,000 subjects on the national waiting
      list, and about 13,000-14,000 kidney transplants are performed each year. Approximately, 25%
      of subjects on the waiting list are "highly sensitized", meaning that they have natural
      proteins (antibodies) that aggressively protect their bodies from the invasion of foreign
      proteins. These individuals often have a difficult time accepting transplanted kidneys. The
      purpose of this study is to identify subjects who are highly sensitized with these
      antibodies, and treat them in such a way, that it may become possible to transplant kidneys
      into them. Drugs like atorvastatin (Lipitor) may decrease the levels of these anti-bodies and
      increase the possibility of these subjects to receive a kidney transplant. This research
      study is being done because currently, there are very limited and cumbersome treatment
      options to address this issue, subjects who are highly sensitized with antibodies, may
      unfortunately wait for a very long time or may never get transplanted.
