      contribute to thromboembolic complications and coagulation activation during ECMO therapy.
      Retrospective data suggest that treatment with PGE1 may serve beneficial by reducing the
      amount of heparin needed for inhibition of coagulation activation, and by reducing the
      thromboembolic risk without increasing the risk of bleeding.

      Inhibition of platelets via PGE1 (Alprostadil) may be interesting in this setting, because,
      in contrast to other platelet inhibitors, it has a very short half-life and platelets remain
      susceptible for activation by more potent agonists (i.e. thrombin, ADP). Thus, although
      reducing the contribution of platelets to coagulation activation, it may not affect safety of
      participating subjects.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial will investigate whether treatment of
      patients with ECMO therapy proves beneficial.
