      on the TLC diet and a 6 week washout on the TLC diet between control and intervention
      periods. Forty subjects with verified and stable coronary artery disease will be enrolled in
      the study. The control intervention involved maintaining a steady TLC diet without nuts which
      will be monitored with counseling and dietary assessments. The almond intervention involved
      consuming 3 oz. of almonds per day and adjusting lipid intake to remain isocaloric with the
      TLC diet alone. Again subjects will be monitored with counseling and dietary assessments.

      At the beginning and end of each intervention period subjects will be tested for endothelial
      function using flow mediated dilation and blood and urine samples will be collected for
      biochemical analysis for markers of inflammation, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress.
