      of administration of Dexmedetomidine infusion at a dose of 0.5 Âµg/kg/h without loading dose
      during elective supratentorial craniotomy under GA. The investigators will compare
      intraoperative hemodynamics in both groups, intraoperative analgesic consumption,
      intraoperative blood loss, postoperative sedation scores, intraoperative need for rescue
      hypotensive agents, and finally the satisfaction of surgeons.

      To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate the effect of Dexmedetomidine
      infusion without loading dose in elective supratentorial craniotomy
