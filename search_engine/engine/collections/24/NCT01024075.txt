      of an endoscopic sinus surgery procedure. Sinufoam prevents scarring and promotes healing of
      the sinonasal mucosa. Sinufoam is commonly mixed with saline, which enables it to be
      liquefied and gently placed into the ethmoid cavity. Recent practice of adding Dexamethasone
      to the sinufoam mixture has been hypothesized to promote healing by reducing chronic
      inflammation associated with CRS. Using topical dexamethasone mixed into the Sinufoam
      solution may improve patient care by preventing the systemic effects associated with
      post-operative systemic steroid use.
