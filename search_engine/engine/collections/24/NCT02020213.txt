      as probable pulmonary Aspergillus infection or proven pulmonary Aspergillus infection. If
      they have poor response to current thought effective agent for pulmonary Aspergillus (eg,
      amphotericin B, Voriconazole, itraconazole) 2 weeks, then they can choose to receive
      Posaconazole as salvage therapy in our study. However, our study wants to quantification of
      therapeutic response, so the enrolled patient should be agree to let us check serum
      galactomannan level at beginning and per 2 weeks. They also should be receive chest CT in the
      beginning and in the end of posaconazole treatment. The rule out timing is evaluated by
      clinical doctors (hematology department) per 2 weeks, if posaconazole has poor effect to
      their disease, the clinical doctors can decided to terminate posaconazole administration.
      Another effective agent will be given when posaconazole fails.
