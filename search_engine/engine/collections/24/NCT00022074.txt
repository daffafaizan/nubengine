        -  Compare the effectiveness and side effects of 2 different doses of gabapentin vs placebo
           for the control of hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms in women with breast cancer.

        -  Compare quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center and duration of hot flash symptoms (less
      than 9 months vs 9 or more months). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times a day.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral gabapentin at a low dose 3 times a day.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral gabapentin as in arm II for 3 days and then at a high
           dose 3 times a day.

      Treatment on all arms continues for 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. After
      week 8, patients may receive open-label gabapentin at the discretion of their physicians.

      Hot flashes are assessed at baseline and then during weeks 3 and 7 of the study.

      Quality of life, anxiety, and depression are assessed at baseline and then at weeks 4 and 8.

      Patients are followed at week 12.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 408 patients (136 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 18 months.
