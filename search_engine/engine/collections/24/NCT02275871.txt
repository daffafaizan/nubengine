      MRI in screening for breast cancer in people who are at higher risk for developing breast
      cancer.

      Standard screening mammograms can miss breast cancers due to its inability to "see through"
      dense breast tissue. For this reason, women at increased risk for the development of breast
      cancer often undergo additional screening beyond conventional mammography with magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Although screening MRI is very sensitive for finding breast cancer,
      it also finds many areas that are benign (not cancer). The only way to know which is the
      cancer is to perform a biopsy, which contributes to patient anxiety and leads to many
      unnecessary biopsies.

      In the preliminary studies performed in women already diagnosed with breast cancer, contrast
      enhanced mammography was shown to have a similar sensitivity for finding primary breast
      cancer but detected fewer of the benign findings which would result in fewer unnecessary
      biopsies. It is also a faster and less expensive exam compared to MRI. Contrast mammography
      was FDA approved in 2011 and is used now as a tool to help work-up abnormalities seen on
      standard mammography and ultrasound.

      We are now studying to see if contrast enhanced mammography will also be a beneficial tool in
      the screening setting to screen high risk patients for breast cancer.
