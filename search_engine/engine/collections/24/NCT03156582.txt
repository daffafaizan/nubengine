      and cure the underlying liver disease. But the success of liver transplantation depends on
      the tumour load; patients with extensive disease have very poor outcomes, whereas most
      patients with small tumours can be curred. This had to be taken into account in the context
      of worldwide organ shortage.

      That is why in 1996 Mazzaferro et al. have reported Milan criteria limiting access to liver
      transplantation for patients with a single tumor ≤ 5 cm or ≤ 3 tumors ≤ 3 cm without tumor
      invasion or metastasis.

      However, in France, these criteria were not respected in about 30% of cases, because they
      were considered too restrictive and unadapted, with good overall results. This led to the
      possibility of new criteria definition. Because the value of alpha-foeto-protein was known as
      a good predictor of tumor aggressivity, a new score emerged in 2012, integrating blocking
      α-fetoprotein thresholds while allowing an increased number and size of tumors. After
      validation of this score, the Biomedicine Agency decided to use this α-fetoprotein score, to
      make the selection of patients allowed to be transplanted since March 2013.

      In this multicentric retrospective comparative study The investigators first want to assess
      if this new score based on imaging is also respected at the explant analysis. Our secondary
      outcomes are to compare the amount of dropped out patients because of this score, the rate of
      tumoral relapse, the overall survival and the disease free survival.

      The investigators aim at collecting the data of 562 patients registered for Liver
      Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma between 2011/03/01 and 2014/03/01 in 5 centres:
      Paul Brousse (Paris), Montpellier, Lille, Lyon and Grenoble.
