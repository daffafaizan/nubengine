      behavioural response to hypothermia is the most powerful protective tool, more effective than
      any autonomic response, and is obviously removed in the operative setting. Anesthesia alters
      thermoregulation by profoundly changing the thresholds for vasoconstriction and shivering,
      making patients vulnerable to the adverse outcomes related to mild hypothermia. Inadvertent
      postoperative hypothermia can occur in up to 70% of surgical patients. It is defined as a
      core temperature below 36°C (96.8°F). The aim of this study was to determine if prewarming
      with an active warming system for 20 minutes preoperatively could prevent postoperative
      inadvertent hypothermia.
