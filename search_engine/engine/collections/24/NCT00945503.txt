      primary aim of this study is to describe the relationship between plasma concentrations and
      brain occupancy of GSK1018921 over time. Up to 22 healthy volunteers will be administered
      single doses of GSK1018921 in order to obtain 12 evaluable complete data sets of occupancy
      estimates.
