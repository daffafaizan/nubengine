      the application of a negative pressure (void) in the wound bed.

      Negative pressure therapy is based on the application of a subatmospheric pressure in the
      wound bed to trigger a whole series of mechanisms, and that to a greater or lesser degree,
      and in a synergistic manner, act by creating or improving the conditions for the healing
      process to develop (negative pressure therapy).

      All these mechanisms act by diminishing the possibility of creating an appropriate medium for
      the growth of pathogenic germs.

      Today, negative pressure therapy is also used to create ideal conditions in surgical wounds
      to prevent or reduce the risk of local complications, is what we call incisional negative
      pressure therapy.
