      water. We will test the hypothesis that water ingestion will increase the systemic vascular
      resistance. This study will occur in patients status post cardiac transplantation during
      their clinical right heart catheterizations. Invasive hemodynamics including cardiac outputs
      and plasma norepinephrine levels will be measured before and 30 min after the water
      ingestion.
