      postmenopausal HR positive early breast cancer patients who experience grade 2-3
      arthralgia-myalgia while on anastrozole, resulting in the discontinuation of anastrozole.
      After a 2-3 week period without any aromatase inhibitor treatment, eligible patients will
      initiate letrozole treatment at a dose of 2.5mg per day for a duration of 24 weeks. If a
      patient has breast cancer recurrence or is intolerant to letrozole during the 24 week period,
      the drug will be discontinued.
