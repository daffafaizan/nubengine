      many complex diseases. However, the genetic risk factors for two forms of acquired heart
      disease that are particularly common in Africa - rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and
      endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) remains unknown. In this application, we propose to evaluate
      genetic risk factors for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF). A
      number of factors should facilitate the identification of genetic risk variants underlying
      the two conditions. First, both forms of acquired heart disease are endemic to sub-Saharan
      Africa (SSA). Second, affected patients and those who do not develop the conditions share a
      common environment. Finally, the availability of high density SNP arrays to capture common
      and rare variation makes the characterization of genomic variation better than ever. Patients
      will be enrolled at the Uganda Heart Institute in Kampala, Uganda, and at the College of
      Medicine, University of Lagos, Nigeria, with the potential to include other African sites.
      Genomic studies will be done at the NIH.
