    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, 4-treatment and 4-period crossover study conducted in a
      school laboratory environment to evaluate the hour-by-hour behavioral instrument scores and
      hour-by-hour PK of 3 different extended-release MPH formulations as well as placebo in
      children with ADHD. The complete study consists of three periods: Screening, Dose Titration
      and Double-Blind Crossover in a Laboratory Classroom.

      The double-blind phase will consist of four periods (or four weeks): each week will consist
      of blinded administration with one of the three active methylphenidate hydrochloride
      treatments or placebo from Sunday through Saturday. On the last day of each period
      (Saturday), study participants will be evaluated in a laboratory classroom setting. On
      Saturdays, the blinded doses of each study drug will be administered at the school site by
      study staff on the morning of the test laboratory classroom day. On the other days, the
      medication will be taken in the morning at home.
