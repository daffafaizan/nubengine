      neovascular process seen with diabetic retinopathy.2-6 Photocoagulative damage also damages
      the nerve fiber layer in the process. Since this should theoretically be associated with loss
      of nerve fibers it is expected to manifest as changes in optic nerve head cupping. There is
      no available literature to support this hypothesis. In fact the only available study done of
      the subject refuted the hypothesis.7 The study had a retrospective design and was done before
      any of the current technology to evaluate optic nerve head morphology was available.

      Patients with concurrent glaucoma and diabetes often undergo panretinal photocoagulation as a
      part of their diabetes treatment. Optic disc cupping is a standard outcome measure for
      glaucoma diagnosis and progression. If PRP were to cause increased cupping, this can be a
      significant confounder in determining glaucoma progression based on optic nerve cupping. The
      findings of the study will help us determine as to how much cupping can be attributed to the
      PRP, if any at all.
