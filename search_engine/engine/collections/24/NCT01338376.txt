      Type 2 DM will be enrolled and be randomized into Structured Education Group and Conventional
      Education Group in 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both of the groups will be treated with Scilin®M30
      twice daily (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner). All the previous oral antidiabetic
      drugs (OAD(s)) will be discontinued except metformin and alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors. The
      physician will determine the starting dose (0.3 IU/kg～0.4IU/kg), as well as later changes to
      dose according to insulin titration algorithm. The treatment duration will last 16 weeks.
