      messages in response to detected PrEP ingestion via an innovative digital pill. PrEPSteps
      comprises 1) an adaptation of LifeSteps, an evidence-based medication adherence behavioral
      intervention, with smartphone-delivered booster sessions, 2) messages of contingent
      reinforcement and corrective feedback, and 3) stimulant use screening, brief assessment, and
      referral to treatment. In this K23, the investigators will first refine and inform the
      specification of PrEPSteps with a series of focus groups. The investigators will next test
      the feasibility, acceptability and potential for an effect of PrEPSteps to boost PrEP
      adherence in a pilot randomized controlled trial of men who have sex with men (MSM) with
      stimulant use. Finally, the investigators will conduct qualitative interviews among
      participants who used PrEPSteps to understand the participant response to living with the
      intervention.
