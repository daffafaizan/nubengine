    
      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the safety and tolerability including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of alvocidib when administered over a range of doses on Days
      1-3 followed by cytarabine/daunorubicin (7+3) on Days 5-11 in adults with newly diagnosed and
      previously untreated AML

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antileukemic activity of alvocidib plus 7+3
           using the 2017 ELN response criteria

        -  To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with alvocidib in
           combination with 7+3

      Exploratory Objective:

      • To assess levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) using standardized techniques (ie,
      multiparametric flow cytometry [MPFC] and next generation sequencing [NGS] and evaluate other
      potential biomarkers including, but not limited to, MCL-1 dependency.
