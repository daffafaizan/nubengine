    
      To identify "progressors" in retinal vascular disease and central retinal edema in type 2
      diabetic patients with early NPDR, based on retinal disease progression from baseline to the
      12-month visit, assessed by the following biomarkers:

        -  Microaneurysms turnover (MA formation rate over or equal to 2, i.e. number of new MA
           from baseline to the 12-month visit) computed from color fundus photographs using the
           RetmarkerDR software; and

        -  Retinal thickness increase in eyes with retinal thickening (Increase in retinal
           thickness above normal range) in the central subfield, the inner ring and/or the outer
           ring Constantly Present, Present or Absent (as measured by OCT and considering the
           macula thickness normative data.
