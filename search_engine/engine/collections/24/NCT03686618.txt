    
      This is a prospective, phase II exploratory pilot study using different dose frequencies of
      intravenous human secretin in patients with non-obstructive, interstitial acute pancreatitis.
      All enrolled patients will receive standard of care therapy in regard to fluid resuscitation,
      pain control, CT scan or ultrasound imaging and nutritional support. In addition to standard
      of care, patients will be divided into 4 cohorts of 10 patients. Cohorts 1,2 and 3 will
      receive different doses of intravenous synthetic human secretin. Cohort X will not receive
      drug. Dosing will start within 24 hours of hospitalization with no further secretin
      administration beyond Day 3. Patients will continue to be followed until discharge. The
      primary study endpoint will be the decrease in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level by 50%
      within 96 hours and/or at discharge compared with CRP level at admission to determine optimal
      frequency of dosing. Secondary study endpoints will include: 1) Serum measurements of pro-
      and anti-inflammatory cytokines including sCD40L, EGF, Eotaxin/CCL11, FGF-2, Flt-3 ligand,
      Fractalkine, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5,
      IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1,
      MCP-3, MDC (CCL22), MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, RANTES, TGF-α, TNF-α, TNF-β, VEGF,
      HSP 27, HSP 60, HSP 70, HSP 90 at time of study enrollment, days of secretin administration,
      96 hours and at discharge 2) Clinically relevant outcome measures including hemoconcentration
      (fall in blood urea nitrogen and hematocrit from admission), decrease in patient admission
      pain scores (visual analogue scale), decrease in systemic inflammatory response, and
      tolerance of oral nutrition 3) Calculation of the Dynamic Acute Pancreatitis Score - organ
      failure, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, abdominal pain, requirement for opiates and
      ability to tolerate oral intake 4) Length of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit
      transfer, mortality, need for surgical, endoscopic or percutaneous intervention 5)
      Development of pancreatic necrosis and/or persistent organ failure and 6) Adverse events and
      30 day readmission rate.
