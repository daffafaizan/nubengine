      clinimetric variables (range of active cervical movement, motor control and electrical
      activity), perceived pain (using NSMNP and algometry) and disability were evaluated. The
      sample (n = 18) is divided into instructors (n = 7) and students (n = 11). The objective of
      this study is to characterize descriptively at the sociodemographic level and to know the
      state of health in relation to clinimetric variables of the fighter pilots of the Talavera la
      Real air base (Badajoz) to determine the risk of developing an neck injury.
