      category 3-5). The subjects are to be divided into three groups:

      Group A: patients who undergo bypass surgery with a synthetic graft on aorto-iliac or
      femoro-popliteal segment; Group B: patients who undergo endovascular balloon angioplasty and
      stenting on aorto-iliac or femoro-popliteal segment; Group C: patients who undergo standard
      of care conservative treatment.

      Decisions on revascularization or conservative treatment alone is to be made by a team of
      vascular specialists in accordance with the severity of the disease, previous treatment,
      anatomy, possible need for repeat procedures in the future, and patient's preferences.
