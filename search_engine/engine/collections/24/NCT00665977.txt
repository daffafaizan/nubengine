      placebo run-in, crossover trial to determine the efficacy of heated humidity with
      Thermosmart™ in improving compliance and nasal symptoms in patients using CPAP versus a nasal
      steroid and placebo (heated humidity, nasal steroid placebo) phases. After successful
      screening, participants will undergo a two week single-blind double placebo run-in phase
      using heated humidity and a nasal steroid placebo. The double-blind treatment phase will last
      a total of six weeks. Participants will undergo both phases: three weeks using heated
      humidity with Thermosmart™ and nasal steroid placebo and three weeks using a nasal steroid
      with a heated humidifier. Treatment phases will be counterbalanced. Study participation will
      last a total of 8 weeks from screening to completion of double-blind treatment.
