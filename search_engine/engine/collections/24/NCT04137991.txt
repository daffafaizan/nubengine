      Moderate-to-high risk cardiovascular surgery is associated with perioperative morbidity and
      mortality. These patients undergo general anesthesia and often require tight blood pressure
      control (e.g., using norepinephrine titration) to avoid the complications associated with
      hypotension and reduced cardiac output. Standard analgesia opioid titration to control
      nociception (i.e., the patient's unconscious response to noxious stimuli) is based on the
      anesthesiologist's experience and variations in the patient's heart rate and blood pressure.
      This causes anesthesiologists to often give too much analgesic, which can lead to inhibition
      of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system, hypotension, and associated side effects. A
      recently developed nociception monitor, the PMD-200 (Medasense, Israel), is capable of
      measuring the patient's level of nociception-antinociception balance and can guide opioid
      administration. This monitor may allow anesthesiologists to administer only the required
      amount of opioid, which may lead to better hemodynamic stability and better postoperative
      outcome.

      Objectives:

      The goal of this study is to determine if titrating analgesia using the Nol-Index, when
      compared to standard care, leads to decreased infused remifentanil, decreased norepinephrine,
      increased cardiac output, more stable blood pressure control, and decreased postoperative
      complications in moderate-to-high risk patients undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery.
