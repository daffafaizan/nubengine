      indicated by enhanced cortisol and catecholamine release and a proinflammatory state mirrored
      by increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFa. Therefore
      sleep deprivation is associated with a similar pattern of endocrine and proinflammatory
      alterations that may promote the insulin resistant state. Thus, it is of paramount interest
      to clearly define the metabolic alterations in patients with primary insomnia.

      Patients with with suspected primary insomnia will be recruited from the sleep clinic at the
      University Hospital Basel and by newspaper ads. Primary insomnia will be diagnosed by a
      polysomnographic study and the exclusion of secondary causes such as depression, sleep apnea
      and restless legs syndrome. Eligible patients will be admitted to the CRC for metabolic
      studies, including baseline blood samples for the measurement of hormones, cytokines and
      adipokines, a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study for the assessment of glucose turnover
      and insulin sensitivity and in vivo NMR studies to determine intrahepatic and
      intramyocellular lipid content.

      The data obtained in insomnic patients will be compared to those of a control group matched
      for age, sex, BMI, menopausal status and physical activity selected from the general
      population.
