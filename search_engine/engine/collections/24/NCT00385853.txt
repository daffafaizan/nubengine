           severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will get the same
           dose of PTK. A small group will be enrolled onto the study and given a certain dose. If
           they tolerate it well, the next small group enrolled will receive a higher dose. This
           will continue until the highest dose that can be given without severe or unmanageable
           side effects is found.

        -  Participants will receive PTK twice daily along with temozolomide daily during each
           treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days.

        -  PTK will start on Day 0 of the first cycle and will be given twice daily for the 7 weeks
           the participant receives radiation therapy.

        -  Daily doses of temozolomide will begin on Day of the first cycle and continue until the
           last dose of radiation therapy in cycle 1.

        -  Each participant will receive 7 weeks of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will start
           on Day 5 of the first cycle and will be administered monday through friday, except on
           holidays.

        -  When radiation stops, temozolomide and PTK will be given for a maximum of 6
           post-radiation cycles of study treatment. During these cycles, PTK and temozolomide will
           be given for 5 consecutive days followed by 23 days of no drugs.

        -  Tests will be performed routinely throughout the study treatment and include; chest
           x-rays, blood tests, physical exams, urine tests and ECG.

        -  The following procedures will be performed at the end of the study or after the
           participants last dose of study medication; tumor assessment by MRI, routine blood
           draws, neurological/physical exam and, medical history review.
