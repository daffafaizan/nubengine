      patients with androgen-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. Patients will be prospectively
      enrolled in this study if diagnosis of adenocarcinoma only has been histologically confirmed
      and they are eligible for (or have already started up to 6 months prior to inclusion)
      standard GnRH-agonist first line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with
      anti-androgen to achieve complete androgen blockade (CAB). UV1 vaccinations will be applied
      simultaneously with CAB.

      When indicated, patients may receive concomitant radiotherapy.

      The following 2-step design will be used:

        1. Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose
           levels).

        2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 7 patients for assessment of immune response
           levels

      13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless
      clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. GM-CSF (Leukine ®) will be
      administered locally 10-15 minutes before each UV1 vaccination.

      Hormone naïve patients will receive standard complete androgen blockade by GnRH-agonist (3
      months depot formulation sc.) and bicalutamide 50 mg orally per day (CAB). Patients already
      on GnRH-agonist therapy will continue with their initial treatment with addition of
      bicalutamide 50 mg orally per day.
