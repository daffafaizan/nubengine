    
      Rationale: In Mongolia, smoking cessation assistance in the governmental health sector
      consists of behavioral counseling and a 3-week regimen of the NRT patch that costs 175 USD.
      This cost for low income adults limits effectiveness. A 2014 study documented the superiority
      and lower cost (<20 USD) of Cytisine versus NRT for continuous abstinence. Trial
      investigators are testing the comparative effectiveness of Cytisine in the "real life
      setting" of their national health care system and, if proven effective, will include coverage
      for Cytisine in the national health plan.

      Research Question/Objective: To determine whether a 25 day course of Cytisine tablets is at
      least as effective as 25 days of NRT in helping smokers remain abstinent for at least one
      month.

      Design: A pragmatic, single blinded, randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial.

      Setting: Nine governmental primary care centers in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and outskirts.

      Participants: Mongolian adult smokers referred to government-run addiction units.

      Intervention and procedures: Participants are randomized to 5 weeks of treatment (n=352) or
      usual care (n=352) and a 6-month follow-up. The treatment consists of a 25-day course of
      Cytisine tablets and behavioral counseling. Usual care consists of 25 days of NRT and
      behavioral counseling.

      Measurements: The primary outcome is continuous abstinence (< 5 cigarettes smoked since quit
      date) at 1 month. Secondary outcomes include 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates and
      adverse events.
