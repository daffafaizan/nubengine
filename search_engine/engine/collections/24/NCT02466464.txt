      treatment in this hospital for nosebleeds that do not resolve with squeezing the nose or
      nasal spray is to place a nasal packing (aka nasal tampon) into the nose. This is an
      effective treatment in most cases, but patients may find it to be uncomfortable. The
      investigators will be comparing the standard nasal packing with a new type of powder which
      may also stop nosebleeds.
