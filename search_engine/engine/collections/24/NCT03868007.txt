      brief and transient limb ischemia confers protection against prolonged and severe ischemia in
      distant organs (e.g., brain and heart).It has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy
      to reduce plasma myocardial enzyme, infarct volume, and incidence of post-ACS heart failure
      in patients with ACS. Additionally, recent studies have found that RIC was safe and feasible
      in patients with AIS even in those caused by large artery occlusion and treated with
      reperfusion therapy, and it might benefit AIS patients by reducing the risk of brain tissue
      infarction and improving functional outcomes. To date, however, it is still unknow whether
      RIC, a systematic protective strategy, could benefit patients with AIS complicating ACS.This
      study aimed to investigate whether RIC is safe and effective in patients with AIS
      complicating ACS.
