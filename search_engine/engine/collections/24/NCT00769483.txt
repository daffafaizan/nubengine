    
      Phase I

      The Study Drugs:

      MK-0646 is designed to block proteins that are thought to cause cancer cells to grow and
      spread. This drug may help slow the growth of tumors.

      Gemcitabine is designed to disrupt the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells
      to die.

      Erlotinib hydrochloride is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface
      of many tumor cells that may control the growth and survival of cancer cells. This may stop
      cancer cells from growing.

      Study Drug Dose Level and Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a group
      (Arm A or Arm B) based on when you joined the study, how many participants have been enrolled
      before you, and on the safety data that is available at that time.

        -  If you are in Arm A, you will receive MK-0646 and gemcitabine.

        -  If you are in Arm B, you will receive MK-0646, gemcitabine, and erlotinib hydrochloride.

      There are 2 dose levels of MK-0646 in each arm. There will be 3-6 participants enrolled in
      each dose level in each arm. Enrollment will begin in Arm A. Arm B will use the same 2 dose
      levels as Arm A. If the first dose level of Arm A is found to be tolerable, at least 3
      patients will be enrolled in Arm B, Level 1, and then at least 3 patients will be enrolled in
      Arm A, Level 2. If Arm B, Level 1 and Arm A, Level 2 can be safely given, the last group of
      3-6 patients will be enrolled in Arm B, Level 2. The first group of participants in each arm
      will receive the lower dose level. The next group in each arm will receive a higher dose than
      the first group, if no intolerable side effects were seen.

      The dose of gemcitabine and/or erlotinib hydrochloride will be the same for every group.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are in Arm A, on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day study cycle, you will receive
      gemcitabine through a needle into your vein over about 1 1/2 hours. On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
      of each cycle, you will receive MK-0646 by vein over 1 hour.

      If you are in Arm B, you will take erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth once a day (in the
      morning) every day. You should take it with about 1 cup (8 oz.) of water 1 hour before or 2
      hours after eating. On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive gemcitabine by vein
      over about 1 1/2 hours. On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, you will receive MK-0646 by
      vein over 1 hour.

      Depending upon how well you tolerate gemcitabine, your doctor may decide that you should
      receive gemcitabine on Days 1 and 15 instead of Days 1, 8, and 15.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

           side effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to make sure your body has not created cells to
           fight against MK-0646. These cells are called human anti-human antibodies (also known as
           HAHA).

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your vital signs and weight will be measured.

      You may remain on study for as long as you are benefiting. You will be taken off study if the
      disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Once you are off study, every 3 months from then on, the study staff will ask you how you are
      doing, either in the clinic or by telephone. If you are called, the phone call will take
      about 10-15 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. MK-0646 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At
      this time, MK-0646 is only being used in research. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride is FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in combination
      with gemcitabine.

      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
