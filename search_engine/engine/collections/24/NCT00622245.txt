      mood swings with manic or hypomanic episodes alternated with depressive episodes of longer
      duration. Patients spend more time in depression than in (hypo)mania over their life time.
      The medical need for the patient is to remain symptom-free for as long a period as possible.
      A reduction both in severity of depression and mania, and in frequency of cycling, is the
      aim.

      Although there are many treatments for bipolar disorder, few are approved, and they have
      limitations in their use due to safety and tolerability issues. Recommendations exist to use
      mood stabilisers, antipsychotics or a combination thereof with or without antidepressants and
      the polypharmacy employed in many cases is a reason for concern. There is a major medical
      need for more effective treatments in monotherapy with a reduced potential for adverse
      effects. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the new drug, Lu AA34893, in
      treatment of depression in patients with bipolar disorder.
