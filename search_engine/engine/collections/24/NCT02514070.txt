      effects of different omega-3 fatty acids, namely EPA and DHA, on lipoprotein metabolism.
      Subjects will be unblinded for performance of measurements after they complete the study.
      Subjects will receive EPA or DHA supplements for approximately 6 weeks with a wash out period
      of 8 weeks between the two arms of the study. The study consists of 4 outpatient visits when
      laboratory or research samples and CAVI tests will be performed. A 7-day food diary, pill
      count, and red cell membrane n-3 levels will be monitored to assess compliance.

      Serum cholesterol is transported by lipoproteins, such as VLDL, LDL and HDL, which vary in
      their relationship to cardiovascular risk. LDL is proatherogenic, whereas HDL is
      cardio-protective. Fish oil supplementation, such as EPA and DHA, has been shown to reduce
      triglycerides. EPA supplementation has also been shown to lower LDL-C, whereas DHA can raise
      both LDL-C and HDL-C. These differential effects on lipoproteins may alter the cardiovascular
      protection afforded by fish oil supplementation. This study will test the hypothesis that EPA
      and DHA may differ in their LDL-C lowering ability because of differences in how they
      modulate plasma PCSK9 levels, which is a major determinant of LDL-C levels. In addition, we
      will assess other parameters related to lipoprotein composition and function that may impact
      the cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA. Other reported beneficial effects of omega-3
      fatty acid supplementation, such as decreased platelet coagulability, markers of inflammation
      and changes in guy microbiota, will also be monitored.
