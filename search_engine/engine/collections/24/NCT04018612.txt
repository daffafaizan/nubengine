      study to assess similarities in safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of high
      dose injectable acetaminophen given relative to placebo, and low dose injectable
      acetaminophen given relative to placebo over a 24-hour period in patients experiencing
      moderate to severe postsurgical pain within 7 hours following surgical removal of 2 or more
      molars
