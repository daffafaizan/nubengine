    
      The primary aims of this Phase II exploratory study in patients treated with A4250 due to
      cholestasis induced pruritus are to:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of A4250, orally administered first as a single dose
           and then during a four week treatment period, as determined by the occurrence of
           treatment-emergent SAEs

        -  Explore changes in serum total bile acids after a four week treatment period

      Secondary safety aims include assessment of the safety and tolerability of A4250, orally
      administered first as a single dose and then during a four week treatment period, as
      determined by the occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs and changes in safety parameters
      including laboratory tests and vital signs

      Secondary efficacy aims are to:

        -  Demonstrate the efficacy of A4250, orally administered during a four week treatment
           period, on liver biochemistry variables and on pruritus parameters

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of A4250 orally administered first as a single
           dose and then after a four week treatment period

        -  Evaluate changes in VAS-itching score after a four week treatment period
