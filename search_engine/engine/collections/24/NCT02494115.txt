      These oedemas have multiple causes and are complicated to be taken care of. Actual available
      treatments such as physiotherapist massage and compression stockings, are often lacking
      efficiency and are not adapted for these patients.

      Physical embarrassment, pain and psychological impact linked to the body image distortion are
      often associated to these lymphedemas. Investigators decided to study new therapeutic method
      because of major discomfort due to these oedemas and doctors' difficulty to manage them.

      Subcutaneous drainage also called lymphocentesis seems to be an interesting technique. This
      local treatment consists in inserting in lower limbs several catheters draining into enclosed
      bags in order to evacuate lymph fluid and to lower local pressure.

      Very few studies have been published concerning this technique and are presenting only a
      small number of cases. They cannot allow clear conclusions of this technique's efficiency but
      show encouraging results.

      Investigators want to collect more data on this technique using a larger number of subjects
      in order to evaluate subcutaneous drainage effects on the comfort of palliative care cancer
      patients presenting lower limbs lymphedema. Investigators will consider as lymphedema,
      oedemas with no renal or cardiovascular identified cause and excluding anasarca.

      This study should be completed by a comparative randomized study to increase the evidence
      level if it shows a technical interest for drainage.
