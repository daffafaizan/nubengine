      construct, "Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS)". However, routine post-stroke work
      up including 24-hour Holter monitoring may fail to detect paroxysmal AF. A recent systematic
      review has shown an increased AF detection rate with longer monitoring durations. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ambulatory 7-day Holter ECG (EV-201,
      Parama-Tech inc.) for detecting AF in patients with recent ESUS after completion of a
      standard clinical examination.
