      conditions, the etiology, mechanisms, and risk factors remain elusive, and this symptom
      remains poorly managed at present. Longitudinal studies related to treatment-related fatigue
      in cancer patients have been conducted but there are limited data showing changes in
      molecular mechanisms before and after cancer therapy which can identify individuals who are
      at risk to experience fatigue during and after therapy. Fatigue is conceptualized as a
      multidimensional symptom which incorporates temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental,
      affective/emotional, behavioral, and physiological dimensions. This prospective,
      observational study will explore the molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying fatigue
      experienced by cancer patients receiving various therapies (e.g. immune therapy, hormone
      therapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy).

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the changes in the self-reported fatigue
      experienced by cancer patients over time. The secondary objectives of this study are to (1)
      investigate the associations between inflammatory, neurometabolic, stress, and mitochondrial
      markers with fatigue intensification over time during the course of treatments, (2) determine
      changes in gene expression from peripheral blood samples over time during the course of
      treatments, (3) relate changes in the levels of these biological markers (i.e.,
      inflammatory/metabolic/stress profiles and gene expression) to patient reported outcomes
      (PROs) of self-reported fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) scores, (4) measure cognitive functioning, skeletal muscle strength, physical
      activity levels and energy expenditure of patients and relate these findings with changes in
      PRO scores, the inflammatory/metabolic/stress profiles and gene expression, and (5)
      investigate the psychometric property of the Saligan-Walitt Integrated Fatigue Tool (SWIFT).
