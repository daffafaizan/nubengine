      uterine fibroid, in the context of women's desire to preserve fertility or not to undergo
      operation.

      Among these hormonal therapies, ulipristal acetate (UPA) is an orally administered selective
      progesterone receptor modulator commonly prescribed for treatment of uterine fibroid. This
      agent acts on causing apoptosis of the muscle cells inside the tumor and reducing the tumor
      matrix in case of uterine fibroid.

      UPA at daily dose of 5 mg has been shown to decrease menstrual blood loss and reduce tumor
      size after 13 consecutive weeks of treatment.
