      amyotrophy caused by the stay in the intensive care unit. This pathology is frequent, under
      diagnosed, increases the length of stay and mortality in intensive care and alters the
      functional status in the long term (mobility, autonomy, cognitive abilities). The gold
      standard is the MRC score. It must be under 48/60. But this means of diagnostic is unreliable
      and tardive (problem of voluntary cooperation, confusion, sedation).

      This study allows the earlier diagnosis of neuromuscular weakness syndrome, by muscular
      ultrasound. Ultrasound of the right femoral muscle allows evaluation of the amyotrophy, which
      is related to the maximum muscular strength.

      The early rehabilitation enable improved prognosis. This is an observational, prospective,
      single-center, blinded, observational study.

      The objective is to determine the day of ultrasound examination with the highest diagnostic
      performance to predict with a maximum of specificity the occurrence of post-intensive care
      neuromuscular weakness syndrome, defined by an MRC score <48/60 at the end of intensive care
      or if the duration of stay exceeds 28 days on the 28th day of hospitalization in intensive
      care unit.
