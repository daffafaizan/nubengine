      'Sensing ET Tube' for measuring oxygen levels in patients undergoing surgical operations. The
      device replaces the standard breathing tube used in surgery and incorporates photonic sensors
      for measurement of the patient's oxygen level and other vital signs. Currently this
      information is supplied from finger probes, which can fail often, for example when the
      patient is cold or when the blood pressure is low. The new device is completely harmless and
      allows the anaesthetist to monitor the oxygen level from the central region of the body using
      minimal connections. If successful, future work is planned to incorporate other sensors into
      the system, providing a complete overview of the health of the patient. This will greatly
      simplify the process of patient monitoring while reducing the number of failures, improving
      patient safety and reducing operating costs.

      A clinical trial is planned in up to 50 patients undergoing general anaesthesia, which will
      quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the measured clinical variables and
      the device's expected performance in mainstream operation. This information will provide the
      basis for further commercial development, most likely through partnership with a medical
      device manufacturer.

      To summarise, the main aims of the project are:

        -  Investigate photoplethysmographic signals from the human trachea and identify viability
           to measure heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation by comparison with "gold standard"
           techniques.

        -  Evaluate custom-designed endotracheal sensor for operation and determine ideal
           electrical characteristics for optimal operation (current supply, detector amplification
           etc.)
