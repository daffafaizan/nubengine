      implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate health promotion activities that
      improve families' diet and physical activity behaviors is imperative. "Radio Stories" is an
      education entertainment strategy that has significant potential as a health promotion tool.
      Through a CBPAR process, we aimed to create and test the effectiveness and acceptability of
      "SoLaHmo Radio Stories" about changing knowledge and behaviors to prevent or manage
      hypertension and obesity for Somali, Latino, and Hmong families with children.

      Methods: SoLaHmo community researchers interviewed 7 families (3 Somali, 2 Latino, and 2
      Hmong) who have successfully implemented lifestyle changes to prevent or manage hypertension
      or obesity, and then create 6 "radio stories" (2 per ethnic community) based on the families'
      experiences. To test the stories, we are conducting a two-arm trial that includes 146
      participants (obesity: 68, hypertension: 78; 44 Hmong, 49 Latino, and 53 Somali
      participants). Effectiveness and acceptability of the program will be tested with pre-and
      post questionnaires.

      Anticipated Results: Higher rates of satisfaction, increased knowledge, and increased
      intention to change healthful lifestyle behaviors in participants receiving the radio
      stories, as compared to control group participants, will indicate radio story program
      effectiveness and acceptability.
