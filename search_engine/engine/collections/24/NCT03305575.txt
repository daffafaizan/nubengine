    
      Cervical cerclage is an ambulatory surgical procedure of short duration commonly performed
      under spinal anesthesia. Bupivaciane and chlororpocaine are both commonly used, but how their
      use impacts clinical care, in particular patient flow, is not well studied.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Participants meeting
      inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to receive spinal anesthesia with either
      chloroprocaine or bupivacaine.

      Patients will then be assessed for motor block and sensory level until they are discharged
      from the recovery room.
