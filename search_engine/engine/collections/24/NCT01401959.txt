    
      This is a non-randomized, open-label trial to evaluate 6 cycles of eribulin in female
      patients with invasive breast cancer who do not achieve pathologic complete response (pCR)
      after treatment with a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery regimen. Patients will
      be randomized into three cohorts according to tumor-type: triple-negative (Cohort A),
      hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative (Cohort B), and HER2-positive (Cohort C) tumors.
      Patients will receive eribulin for 6 cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Patients with HER2-positive
      tumors will also receive trastuzumab. Patients in all cohorts will be allowed to receive
      locoregional radiotherapy and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy per institutional guidelines.
