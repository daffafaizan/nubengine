      pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, no study investigating its effect on functional
      mobility with performance-based measurement methods or investigating its effectiveness on
      kinesiophobia has been found. Studies investigating the efficacy of KT in pregnant women with
      PGP are few and many are methodologically weak studies, most of which do not contain
      randomization and control groups. Also, no study has been found in the literature, which
      compares the effectiveness of PB and KT in pregnant women with PGP. Therefore, the primary
      aim of this study is to examine the effects of PB and KT on pain and functional mobility in
      pregnant women with PGP in comparison with the control group, which is only given pain
      neuroscience education and ergonomic training. The secondary aims are to investigate the
      effects of these applications on kinesiophobia, activity limitation and sleep quality; and to
      compare the groups in regard to patient compliance and treatment satisfaction levels of the
      groups.
