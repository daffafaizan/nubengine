    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of DCE-MRI (dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging) as non-invasive imaging tool to image contrast enhancement in ocular and orbital
      tumors.

      II. To compare contrast enhancement and its distribution within orbital tissue. III. To
      assess potential differences in contrast enhancement which help to characterize malignant
      lesions as well as discriminate these from benign tissue.

      IV. To compare image characteristics between clinical high field end ex-vivo ultra high field
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

      V. To correlate imaging findings with obtained histology by comparing contrast enhancement
      parameters, e.g. maximum signal intensity, to histology characteristics, e.g. vascular
      density.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo DCE-MRI.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
