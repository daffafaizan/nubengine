    
      Approximately 30-50% of patients after cardiac surgery develop cardiac arrhythmias, most
      often atrial, and most frequently atrial fibrillation (AF).

      Various risk factors, inter alia, the type of surgery itself are risk factors. The major
      additional risk factors for postoperative atrial fibrillation are: age, valvular involvement,
      length of cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times.

      Postoperative atrial fibrillation is associated with increased length of stay, higher
      morbidity and mortality including stroke.

      Documentation of postopertive atrial fibrillation is well gathered during the postopertive
      length of stay, but scarce information exists regarding the development and occurence of
      atrial arrhythmias after the patient's discharge.

      Additionally, the various management protocols which exists with regard to postoperative
      atrial fibrillation, rely on continuous treatment of the patients with amiodarone or various
      other anti-arrhythmic agents for the initial postoperative period, and the initial first
      month after discharge.

      So far there is not an unambiguous recommendation regarding the duration of treatment
      required with amiodarone after releasing the patient.

      The aim of this study is to document and record cardiac arrhythmias in patients after
      open-heart surgery within the time window since the release from hospital and up to six weeks
      after surgery.

      Results of the study will allow us to fully characterize postoperative arrhythmias and their
      risk factors.
