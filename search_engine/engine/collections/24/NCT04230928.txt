      sustainable community care setting, in addition to routine medical care, to African American
      (AA) with pre-hypertension, hypertension (stage 1-3), or cardiovascular disease risk factors.
      This study will also secondarily assess the feasibility of following a VLC diet in a
      low-income, AA population.
