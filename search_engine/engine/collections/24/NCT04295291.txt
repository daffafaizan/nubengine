      ratio, OR, for 2.48, 95% KI 1.11-5.56, p=.03), monthly assessment of all cardiac arrest cases
      (OR 6.9, 95% KI 1.41-33.92), and includin av local coordinator for CPR (OR 2.93, 95% KI
      1.08-7.94, p=.03), as well as depth of compressions. Nevertheless, information about cardiac
      arrests and CPR have not been assessed in relation to patient specific information. In the
      current hospital, we are able to record the CPR sequence, and see this in relation to other
      patient- and case- specific information such as initial cardiac rythm, time to first
      compression, hands-off time, quality of CPR, and factors affecting the treatment and outcome.

      The hospital has 71 registered defibrillators used in CPR. The current study will both gather
      retrospective data- not seen in relation to patient specific information, and prospective
      data related to specific patients.
