           in which the large substitution fluid is produced directly from the dialysate. It offers
           many advantages aside from its safe inflammatory profile, which is attributable to the
           use of ultrapure dialysate and highly biocompatible dialysis membranes. Due to an
           improved convective clearance, significantly increased removal of large or protein-bound
           uremic retention solutes can be achieved, with a potential benefit on cardiovascular
           morbidity and mortality.

        2. Endothelial dysfunction, almost universal in end stage renal disease, is important risk
           factor for cardiovascular events, and can be evaluated by brachial artery
           endothelium-dependent vasodilation (flow-mediated dilation) to reactive hyperemia
           following 5 min of forearm ischemia.

        3. The stable HD patients will receive 8-week treatment on OL-HDF or conventional low flux
           HD and then crossed over to opposite treatment arm. The FMD will be measured by one
           sonographer, and at the same time whole blood and serum will be sampled and stored for
           further analysis. The timepoint for measurement is 4-week interval after baseline
           evaluation.
