      young children ( Ã‡olak et al., 2013). The prevalence of ECC in Egypt is high, it is about
      (78%) according to the last Egyptian Report, 2014.

      ECC begins with white-spot lesions, and caries can progress continuously, leading to complete
      destruction of the crown. Calcium and phosphate ions are more readily lost for children
      because lower mineralization of deciduous enamel. The disease usually develops very quickly
      and causes many childhood health problems, such as caries-related toothache and infection.

      Demineralization and remineralization are dynamic processes in caries initiation,
      progression, and reversal. Therefore, regulation of the demineralization- remineralization
      balance is a key to caries prevention and treatment. The ideal method of increasing
      remineralization is reconstructing the depleted tissues with hydroxyapatite, which is the
      same inorganic component as the enamel.

      Fluoride varnishes have been the standard practice for the professional application of
      fluoride.

      Casien PhosphoPeptide (CPP) is a sticky protein that binds and stabilizes calcium and
      phosphate ions in an amorphous state. CPP-ACP has been shown to adhere to teeth surfaces.
