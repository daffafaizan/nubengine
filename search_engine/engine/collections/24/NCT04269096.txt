      an effort to address the most common complications of a surgical procedure, perioperative
      protocols have recently been created in an effort to apply best practices consistently and
      enhance the recovery from surgery. In addition to evaluating the validity of the protocol
      components themselves, it is valuable to measure compliance with said protocol. Failure to
      complete the steps of a care pathway may be caused by several reasons, and a study of
      application of these steps may help future efforts at standardization of care.

      The purpose of this study is to determine compliance with the Prisma Health-Upstate
      Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Perioperative Protocol.

      Hospital inpatient data from patient charts, office charts, and hospital medical data systems
      of Prisma Health-Upstate System will be used to review the records of all patients age 18-75
      years, inpatient and outpatient, who had surgery for choledocolithiasis between January 1,
      2016 to April 1, 2017.
