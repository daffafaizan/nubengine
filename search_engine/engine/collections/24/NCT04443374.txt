      assess physical activity level particularly people with mental illnesses. The purpose of this
      study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SIMPAQ into Turkish and investigate its
      psychometric properties. Eighty individuals with mental illnesses (major depression, bipolar
      disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol and substance addiction) will include. For
      cross-cultural adaptation and validation procedure, developers' manual in the official site
      will be followed (http://www.simpaq.org/). Within a 5-to-7-day period after the first
      assessment, the participants completed the Turkish version of the SIMPAQ to evaluate
      test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (Î±) was used to assess internal consistency. The
      correlations with the Turkish version of the International Physical Activity-Short Form
      (IPAQ-SF) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Turkish version of the DSM-5
      Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Scale-Adult Version (DSM XC) will determine to check
      the validity.
