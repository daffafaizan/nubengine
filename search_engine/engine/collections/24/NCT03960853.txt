    
      One hundred patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection (age > 65
      years old, body mass index(BMI）18-30 kg/m2, American society of anesthesiologists(ASA
      )grading Ⅰ - Ⅲ ) will be randomly assigned to volume control ventilation(VCV)group and
      pressure controlled ventilation-volume guarantee(PCV-VG)group.General anesthesia combined
      with epidural anesthesia will be used to both groups.

      Ventilation settings in both groups are VT 8 mL/kg,inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio
      1:2,inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) 0.5 with air,2.0 L/min of inspiratory fresh gas
      flow,positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 millimeter of mercury （mmHg）,respiratory rate
      (RR) was adjusted to maintain an end tidal CO2 pressure (ETCO2) of 35 -45 mmHg.

      In operation dates will be collected at the following time points: preanesthesia, 1 hour
      after pneumoperitoneum,2 hours after pneumoperitoneum ,30 minutes after admission to
      post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) .The dates collected or calculated are the following:1)peak
      airway pressure,plate airway pressure, mean inspiratory pressure, dynamic compliance,
      RR,Exhaled VT andETCO2，2) Arterial blood gas analysis: arterial partial pressure of oxygen
      (PaO2), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2),power of hydrogen（PH）, and oxygen
      saturation (SaO2)，3) Oxygenation index (OI) calculation; PaO2/FIO2, 4) Ratio of physiologic
      dead-space over tidal volume(Vd/VT) (expressed in %) was calculated with Bohr's formula ;
      Vd/VT = (PaCO2 - ETCO2)/PaCO2,5) Hemodynamics: heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP),and
      central venous pressure （CVP），6) lung injury markers ：Interleukin 6(IL6）,Interleukin
      8（IL8）,Clara cell protein 16（CC16）,Solution advanced glycation end products
      receptor（SRAGE）,tumor necrosis factor α(TNFα) .

      Investigators will collect the following dates according to following-up after surgery: the
      incidence of postoperation pulmonary complications(PPC) based on PPC scale within seven days
      , incidence of pneumonia within seven days after surgery,incidence of atelectasis within
      seven days after surgery,length of hospital days after surgery, the incidence of
      postoperative unplanned admission to ICU, the incidence of operation complications within 7
      days after surgery, the incidence of postoperative systematic complications within 7 days
      after surgery.
