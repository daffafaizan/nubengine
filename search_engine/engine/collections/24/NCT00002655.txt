      using a commercially available intraoperative cryosurgical system, with placement of the
      cryoprobe and subsequent monitoring by high-resolution ultrasound. II. Use this technique on
      selected patients with surgically unresectable metastatic or primary liver cancer whose
      disease appears confined to the liver and who are potentially curable if all tumor in the
      liver can be destroyed. III. Quantitate the quality and duration of survival, identify
      recurrence of hepatic malignant disease, and identify any morbidity from the procedure.

      OUTLINE: Cryosurgery. Liquid nitrogen freezing of tumor using a cryoprobe placed and
      maintained under ultrasound guidance.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be treated.
