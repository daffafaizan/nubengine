    
      In this Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, dose rising trial, subjects with actinic keratosis
      will receive topical application of SOR007 Ointment (in four concentrations) or SOR007
      Ointment vehicle to the face twice daily for up to 28 days. Subjects will be enrolled in four
      dose-escalating cohorts of eight subjects and randomized to SOR0007 or Ointment vehicle in a
      ratio of 3:1. Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration.

      Safety will be assessed in an ongoing manner and formal safety reviews will be conducted four
      times for each cohort: at Day 8, Day 15, Day 21, and Day 28 for the last subject enrolled in
      each cohort. The next dose level cohort will enroll upon a finding of safety and tolerability
      at the previous cohort's second (Day 15) safety review.

      The safety and tolerability of SOR007 will be demonstrated by local toxicity, adverse events,
      laboratory assessments and vital signs. Subjects will be observed for reduction in the number
      of AK lesions to determine preliminary efficacy. Plasma samples will be taken at various time
      points throughout the study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of SOR007.
