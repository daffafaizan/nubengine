      persons in this country report limitations in their daily activities due to arthritis.
      Rheumatoid arthritis alone affects 1 of every 100 persons in the US. Clinic-based
      self-management programs have been found to be effective in reducing both pain and disability
      for persons with RA. However, barriers to participation exist such as distance, time, limited
      transportation, and declining functional status. The Internet is widely used as a source of
      information about health issues and may provide an opportunity to reduce these barriers and
      extend consumer access to self-management approaches. It is necessary to determine the
      efficacy of Internet-delivered self-management programs.
