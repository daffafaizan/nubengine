      effects of these procedures is high-turnover bone loss and metabolic bone disease. Denosumab
      is a monoclonal antibody to RANKL that acts as a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. The
      investigators are conducting a randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the ability of
      denosumab to prevent bone loss after RYGB or SG surgery in older adults. At the conclusion of
      the study, all participants will be given zoledronic acid.
