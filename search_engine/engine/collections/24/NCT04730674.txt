      included. All of them were females undergoing modified radical mastectomy where seroma
      appeared after drain removal.

      The age, co-morbidities, total leukocytic count (as an indicator of infection), serum albumin
      and tumour size and pathology for all of them were recorded. Then we interfered with our
      tetracycline injection technique for the treatment of seroma.

      All the patients were consented regarding this therapeutic technique explaining the expected
      possible occurrence of some pain during and after injection, other complications like wound
      infection or flap necrosis necessitating further intervention. Moreover, repetition of the
      technique may be needed

      In our technique the following was adopted:

        1. First, the seroma fluid was aspirated completely using a 20 cc syringe while the patient
           lying flat and the needle inserted in the most dependent area

        2. Then, 10 cc of saline containing 2 gm of tetracycline mixed with 5 ml of 2% xylocaine
           (as a pain relieving agent) was injected at the seroma bed.

        3. After completion of injection, a crepe bandage was applied over the mastectomy area
           (flaps covering the seroma bed)

        4. Then after 5 days the patient were examined again for seroma re-collection or the
           presence of complications as infection or flap necrosis. If there were any
           re-collection, the tetracycline injection procedure would be repeated.

      The amount of seroma aspirated in each session in addition to the complications if present
      were recorded.
