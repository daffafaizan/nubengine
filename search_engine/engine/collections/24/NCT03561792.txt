      volume (RR/VT), is a well-known weaning index and one of the most clinical indices used to
      predict weaning outcome. However, it has some limitations in predicting weaning outcomes.
      Several previous studies have defined different sensitivities and specificities for RSBI less
      than 105 to predict weaning success which may lead to errors in predicting successful
      weaning.

      On the other hand, Weaning failure is likely to occur if there is an imbalance between the
      load on the inspiratory muscles and their neuromuscular capacity, the imbalance between the
      mechanical load imposed on the diaphragm which is the major muscle of inspiration and its
      ability to cope with it. Therefore, evaluating the function of diaphragm before any weaning
      trial could be useful in predicting weaning outcome.

      Bedside ultrasonography is an easy, fast, noninvasive, and accurate maneuver for evaluating
      diaphragmatic function. Diaphragmatic displacement (DD) reflecting the ability of diaphragm
      to produce force and subsequently tidal volume during inspiration and defined as displacement
      of less than 10 mm has been found to be a predictor of weaning failure among patients in
      medical ICUs.

      Spadaro et al. proposed substituting VT with DD in the RSBI, and calculating diaphragmatic
      RSBI (DRSBI) would result in a more accurate predictive index than the traditional RSBI.
