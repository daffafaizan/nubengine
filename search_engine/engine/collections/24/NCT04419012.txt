      mortality. An important element of management of patients with AF is anticoagulation to
      prevent thromboembolic events. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K
      antagonists (VKAs) are two main drugs groups used in thromboembolic events prevention.

      Primary objective of the study is to assess the frequency of VKAs vs NOACs prescription in AF
      patients treatment of with OACs.

      Secondary objective of the study are as follows: assessment of the frequency of
      appropriate/inappropriate OACs prescription in AF patients and assesment of the number of
      patients with AF treated with apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban with high thromboembolism
      risk according to CHA2DS2-VASc score.

      The POL-AF Registry is a multicenter prospective analysis of hospital records of patients
      with AF managed in ten cardiology centers.

      Collected data will include demographics, type of AF (valvular and non-valvular, as well as
      paroxysmal, persistent and permanent), medical history, laboratory tests, echocardiographic
      parameters and concomitant medications.

      Each patient will be evaluated regarding to common scales assessing risk of thromboembolic
      (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for
      bleeding in anticoagulated patients basing on the current guidelines for AF treatment)
      events.
