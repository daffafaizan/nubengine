        -  Percutaneous biopsy for hepatic masses has a potential risk of bleeding and peritoneal
           tumor seeding.

        -  A new device for biopsy track ablation has been invented to reduce the risk of bleeding
           and peritoneal tumor seeding.

      Method:

        -  Routine percutaneous biopsy for hepatic masses is performed.

        -  Immediate after obtaining tissue, biopsy needle track is ablated with a new biopsy tract
           ablator.

        -  Immediate (with ultrasound) and 24 hours (with CT scan) after procedure, occurrence of
           complications is evaluated.
