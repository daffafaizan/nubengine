    
      The present study was designed as a prospective study. All patients enrolled in the study
      will require norepinephrine to maintain MAP between 65 and 75 mmHg despite adequate volume
      resuscitation and will be sedated according to istitutional guidelines with propofol and
      remifentanyl. After 8 h had elapsed during stable hemodynamic conditions, an initial set of
      measurements will be obtained during the sedation with propofol and remifentanyl. This set of
      measurements will be considered as baseline. In the patients in which conventional sedation
      will be replaced by dexmedetomidine and remifentanyl, a second set of measurements will be
      obtained after 4 h had elapsed during stable conditions. A final set of mesurements will be
      obtained after another 8-h period in stable conditions after switcheing back again to
      propofol and remifentanyl, .

      During the observational period the dosage rate of norepinephrine will be adjusted to
      maintain the same threshold MAP of 65-75 mmHg All other medications were held constant.
