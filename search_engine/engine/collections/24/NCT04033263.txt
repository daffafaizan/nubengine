      containing sterilized enamel and dentine slabs. During this experimental phase, they will use
      the designated mouth rinse. After this period, the investigators will remove the enamel and
      dentine slabs, and will also collect salivary pellicle and any bacterial biofilm forming on
      the participant's teeth. Participants will also donate saliva for proteomic analysis (protein
      profile) to verify if there are any differences in proteins in saliva to proteins in the
      pellicle. Throughout the whole study, all participants will use standardized oral hygiene
      products.

      The experimental mouth rinses contain plant extracts that could interact with salivary
      proteins and influence the salivary pellicle and oral biofilm, thus bringing positive results
      against tooth (enamel and dentine) demineralisation.
