      combination with Gemcitabine in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. Primary objective in part A is to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of P276-00
      in combination with Gemcitabine and in part B to evaluate efficacy of this combination in
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. In part A, cohort of 3
      subjects will be enrolled at starting dose level of P276-00 which is 100 mg/m2/ day to be
      given intravenously (IV) from day 1 to day 5 every 21 days. This constitutes one cycle of
      P276-00. If this dose is well tolerated then next cohort will be enrolled at higher dose
      level of P276-00. P276-00 dose escalation will continue until MTD of P276-00 in combination
      with Gemcitabine is determined. The subsequent dose levels of P276-00 will be 140 mg/m2/day
      and 185 mg/m2/day. In part B ten subjects will be evaluated at the MTD of P276-00 in
      combination with Gemcitabine to evaluate efficacy of the combination. Dose of Gemcitabine
      will be same in both parts of the study which is 1000mg/m2 over 30mins every week for 7 weeks
      followed by a gap of one week and then 3 weekly doses every 4 weeks. Subjects will be treated
      for six cycles of P276-00 in combination with Gemcitabine or until evidence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety evaluations will be performed at regular
      intervals by means of record of vital parameters, physical examination and laboratory
      investigations for hematology and biochemistry. Efficacy assessment will be performed by
      means of weekly record of pain intensity, analgesic consumption, change in weight and
      performance status for evaluation of clinical benefit response and by means of CT scans at
      the end of every 2 cycles for evaluation of tumor response by RECIST (Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors)
