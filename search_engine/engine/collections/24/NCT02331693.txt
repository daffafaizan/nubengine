      - Patients with advanced gliomas have very limited treatment options. Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) is often amplified in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and has been regarded
      a suitable target for GBM treatment.

      The investigators have constructed lentiviral vector that contains a chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) that recognizes overexpressed EGFR in tumor cells but not EGFR in normal
      cells, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this CAR with high efficiency without
      the need to perform any selection.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objectives To evaluate the safety of the administration of anti-EGFR CAR engineered T
      lymphocytes in patients receiving the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, and aldesleukin

      Secondary objectives To determine whether the glioma will regress after the patients receive
      anti-EGFR CAR-engineered T lymphocytes and aldesleukin following a nonmyeloablative but
      lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Histologically proven glioblastoma or glisarcoma overexpressing EGFR as determined by IHC,
      Western blot, FISH or RT-PCR.

      Failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Cardiac,
      pulmonary and laboratory parameters within acceptable limits

      DESIGN:

      The study will be conducted using a Phase I design. Patients will receive a non-myeloablative
      but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine
      followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive, CAR gene-transduced T cells, plus
      IV aldesleukin.

      A total of 10 patients may be enrolled over a period of 1-2 years.
