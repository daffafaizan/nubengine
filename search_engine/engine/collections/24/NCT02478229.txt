      indication for liver transplant worldwide. HCV recurrence following liver transplantation is
      universal, associated with 100-fold increase in viremia levels, and runs at an accelerated
      course, leading to graft cirrhosis in up to 30% of patients within 5 years. Successful
      eradication of HCV post transplant normalizes the long term survival of HCV positive liver
      transplant recipients. This study aims to treat HCV infection starting at the time of
      transplant. The study is a single centre, single arm, open-label,proof of concept study
      enrolling 20 adult primary liver transplant recipients with genotype 1 HCV infection.
      Subjects will receive Sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg and Ledipasvir (LDV) 90 mg as a fixed dose
      combination (FDC) tablet starting at time of liver transplantation (OLT) and continues for 12
      weeks. Subjects will receive 24 week post-treatment follow up. The study will investigate if
      the patient has achieved sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after cessation of
      treatment (SVR12). Furthermore, safety and efficacy of this treatment regimen beginning at
      the time of transplant will be investigated.
