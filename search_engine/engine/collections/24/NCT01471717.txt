      Primary Objectives:

      Pharmacokinetic

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INX-08189 and INX-08032 when
           INX-08189 is dosed alone as compared to when dosed in combination with Victrelis

        -  To characterize the PK profile of Victrelis when dosed alone as compared to when dosed
           in combination with INX-08189

      Safety

      - To evaluate the safety of INX-08189 and Victrelis when dosed alone and when dosed in
