      volunteers, are sub-optimal clinically as patients display variable pharmacokinetics. This
      problem is further confounded by rising antimicrobial resistance and the need for high dose
      beta-lactams, exceeding licensed recommendations. In order to optimise beta-lactam therapy,
      dose individualisation using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been suggested. However,
      experience with beta-lactam TDM is limited with varying practices worldwide. Therapeutic
      targets are also variable and have not been extensively validated. Hence, this study
      primarily aims to establish clinical feasibility and utility of beta-lactam TDM. The
      investigators hypothesise that conventional beta-lactam dosing will produce sub-optimal
      levels in at least half of the patients, justifying need for TDM and dose individualisation
      to improve clinical outcomes. The secondary aims include correlating various therapeutic
      targets with clinical outcomes to identify a suitable therapeutic target for clinical use and
      to characterise beta-lactam pharmacokinetics and recommend local empirical dosing regimens.

      The investigators propose a prospective cohort study on adult patients (â‰¥21 years) admitted
      to SGH. Four blood samples will be obtained over a dosing interval and assayed using liquid
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Levels and dose adjustment recommendations will
      be reported to physicians by infectious disease pharmacists.
