      be screened by 2 investigators independently for shoulder muscle weakness. Weakness is
      determined by the strength of the other side when one side is remarkably weaker or by
      comparing with the general strength of the deltoid muscle if both sides are suspected
      involved.

      Suitable participants will undergo shoulder strength testing with a handheld dynamometer.
      Participants will be divided into the intervention group and the control group randomly. The
      shoulder strength will be tested by the second, individual blinded assessor.

      Subjects in the intervention group will receive passive spinal mobilization at cervical 4-5
      segment on the involved side(s); the control group will receive placebo intervention.

      Each participant will be tested for 2 times, before and immediately after a C4-5 joint
      mobilization on the involved side (s).
