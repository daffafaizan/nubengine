      rate of ~90%. The pathophysiology of AAA encompasses a range of poorly understood
      biomechanical and biological processes. Currently the diameter of the aneurysm is used as a
      surrogate for the risk of rupture and patients with an aneurysm diameter greater than 55 mm
      are considered for elective surgical repair. However, this reliance on a single surrogate
      measure is too simplistic and does not take into account other physical and biological
      aspects of the AAA. We propose to evaluate the role of inflammation, proteolysis and
      neovascularisation in patients with AAA disease. We will compare novel magnetic resonance
      imaging techniques with blood and tissue measures of inflammation (c-reactive protein,
      cytokines, macrophage and leucocyte density), proteolytic activity (matrix
      metalloproteinases, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) and neovascularisation (vessel
      density, endothelial progenitor cells). By comparing findings between patients with
      symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, this study will inform our understanding of the disease
      process as well as potentially identify risk markers of AAA instability that could be used to
      follow-up patients with asymptomatic disease.
