      liquefaction, improving the preservation and function of the tear film's evaporative
      component. It supplies continuous controlled heat to the outer skin of the eyelids, absorbing
      deep into the tissue and breaks down the hardened oils in the meibomian glands. We are trying
      to find a effective, safe and economical therapy for dry eye patients.
