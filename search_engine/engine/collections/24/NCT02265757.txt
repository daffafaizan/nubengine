      randomization leads to the addition of treatments beyond placebo. Participants are confronted
      with the probability of receiving placebo (no treatment). This leads many potential
      participants to not consent or to withdraw if they believe they are receiving no treatment.
      In contrast, the proposed trial will be 'subtractive'. This innovative approach to
      randomization will involve suppression of just 1 of the 5 treatment components. Thus, all
      participants will receive at least 80% of the menu of interventions offered in this trial.
