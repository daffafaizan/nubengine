      Spiral-ZÂ®. The purpose of this study is to measure the extent of thrombus formation and
      occlusion of these stent graft limbs in patients with aortic aneurysms treated at St. Olavs
      Hospital in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Information is collected from the Norwegian registry for
      vascular surgery (NORKAR), electronic patient journal and the picture archiving and
      communication system (PACS). The total number of included patients is estimated to be
      approximately 100.
