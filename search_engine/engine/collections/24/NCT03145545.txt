      cord blood may not be available due to size or matching criteria, or if a reduced intensity
      regiment is recommended. The risk of severe graft vs. host disease (GVHD) and other
      complications is higher with unrelated donors, or partially matched related donors. At the
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) there is extensive experience using mismatched
      unrelated donors or partially matched related donors with complete or partial T depletion to
      reduce the risk of severe GVHD.
