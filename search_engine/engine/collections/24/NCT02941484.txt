      become an important focus of Pancreaticoduodenectomy procedures following universal accepted
      and practice in gastrointestinal and colorectal surgeries. Early oral diet without
      restrictions after operation is recommended strongly according to ERAS guideline. However,
      several studies demonstrated that only half validated the true practice of the postoperative
      oral diet. Furthermore, Oral intake tolerance after PD is controversial. Only 23% of patients
      were able to take solid food at day 3. It appears that adequate nutritional intake only via
      oral diet is a severe challenge. Besides, Studies showed that insufficient amount of dietary
      intake was significantly associated with extended duration of postoperative hospitalization
      and parenteral nutrition. Importantly, Specific clinical study on early oral intake after PD
      is very limited. Therefore, the present study is aim to evaluate the tolerance, safety, and
      efficacy in the patients undergoing PD in the age of ERAS.
