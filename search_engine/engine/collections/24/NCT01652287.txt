      health. A common use for probiotics is in addressing gastrointestinal issues, such as
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). As an alternative to supplements, probiotics are also
      included as ingredients in fermented dairy products to produce functional foods, which are
      foods providing health benefits beyond their nutritional value. Yogurt, for example, is a
      fermented milk product often considered a functional food. One of the most commonly used
      probiotics is Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB-12).

      Our Primary Aim in Years 1-2 is to conduct a pediatric randomized controlled study to
      establish the safety of BB-12 fortified yogurt in children. Our Secondary Aims are to examine
      the fecal microbiota of children prior to, during and following consumption of probiotics.
      This study will evaluate whether a well-defined, probiotic-containing yogurt can safely be
      used as an effective delivery vehicle for probiotics. This study is important to help advance
      probiotic research forward in a systematic, well-accepted manner. Our long-term goal is to
      create yogurt with sufficient probiotic dosages to positively impact many different aspects
      of childhood and adult health.
