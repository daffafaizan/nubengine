      Many young adult subjects have some degree of atherosclerotic coronary and carotid artery
      disease and experience no symptoms. As time passes, many die suddenly and unexpectedly and
      only limited therapeutic process begins in youth, a measure of the early manifestations of
      atherosclerosis may have the potential of identifying subjects at risk for premature coronary
      and carotid occlusive vascular disease when therapeutic options can be administered. Impaired
      brachial artery flow mediated dilatory (FMD) capacities have been shown to exist in children
      and young adults with hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, diabetes and in those who
      smoke. Impaired brachial artery FMD has been shown to related to impaired endothelial
      function, which is an early manifestation of the atherosclerotic process. If impaired
      brachial artery FMD is a predictor of the process, then it may be used to non-invasively
      assess atherosclerosis early in its development and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic
      interventions.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this longitudinal study using previously studied members of the Muscatine study,
      measurements are made of contemporaneous risk factors, and brachial artery FMD, along with
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid artery intimal-medial thickness (IMT) (the
      latter two established measures of early atherosclerosis) and again three years later. The
      effort is designed to examine the following hypotheses: 1) Established risk factor levels
      measured in childhood, adulthood and across the years form childhood through adulthood are
      predictive of brachial artery flow mediated dilatory (FMD) capacities; 2) Putative risk
      factor levels measured in adulthood are related to the degree of brachial artery FMD, CAC and
      carotid artery IMT; 3) Brachial artery FMD, CAC and carotid artery IMTare related in adults;
      and 4) Brachial artery FMD is predictive of increased carotid artery IMT.
