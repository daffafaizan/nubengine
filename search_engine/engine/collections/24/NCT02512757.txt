    
      This is a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the diagnostic performance
      characteristics of the AminoIndex™ technology among patients at high risk for developing lung
      cancer as compared with standard lung cancer screening and diagnostic procedures including
      low-dose CT, high-dose CT, biopsy and histopathology.

      The study will enroll patients into one of three arms:

        1. patients with lung nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm but ≤ 35 mm that have been biopsied and diagnosed
           with primary lung cancer who have not yet initiated treatment of any kind for their lung
           cancer;

        2. patients with lung nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm but ≤ 35 mm that have been biopsied and determined
           to not be cancerous OR that have demonstrated no nodule growth for > 2 years by repeat
           CT imaging; and

        3. patients at high-risk for lung cancer (per NLST guidelines) with no evidence or history
           of lung cancer (negative LDCT/CT/X-ray).
