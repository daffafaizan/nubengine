      prostate cancer. Patients will be treated with L-377202 once every three weeks. Plasma
      concentrations of L-377202, liberated doxorubicin, and leu-doxorubicin will be obtained at
      defined time intervals throughout the study. At least 1 patient will be treated at each dose
      level until there is evidence of greater than or equal to Grade 2 drug-related toxicity. Each
      patient will be treated at only 1 dose level, although multiple cycles may be administered
      until signs of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are evident. Doses will be
      doubled for each subsequent cohort of patients until evidence of greater than or equal to
      Grade 2 drug-related toxicity. Upon documentation of greater than or equal to Grade 2
      drug-related toxicity, subsequent dose escalations will proceed along the modified Fibonacci
      scale and enroll at least 3 patients per dose level until 1 patient experiences dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT).
