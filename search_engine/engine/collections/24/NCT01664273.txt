      patients will be treated.

      Treatment procedure: Local anesthetic is applied to m. quadriceps femoris (thigh muscle) and
      the skin. An incision of the skin is performed followed by dissection until the muscle is
      exposed. The surgical procedure is performed by plastic surgeons.

      Plasmid AMEP is injected intramuscularly and immediately followed by application of electric
      pulses via a needle electrode inserted into the muscle. A combination of one high voltage
      pulse (700V/cm, 100 Âµs) followed by one low voltage pulse (80 V/cm, 400 ms) will be applied.
      The wound is sutured and a dressing is applied. Treatment procedure is estimated to 30
      minutes.

      All patients are hospitalized for 24 hours after treatment for the purpose of evaluation of
      vital signs, physical examination, AE and SAE recording and pharmacokinetics sampling (blood
      and urine).

      Blood biochemistry including LDH and CK is taken 24 hours post treatment. ECG will be taken
      before and after treatment. Patients score discomfort or pain from treated area using VAS.
