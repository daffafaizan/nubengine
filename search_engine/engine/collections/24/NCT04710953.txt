      Swenson described HAPE in 2002, as a form of hydrostatic acute pulmonary edema with an
      alteration of alveolar-capillary permeability. Overall prevalence of AMS is 10-20% while
      incidence of HAPE, HACE or mixed incidence is 2-3%. Highest reported incidence of HAPE among
      Indian soldiers climbing to Siachen glacier is 15.5%. At 1500-2400m, A series of 52 patients
      admitted for HAPE over a period of 9 years was reported in literature..

      Scientific rationale:

      Positive pressure has been used to increase altitude tolerance since the 1940s under
      simulated altitudes. PEEP applied via face mask increased SpO2 and decreased AMS symptoms.
      CPAP was used after ascent to 3205 m on Mount Cook in New Zealand where it improved SpO2 and
      reduced symptoms of HAPE. A CPAP helmet providing 15 cmH20 CPAP improved SpO2 in a single
      HAPE patient (at 5300 m) from 56% to 74%.-1st case report. A study at Thorang La pass (5416
      m) in October 2010 in the Nepal Himalaya found that nasal continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) is useful as an additional modality to treat presumed high altitude pulmonary edema
      (HAPE)- 2nd case report.
