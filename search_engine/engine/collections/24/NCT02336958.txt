      well as cranial nerves. So is the wall of the carotid arteries innervated by vagal and
      glossopharyngeal nerve as well as the sympathetic trunk. When carotid surgery was performed
      under regional anesthesia, so additional infiltration of local anesthetic by the surgeon was
      common, particularly during preparation of the carotid arteries.

      Introduction of ultrasound guidance made it possible to guide the needle directly to the
      vascular wall. But this procedure is considered very demanding, because of guiding the needle
      in an anatomical region with artifacts (because of calcification), sudden movements (e.g.
      because of swallowing) and compromised coagulation (antithrombotic medication). On the other
      side there are no clinical data proving the benefit of an additional perivascular
      infiltration with local anesthetic. Therefore, this investigation is testing the hypothesis,
      that an additional perivascular infiltration is associated with increased block quality.
