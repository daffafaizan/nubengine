      nucleus were enrolled. Patients were assigned to two groups: Group I: neutral IOL implanted
      in eye while in Group II, blue-blocking IOL was innovatively implanted in the eye.

      A cataract is a clouding of the crystalline lens inside the eye, which leads to a decrease in
      vision. It is the most prevalent, treatable cause of visual impairment and blindness in the
      world. Cataract surgery with an intraocular lens (IOL) implant is one of the most common and
      thought to be the most effective surgical procedure in any field of medicine.

      In this trial, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of cataract surgery on
      circadian rhythm and sleep as well as the effect of the blue light transmission
      characteristics of the implanted IOL on sleep. Patients enrolled into the study will be
      assessed in 3 months before the surgery and 3 months after the surgery.
