      most often present with severe pain and bleeding during defecation. The symptoms of chronic
      anal fissures persist for more than 8 weeks and do not respond well to medical treatment.
      This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of PRP on the healing of chronic
      anal fissures, which can be considered as nonhealing ulcers. High anal sphincter pressure can
      cause chronic anal fissures by producing mucosal ischemia in the posterior anal canal that
      delays wound healing, ultimately resulting in a chronic nonhealing ulcer. Increased anal
      sphincter pressure induces constipation and spasms in the arterioles that form the mucosal
      blood supply.9 Botulinum toxin, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or surgery promote
      healing by reducing anal sphincter pressure, and increasing blood flow.

      Autologous PRP has been shown to speed recovery and improve pain and quality of life scores
      of patients treated for chronic wounds.PRP reduced complaints and accelerated
      epithelialization and healing in patients with chronic anal fissures. PRP, which can be
      obtained easily and did not have any harmful patient effects may be an alternative to surgery
      in patients with chronic anal fissures. The duration of symptoms should be considered during
      the evaluation of treatment options.
