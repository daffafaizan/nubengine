      response rate (around 25%) in general Taiwan adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients, while the median
      overall survival time didn't longer than chemotherapy treated patients. A recent prospective
      study of gefitinib in chemonaive adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients showed that the objective
      response rate was lower to be only 1.1% among EGFR mutation negative patients.

      Since typical EGFR gene mutations (i.e., the deletion of typically five amino acids at codons
      746-750 (ELREA) in exon 19 and a leucine-to-arginine mutation at codon 858 (L858R)) are a
      good predictor for tumor response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor, this present study is to
      tailor the patient's treatment according to his/her EGFR gene mutation status. Receptor
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib in this study) will be the suggested second-line drug of
      recommendation for typical EGFR gene mutation patients, and chemotherapy (pemetrexed in this
      study) will be the suggested second-line drug of recommendation for EGFR wild type patients.

      The aim of this study is to increase the overall tumor response rate to 40% from current
      treatment outcome (around 25%) by this tailored second line treatment. The further interests
      of this study include prospectively evaluate the predictivity of EGFR gene mutation to tumor
      response.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall tumor response rate of
      tailored second line treatment determined by typical EGFR gene mutation in patients with
      advanced lung adenocarcinoma.
