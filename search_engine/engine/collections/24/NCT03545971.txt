    
      Phase Ia study will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design. The starting dose is 0.3
      mg/kg, followed by 3 dose cohorts (1mg/kg, 2mg/kg and 3mg/kg). Duration of dose limiting
      toxicity observation is 21 days. IBI310 treatment q3w, up to 3 cycles, will be provided to
      patients who complete DLT observation period.

      Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by RECIST v1.1. Patients' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity will be assessed
      throughout the study.

      Phase Ib study on the tolerability and safety of IBI310 combined with Sintilimab in patients
      with advanced melanoma. Phase Ib of the study will begin after DLT observation is completed
      in certain dose cohorts.
