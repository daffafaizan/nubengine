      leading cause of death in men. Following primary therapy for prostate cancer, a substantial
      number of patients will recur either locally in the pelvis or in extra pelvic locations.
      Approximately 20-30% of patients' status post RP will recur and up to 60% patients treated
      with EBRT will recur, as detected by rising serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      after original therapy. This phenomenon is referred to as biochemical recurrence (BCR), as
      the elevated PSA usually occurs in advance of obvious clinical or radiologic evidence.

      This study is designed to evaluate the performance of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT in detecting the
      location (localized versus extra pelvic) of BCR and advanced metastatic prostate cancer
      compared to conventional imaging. In addition, we will evaluate its performance in assessing
      interim and post salvage therapy response compared to conventional imaging, including pelvic
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy.
