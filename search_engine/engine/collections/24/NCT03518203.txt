      adults undergoing allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who will
      receive early therapy with eculizumab to prevent TMA-associated MODS after transplantation.
      The purpose of this research study is to examine efficacy of complement blocker eculizumab in
      HCT recipients with high risk TMA and to determine optimal eculizumab dosing regimen for HCT
      recipients with TMA using PK/PD studies. All patients will receive therapy based on their
      weight for 24 weeks. Survival will be assessed at 6 months from TMA diagnosis.
