      technology that integrates selected dynamic cardiovascular measurements, using the arterial
      pressure waveform, to predict impending intra-operative hypotensive episodes. In addition,
      the monitor provides a calculated (dp/dtmax), determined from the radial arterial pressure
      waveform as a guide to optimal therapeutic interventions. A recent study has demonstrated
      significant correlation between radial arterial dp/dtmax values calculated with the HPI
      software to those calculated using echocardiography in patients with acute heart failure in
      the cardiac ICU setting, especially in those with higher systemic vascular resistance, lower
      cardiac output, and lower stroke volumes.

      This study seeks to assess the strength of these correlations in the intra-operative setting
      in patients with normal and abnormal cardiac function. Corroboration of the reliability of
      this newer method of ascertaining Left ventricular contractility and quantifying the
      correlations in different settings will allow for more accurate and efficient clinical
      utilization of dp/dtmax in a larger number of clinical settings.
