      recruited. Stroke etiology will be determined by Neurologists based on clinical syndrome,
      vascular imaging features and concurrent cardiovascular risks. The time window for
      recruitment is 4 weeks from the qualifying stroke.

      After an informed consent for the study, potential candidates will undergo a cranial MRI and
      MR angiography. Patients who are found to have acute or subacute lacunar infarcts (defined as
      an infarct diameter < 15mm) in the territories supplied by the lateral lenticulostriate
      arteries, i.e. internal capsule, putamen, external capsular or corona radiata, will proceed
      to a 3-Dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) at baseline and in 12 months. All recruited
      patients will receive single antiplatelet agents and statin. Their cognition, mobility and
      treat cardiovascular risk factors based on 4 pre-specified goals (as elaborated in Study
      Procedures) will also be regularly reviewed.
