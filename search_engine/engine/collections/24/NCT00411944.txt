    
      A 5-year pharmacokinetic follow-up study in 95 renal allograft recipients assessing
      tacrolimus exposure using repeated abbreviated Area-Under-the-Concentration-time (AUC) curve
      measurements at regular time points after grafting. The effects of the CYP3A5*1, CYP3A4*1B,
      MDR1 G2677T/A and C3435T single nucleotide polymorphisms on the evolution of tacrolimus
      disposition are studied over 5 years in order to clarify the interrelationship between
      CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and MDR1 genotypes, time-dependent exposure and tacrolimus-related toxicity.
