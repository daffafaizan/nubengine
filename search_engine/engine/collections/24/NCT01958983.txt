      changes in emotions and personalities. Due to the changes in the frontal and temporal lobes
      of the brain, individuals with dementia often experience an impaired ability to judge
      situations. Empirical studies have indicated that cognitive stimulation is essential to
      facilitate individuals with dementia in thinking, concentration, and memory. Structured music
      activities provide cognitive stimulation to individuals with dementia through attentive
      listening and active participation. Additionally, drum improvisation not only reflects the
      current status of an individual, but also serves as an audio feedback through free play.
