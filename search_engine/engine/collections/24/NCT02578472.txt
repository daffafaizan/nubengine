      treatment the participant receives), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 3-way
      cross-over (the same medications provided to all participants but in different sequence),
      pilot study in healthy male and female participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 6 treatment and planning sequences. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening
      Phase (between 21 days and 1 day prior to the first dose administration), a 3-way crossover
      double-blind, single dose treatment Phase and follow-up Phase (7 to 10 days after last dose
      administration). The maximum study duration for each participant will not exceed 7 weeks. The
      double-blind crossover treatment phase will consist of 3 treatment periods separated by a
      washout period of at least 3 days between dosing. Participants will receive either Treatment
      A (2 capsules of 20 milligram [mg] JNJ-42847922), Treatment B (10 mg zolpidem and 1 placebo
      capsule) or Treatment C (2 placebo capsules) in each treatment period. Driving performance
      will be assessed primarily by the mean difference of standard deviation of lateral position
      (SDLP) from an on road driving test. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
