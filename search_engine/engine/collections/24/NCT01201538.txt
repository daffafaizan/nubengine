      overexpressed and activated in both sporadic and NF2 VS.It has also been shown pre-clinically
      that Imatinib induced a reduction in proliferation and cell viability, with increased
      apoptosis, in HEI-193 human NF2-null VS cells.Nilotinib is a newer generation RTK inhibitor,
      with a similar target profile as Imatinib. It was designed by modifying the Imatinib
      molecule62, and has 30-fold increased potency compared to IImatinib43. In clinical studies of
      patients with CML or GIST resistant to Imatinib, Nilotinib has demonstrated efficacy with
      minimal toxicity. Nilotinib (Tasigna®, code number AMN107) was first approved in 2007 for use
      in Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in the chronic or accelerated phase in patients
      resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Thus making Nilotinib an ideal drug to study in
      understanding its benefit in VS patients.
