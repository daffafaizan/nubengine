      operation, alleviates pain after knee replacement surgery. This is also a dose-finding study
      comparing two doses of dexamethasone.

      Total knee arthroplasty causes considerable pain. Multimodal analgesia and peripheral nerve
      blocks are used for treatment of pain. Some studies suggest that glucocorticoids alleviate
      postoperative pain. The optimal dose of dexamethasone in treatment of postoperative pain is
      not known. Studies on this subject in patients with total knee replacement are sparse.
      Potential side-effects of dexamethasone (hyperglycemia, wound infection) need to be studied.

      Patients coming for primary knee replacement surgery are enrolled. The patients in each study
      group receive multimodal therapy for postoperative pain: etoricoxib, paracetamol, gabapentin
      and oxycodone. A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone (0,15 mg/kg or 0,25 mg/kg) or a
      placebo (saline) is administered to the patient during the operation. The effect of
      dexamethasone on postoperative pain is observed: main outcome is dynamic pain at 24 h
      postoperatively. The extent of inflammatory reaction is measured (CRP). Serial blood glucose
      measurements are done.
