      rate, and duration of response in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, progressive
      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the toxicities and pharmacokinetics
      of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive acridine carboxamide IV over 24 hours
      for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until
      disease progression or commencement of another treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
