      as the reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants, is a major regulator of cellular
      functions. Impaired balance between pro- and antioxidants causes oxidative stress which may
      result in oxidation of proteins, lipids and DNA with the final outcome of premature cell
      aging and apoptosis [1,2]. Oxidatively stressed red blood cell (RBC) have been observed in
      various congenital and acquired hemolytic anemias, including thalassemia, sickle cell anemia,
      congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, G6PD deficiency and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
      (PNH) as well as in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although the primary etiology is
      different in these anemias, oxidative stress mediates several of their pathologies, mainly
      hemolysis [3].

      Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) is a genetic disorder of the RBC skeleton with primary
      deficiency in spectrin, ankyrin-1, band 3 or protein 4.2 associated with chronic hemolytic
      anemia [4]. Secondary protein deficiencies resulting from oxidative stress are often observed
      and may be involved in the clinical manifestations of the disease [5].
