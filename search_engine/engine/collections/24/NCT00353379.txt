      deficiencies in interpersonal relationships and disturbances in thought patterns, appearance,
      and behavior. This disorder is different from schizophrenia. While some of the symptoms of
      the two disorders are similar, such as the tendency to have unusual beliefs and behaviors,
      people with schizotypal personality disorder do not experience hallucinations and are not
      significantly disconnected from reality, both of which are signature symptoms of
      schizophrenia. Guanfacine is a drug that is often used to treat high blood pressure and
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There is evidence that guanfacine enhances
      cognition and diminishes impulsivity. This study will determine the effectiveness of
      guanfacine in improving symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder.

      Participants in this 6-week, double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      guanfacine or placebo. Participants receiving guanfacine will remain on the drug for the
      duration of the study. The other participants will receive placebo for the duration of the
      study. Guanfacine dosages will not exceed 2 mg per day. All participants will report to the
      study site weekly for assessments of vital signs, study compliance, medication side effects,
      and psychological symptoms. Additional cognitive testing will be performed at week 6. Upon
      study completion, patients will return for a follow-up assessment.
