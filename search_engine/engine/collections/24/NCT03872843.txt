      Subjects with a renal stones who are consented for a ureteroscopy will be eligible for the
      study. Subjects eligible for the study will have a discussion with the study team member
      about treatment options. Subjects can either elect not to be in the study and actively choose
      which treatment is preferable, or the subject can choose to enter the study and be randomized
      to one of these treatment arms. The ureteroscopy will be performed using standard of care
      instruments and techniques. No changes to operative technique will be performed for subjects
      in the study vs regular patients undergoing the same procedure. Post operatively;
      investigators plan to discharge all subjects home from the recovery unit. All subjects will
      be seen one week after surgery for follow up, questioner filling and stent removal.
