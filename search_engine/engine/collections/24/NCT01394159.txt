      the newly developed 22G ProCore needle for sampling pancreatic mass lesions during endoscopic
      ultrasound. Patients were randomized into the two needle groups and then various outcomes
      were compared between the two needle types, including the number of passes needed to
      establish a diagnosis, the ability to procure enough tissue sample to be able to make a
      diagnosis, the rates of needle failure and complication rates.
