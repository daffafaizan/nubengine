      disease. The risk of developing CVD is directly related to blood pressure (BP) level.
      Tripeptides IPP and VPP obtained from milk proteins were shown to have potential blood
      lowering effects. The renin-angiotensin system is one of the major pathways of BP regulation,
      and ACE inhibition is an important target for BP control. CasiGold and CasiMax are hydrolysed
      casein preparations consisting of relatively high concentrations tripeptides which have ACE
      inhibitory properties in vitro and which may have beneficial effects on blood pressure.

      Study population: 84 female and male Caucasians with a high-normal blood pressure or mild
      hypertension, aged 30 - 70 years at Day 01 of the study and with a BMI 18 - 32 kg/m2, will
      participate in the study.

      Intervention: All subjects receive all treatments, but in a different order. One of the
      treatments consists of daily consumption of two capsules Casigold containing IPP during a
      period of 4 weeks. One of the treatments consists of daily consumption of two capsules
      Casimax containing a mixture of tripeptides during a period of 4 weeks. And one of the
      treatments consists of daily consumption of two capsules placebo during a period of 4 weeks.
      One capsule will be taken upon completion of breakfast and one capsule will be taken upon
      completion of dinner.

      Main study parameters: The main study parameter is the blood pressure after 4 weeks of each
      treatment. Blood pressure will be measured at the study site on the two last days of each
      treatment period. Other study parameters include evaluation of safety at the end of each
      treatment period, and determination of genetic polymorphisms. Analysis of renin and
      angiotensin I and II will only be done in case a change in BP is found.
