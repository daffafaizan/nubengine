    
      An adaptive randomised, double-blind, single-centre, placebo-controlled Phase I study
      evaluating ECG effects, safety, tolerability and PK of single ascending doses of Modufolin®
      for Injection, 100 mg in healthy male volunteers. Thirty-three (33) eligible and consenting
      subjects will be included in 3 cohorts, 11 subjects in each cohort. Within each cohort,
      subjects will be randomised to receive either placebo (3 subjects) or Modufolin® for
      Injection, 100 mg (8 subjects). There will be 3 pre-defined ascending dose-levels. Additional
      dose levels may be considered if recommended by the internal Safety Review cCommittee. There
      will be an interval between each dose level to allow time for safety data to be analyzed and
      evaluated by the iSRC. The iSRC will have the choice to decide to escalate the dose as
      planned, reduce or increase the dose escalation step, repeat the dose, reduce the dose or
      terminate the study. The total study duration for the subjects will be approximately 5 weeks
      and there will be in total 3 visits to the clinic. Subjects will be screened for eligibility
      according to study-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria within 4 weeks prior to start of
      stud treatment (Visit 1; Screening visit). The subjects will be confined to the research
      clinic from the evening before dosing (Day -1) until 24 hrs post dose (Days 1 and 2). The
      subjects should be fasting overnight (8 hrs) before IMP/placebo administration until 4 hrs
      post-dose. A Follow-up Visit will be performed 5 to 10 days after dose administration of for
      each cohort.
