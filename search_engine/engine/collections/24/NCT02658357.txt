    
      The study will be a 6-month, open-label, study in approximately 50 stable subjects diagnosed
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of Risperidone and 9-OH-Risperidone following implantation of two or three,
      300 mg Risperidone Implants.

      Subjects who are diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-V
      and are stable on a daily 4 mg oral dose of Risperidone for at least 8 weeks will be
      recruited into the study.

      Subjects stable on a 4 mg oral dose of Risperidone will be implanted with two or three, 300
      mg, Risperidone Implants. All implants will be placed in the inner aspect of the upper arm.
      Plasma concentrations of Risperidone and the active moiety will be measured prior to
      placement of the Risperidone Implants, throughout the implantation period, and after
      re-converting to oral Risperidone following the removal of the Risperidone Implants.
