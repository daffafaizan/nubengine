      subjects with Advanced Diabetic Nephropathy (CKD stages 3 and 4) randomized into
      multifactorial intervention in the Diabetes-Renal Clinic (study group) and into usual care
      (control group). The multifactorial intervention includes the following: 1. Blood pressure
      control to the goal of <130/80mmHg and renal protection with reduction of proteinuria to
      <0.5g/day using a protocol that includes therapy with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or their
      combination. 2. Tight glucose control using SMBG and Lantus/Apidra self-escalation regimen.
      3. Use of hypolipidemic therapy to achieve targets of LDL of < 70 mg/dl, HDL > 40/50 mg/dl
      (males/females) [since you said that HDL is not a target because there are no meds for it I
      deleted HDL;] and triglycerides of less than 200 mg/dl. 4. Patient enhanced self-management
      provided by combined diabetes-renal education curriculum (taught by certified diabetes and
      renal educators). 5. Behavior and social intervention (motivational interviews and social
      assessment) provided as needed by social workers. 6. Intense case management that includes
      close follow-up of visits, laboratory monitoring and other self-adherence behaviors. 7.
      Weight loss with lifestyle and diet modification.

      Control Group will keep on receiving the usual treatment that they used to receive from their
      respective clinics and the Diabetes-Renal team would not alter their therapy or interfere in
      their management.
