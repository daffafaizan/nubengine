    
      Design, implement, and evaluate multi-level participatory interventions that can lead to a
      sustained reduction in arsenic exposure in adults and children in Cheyenne River, Oglala, and
      Spirit Lake communities in North/South Dakota by: 1) building local capacity at the tribal
      and community levels to ensure the long-term sustainability of the interventions. 2) conduct
      a 2-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing arsenic removal device only to removal
      device and intensive education and promotion among 300 households, 600 participants.
