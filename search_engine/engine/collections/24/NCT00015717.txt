      treatment for occlusive disease of the extracranial and the intracranial vessels. Temporary
      or permanent clinically detectable neurological deficits occur in up to 13% of all patients
      undergoing CASS and are usually related to distal embolization or hemodynamic insufficiency.
      Silent cerebral micro-emboli are known to occur in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy
      and angioplasty but are believed to be of little clinical significance. Distal embolization
      may be a technical concern when performing CCAS and could cause silent cerebral ischemia.
      High resolution diffusion-weighted MRI may detect silent hyperacute ischemic lesions in
      patients undergoing CCAS and examination by a stroke neurologist may detect clinical deficits
      otherwise unrecognized.
