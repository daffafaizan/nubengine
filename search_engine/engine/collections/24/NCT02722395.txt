      of the implementation for tumor motion management in liver SBRT. Compared to CT, MRI has many
      significant advantages for radiotherapy planning, including superior tumor and soft-tissue
      contrast, flexible imaging orientation, freedom from radiation exposure and real-time
      imaging. MRI solely based liver SBRT will allow for more precise delineation of target
      volume, less uncertainties in treatment planning, better motion management, and potentially
      better treatment outcome
