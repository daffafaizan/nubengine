        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate, in terms of proportion of those
           with measurable disease or bone metastases only, of patients with locally recurrent or
           metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with atrasentan (measurable disease stratum
           closed to accrual as of 7/16/04).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      immunotherapy/biologic therapy (yes vs no) and characteristic of disease (measurable vs bone
      metastases only) (measurable disease stratum closed to accrual as of 7/16/04).

      Patients receive oral atrasentan once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (90 per stratum [with or without prior therapy])
      will be accrued for this study within 6 months (based on prior accrual, the bone metastases
      only group [specifically patients who have received 1 prior therapy] is the only stratum open
      for accrual).
