      sub-acute, late sub-acute and chronic post-stroke patients. Other objectives include
      assessing the required doses of electrical current amplitudes, the usability of the device,
      and examining the overall safety.

      Many individuals experience weakness or paralysis of their arms and hands following a stroke.
      As a result, they are often unable to grasp and reach objects voluntarily and have difficulty
      performing basic activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing, feeding, bathing and
      grooming. Despite extensive rehabilitation programs, many of these individuals remain
      dependent on others for assistance with ADLs. This unmet medical need remains the focus of a
      wide range of research efforts.

      MyndMove is a newly developed Functional Electrical Stimulation based treatment designed to
      recover voluntary movement in severely paralyzed upper limbs following stroke and spinal cord
      injury.

      This study will enroll stroke patients that have severe hemiparesis of an upper limb (as
      defined by 1) an UE-FMA score of less than or equal to 19 and 2) a Chedoke McMaster Stage of
      1-2 for the arm and hand). Three cohorts of patients enrolled in the study will include:

        -  Early sub-acute stroke patients (less than 2 months post stroke) receiving therapy
           during inpatient rehabilitation;

        -  Late sub-acute stroke patients (post-discharge from inpatient rehab and less than 6
           months post stroke) receiving therapy in outpatient clinic settings; and

        -  Chronic stroke patients (greater than 6 months post stroke) receiving therapy in
           outpatient clinic settings
