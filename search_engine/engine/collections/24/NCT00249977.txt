      have been well described. The two drugs are synergistic.

      The standard of care for colon cancer is the combination of 5-FU, leucovorin and irinotecan
      (Saltz regimen). Recently, oxaliplatin has been introduced for the treatment of colon cancer.
      Combination of oxaliplatin with 5FU (Folfox4) have shown comparable activity to the Saltz
      regimen. Furthermore, one author recently published on the triple combination of oxaliplatin,
      5FU and irinotecan, with impressive clinical activity in colon cancer.

      There is some evidence that 5FU impairs DNA repair. One of the putative resistance mechanism
      to topoisomerase I inhibitors is increased DNA repair. We therefore hypothesize that
      inhibition of DNA repair by capecitabine may increase the activity of the combination of
      cisplatin and irinotecan.

      This study is open to all patients with solid tumor who have failed a line of chemotherapy
