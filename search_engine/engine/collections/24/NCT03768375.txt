      changes or abnormalities. immuno-histochemistry tests reveal the abnormal activation status
      of signal pathways involved in study.These information will be used to recommend target
      therapy which may be more likely to result in a beneficial response.Patients will receive
      target anti-tumor agents according to the result of genomic and proteomic profiling.
