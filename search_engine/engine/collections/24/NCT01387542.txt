    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized (the
      study drug is not assigned by chance) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      paliperidone ER in adult Thai schizophrenia participants. The study consists of a screening
      phase and an open-label treatment phase. Study duration will be 10 weeks and participants can
      either be inpatient or outpatient. The recommended paliperidone ER starting and maintenance
      dose will be 6 milligram (mg) per day for most participants. Throughout the study, flexible
      dosing ranging from 3 to 12 mg per day may be used at the discretion of the investigator.
      Throughout the study, participants will be evaluated for efficacy using clinician rating
      (Clinical and Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] scale, and Personal and Social Performance
      Scale [PSP]) scales. Safety of the participants will be monitored.
