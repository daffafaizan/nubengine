      because there may be differences in biology between tumors which are stable or responding to
      therapy and those that are clinically progressing, this study, CA209064, looked at two
      sequential combination regimens in which the second agent is administered immediately after a
      pre-specified duration of therapy with the first agent and not delayed until the time of
      progression after the first agent. This sequential study design looked at pharmacodynamic
      changes during treatment with one agent which may predict clinical activity to subsequent
      treatment with the alternate agent. This was done because it has not been scientifically
      proven whether or not the order in which nivolumab and ipilimumab are given is clinically
      important.
