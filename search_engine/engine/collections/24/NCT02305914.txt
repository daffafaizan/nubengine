      However, it has been shown that AP is associated to some extent with other diseases such as
      chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, pancreatogenic portal hypertension and autoimmune
      pancreatitis; In addition, for patients who have severe lung injury following AP, especially
      with PaO2/FiO2<200 during ICU stay, the long term prognosis remains unclear. Thus, a large
      sample follow-up study is essential for elucidating the possible long-term complications.

      Prior to follow up study, the investigators performed baseline analysis of AP patient data
      from the database of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. It is estimated
      that 1300 patients will be interviewed over telephone and 600 patients in the outpatient
      department. The content of the follow-up includes: questionnaire (the MOS[medical outcome
      study] item short from health survey, SF[short form]-36) ; lab testing(complete blood count,
      blood chemistry such as liver and kidney function, C-reaction protein(CRP), AMY, fasting
      blood-glucose，1 and 2 hour postprandial blood glucose,C-peptide, blood lipids, FE-1) and CT
      scan. For patients who have severe lung injuries during ICU stay, pulmonary function test,
      Blood gas analysis and chest CT will be performed. After screening, the patients with chronic
      pancreatitis(CP), pancreatic cancer(PC), post Pancreatogenic portal hypertension（PPH） or
      autoimmune pancreatitis(AIP）will be hospitalized for further therapy.
