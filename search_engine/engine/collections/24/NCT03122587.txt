      development and maintenance of substance use disorders. Findings suggest that differential
      DLPFC engagement during affective and cognitive processing, and in particular, distress
      tolerance, in substance use disorder may be malleable, providing a promising intervention.
      Modulating neural oscillations with non-invasive, safe brain stimulation by targeting regions
      such as the DLPFC may provide an avenue to improve distress tolerance and inhibitory control
      in SUD. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may be a particularly promising
      approach as it is a safe and non-invasive method of electric stimulation that has the
      potential to effectively modulate neural network and circuit dynamics, more closely aligning
      with a network-based conceptualization of affective and cognitive processesThis study will
      test the effects of tACS on distress tolerance and inhibitory control among treatment-seeking
      adults with substance use disorder.
