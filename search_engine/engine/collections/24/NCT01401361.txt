      meet the eligibility criteria will receive ablation therapy for typical atrial flutter using
      the Contact Therapy™ Cool Path™ Cardiac Ablation System. Historical data from published (PMA
      P060019 Cool Path) , reported (IDE G090109 Cool Path Duo) and published literature on Atrial
      Flutter RF ablation studies is used to determine performance goals for primary study
      endpoints and derive the sample size. In addition, the following analyses will be performed
      in the study

        1. Validation of ECI against conventional methods of assessing tip tissue contact and

        2. Ancillary analysis to assess the relationship between the ECI and study outcomes.
           Subjects will undergo two follow up visits at day 10 and month 3 post procedure. The
           following assessments will be performed during these visits:

             -  ECG

             -  Query regarding adverse events since the last visit

             -  Assessment of anti-arrhythmic and anti-coagulation medication

             -  Query regarding recurrence or repeat ablation for typical atrial flutter
