      improving function in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome (subacromial impingement).
      It remains unknown if individuals respond differently to different manipulation techniques.
      This study examines the immediate effects on pain and short-term effects on pain and function
      using the Penn Shoulder Score (PSS) as well as the immediate effects on scapular kinematics
      (upward rotation and posterior tilt, specifically), pectoralis minor muscle length, and
      scapulothoracic muscle force production for the middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and
      serratus anterior.
