        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of SU5416 and paclitaxel in patients
           with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.

        -  Determine the antiangiogenesis effect of this combination regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity, pharmacodynamic effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters of this
           combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over one hour on day 1 and SU5416 IV over one hour on days 1
      and 4. Treatment continues weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and SU5416 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-15 months.
