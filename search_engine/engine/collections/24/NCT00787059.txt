      Ad5.hAC6 (adenovirus-5 encoding human adenylyl cyclase type 6) can be given safely to
      patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and 2) whether this agent may be of benefit in
      heart failure. Gene transfer is a process by which genes are introduced into cells and the
      cells then produce the specific protein that the gene directs, in this case, a protein known
      as adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6). The gene is carried into the heart cells by a modified
      virus. The virus that is modified is an adenovirus (Ad5), a virus that sometimes causes a
      brief cold. In extensive animal experiments, it was found that increased amounts of AC6
      protein in heart cells appear to make the heart pump more vigorously.
