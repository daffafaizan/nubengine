      ischemia using regadenoson low-dose dynamic computed tomography myocardial perfusion (CTP) in
      patients diagnosed with intermediate coronary artery stenoses in referrence to the magnetic
      resonance myocardial perfusion imaging (MR MPI).

      The main objectives of the study are:

        -  to evaluate feasibility of low - dose regadenoson dynamic computed tomography myocardial
           imaging protocol

        -  to assess the diagnostic value of quantitative dynamic CTP based absolute parameters
           (myocardial blood flow - MBF, myocardial blood volume - MBV, perfused capillary blood
           volume - PCBV, peak value - PV, time to peak - TTP) in reference to magnetic resonance
           myocardial perfusion imaging

        -  to assess the diagnostic value of quantitative dynamic CTP based relative parameters
           (relative myocardial blood flow - MBFR, relative myocardial blood volume - MBVR,
           relative perfused capillary blood volume - PCBVR, relative peak value - PVR, relative
           time to peak - TTPR) in reference to magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging

        -  evaluation of safety of regadenoson low-dose dynamic CTP.
