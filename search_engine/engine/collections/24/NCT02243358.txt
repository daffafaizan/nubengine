    
      The primary objective is to evaluate frequency of achieving complete resection ( RO resection
      )in patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer treated with a
      neoadjuvant regimen of FOLFOX followed by radiation therapy (RT) concurrent with gemcitabine
      chemotherapy at standard dosing.

      Secondary objectives are to determine overall survival and progression-free survival as a
      function of time from study enrollment and to evaluate tolerability and toxicity of protocol
      treatment.

      Eligible patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer will be accrued
      onto protocol therapy, which would include a neo-adjuvant phase followed by surgical
      resection. A cycle of FOLFOX treatment is 14 days. 2 cycles are intended prior to combined
      modality treatment. Combined modality treatment will begin 2 weeks (plus or minus 2 days)
      after the last FOLFOX administration. (Gemcitabine 1000mg/mÂ² will be infused over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 during the 5-week course of radiation treatment. The surgical
      procedure performed will be that required for a complete resection, and this will be based on
      the discretion of the operating surgeon. Patients will be followed for 1 year after
      completion of neoadjuvant therapy or until removal or termination from study, or until death,
      whichever occurs first. Patients will be seen in follow-up ever 3+/- 1 months for 1 year from
      completion of protocol therapy.
