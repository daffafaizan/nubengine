      early stage HER-2 expressing breast cancer, because it decreases the risk of relapse.

      Transtuzumab affects cardiac function and potential benefits in decreasing cancer recurrence
      have to be balanced against short and long term toxicity.

      We have previously identified a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes
      mellitus in our patients with breast cancer. These patients may be particularly susceptible
      to cardiotoxic effects of transtuzumab based therapy.

      Aim of this study is to assess the changes in the cardiac function of women who are
      undergoing transtuzumab based therapy for early stage breast cancer.
