    
      This two arm randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effect of telephone follow-up
      versus standard in-person follow-up (usual care) on patient satisfaction among a sample of
      360 primary care patients followed at the Gouverneur Ambulatory Care Practice. All primary
      care patients will be considered eligible at the outset. Providers will determine patient's
      study eligibility at the baseline visit based on the ability to safely follow-up the
      patient's health issue over the telephone in subsequent visits. Eligible patients that are
      randomized to the telephone follow-up arm will have their next medical visit with their
      primary care provider via a telephone call. Eligible patients that are randomized to the
      usual care arm will have a standard in-person clinic visit with their primary care provider.
      In both study arms, the timing and frequency of follow-up appointments will be determined by
      the patient's primary care provider. Regardless of group assignment, outcomes will be
      assessed at the baseline and 6-month study visit.
