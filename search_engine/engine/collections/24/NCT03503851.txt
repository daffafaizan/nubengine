    
      Implantation of the MitraClip has become the most frequently used percutaneous technique to
      treat significant (grade 3+ or 4+) mitral regurgitation (MR) in elderly patients deemed
      inoperable or at high surgical risk. In Europe, about two-thirds of patients treated with the
      MitraClip suffer from MR of functional origin secondary to ischemic or dilated
      cardiomyopathy. At present, there is debate among operators on whether stabilizing/supporting
      a single adequately implanted clip with a second clip is beneficial for patients with
      functional MR.

      Purpose To demonstrate the noninferiority of a 1-clip strategy vs. a 2-clip strategy of
      MitraClip implantation, when the second clip in the 2-clip study arm is implanted for
      stabilizing/supporting purposes.
