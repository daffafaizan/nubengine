      to be effective treatment for many malignant diseases in human. Antibodies can mediate
      cytotoxicity through complement dependent cytotoxicty (CDC), antibody dependent cell mediated
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) or apoptosis.

      AbGn-7 was identified based on its direct killing (apoptosis-inducing) activities towards
      cancer cells expressing its epitope. In vitro data also demonstrated its ability to elicit
      CDC and ADCC. The in vivo xenograft study of AbGn-7 demonstrated that AbGn-7 alone or in
      combination with chemotherapeutic agents successfully suppressed the growth of gastric,
      pancreatic, and colorectal tumours. The NHP study proved the safety profile of AbGn-7. The
      present Phase 1 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AbGn-7
      alone in patients with solid tumors of epithelial origin (Phase 1a) and in combination with a
      current chemotherapeutic regimen FOLFOX7 in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or
      metastatic gastric carcinoma (Phase 1b).
