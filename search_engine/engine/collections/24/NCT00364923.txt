    
      This is a Phase 2, single arm, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center study designed to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pralatrexate when administered with vitamin B12 and
      folic acid supplementation to patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL.

      Pralatrexate will be given over 3-5 minutes intravenously (IV), which means through a vein.
      If pralatrexate is tolerated well, the patient will receive IV injections of pralatrexate
      every week for 6 weeks, followed by 1 week without receiving pralatrexate. These 7 week
      cycles will be repeated depending on response and tolerability.
