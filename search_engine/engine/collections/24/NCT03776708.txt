      should be challenged by a validated sham procedure, regionally and remotely over time.
      Further information is needed concerning its duration and its size.

      Research questions:

        1. What is the regional effect of spinal manipulation on the pressure pain threshold in
           asymptomatic subjects, when compared to a valid sham procedure?

        2. What is the remote effect of spinal manipulation on the pressure pain threshold in
           asymptomatic subjects, when compared to a valid sham procedure?

        3. What is the duration of the effect of spinal manipulation on the pressure pain threshold
           in asymptomatic subjects?

        4. What is the size of the effect of spinal manipulation on the pressure pain threshold in
           asymptomatic subjects over time?
