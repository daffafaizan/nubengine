      university and engineers of naki medical co., ltd. in Hong Kong independently developed an
      ai-assisted diagnostic model of digestive endoscopy in the early stage, namely the deep
      learning modelã€‚The deep learning model through the early stage of the study, is able to
      identify lesions of colon polyps, colorectal cancer, colorectal apophysis lesions, colonic
      diverticulum, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcer, gastric polyps, submucosal uplift, reflux
      esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, esophageal polyp, esophageal erosion, esophageal ectopic
      gastric mucosa and esophagus varicosity, esophageal cancer, esophageal papilloma, etc.The
      sensitivity for the diagnosis of some diseases, such as colon polyps, is 99%. On the one
      hand, this auxiliary diagnostic model can guide endoscopic examination for beginners; on the
      other hand, it can improve the detection rate of lesions and reduce the rate of missed
      diagnosis; on the other hand, the overall operating efficiency of the endoscopic center is
      improved, which is conducive to the quality control of endoscopic examination. Now the
      AI-assisted diagnostic model has been further improved, and it is planned to carry out
      further clinical verification in the digestive endoscopy center of our hospital. It is
      connected to the endoscopic system of our hospital and used simultaneously with the existing
      image-text system of endoscopy to compare the practicability, sensitivity and specificity of
      AI-assisted diagnosis model in the diagnosis of digestive tract diseases, and focus on the
      quality control of endoscopic examination.
