      surfactant followed by CPAP have a shorter length of respiratory support (length of time on a
      ventilator and CPAP) than similar infants who are treated with MV after surfactant therapy;
      and to examine secondary outcomes including outcomes related to lung disease, feeding issues
      and hospital length of stay (secondary outcomes).

      Hypothesis: The use of CPAP after surfactant in infants born 28 to 32 weeks with RDS will
      reduce the length of respiratory support as compared with infants treated with MV. We
      hypothesize that the incidence of lung disease and feeding issues will be similar between
      groups while length of hospital stay will be shorter in the CPAP group.

      Methods: A multi-center, randomized trial conducted in seven neonatal intensive care units in
      Canada and France. Parents will be approached for consent prior to delivery or after the
      infant shows signs of RDS. Infants 28 to 32 weeks gestation with RDS will be eligible for the
      study. After intubation and surfactant administration, babies will be randomized to either
      receive CPAP or MV. Strict criteria for CPAP failure, weaning ventilation and weaning and
      discontinuing CPAP will be specified. Infants will be followed in the nursery until hospital
      discharge or until all outcomes have been determined.
