      terms of expenditures, the development of efficient strategies based on the identification
      and the correction of risk factors of institutionalization of AD patients proves necessary.

      While it has been identified that institutionalization date depends on patients' health
      characteristics, the role of social, economic and environmental factors still remains few
      known.

      The investigators hypothesized that institutionalization of AD patients could be related not
      only to medico-neuropsychological patients' characteristics but also to socio-economic and
      environmental characteristics of dyad (i.e., AD patient and spouse carer), that could modify
      the delay of institutionalization.
