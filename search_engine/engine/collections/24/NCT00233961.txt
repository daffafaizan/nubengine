        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of harvesting adequate numbers of CD34-positive
           peripheral blood stem cells using filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with chronic phase
           chronic myeloid leukemia in complete cytogenetic remission.

        -  Determine the safety of temporarily discontinuing treatment with imatinib mesylate and
           using G-CSF during the harvesting procedure, in terms of the percentage of Philadelphia
           chromosome (Ph)-positive cells before and after stem cell harvest, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) and then undergo apheresis for up to 5 days.

      After completion of apheresis, patients resume treatment with imatinib mesylate off study.
      Patients may later undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, when deemed
      necessary.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
