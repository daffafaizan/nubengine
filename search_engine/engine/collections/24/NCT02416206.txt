      high-dose bendamustine-based preparative regimen (BeEAM). The primary endpoint of this trial
      will be the rate of CR at day 100 post-transplant. Experience from the literature, as well as
      results from our institution, suggests that following ASCT for the upfront treatment of
      myeloma, the rate of CR at day 100 post-transplant is approximately 45%. It is hoped that
      under this protocol, this rate will be at least 65%. Thus we statistically formalize this
      study by testing the null hypothesis that p, the CR rate is 0.65 or more versus the
      alternative hypothesis that p is less than 0.45. A sample size of 65 pts gives 90% power with
      an alpha=0.05, using the formula for a one sample binomial (two-sided) test of a proportion.
