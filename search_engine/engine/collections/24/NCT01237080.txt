      surgery and anesthesia in obese patients becomes more frequent. Several potential problems
      related to anesthesia in this patient group exists, including airway management and
      sufficient oxygenation.

      Anaesthesia of obese patients are more likely to require intubation. In light of the
      foregoing, it is therefore important to find the methods that provide the fewest
      complications related to intubation. Therefore this study compare two instruments (Fastrach
      TM and GlideScope Â®) to find out which of the methods that provides the best airway
      management, measured primarily in time and numbers of intubation attempts.
