      and/or susceptibility of AD. Thus, subjects with AD and family members when there is a strong
      history of AD are being recruited. Data collection includes a blood sample, clinical
      phenotype data from hospital records, standardized assessment scales (e.g. Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Functional
      Activities Questionnaire (FAQ-IADL), tests of mental function (Mini Mental State Examination
      (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE)) and family and lifestyle/environmental
      questionnaire. Furthermore are control subjects being recruited where data includes a blood
      sample, MMSE and a lifestyle/environmental questionnaire.

      Initial genetic analyses will focus on known genetic risk factors for AD by looking at the
      most highly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in loci harboring e.g. apolipoprotein
      E (APOE)/Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40 (TOMM40), MAPT, Phosphatidylinositol
      Binding Clathrin Assembly Protein (PICALM). Subsequent analyses will focus on genome-wide
      array genotyping of ~ 1.8 million markers, e.g. to accommodate the population structure.
      Finally, patients with a family history of AD who cannot be explained by the before mentioned
      analysis will be subject to exome sequencing. Exposure analyses will focus on persistant
      organic pollutants, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), perfluorinated alkylated
      substances (PFAS) and also mercury.

      The investigators believe the Faroese population presents a unique opportunity to more
      readily identify genetic and environmental factors involved in AD due to its characteristics
      as a geographic, environmental and genetic isolate with a homogeneous genetic background.
