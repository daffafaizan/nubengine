      in a significant reduction of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarctions . Thus,
      interventions to lower the "total serum cholesterol" are commonly employed by medical
      professionals - this includes behavioral modifications (exercise, dieting, and weight loss)
      and pharmacological interventions.

      Investigation has shown that clinical outcomes do not only rely on "total serum cholesterol".
      "Total serum cholesterol" is comprised of multiple subtypes - most notable are "HDL
      Cholesterol" and "LDL cholesterol". Analysis of the data has shown that high levels of LDL
      cholesterol predict higher rates of cardiovascular events, while high levels of HDL
      cholesterol are actually predictive of significantly less cardiovascular events. These
      effects are independent of other cardiovascular risk factors .

      The mechanism by which LDL cholesterol results in heart disease has been intensely
      investigated and elucidated. Numerous drugs are now approved and utilized by physicians to
      lower the LDL cholesterol of patients to prevent primary and secondary cardiovascular
      disease.

      Epidemiological data show that low levels of HDL-C place individuals at higher risk for
      coronary artery disease while high levels of HDL-C actually decrease an individual's risk .
      The mechanism behind this risk reduction remains unclear and is likely multi-factorial.
      Furthermore, some data suggests that while HDL-C is important in risk reduction, it is not
      necessarily the measured serum level of HDL-C, but also the composition, oxidation state,
      metabolism of the HDL-C that determines an individual's cardiac risk . Understanding of this
      mechanism could lead to potential therapeutic targets as well as clinically relevant
      diagnostic testing.
