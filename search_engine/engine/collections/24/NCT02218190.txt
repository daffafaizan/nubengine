      incidence of post-operative ileus (POI) and concomitant increased length of hospital stay
      (LOHS). POI is exacerbated by high dose opiate consumption often required by these patients
      post-operatively. We propose a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial
      studying the use of alvimopan, a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist known to
      reduce POI in bowel resection. We hypothesize that alvimopan will shorten POI in spine fusion
      patients without negatively affecting post-operative pain control. Treatment efficacy will be
      assessed by recording time to first bowel movement, time to hospital discharge, and
      post-operative pain control.

      We hypothesize that acute administration of alvimopan, a peripherally-acting mu-opioid
      antagonist, shortens the duration of post-operative ileus (POI) in patients undergoing
      long-segment (5 or greater thoracolumbar levels) posterior spinal fusion (PSF). The study
      will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Reducing the morbidity
      of POI in patients undergoing PSF will decrease hospital stay and costs, and also improve
      patient satisfaction and post-operative care after major orthopaedic surgery.
