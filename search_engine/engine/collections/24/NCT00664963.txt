      the coronary arteries, we assume that YUKON-BTX-Sirolimus-eluting stent has a superior
      restenosis rate compared to treatment with uncoated stent in the below-the-knee arteries
      consecutively. The purpose of this study is to compare the restenosis rate of the treatment
      with balloon-expandable YUKON-BTX-Sirolimus-eluting stent over the treatment with YUKON-BTX
      uncoated stent in patients with ischemic infrapopliteal arterial disease. Randomisation will
      be performed by extremity, that may lead to varying treatments within one patient during the
      study.
