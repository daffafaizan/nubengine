      aims of this study are to define evidence-based, safe and effective upper and lower limits of
      the plasma concentrations of imipenem, meropenem, amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, piperacillin,
      ceftazidime and cefepime in patients at increased risk of serious bacterial infections and
      currently understudied pharmacokinetics (the critically ill, the elderly, and the
      immunosuppressed).

      This prospective observational study will include adult patients with suspected or confirmed
      systemic bacterial infection receiving one of the above-named antibiotics and hospitalized in
      intensive-care, step-down, or hematology-oncology units of the Geneva University Hospitals
      (HUG).

      Eligible patients will be identified via the electronic health record (EHR). Patients
      receiving traditional intermittent dosing or prolonged infusions will undergo TDM for at
      least one intermediate (mid-interval) and one trough level at 24 hours (-12 or +48 hours)
      after the therapy's start. Patients receiving continuous infusions will undergo TDM for at
      least one steady-state level. Clinical course will be observed for 30 days from the start of
      the study antibiotic (1st day of study antibiotic =day 1).

      The primary outcome is incidence of clinical toxicity through day 30 after start of study
      antibiotic (as stratified by BL trough concentration). Secondary outcomes are listed below.
