      development of mucocutaneous telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations in organs such as
      brain, lung, liver and tube digestivo. Is considered a rare disease, although It means that
      there is a substantial underdiagnosis. The overall prevalence is 1/5000.

      Approximately 60% of the general population hosts strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S.
      aureus) intermittently and are called intermittent carriers, 20% represent persistent
      carriers harboring the same strain of S. aureus and 20% of the population are never carriers.

      On this concept, one might think that HHT patients in whom there is an active and
      pathological vascular remodeling that causes bleeding, and inflammation is a known activator
      of abnormal angiogenesis; reducing an inflammatory factor as microbial through the
      eradication of nasal S. aureus could be useful to reduce bleeding in this population,
      directly impacting on quality of life.
