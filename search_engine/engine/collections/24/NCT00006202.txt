      supplementation of lutein with the resulting serum levels of lutein in people over age 60 who
      may or may not have AMD. Secondary objectives are to investigate the relationship between
      level of disease and lutein absorption and to assess change in macular pigment. Assessment of
      macular pigment is not routinely performed in this patient population. Including this
      assessment in the current study will further attempts to standardize its implementation. If
      results appear to warrant further study, a placebo-controlled study may be appropriate.
      Patients will range from those with no AMD and little or no drusen in either eye through end
      stage AMD (geographic atrophic, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, or other signs of
      neovascular/exudative disease) in the eye with worst disease. AMD severity will be classified
      using Age-Related Eye Disease Study criteria for the definition of advanced AMD (Appendix 2).
      Development of a safety profile is not a specific objective of this study. To this point in
      time, the available published data have not indicated any safety concerns. However, due to
      the lack of complete knowledge of potential toxicities, safety assessments will be performed
      at all scheduled study visits. These safety assessments include: visual acuity, complete
      ophthalmic examination, fundus photos, liver function tests, visual field tests, and a
      side-effect questionnaire from the AREDS. Should safety concerns arise, adverse event rates
      can be compared to the AREDS, which is based on the same study population.
