    
      Our aim is to perform MR Spectroscopy (MRS) on 150 patients at the end of their clinically
      indicated routine breast MRI guided biopsy and breast MRI guided needle localization
      examination using a software package from General Electric Medical Systems (Milwaukee,WI).
      This will add time to the routine examination but will not involve additional injections of
      contrast. We will analyze the spectroscopic data to determine if benign lesions can be
      reliably differentiated from malignant ones. The MR Spectroscopy (MRS) will be administered
      at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, NY,NY 10021.
