      bupivacaine (Exparel) and continuous epidural blocks in patients who are scheduled for major
      lower abdominal surgery. To assess whether TAP block with Exparel is noninferior to
      continuous epidural analgesia on pain management, defined as noninferior for both pain
      control and total opioid consumption for 72 hours, in patients who had major lower abdominal
      surgery.
