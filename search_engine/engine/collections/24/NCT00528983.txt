    
      Optional Extension Phase (OEP) to the AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 study which allows subjects who
      continue to receive oral azacitidine and have stable disease or are demonstrating clinical
      benefit as assessed by the Investigator, and have consented to participate, may enter the OEP
      of this study (at their current doses) at the start of their next cycle.

      Subjects who are entering the OEP should be discontinued from Part 1 or Part 2 protocol
      prescribed therapy in the AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 study.

      Subjects may continue to receive oral azacitidine in the OEP until they meet the criteria for
      study discontinuation or oral azacitidine becomes commercially available. Subjects
      discontinuing from the OEP will have an OEP discontinuation visit 28 days after the last dose
      of study drug or at study withdrawal.

      Primary Objective of OEP is to evaluate long term safety of oral azacitidine.
