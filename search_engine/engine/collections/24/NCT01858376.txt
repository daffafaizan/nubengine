      lipid profile, platelet aggregation and high-sensitivity C - reactive protein in 30
      volunteers at risk for cardiovascular disease.

      -Herbal Polyphenols/Antioxidants: Role in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: Phenolic
      compounds are dietary antioxidants found in plants that are shown to inhibit LDL oxidation,
      inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion, decrease total and LDL cholesterol, and induce
      endothelium-dependent vaso-relaxation. [Lapointe, Vita, and Mendes]. Epidemiologic studies
      suggest that higher polyphenol intake from fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased
      risk for cardiovascular disease. Among the numerous plausible mechanisms by which polyphenols
      may offer cardiovascular protection, improvement of the endothelial function and inhibition
      of angiogenesis and cell migration and proliferation in blood vessels have been the focuses
      of recent studies. Antioxidants in polyphenols, in addition to protecting LDL cholesterol
      against oxidation, may act at a vascular cell level by limiting cellular production of
      reactive oxygen species, and, thus, cell-mediated LDL oxidation. In traditional Indian
      medicine, the gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica) has been used for thousands of years as an
      effective source of polyphenols and antioxidants. "P. emblica is considered beneficial
      against various diseases namely cancer, diabetes, liver treatment, and various other
      diseases."[Hiraganahalli]. CaprosÂ®, from Natreon, Inc., is a cascading antioxidant ingredient
      derived from Phyllanthus emblica. It has been used in cosmetics and food-and-beverage
      formulations in many countries, and, based on extensive scientific research, also shows
      particular promise as a dietary supplement.
