    
      This is a first phase I study in HGSOC patients with primary disease eligible for standard of
      care treatment with either; complete or optimal primary cytoreductive surgery followed by 6
      cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel); or 3 cycles of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by complete or optimal cytoreductive interval
      surgery and 3 additional cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel.

      In the current study, DCP-001 vaccinations will be scheduled after standard of care
      treatment, starting 6 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy.

      Patients will receive 4 vaccinations containing 25E6 DCP-001 cells per vaccination followed
      by 2 additional booster vaccinations of 10E6 cells. Each patient will be followed up for 24
      months. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Systemic immune responses are
      determined by standard immune assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
      serum collected before, during and after vaccinations. Progression of disease will be
      monitored according to standard-of-care follow-up.
