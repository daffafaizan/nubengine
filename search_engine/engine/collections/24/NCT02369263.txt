    
      For subjects with suspicion of DVT to the Emergency Department, an EM Resident will perform a
      bedside non-diagnostic two point compression DVT Ultrasound. Subjects will then receive a
      diagnostic DVT Ultrasound in the Radiology Department with official radiologist
      interpretation. The bedside ultrasound will not interfere with or delay the diagnostic
      ultrasound. Patient demographic and clinical data will be collected for validation purposes.
      Validation of the The EM Resident interpretation will be accomplished by comparison to the
      official Radiologist interpretation.
