    
      KER-050 is a therapeutic protein designed to increase red blood cell and platelet production
      by inhibiting the signaling of a subset of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ÃŸ) family
      of proteins to promote hematopoiesis. It is being developed for the treatment of low blood
      cell counts, or cytopenias including anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients with
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Myelofibrosis (MF).
