           blood transfusions in allogeneic liver transplantation patients were performed to screen
           preoperative variables.

        2. Models were established by machine learning algorithms to predict a large number of
           blood transfusions during surgery, providing a reference for preoperative blood
           preparation and postoperative outcome.
