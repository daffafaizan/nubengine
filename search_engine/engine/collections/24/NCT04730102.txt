      rectal lumen by a purse string suture, rectal washout is performed with a total of 500 ml
      sterile water. Fluid samples are collected after every 100 ml by instilling 50 ml of saline
      after each washout. A sixth sample is collected from the presacral cavity. Each sample is
      cytologically examined by a pathologist and labelled either malignant or non-malignant.
