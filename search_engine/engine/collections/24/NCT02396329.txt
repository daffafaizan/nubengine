      protocol versus povidone- iodine protocol used as preoperative skin antisepsis for patients
      undergoing cesarean section in reduction of surgical site infection.Chlorhexidine is a
      chemical antiseptic. It is effective on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria,
      although it is less effective with some Gram-negative bacteria. It has both bactericidal and
      bacteriostatic mechanisms of action, the mechanism of action being membrane disruption.

      Iodine is commonly used as an antiseptic agent clinically. Iodine is usually formulated as an
      iodophor, which consists of iodine combined with a carrier molecule. This formulation
      increases the solubility of iodine and provides a reservoir for sustained release. The most
      commonly used iodophor is povidone iodine which is a 10% iodophor solution that contains 1%
      available iodine. Iodine molecules penetrate microbial cell walls and cause oxidation of
      cysteine, iodination of amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids. This leads to reduced
      protein synthesis and bacterial cell wall damage.
