      the anatomic radical perineal prostatectomy. The anatomic radical perineal prostatectomy is
      standard-of-care surgical approach to the surgical management of localized prostate cancer.
      The operative technique selected for radical prostatectomy is largely based on patient
      preference after appropriate counseling, and surgeon recommendation based on surgical
      considerations and surgeon experience. Outcome data for the anatomic radical perineal
      prostatectomy will represent a valuable addition to the published body of literature. Our
      study is a prospective clinical outcome data collection and analysis and we will be looking
      at data within several domains. First, perioperative data will be collected to evaluate the
      OR time, blood loss, surgical complications, and length of hospital stay for the anatomic
      radical perineal prostatectomy. Second, oncologic efficacy of this procedure will be
      reported, based on margin status of surgical specimens, which will be correlated with tumor
      features (Gleason score, tumor volume, pre-op PSA score). Third, functional outcomes will be
      evaluated by comparing urinary, sexual, and bowel function in the pre-op and post-op
      settings. This third domain will be accomplished by employing the following validated
      questionnaires (attached - SHIM, IPSS, and EPIC-26). These questionnaires will be filled out
      at 3 time-points: pre-op, and at 3 months and 12 months post-operatively.
