      cell transplantation (AATT) in patients with refractory leukemia will be evaluated in a
      clinical setting. The current study is limited only for patients with refractory disease that
      received and failed up to 2 lines of salvage therapy, in good performance status and younger
      than 50 years old. Only patients that will achieve complete remission after transplant I,
      will have no major organ dysfunction and with acceptable performance status, will be treated
      with transplant II. Close monitoring with strict stopping rules including in case of excess
      transplant related morality, acute or chronic GVHD or graft failure will be employed.

      Treatment schedule:

      15 patients (divided into 2 cohorts, see below) with matched family member or unrelated donor
      will be included in single arm open phase I/II trial.

      Conditioning protocol:

      All patients will be prepared by the same sequential conditioning protocols:

      Transplant I: Cy-TBI followed by Transplant II: Busulfan-thiotepa.
