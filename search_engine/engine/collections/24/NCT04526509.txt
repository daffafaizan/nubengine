    
      New York esophageal antigen-1 (NY-ESO-1) and LAGE-1a antigens are tumor-associated proteins
      that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using adoptively transferred
      T-cells directed against NY-ESO-1 have shown objective responses. GSK3901961 and GSK3845097
      are next generation engineered TCR T-cells, co-expressing the CD8α cell surface receptor,
      targeting NY-ESO-1, and co-expressing the dnTGF-βRII cell surface receptor, targeting
      NY-ESO-1, respectively to potentially improve function. This is a master protocol evaluating
      first time in human T-cell therapies. It will initially consist of two independent
      substudies, investigating GSK3901961 and GSK3845097 in HLA*A02+ participants with NYESO1+
      previously treated advanced (metastatic or unresectable) synovial sarcoma (SS) and/or
      previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
