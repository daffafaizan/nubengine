      30mg of ketorolac and 8mg of morphine sulfate injected plus a pain pump containing 100mL of
      ropivacaine (0.5%) administered at 4 mL/hour; B) an identical solution plus a pain pump
      containing 100-mL of normal saline administered at 4 mL/hour; C) an identical solution and no
      pain pump. Pain level, the amount of pain medication used and time to discharge were
      recorded. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed at nine months after surgery.
