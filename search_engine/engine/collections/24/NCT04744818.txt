      reducing ID/IDA in children. ID/IDA affects many young children in Africa. Current guidelines
      do not recommend routine testing of hemoglobin in early infancy, as it is generally believed
      that most infants are born with adequate iron stores to last 6 months. However, many African
      infants are born with low iron stores and ID/IDA may develop earlier than generally
      appreciated, within 2-3 months after birth. Vaccines provide tremendous benefits in LMIC;
      however, they currently fail to reach their full potential. We need to better understand the
      causes of vaccine failure, in order to develop new strategies to improve vaccine
      immunogenicity. Despite lower efficacy in LMIC, these vaccines provide a major benefit
      because the disease burden is so high; however, if approaches can be found to improve
      immunogenicity, these vaccines would be even more powerful.

      For this study, 6 weeks old infants will be randomly assigned to two study groups. Group 1
      will receive iron at time of pediatric vaccinations from age 6-24 weeks. Group 2 will receive
      no iron at time of pediatric vaccinations. All infants will receive a multivitamin syrup from
      age 6-24 weeks. All infants remaining ID/IDA at age 24 weeks will receive iron. Infants will
      be followed-up until age 52 weeks.
