      daily for 24 weeks. The efficacy of pirfenidone versus placebo will be assessed by daily
      measurement of forced vital capacity using a handheld spirometer over the treatment period.
      Additionally, the study will assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone with and without
      concomitant mycophenolate mofetil treatment and in study participants with or without
      interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). All study participants who attend the
      follow-up visit at Week 28 will be offered the opportunity to receive open-label pirfenidone
      within the trial protocol. In order to maintain blinding of the controlled period of the
      study, all study participants will discontinue treatment by Week 24 and return for a
      follow-up visit 4 weeks later. Study participants eligible to participate in the single-arm
      12-month extension will be initiated on open-label pirfenidone during this visit (re-starting
      the dose titration from one capsule three times daily [TID]). During the long-term extension
      period, study participants will be monitored for safety, initially at monthly visits during
      the first 6 months and thereafter approximately every 3 months. A final follow-up visit will
      take place 4 weeks after the last dose of pirfenidone is taken.
