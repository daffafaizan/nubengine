      delivery.Countries report wide variations in trauma rates, and within countries further
      variations exists among institutions and also among professional groups of caregivers.Visual
      and digital examination of the wound has been and is the most common way to assess and
      classify a perineal tear. However resent studies indicate that many tears diagnosed with this
      method are misclassified.The suggested reasons for this, apart from the fact that bleeding
      and tissue oedema make the diagnose difficult, is that many healthcare providers have too
      little training in perineal assessment and basic anatomy.

      In this prospective randomised trial consenting women will be randomised in to the common
      visual and digital assessment of the perineal tear by to different midwives, blinded to each
      others assessment or visual and digital assessment and measuring of the tear with a small
      soft ruler, Peri-Rule also by two different midwives.
