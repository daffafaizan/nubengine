      I. To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of this exercise program using a token
      economy system in hospitalized pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) undergoing
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of an exercise program using a token economy system in hospitalized
      pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients going through HSCT on measures
      of physical fitness.

      II. To evaluate the impact of an exercise program using a token economy system in
      hospitalized pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients going through
      HSCT on physical activity.

      III. To evaluate the impact of an exercise program using a token economy system in
      hospitalized pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients on quality of
      life, fatigue, sleep and function.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a 6-minute walk test and a timed get up and go test on the day of hospital
      admission, on days 0 (day of stem cell transplant) and 21, the day of discharge, and day 100.
      Patients also complete surveys over 10 minutes about quality of life and fatigue levels on
      the day of hospital admission, on days 0 (day of stem cell transplant) and 21, the day of
      discharge, and day 100. Patients who are able and allowed to, may also walk and participate
      in other intense physical activities to earn stickers. Patients who are unable to walk have
      tailored goals created by a physical/occupational therapist to earn stickers and participate
      in physical activity as prescribed by their therapist.
