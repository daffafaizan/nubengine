    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety and tolerability of MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232 (KRT-232 [AMG 232]) in
      combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd). (Part A) II. Determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in
      combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd). (Part A) III. Confirm
      the safety and tolerability of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in combination with carfilzomib,
      lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) at MTD/tentative RP2D in a goal of 10 subjects with
      relapsed and/or refractory myeloma. (Part B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate progressive disease (PD) effects of KRT-232 (AMG 232) through serum MIC-1 levels.
      (Part A) II. Assess KRT-232 (AMG 232) exposure-response relationships (PD, toxicity, and
      efficacy). (Part A) III. Evaluate the overall response rate of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in
      combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) in relapsed/refractory
      myeloma by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. (Part B) IV. Evaluate PD
      effects of KRT-232 (AMG 232) through serum MIC-1 levels. (Part B) V. Assess KRT-232 (AMG 232)
      exposure-response relationships (PD, toxicity, and efficacy). (Part B)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of KRT-232 (AMG 232) in combination with
      carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) in relapsed/refractory myeloma by
      International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. (Part A) II. Evaluate ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) expression levels of relevant genes in the TP53 pathway that may predict response to
      therapy using pre- and post-treatment bone marrow biopsies. (Parts A and B)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232.

      Patients receive MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, carfilzomib
      intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, 8-9, and 15-16 of cycles 1-12 and on days
      1-2 and 15-16 of cycles 13-18, lenalidomide PO on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO or
      dexamethasone sodium phosphate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
