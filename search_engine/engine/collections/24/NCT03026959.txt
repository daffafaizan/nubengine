      mindfulness-based practice is effective for improving mental health status and preventing
      depressive symptom relapse, this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief
      mindfulness-based program, offered during pregnancy, in reducing mothers' psychological
      symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period. A brief program has the advantage being
      more economical to facilitate compared to full-length programs and also requires a shorter
      commitment from pregnant women, who are also attempting to manage multiple other new and
      existing demands (e.g., obstetrics appointments, work).

      As emerging research suggests that women are particularly vulnerable to increased depressive,
      anxious, obsessive, compulsive, and hypomanic symptoms during the perinatal period these are
      the main psychological symptoms that will be assessed. As well, perceived stress and
      psychological resiliency will also be assessed for in order to examine changes in these
      domains in relation to mindfulness engagement. Furthermore, as a reduction in maternal
      psychological symptoms has been reported to have implications for mother-infant bond, the
      mother's interpersonal functioning, and maternal quality of life, the investigators will also
      assess to see if there are corresponding changes in these domains related to mindfulness
      engagement.
