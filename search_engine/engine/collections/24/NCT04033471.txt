      treated inadequately, can cause shallow breathing, atelectasis, retention of secretions and
      lack of cooperation in physiotherapy. This increases the incidence of post-operative
      morbidity and leads to delayed recovery.Epidural anesthesia is safe and inexpensive technique
      with the advantage of providing surgical anesthesia and prolonged postoperative pain relief.
      It also an effective treatment of operative pain blunts autonomic, somatic and endocrine
      responses. Morphine and midazolam can be used as adjuvant to bupivicain to reduced the
      postoperative pain
