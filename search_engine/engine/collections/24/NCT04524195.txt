    
      The purpose of this study is to find out how the radiotracer called [18F]F-AraG can help
      investigate changes in cancer's anti-tumor immune response (or activation of T-cell) levels
      during positron emission tomography (PET) scans. [18F]F-AraG has the potential to serve as a
      noninvasive imaging biomarker in the monitoring of T-cell mediated anti-tumor immune response
      following administration of an immunotherapeutic agent.

      Participants in this study will have tests, exams and procedures that are for study purposes.
      Participants will be in this study up to one month which will include about three clinic
      visits.

      A baseline [18F]F-AraG PET-CT will be obtained 0-7 days before a NSCLC patient receives
      PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. A second [18F]F-AraG PET-CT will be performed 10-14 days after
      PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy is administered.
