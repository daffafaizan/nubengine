    
      The drug being tested in this study is called mobocertinib. This study is to assess the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of mobocertinib and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) in
      participants with severe RI compared to matched-healthy participants with normal renal
      function.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of
      the following 2 treatment groups:

        -  Severe RI: Mobocertinib 80 mg

        -  Normal Renal Function: Mobocertinib 80 mg

      Healthy participants with normal renal function will be recruited to match severe RI by age
      (mean plus or minus [+-] 10 years), gender (+-2 participants per gender), and body mass index
      (BMI), (mean +- 10 percent [%]). All participants will be asked to take single dose of
      mobocertinib on Day 1.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 51 days. Participants will be contacted by telephone 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
