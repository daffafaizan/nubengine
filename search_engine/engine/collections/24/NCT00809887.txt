      supraphysiologic concentration (100- to 1000- fold higher) of an antimicrobial agent and
      allowing it to dwell (lock) for several hours in an attempt to sterilize the lumen.
      Advantages of the ALT are: the ability to administer high local concentrations; the ease of
      administration; the cost-savings and vein access-savings by decreasing the number of surgical
      procedures in an operating room for catheter replacement; the decrease in possible surgical
      complications and risks. The Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for
      Healthcare Epidemiology of America and others recommend the ALT for the treatment of
      uncomplicated bacteremias. This technique however is not currently recommended for the
      treatment of catheter-related fungal infections, primarily due to lack of adequate data. This
      study plans to enroll approximately 20 children admitted to the Children's Medical Center at
      Dallas in high need of central venous catheters or with evidence of fungemia in this study to
      investigate the effectiveness of ALT with Micafungin against fungal infections.
