      Wound Registry reports that only 40% of DFUs heal in 12 weeks1. Woundologists have adopted
      the phrase, "time is tissue." This adage reminds clinicians that the longer a DFU remains
      open, the greater the risk of infection, major amputation and death. The diabetic with a foot
      ulcer has a mortality rate of 47% which exceeds the mortality2 from most common cancers3.
      Beyond patient suffering, the treatment of DFUs cost the US health care system more than 15
      billion dollars annually4.

      In recent years, several clinical trials have demonstrated that products derived from human
      placental membranes promote the healing of DFUs5. Research has confirmed that growth factors
      present in amniotic membrane induce angiogenesis, stimulate human dermal fibroblast
      proliferation, and recruit stem cells important to wound repair and regeneration to the DFU6.
      All these factors are highly desirable properties in the healing of chronic DFUs.

      A novel dual layer amniotic membrane (DLAM, Artacentâ„¢, Tides Medical. Lafayette, LA)
      potentially can increase the delivery of growth factors due to its double layer of amniotic
      membrane. A prospective case series demonstrated good healing rates in DFUs: 65% healing at
      12 weeks7. The current study is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy
      of DLAM in DFUs.
