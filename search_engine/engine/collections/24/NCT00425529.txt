      response and massive production of reactive oxygen species at the site of injury. In these
      situations, requirements for certain amino acids (glutamine, cysteine) and antioxidant
      micronutrients (zinc, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-caroteen, selenium) are markedly increased
      and may not be covered by the levels normally present in standard enteral diets, especially
      in the early phase when enteral nutrition is introduced gradually. Thus, supplementation with
      amino acids and antioxidant micronutrients may be appropiate in order to optimize nutritional
      support in such patients.

      The administration of selected nutrients via modular devices added to a standard enteral
      formulation is an attractive means of providing optimized nutrition support for specific
      disease states. Module AOX is intended for supplementation of patients requiring nutritional
      support for a condition in which oxidative stress is expected. The module contains:

        -  Glutamine: to support gut mucosal and immune function, to minimize early depletion of
           glutamine stores and preserve body protein

        -  Cysteine: to support synthesis of glutathione, an important cellular antioxidant, and to
           support the synthesis of acute phase proteins

        -  Vitamin E, vitamin C and beta-caroteen: water- and lipid-soluble antioxidant
           micronutrients to boost antioxidant defenses

        -  Zinc: to compensate for increased losses and to support protein synthesis, immune
           function and wound healing

        -  Selenium: to compensate for increased losses, support antioxidant defenses and immune
           function
