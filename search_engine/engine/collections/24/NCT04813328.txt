      and intestinal microbiota in people with and without SARS-CoV-1 antibodies and helminth
      infection.

      A target sample size of 600 participants aged 5 years or older will undergo a one-time blood
      and stool collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, diagnosis of parasitic infections, and
      experimental studies including transcriptomics (RNA) and microbiome (intestinal
      microorganisms) characterization. Participants willing to take part in the study will be
      selected from households in the Tiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, India. Individual study
      participation involves a single study visit. Participants will be informed of the results of
      clinical testing and will be referred for medical care as appropriate.
