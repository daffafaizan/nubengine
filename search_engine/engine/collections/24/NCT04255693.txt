      discussion. Some studies support the evidence that specific components of food plays a role
      in triggering symptoms or may have an impact on reflux oesophagitis. Still, only limited data
      are present on the long-term real-life effects of diet and behaviour on the disease
      manifestations and outcomes. This specific study aims to investigate the role of diet in
      real-life cohort of patients in whom diagnosis of GERD is initially confirmed with the use of
      modern techniques (questionnaires, endoscopy, oesophageal pH-impedance recordings). To make
      the study possible, it is planned to form a cohort of patients with different manifestations
      of gastroesophageal reflux disease: non-erosive GERD (NERD), reflux-oesophagitis (EE),
      hypersensitive oesophagus. Each form of GERD is to be established in accordance to modern
      concept of GERD (i.e. Lyon consensus). In addition to standard-of-care examinations, diet
      assessment will be performed with the use of computer-based food frequency questionnaire
      (FFQ), which allows to analyse frequently used foods, food products in terms of frequency of
      consumption and sizes of the portions. Assessment of diet will be performed at the enrolment
      and than with a period of three months during three years. Based on the results, it would be
      possible to assess the effect of long-term adherence to diet, change of the composition of
      it, and perform a multifactorial statistical analysis with the consideration of other
      confounders: change in BMI, physical activity, smoking, concomitant medications, etc.
