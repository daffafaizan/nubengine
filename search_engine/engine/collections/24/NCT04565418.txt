      substrate metabolism, indicating metabolic inflexibility with an inability to fully switch to
      fat oxidation during the night. Whereas exercise has been shown to promote mitochondrial
      function and insulin sensitivity, it is unknown to if exercise training is able to restore
      24h rhythmicity in overall substrate metabolism and muscle metabolism in human subjects with
      pre-diabetes.

      In this single-arm longitudinal design, subjects will serve as their own control. Subjects
      will perform high-intensity interval training for 12 weeks (3x times per week) on a cycle
      ergometer at the research facility. Pre and post exercise, subjects will stay in a metabolic
      chamber and adhere to a relatively normal life-style in order to standardize the main 24h
      measurement period. As the primary outcome, substrate metabolism will be measured with a
      ventilated hood system and by indirect calorimetry in the chambers. Muscle biopsies from the
      vastus lateralis and frequent blood samples will also be taken over the course of the 24h.
      Thereby, ex-vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and muscle clock gene expression will
      serve as the main secondary outcomes.
