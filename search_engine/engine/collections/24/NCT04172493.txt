      I. To assess whether use of hyperspectral endoscopy (HySE) can improve visualization of
      abnormal colonic tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether use of HySE could reduce the rate of missed flat polyps.

      II. To assess whether use of HySE might in the future reduce the incomplete resection rate
      (IRR).

      III. To examine accuracy of practitioners in predicting polyp histology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care white light endoscopy and hyperspectral endoscopy during
      routine colonoscopy procedure.

      After completion of study, patients who experience a colonoscopy-related severe adverse event
      are followed up until resolution or stabilization of the event.
