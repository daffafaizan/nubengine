      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of a 10 week parent-only group support program
      focusing on evidence-based parenting practices followed by a mobile health (mHealth)
      component for 6-months (n = 150) compared to standard care (n = 150) for overweight and
      obesity in pre-school children (change in BMI z-scores after 9 months primary outcome).

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if the intervention can improve body composition (waist
      circumference), child eating behaviour, physical activity, and parental feeding practices in
      comparison to the control group.

      Specific Aim 3: To assess reversibility of the molecular signatures of obesity following the
      intervention through epigenetic markers in white blood cells (methylation) and analyzing the
      role of the gut hormones.

      Specific Aim 4: To assess and validate child food intake with metabolic markers in urine.

      Specific Aim 5: To evaluate the feasibility of recruitment (facilitators and barriers),
      attrition and acceptability, as well as patient and caregiver satisfaction to the
      intervention.
