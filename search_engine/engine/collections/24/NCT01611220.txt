      high percentage of patients relapse following discharge. The aim of the study was to assess
      the effect of a relapse prevention program during the last phase of inpatient treatment.
      Patients, when they achieve a BMI of 18.5, are randomly allocated to complete the standard
      cognitive behavior inpatient treatment (CBT-I) or to complete the standard CBT-I plus eight
      relapse prevention groups based on the cognitive dissonance. The intervention has been
      derived by the selective and indicated prevention programs using a dissonance-based approach.
      This intervention showed to be effective in reducing the risk for eating pathology onset. The
      primary outcome of the study is to assess the number of patients allocated to the two
      condition with a BMI equal or greater than 18.5 at 12-months after discharge.
