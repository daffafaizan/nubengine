      pseudoarthrosis of the clavicle from 2007 to 2017 at the Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, in
      order to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results of the treatment. This is an
      interventional study and patients will be contacted by telephone to verify their willingness
      to perform a visit (including a bilateral radiographic) at the Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute
