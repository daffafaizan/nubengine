      associated disabilities that persist despite ample medical treatment. Common knee problems of
      people who undergo TKR surgery include osteoarthritis, rheumatic diseases, and sudden or
      gradual joint injury. Most people who undergo TKR surgery experience immediate and
      significant decrease in pain, improved joint function, and increased physical activity.
      However, not all people who undergo TKR surgery report improvement, and there is no one
      factor that contributes to this variation in functional gain. With the rapid growth in the
      number of people electing to have TKR surgery and in the number of candidates eligible for
      TKR, optimal surgical results are both a clinical and public health priority. This study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of a patient support program emphasizing exercise and emotional
      health in increasing physical function after TKR surgery.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to a TKR patient support program or
      treatment as usual. The intervention patients will receive a program designed to complement
      the intensive physical rehabilitation period.

      Sessions will aim to help participants enhance their self-management skills for behavior
      change.
