      curvature, strength, protection) the inner eye structures from external environment, we have
      examined the role and function of stroma as a main factor of corneal thickness in implanting
      fresh corneal lenticule in progressive corneal disease.

      We have studied that in many clinical cases where the corneal epithelium and endothelium are
      healthy and functioning, the cornea can still lose it's transparency by different corneal
      stromal pathologies (infection ,keratoconus, inflammation ,neurodegeneration and corneal
      dystrophies).
