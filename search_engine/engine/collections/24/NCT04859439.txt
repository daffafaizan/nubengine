    
      This is an open-label, single-dose Phase I study that evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety,
      and tolerability of a single dose of DBPR108 100 mg in subjects with mild, moderate, and
      severe renal impairment (RI), subjects with kidney failure and the control subjects with
      normal renal function. This study consists of a screening period (Day -14 to Day -1), a
      baseline period (Day -1), a treatment period (Day 1 to Day 3), and a follow-up call on Day 6.

      Subjects will be enrolled in the following groups:

      Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be calculated based on Modification of Diet
      in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation at screening.

      (A) mild renal impairment (60 ≤ eGFR≤ 89 mL/min/1.73m2); (B) moderate renal impairment (30 ≤
      eGFR≤ 59 mL/min/1.73m2); (C) severe renal impairment (15 ≤ eGFR≤ 29 mL/min/1.73m2); (D)
      kidney failure (<15 mL/min/1.73m2, not on hemodialysis); (E) control subjects with normal
      renal function will be matched with subjects with HI by weight, age, and sex (eGFR≥90
      mL/min/1.73m2).

      Approximately 8 subjects will be enrolled in each group.
