      type 2 diabetes demonstrate that regular physical activity improves glycosylated haemoglobin
      (König et al.: Resistance Exercise and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Deutsche Zeitschrift für
      Sportmedizin Jahrgang 62, Nr. 1 (2011): 5-9). Sigal et al. proved that either aerobic or
      resistance training alone improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, but the improvements
      are greatest with combined aerobic and resistance training (Sigal, RJ, et al.: Effects of
      Aerobic Training, Resistance Training, or Both on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes, Ann
      Intern Med. 2007 Sep 18;147(6):357-69).

      Therefore, aim of the current study is to compare the effects of aerobic endurance training
      or resistance endurance training or the combination of aerobic endurance training and
      resistance endurance training in diabetes type 2 patients without any other lifestyle or
      dietary interventions.
