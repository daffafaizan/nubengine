      evaluated in patients with Parkinson's disease. This dopamine receptor agonist will be
      administered transdermally under double-blind conditions, in a rising dose paradigm.
      Antiparkinsonian activity will be quantified by means of standard rating scales. Possible
      adverse events will be assessed by appropriate clinical and laboratory tests.
