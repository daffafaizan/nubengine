      following major orthopedic surgery that has traditionally been performed in an inpatient
      setting, remains unknown. Care giving places a tremendous amount of physical and mental
      stress onto the caregiver, which may result in the "hidden patient" in the caregiver. It is
      expected that by 2026, 51% of TJA will be performed as outpatient procedures. Building on the
      successes of the country's first outpatient TKA program at Women's College Hospital, and with
      the expansion to include outpatient THA procedures, it is now important to understand whether
      or not our innovative ambulatory model is simply transferring the burden of postoperative
      care and recovery from nurses, doctors, and other hospital staff to family members, friends,
      or privately-employed caregivers.

      In the current state of literature, there is inadequate data examining caregiver burden when
      traditional surgical procedures are shifted to an outpatient setting, therefore, a
      comprehensive study is required to understand the various dimensions of caregiver burden.
      Therefore, our research question is "what are the most important factors that contribute to
      the burden of care for caregivers of patients undergoing outpatient surgical procedures
      traditionally performed as inpatients?"

      This prospective cohort study examines how the various dimensions of caregiver burden impact
      caregivers at different time points throughout the care giving experience. These dimensions
      include factors such as the intensity of dependence on the caregiver, duration of care,
      caregiver specific factors (e.g., the health literacy of the caregiver), and care giving
      dimensions (e.g., physical, emotional, social and financial burdens). Through gaining an
      understanding of how the various dimensions of caregiver burden impact caregivers in the
      outpatient settings, meaningful improvements can be made in the future and ultimately improve
      the quality of life of the caregiver during the time of care.
