      option. Despite the evolution in treatment with multimodality treatment strategies,
      oeso-gastric cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies with 5-year survival rates
      reaching only 22%. When the disease is localized, perioperative chemotherapy with cytotoxic
      agents is the preferred strategy since it increases the overall survival (OS) rate. However,
      in oeso-gastric cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), is a favorable prognostic
      factor, the recommended cytotoxic chemotherapy combination seems inefficient and even
      deleterious.

      It is now well established that dMMR and or the MSI phenotype are the surrogate markers of
      response to immunotherapy.

      The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab had shown promising efficacy in multiple tumor
      types (dMMR/MSI).

      Based on the data above, we have designed this phase II study to evaluate the complete
      pathological response rate (cPRR) in patients with non-metastatic MSI/dMMR oeso-gastric
      adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab treatment.
