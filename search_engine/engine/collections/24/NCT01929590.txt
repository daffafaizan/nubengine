    
      In-hospital patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: group 1 single dose
      (PEG-3350; PEG-4 L the day previous of the study, starting at 17:00 and finishing at 21:00
      h); group 2: split-dose (PEG-3350; 2 L the day before 17:00-19:00 h and 2 L same day of the
      procedure 06:00-08:00 am); group 3: low-volume 2 L PEG-solution (same day of the procedure
      06:00-08:00 am).

      The quality of colonic preparation was assessed by the Boston bowel preparation scale (13);
      tolerability (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain), compliance, sleep disturbance and
      adverse effects in group 3 were compared with those in groups 1 and 2. The time since the
      last dose of bowel-preparation agent, the time since the last solid food was consumed, the
      approximate amount of bowel preparation taken (0%, 25%, 75%, or 100%), and the start time of
      the colonoscopy were recorded.

      Satisfactory colon preparation was considered when scores of the Boston bowel preparation
      scale were 2/3; otherwise, the procedure was considered unsatisfactory preparation.
