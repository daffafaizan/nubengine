    
      This is a two year follow up study designed to monitor and obtain long-term safety data of
      the ACI 7000PDT in subjects who participated and successfully completed the ACU-P08-020/020A
      studies. Subjects must be able to provide voluntary informed consent, and must sign and be
      given a copy of the written Informed Consent form prior to participating. This continuation
      study follows subjects still implanted with the ACI and includes two visits, at 12-month
      intervals, after subjects have been exited (at Month 36) from the ACU-P08-020/020A studies.
      The first visit is at Month 48 following implantation followed by a final Month 60 visit. The
      study parameters being measured at these two visits include:

        -  Specular microscopy

        -  Slit lamp and fundus examination (ocular health)

        -  Corrected and uncorrected visual acuity

        -  Manifest mid-point refraction

        -  Corneal topography

        -  Dry eye assessment

        -  Mesopic and Photopic contrast sensitivity

        -  Adverse events and complications

      All sites participating in the ACU-P08-020/020A studies were invited to participate in the
      continuation study.
