    
      Patients with chronically, long-lasting illness, have complex needs for treatment and care,
      which none of the service providers can fulfill on their own. Both patients and their
      relatives are in danger of experiencing severe lack of quality. Integrated care path programs
      are increasingly put into use. There is insufficient research-based documentation of the
      effect of such care paths.

      The available documentation of different integrated care paths emphasizes early mobilization
      and discharge, rehabilitation in familiar surroundings, more effective communication and
      exchange of competence between the different service providers and educational
      self-management for patients as main elements in order to expect effect.

      There are no studies that evaluate the effect of quality of life, functional skills and
      personal coping if group-based educational self management is combined with physical exercise
      and patients with different chronically illnesses participate in the same group.
