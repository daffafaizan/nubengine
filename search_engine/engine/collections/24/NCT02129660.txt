    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle controlled, parallel group, comparator study
      designed to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of two doses of glycopyrrolate
      compared to two doses of glycopyrronium compared to vehicle, 5 treatment arms.

      Efficacy will be assessed through gravimetric assessment of sweat production using Patient
      Reported Outcome and the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS).

      Safety will be assessed through adverse events, local skin responses, serum chemistry and
      hematology laboratory testing, ECGs, physical examination and vital signs.

      PK blood samples will be taken study subjects.
