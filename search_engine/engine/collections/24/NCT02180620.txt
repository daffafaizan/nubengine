      standardized dinner meal with 1) no RE (NoRE), 2) pre-dinner RE (RE→M), and 3) post-dinner RE
      beginning 45 min after dinner (M→RE). Diet was standardized during the day of testing.
      Participants reported to the lab for testing sometime between 3 - 5:30 p.m. and upon arrival
      a venous catheter was inserted into a forearm vein. Frequent blood sampling, indirect
      calorimetry measurements, and subjective well-being measurements ensued for ~5.75 h while the
      participants were in the lab.
