      vitro experimental systems, mIL-11 was shown to endure chemical and proteolytic stresses more
      effectively, while retaining the biological activity of the original rhIL-11. The improved
      stability of mIL-11 was also demonstrated in the comparative pharmacokinetic study of
      subcutaneously delivered mIL-11 and rhIL-11 in the rodent and primate models. Based on its
      improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features. In Phase II study shows that mIL-11 is
      well tolerated and has thrombopoietic activity equivalent to one third of the clinical dose
      of rhIL-11, indicating the potential of mIL-11 for use in the treatment of CIT. This study is
      a phase III, single-blinded, randomized,multicenter,cross-over study designed to evaluate
      optimal dosing dose and efficacy and safety of mIL-11 on CIT patients receiving suitable
      chemotherapeutic regimen for treating cancer.
