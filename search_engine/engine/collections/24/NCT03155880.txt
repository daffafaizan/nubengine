      randomized trials and epidemiologic studies of obesity tend to consider obesity to be a
      homogeneous entity . The investigators will analyze data from the 2011-2012 wave of the
      NHANES. Obesity will be defined as having a body mass index greater than or equal to 30
      Kg/m2. The investigators aim to identify obese sub-groups according to demographic factors,
      clinical conditions and behavioral characteristics. Results of this type of analysis will
      shed light on an important gap in the way that obesity interventions and guidelines are
      developed and will be an important step in beginning the discussion towards this important
      area.
