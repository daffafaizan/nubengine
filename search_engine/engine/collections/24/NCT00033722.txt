        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with previously treated stage IIIB or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer when treated with lometrexol and folic acid.

        -  Determine the complete response rate, duration of response, and time to progression in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 1-year survival rate and overall survival in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral folic acid once daily on days -7 to 6. Patients also receive lometrexol
      IV over 30-60 seconds on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed up to 2 months after removal from study and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
