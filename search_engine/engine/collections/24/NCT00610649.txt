    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, safety and tolerability study examining MK-8777 in
      participants with major depressive disorder. In Part I of the trial, four different cohorts
      of six participants each will receive multiple rising doses of MK-8777 (ranging from 100 mg
      twice a day [BID] to 300 mg BID) or placebo for up to 16 days. In Part 2, a new cohort of
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive 100 mg BID of MK-8777, 400 mg BID of
      MK-8777, or placebo. Following titration (3 days per step), participants will be maintained
      on the assigned BID dose until Day 27, followed by one day of once a day (QD) dosing, for a
      total of 28 days. There were 11 treatment arms in total for Part 1 and Part 2 (see
      Interventions).
