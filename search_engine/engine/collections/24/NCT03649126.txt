      efficiency and quality of multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings and facilitate optimal
      treatment decision making. Optimal discussion of each patient at MDT meetings can be achieved
      by a clear communication of all diagnostic results among MDT members. However, the adoption
      of innovations, such as SSR, is laborious, especially when the innovation requires changing
      daily habits. Offering implementation tools supports the adoption of innovations among
      medical professionals. Implementation tools are most effective when they are developed on the
      basis of factors that impede or facilitate the innovation. Besides the importance of
      investigating these factors for SSR among pathologists, we will also involve MDT members
      receiving pathology SSRs in our study. After all, because MDT members will greatly benefit
      from SSR, they could play a key role in stimulating the use of SSR among pathologists.
      Therefore, we will also explore which tools MDT members need to stimulate the diagnostic
      disciplines in using SSR. Subsequently, we will develop and evaluate implementation tools to
      support the use of SSR by pathologists. The kit for successful implementation of SSR will be
      offered to other medical disciplines like radiology, endoscopy, and surgery who face similar
      challenges with implementation of SSR. The SSR-kit consists of our multidisciplinary approach
      for the whole process of developing implementation tools for SSR, examples of tools for SSR,
      and other results of this project.
