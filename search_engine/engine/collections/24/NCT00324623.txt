        -  Determine the magnitude and duration of the expansion of antigen-specific T-cells
           present in post-vaccination peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reinfused after
           immunosuppression in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Characterize the T-cell subsets (phenotype, function, T-cell receptor repertoire) in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label dose-finding study. Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect
      whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients are then assigned to 1 of 3
      treatment groups.

        -  Group 1 (closed to accrual as of 5/8/2007): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days
           -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV on days -5 to -3. Patients undergo autologous PBMC infusion
           on day 0. Patients also receive vaccination comprising Melan-A vaccine emulsified in
           incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) subcutaneously (SC) once every 3 weeks beginning on
           day 0.

        -  Group 2 (closed to accrual as of 8/15/2007): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV at a
           higher dose than in group 1 on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV on days -5 to -3.
           Patients also receive an autologous PBMC infusion and Melan-A vaccine emulsified in IFA
           as in group 1.

        -  Group 3: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV at 30 mg/kg on days -7 and -6. Patients
           also receive fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV on days -5 to -3, autologous PBMC infusion on day
           0,and Melan-A vaccine emulsified in IFA and IMP321. The first 3 patients receive 25
           micrograms of IMP321, in the absence of severe 3 or 4 toxicity, the dose will be
           escalated to IMP321 250 micrograms.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.
