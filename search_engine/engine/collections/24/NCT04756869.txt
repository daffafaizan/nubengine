      COVID-19 infection is especially important in this population in order to prevent the spread
      of disease among the health care workforce, their patients, and their families. However,
      standard symptomatic COVID-19 testing is insufficient to protect health care workers and
      prevent the spread of disease. This study utilizes continuous physiological data from
      wearable sensors and surveys completed via smartphone technology, in conjunction with
      biospecimens, in order to assist health care workers in their self-monitoring for COVID-19
      infection. Subjects will wear smart watches and temperature monitoring patches to collect
      continuous heart rate and temperature data. Subjects will also complete baseline and exit
      surveys, in addition to daily mood and symptom logging surveys. Finally, subjects will
      provide biospecimens - nasal and saliva samples and optional blood samples. Using wearable
      sensor data in conjunction with survey data and biospecimens, this study aims to prevent the
      spread of COVID-19 among health care workers, their patients, and their families, and to
      eventually develop a predictive model for early detection of COVID-19 infection.
