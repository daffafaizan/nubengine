      of two arms : 1) IVR or 2) SMS. Participants in the first study arm will receive an IVR
      survey. Participants in the second study arm will receive a SMS survey. The IVR and SMS
      questionnaires contain a set of demographic questions and one non-communicable disease (NCD)
      module (alcohol, or tobacco, or diet, or physical activity, or blood pressure and diabetes).
      We will examine contact, response, refusal and cooperation rates and demographic
      representativeness by each study arm.
