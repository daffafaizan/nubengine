      deficits in non-demented patients with PD. The secondary objective is to assess affective
      changes in this patient population. This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo
      controlled study in 1-3 centers. Patients will be recruited from the Movement Disorders
      Outpatients Clinic, Department of Neurology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul
      University and Marmara University. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to rasagiline
      1 mg or placebo. Patients will be treated with the study medication over 3 months. Cognitive
      and behavioral assessments will be performed at baseline, at 4 weeks and at the end of the
      study, at 12 weeks. A total of 40 PD patients with cognitive deficits, but without dementia
      will be recruited. No sample size calculation will be performed, a sample of convenience will
      be used.
