    
      Up to 20 (twenty) subjects who have alveolar defects secondary to clefts (n=10) or trauma
      (n=10), will be selected to participate in this study. Among the 20 patients, a total of up
      to 60 defect sites will be evaluated for bone regeneration following therapy, with each
      subject being evaluated in from one to four sites. Once enrolled, subjects from each of the
      two groups (cleft or trauma) will be randomly assigned to receive one of two possible
      treatments, traditional autogenous bone grafting or cell therapy (ixmyelocel-T)
