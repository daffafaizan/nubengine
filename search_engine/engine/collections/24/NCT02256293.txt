      acceptance-based group to improve diabetes self-management among individuals with Type 1
      Diabetes. Interested individuals will participate in a weekly acceptance-based therapy group
      focusing on improving diabetes management (e.g., adherence to dietary recommendations,
      appropriate insulin dosing) for a total of 8 weeks. Participants will also be asked to
      complete questionnaires both pre and post treatment. Questionnaires will assess diabetes
      management and acceptability of the group (post treatment only). Regular medical monitoring
      is required for participation in the current study. Participants will be asked to provide
      consent to contact their current medical provider in order to confirm that the participant's
      is receiving regular medical monitoring for diabetes care and that providers are aware of
      their patient's participation in group.
