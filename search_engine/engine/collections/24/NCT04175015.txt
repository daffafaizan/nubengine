      and gain insights into the best way to conduct a fair comparison. Everyday children are faced
      with health claims, some reliable and some not so reliable. The purpose of the SMARTY trial
      is to help children critically assess and develop a critical eye when it comes to information
      they encounter every day, in particular when it comes to their health. The SMARTY trial is a
      pragmatic, two group, parallel, randomised trial.
