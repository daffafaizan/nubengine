      studies have compared cidofovir to other therapies and its place in the treatment of CMV
      retinitis remains unexplored. By combining the ganciclovir intraocular device (slows
      retinitis progression) with oral ganciclovir (has the potential to treat both the ocular
      disease and to suppress dissemination to the contralateral eye and the viscera), without the
      use of a central venous catheter, this combination has become increasingly common. For these
      reasons, a comparative trial of cidofovir to other therapies is appropriate.

      After being stratified by the clinic and by stage of disease, patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms: intravenous (IV) cidofovir (Group I) or intraocular ganciclovir device plus
      oral ganciclovir (Group II). Group I: Cidofovir is administered IV once weekly for 2
      consecutive weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter. If progression occurs, oral ganciclovir is
      added to treatment or if this regimen is not tolerated, patients are treated according to the
      best medical judgment. Concurrent oral probenecid and intravenous hydration are administered
      with each cidofovir infusion. Group II: An intraocular ganciclovir device is surgically
      implanted at baseline and then every 6 to 8 months and ganciclovir is administered orally. If
      more than 1 progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, patients are treated according to
      the best medical judgment.
