      with disease activity in several immunological renal diseases, e.g. ANCA-associated
      glomerulonephritis. Thus, study authors hypothesise that CD4+, respectively CD8+, T effector
      memory lymphocytes found in urine samples of patients with inactive ANCA-vasculitis predict
      subsequent renal flares. Therefore, quantification of these cellular subsets might reliably
      predict relapse of ANCA associated glomerulonephritis at an early stage. In a prospective
      experimental study urine of patients with ANCA-vasculitis and no renal involvement or
      patients in renal remission will be analysed by flow cytometry. After 6 months of
      observation, clinical outcome and potential renal relapse will be determined and correlated
      to initial T lymphocyte count.
