      reaction of the immune system. Airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrow as a result of
      a reaction to triggers like chemicals (house-hold cleaning products, pollution) and allergens
      (house dust mite and cat or dog fur). The airways become blocked, causing shortness of breath
      and wheezing. The purpose of this study is to find out more information about how effective
      the study drugs are at protecting the lungs against allergic triggers of asthma. There are
      three study drugs being investigated in this study: fluticasone furoate on its own, GW642444M
      on its own and a combination of fluticasone furoate (FF) and GW642444M.

      FF is a corticosteroid that is being developed by for the treatment of asthma. A nasal spray
      formulation of FF has been approved for marketing in the USA, Europe and Japan for the
      treatment of hayfever (rhinitis) but the dry powder formulation used in this study is not yet
      approved.

      GW642444M is a long-acting beta2-agonist being developed by GSK for the treatment of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It works by acting on cells in the lungs, causing some
      of the muscles around the lungs to relax and open up better (bronchodilation), making
      breathing easier. The combination of FF/GW642444M is being developed as a once-daily
      treatment for both asthma and COPD.

      Study treatment will be taken for 21 days in each period (4 treatment periods: FF alone,
      GW642444M alone, FF/GW64244M combination and placebo) and each subject will receive all
      treatments. On D21 subjects will undergo an allergen challenge, followed by a methacholine
      challenge on D22. The washout between treatment periods will be 21-35 days.
