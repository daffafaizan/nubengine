      problems. And it is reported to be able to reduce the intraoperative anesthetic requirement.
      However, so far there is few evidence from randomized controlled studies to confirm the
      assistant anesthetic effect of acupuncture. Electroacupuncture (EA) is a modern non-invasive
      technique of traditional acupuncture. Compared to traditional acupuncture, EA is more
      practicable, more easily to be accepted by patients and operated by physicians. Nasal sinus
      surgery and mammaplasty, especially breast augmentation, mostly belong to the scope of day
      surgeries, which demand a rapid, smooth recovery from anesthesia with minimum adverse side
      effects (e.g.: pain, PONV, etc).
