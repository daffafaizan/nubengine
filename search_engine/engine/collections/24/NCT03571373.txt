      disease (IBD) will be included in the inception cohort. The primary aim of the inception
      cohort is to analyse the effectiveness and safety signals of current treatment strategies and
      to correlate them to individual risk factors. In order to capture information on rare and
      severe complications in PIBD as well, the safety registry was designed to estimate incidence
      and prevalence rates of these complications and get more insight in disease and treatment
      characteristics of these patients.
