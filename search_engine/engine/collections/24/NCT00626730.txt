      Primary

        -  To assess the impact of high-dose radiotherapy (RT) on progression-free survival (PFS),
           treatment tolerance, and post-treatment global cognitive functioning in patients with
           atypical (WHO grade II) or malignant ( WHO grade III) meningioma.

      OUTLINE: Patients with grade II disease are stratified according to resection status
      (complete excision [Simpson's stages 1-3] vs incomplete excision [Simpson's stages 4-5]) and
      participate in a phase II study. These patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups
      according to Simpson staging. Only data from these patients is analyzed with respect to the
      progression-free survival endpoint. Patients with grade III disease are treated in group 1 or
      2 according to Simpson staging (as patients with grade II disease). After treatment, the
      clinical results from these patients are observed and described.

        -  Group 1 (Simpson stage 1-3): Beginning no later than 6 weeks following surgery, patients
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

        -  Group 2 (Simpson stage 4-5): Beginning no later than 6 weeks following surgery, patients
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 7 weeks.

      Patients complete a Mini-Mental Status Exam at baseline and at 6 weeks and 6 months after
      completion of study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks, at 6 and 12 months,
      and then annually for at least 3 years.
