      The usual management of these crises relies on hydration, administration of oxygen and
      narcotics, like morphine. A select group of patients, for unknown reasons, does not respond
      to this management and these patients often require prolonged use (several days) of
      intravenous narcotics. Narcotics have proven to be ineffective in controlling this type of
      pain and can cause multiple side effects (sedation, vomiting, respiratory depression). We
      propose to administer intravenous ketamine in this group of patients who are resistant to
      intravenous narcotics. Ketamine has been proven to be effective in controlling pain in
      multiple clinical situations. However, there are no data in the literature describing its use
      in patients with sickle cell disease.
