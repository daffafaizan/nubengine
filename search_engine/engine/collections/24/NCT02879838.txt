      diagnosis concerning severity and control of respiratory disorder and also the possible
      effect of professional environment on the disorder. Their medical care and medico-legal care,
      in case of recognition of occupational disease, could be ameliorated.

      In general, this study will allow the harmonization of diagnostic care and medical,
      medico-professional and medico-legal management of cases of work related asthma in
      specialized hospitals.
