      productivity, and despite the development of several treatment guidelines, one of which
      recommends chiropractic spinal manipulation for some subgroups of patients with pack pain,
      the management of LBP remains controversial and highly variable across professions and
      geographic regions. Although one recent publication describes the design of chiropractic and
      exercise for seniors with low back or neck pain, no published studies to our knowledge, have
      assessed the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation compared to medical care for older
      adults with sub-acute or chronic low back pain.
