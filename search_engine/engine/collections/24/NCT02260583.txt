      of their disease In an attempt to correct or slow down the rate of rise of PaCO2, long-term
      noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) has been proposed.

      Only very few studies demonstrated the clinical efficacy of NIV. Indeed this technique is not
      always well tolerated and therefore it may be effective only in a subset of patients Recently
      extracorporeal CO2 removal have been shown to avoid the need of endotracheal intubation in
      COPD patients with an episode of Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure In this pilot
      physiological study we want to assess the safety and efficacy of this technique in reducing
      the PaCO2 level in those COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure non
      responding to chronic NIV.
