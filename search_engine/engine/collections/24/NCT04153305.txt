    
      Follow-up of patients already been registered in the ERNEST registry resulting alive and/or
      in active surveillance at November 2014 (Blood 2014 124:1849) will be updated retrospectively
      until December 2020. Data collection will be centralized at Fondazione per la Ricerca
      Ospedale di Bergamo (FROM), and performed by a web-based and Electronic Data Capture (EDC)
      system through ad hoc electronic case report forms (e-CRFs). The e-CRFs system will be
      pre-filled with pre-existing data collected from cases already entered in the registry.
      Information on therapies received and outcome events occurred (in term of death, evolution to
      acute leukemia, secondary cancer and cardiovascular complications) until December 2020 will
      be recorded by authorized participating investigators.
