        -  A screening visit of up to 21 days prior to randomization

        -  Randomization at baseline

        -  A Treatment period (initiated within 3 days of randomization), which included 28-day
           treatment cycles in both arms until predefined treatment discontinuation criteria were
           met

        -  A follow-up visit 30 days after discontinuation of treatment,

        -  A post study treatment follow-up period until death or the study cutoff date.

      The criteria for treatment discontinuation were:

        -  Participant (or legal representative) chose to withdraw from treatment

        -  The investigator thought that continuation of the study would be detrimental to the
           participants well-being, such as:

             -  Disease progression

             -  Unacceptable AEs not manageable by symptomatic therapy, dose delay, or dose
                modification

             -  Intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of study treatment

             -  Noncompliance with the study protocol

        -  Participant was lost to follow-up

        -  Unblinding of the participant's investigational treatment
