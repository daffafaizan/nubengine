      have vitamin D levels <30 ng/ml. Subjects will undergo a 8 week lead in period and receive
      Vitamin D supplementation with 50,000 IU D2 weekly for 8 weeks.Participants with sufficient
      Vitamin D levels after 8 weeks (>30 ng/mL) will be enrolled into the study and randomized to
      one of three arms: (1) placebo (2) 1000 IU/day Vitamin D3 (3) 5,000 IU/day Vitamin D3 for 22
      weeks. Based on clinical experience, doses higher than the recommended doses for bone health
      in the general population (600-800 IU/day Vitamin D3) are needed to achieve and maintain
      optimal levels of Vitamin D in people with Crohn's disease.

      The investigators aim to determine optimal maintenance dosing to sustain vitamin D
      sufficiency in people with Crohn's disease. The investigators also seek to determine
      demographic and disease related characteristics associated with inability to maintain
      sufficient levels.
