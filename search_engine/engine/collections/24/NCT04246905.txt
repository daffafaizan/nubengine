      informed consent. Participants will receive 12 weeks of either sulforaphane or placebo per
      day, in addition to the existing treatment. Baseline assessments include demographics, a
      comprehensive medical history, anthropometric measurements (weight and height), physical
      examination, and lab work. Clinical symptoms will be assessed by the Montgomery-A° sberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton depressive scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety
      Scale(HAMA), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The safety will be assessed by
      Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS). The cognitive function will be evaluated by MATRICS
      Consensus Cognitive Battery （MCCB）at the beginning of the study and at week 12. The cranial
      MRI is examined at baseline and repeated at week 12. The primary outcomes will be the
      effective time and the percentages of efficacy at 8 weeks, measured using the MADRS. Efficacy
      is defined as ≥50% decreases in the total score of MADRS. Secondary outcomes include global
      psychopathology, quality of life, functioning, cognition, biological data, safety and
      tolerability.
