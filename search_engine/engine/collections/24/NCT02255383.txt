    
      The study design is a prospective, multicenter, study of the commercially available Persona
      fixed bearing knee implants. The study will require each site to obtain IRB approval prior to
      study enrollment. All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the
      Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their total knee
      arthroplasty. The post-operative clinical and radiographic evaluations will be conducted at 6
      weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years.

      The primary objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcomes
      data for the commercially available Persona fixed bearing implants used in primary total knee
      arthroplasty. The assessments will include: implant survivorship based on removal of a study
      device; safety based on incidence and frequency of adverse events; and clinical performance
      measured by overall pain and function, quality of life data, radiographic parameters and
      survivorship.
