      urothelial carcinoma (UC) tumors. Within this pathway, the PI3 kinase alpha subunit (PIK3CA)
      is frequently mutated in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) (15-20%) and PTEN is
      inactivated in another 30%.

      Due to TAK-228's effects on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in preclinical studies and the
      frequency of pathway alterations in UC tumors, TAK-228 is a rational therapy for bladder
      cancer.

      This clinical investigation may also reveal how alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
      correlate with treatment response. In preclinical bladder cell line models and xenografts
      done in our lab, synergistic effect has been seen with the combination with paclitaxel.

      The primary end-point is objective response rate (ORR) with the goal of increasing the rate
      from 10% to 26%. Response rates will be measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria. PFS and OS will
      be measured from the start date of treatment with TAK-228 and paclitaxel. Grade 3, 4 or
      serious adverse events will be collected and compared to the catalogued events in the phase
      II trial in breast cancer (NCT01351350). Patient tumors will be analyzed for genetic
      alterations within the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to determine if alterations within this pathway
      correlate with response rate, PFS, or OS.
