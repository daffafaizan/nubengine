    
      Breast cancer is considered a systemic disease since early tumour cell dissemination may
      occur even in patients with small tumours; several investigators using immunocytochemistry or
      real time PCR (RT-PCR) have shown that cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells could be
      identified in the bone marrow aspirates or the peripheral blood of otherwise metastases-free
      patients with stage I and II breast cancer. The clinical importance of the immunocytochemical
      detection of occult tumour cells in the bone marrow has been confirmed in many prospective
      studies to represent an independent predictive and prognostic factor for distant relapse and
      reduced survival.

      Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have persistent detection of tumour cells in the
      peripheral blood (â‰¥5 cells/7.5 ml) despite at least one line of chemotherapy will receive
      lapatinib for a minimum of one month unless disease progression occurs at an earlier time
      point.
