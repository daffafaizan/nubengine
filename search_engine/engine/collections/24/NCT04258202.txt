      respiratory function and may be associated with subsequent pulmonary complications.
      Especially, during laparoscopic surgery, gas infiltration and head down position cause
      pulmonary atelectasis. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers are beneficial in reopening collapsed
      alveoli and improving lung mechanics, suggesting that performing an Alveolar recruitment
      maneuvers after intubation, circuit disconnection, position change, intraabdominal gas
      infiltration.

      Conventional manual ARM is performed by sustained lung inflation using the reservoir bag on
      the anaesthesia machine with the adjustable pressure-limiting valve set to the desired
      inflation pressure. However, the manual ARM can lead to brief loss of positive pressure when
      switching back to the ventilator circuit, which results in re-collapse of alveoli. For this
      reason, investigators try to compare the methods of the ventilator-driven ARM.
