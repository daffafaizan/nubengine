    
      Dutogliptin 60 mg administered by twice daily subcutaneous (SC) injection for 14 days in
      combination with a fixed standard dose of filgrastim (10 µg/kg) administered SC daily for 5
      days. This study will be conducted in adults with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
      with successful revascularization following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and
      stent implantation.

      Primary Objective

      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dutogliptin in combination with filgrastim in
      subjects with STEMI compared with placebo

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy of dutogliptin in combination with filgrastim in subjects
           with STEMI compared with placebo as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
           (cMRI)

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dutogliptin in a subset of the study
           population

        -  To establish the pharmacodynamics (PD) of dutogliptin (plasma DPP4 activity) in a subset
           of the study population

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To examine the effects of dutogliptin in combination with filgrastim on:

        -  Change from baseline in plasma stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1a levels

        -  Change from baseline in plasma biomarkers, including N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic
           peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity troponin
