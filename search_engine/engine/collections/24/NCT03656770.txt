      accompanied by significant advances in treatment and improvements in prognosis, mental
      illness remains highly stigmatized throughout the world. Previous studies suggest that
      portraying mental illness as treatable can reduce negative attitudes toward persons with
      mental illness. This randomized controlled trial compares the effects of exposing study
      participants to vignettes portraying persons with untreated and symptomatic mental illness
      vs. treated mental illness with complete response vs. treated mental illness with relapse. It
      is hypothesized, based on prior work, that study participants exposed to vignettes depicting
      treated mental illness with completed response would have the greatest effect on reducing
      negative attitudes toward persons with mental illness, followed by treated mental illness
      with relapse and untreated and symptomatic mental illness.
