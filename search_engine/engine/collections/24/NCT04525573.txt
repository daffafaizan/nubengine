      penetrating red/IR light with the photomodulated effects of gold light. The light is
      positioned alongside the patient as they lay, or sit on a treatment table. A light panel is
      mounted to an articulating arm for positioning the light at the correct treatment position
      above the patient (non-contact). The effects of a red/gold/IR combination LED light therapy
      device on circumferential reduction of fat will be measured, and the overall health of the
      patients will be monitored using blood tests.
