      mg/dl or greater are then given a 100g glucose tolerance test. Two abnormal values are
      diagnostic of gestational diabetes. all women are initially counseled on diet and exercise.
      Women who fail to maintain a fasting of <105mg/dl and 2 hr postprandial < 120 mg/dl are
      offered participation in the study. Women were randomized to either metformin or glyburide
      via a computer generated randomization. Women who fail to meet glycemic goals after receiving
      the maximum dose of study medication were considered treatment failures and insulin therapy
      was initiated.
