    
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that patients who have competent great saphenous
      vein (GSV) and short saphenous vein (SSV) or have undergone prior successful endovenous
      treatment of an incompetent GSV and/or SSV but continue to demonstrate clinical symptoms of
      peripheral venous insufficiency resulting from incompetent perforator veins (IPVs) will
      improve the immediate treatment outcomes from successive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of
      IPVs veins.
