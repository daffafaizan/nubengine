      marrow versus unmodified marrow in adults and children with leukemia. II. Evaluate 2-year
      leukemia-free survival, primary and secondary graft failure, graft-versus-host disease,
      infection, and relapse in these patients. III. Assess the quality of life associated with
      T-cell-depleted versus unmodified, unrelated donor transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center. Patients
      receive myeloablative therapy according to diagnosis: those with acute lymphocytic leukemia
      and lymphoblastic lymphoma are treated with total body irradiation (TBI), with a testicular
      and chest wall boost as appropriate, followed by cyclophosphamide (CTX); patients with
      undifferentiated or biphenotypic leukemia or with acute or chronic myelocytic leukemia are
      treated with CTX followed by TBI. Patients are then randomly assigned to receive
      non-T-cell-depleted, unrelated marrow versus T-cell-depleted, unrelated marrow. The modified
      marrow is depleted of T-lymphocytes by counterflow elutriation and positively selected for
      CD34 cells. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine and methotrexate
      is given to the unmodified marrow group. Patients who receive modified marrow are given
      antithymocyte globulin (or methylprednisolone) for graft rejection prophylaxis before
      transplantation and cyclosporine and methylprednisolone for GVHD prophylaxis after
      transplantation.
