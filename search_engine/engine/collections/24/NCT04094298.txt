      rotator cuff disease. The study will enroll 65 patients in a longitudinal case series level
      IV study using extended release triamcinolone to treat shoulder pain from rotator cuff
      disease. Inclusion criteria will be shoulder pain without a history of trauma and physical
      exam consistent with rotator cuff tendinitis, impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tear.
      Patients will have normal Xrays or Xrays indicative of chronic cuff tearing and a
      musculoskeletal ultrasound indicating an intact rotator cuff, partial cuff tearing or cuff
      tear. Patients will undergo an ultrasound guided injection of TA-ER into the subacromial
      space from a lateral access point at the time of the examination. They will be monitored for
      any immediate adverse effects. Patient reported outcomes measures will be recorded with
      online questionnaires which include a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Single assessment numeric
      evaluation (SANE), Veteran's Rand 12 (VR-12) and American Shoulder and Elbow Scale (ASES) and
      will be recorder pre-treatment and at 2, 4, 8 and 12 and 24 weeks post treatment. Patients
      will be asked to follow up for an in person evaluation at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks post
      injection.
