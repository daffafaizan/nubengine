      weakness, and limited neck range of motion in individuals who reported having sinus
      headaches. These impairments are also associated with cervicogenic headaches (headaches
      originating in the neck), but had not previously been shown in people with sinus headaches.

      Because the individuals in this previous study self-diagnosed their sinus headaches, it is
      possible that they did not have sinus headaches but rather had a different kind of headache.
      It is unknown whether or not individuals who have been diagnosed with sinus headaches
      according to diagnostic criteria also present with musculoskeletal impairments.

      Purpose 1: The purpose of this study is to determine if musculoskeletal neck impairments are
      present in individuals diagnosed with headaches attributed to rhinosinusitis (sinus
      headaches) compared to people without headaches. Question: Do people with diagnosed with
      headaches attributed to rhinosinusitis have neck pain or impairments in neck strength, neck
      range of motion, or segmental neck joint mobility compared to people without headaches?

      Background for question 2: Upper cervical range of motion can be measured using the
      flexion-rotation test or the side bend rotation test. The side bend rotation test has been
      suggested as potentially more useful in individuals with hyper-laxity, however, has not been
      examined in a symptomatic population.

      Purpose 2: To compare the side bend rotation test to the cervical flexion rotation test and
      manual joint assessment in people with varying degrees of joint laxity. Question: What is the
      diagnostic accuracy of the side bend rotation test compared to the index tests of the flexion
      rotation test and manual joint assessment?
