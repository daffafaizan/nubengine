      associated with significant distress and dysfunction in social situations. Although treatment
      with cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is known to help remedy SAD, many patients do not
      respond to this treatment and most do not reach full recovery. In CBT, patients undergo
      repeated and prolonged exposure practices to feared social situations to learn better ways to
      deal with anxiety in these settings. Exposure therapy is based on animal models of extinction
      of conditioned fears, and recent animal research has identified some of the core pathways and
      neurotransmitters involved in fear extinction. D-cycloserine (DCS) is a drug that appears to
      facilitate learning and the process of extinction of conditioned fear in both animals and
      humans. This study will assess the effectiveness of DCS combined with CBT in treating people
      with SAD.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to an active or control
      group. All participants will attend 18 study visits at the Center for Anxiety and Related
      Disorders over a 9-month period. There will be 12 CBT sessions of 90 minutes each and 6
      assessment visits. The CBT sessions will help participants to become more comfortable with
      social situations. During 5 of the CBT sessions, participants will receive a pill containing
      either DCS or sugar (placebo). Assessment visits will include interviews, self-report
      questionnaires, and laboratory tests. These visits will occur at Weeks 1, 7, and 12 during
      treatment and at Months 3, 6, and 9 post-treatment.
