    
      Accurate detection of bone lesions in myeloma patients is essential for treatment planning
      and patient survival.

      Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients can be enrolled in this study. All participants
      will at time of diagnosis undergo three project scans (FDG-PET-CT, NaF-PET-CT, whole-body
      MRI) as well as whole-body x-ray as part of clinical routine practice.

      Experienced specialists in the field of radiology and nuclear medicine interpret the images.
      Each reader performs the evaluations blinded to other imaging results as well as to the
      patient's clinical information. The reader assesses whether myeloma indicative bone lesions
      are present in eight predefined skeletal body regions.

      Endpoint is purely diagnostic.

      Statistics:

      Cochran's Q-test: to compare the proportion of patients with bone disease detected by the
      four scanning methods.

      Two-sided ANOVA: to compare the average number of regions detected with bone disease by the
      four scanning methods.

      Tukey's comparison test: to compare the difference between each pair of means.
