      events. AF is the leading cause of embolic stroke. Identification of factors that may
      influence blood coagulability in these patients could better identify therapeutic targets to
      optimize anticoagulation. Platelets play a major role in the coagulation process, their study
      may provide valuable information. Moreover microparticles from platelet activation are known
      to have pathophysiological effects including effects on thrombosis and inhibition of
      fibrinolysis. It has also been shown that the microparticles have a role in endothelial
      dysfunction and generation of inflammatory condition which are associated with atrial
      fibrillation.

      Investigators propose in this project, a comparative study between AF patients and healthy
      volunteers. Complete characterization of platelet (morphology, platelet function, platelet
      proteome) and microparticles levels will be perform. Different site blood sampling (systemic
      or cardiac) will be done in patients during their ablation procedure. Patients will be
      followed during their hospitalisation.
