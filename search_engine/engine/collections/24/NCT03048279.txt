    
      Previously followed MEN1 and MEN2 patients at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center will be mailed an
      introductory letter and a "consent to be contacted" form to determine whether they are
      interested in participating in the study. New MEN1 and MEN2 patients seen in clinic at M.D.
      Anderson Cancer Center will be asked if they wish to learn more about this study. Interested
      patients will also be asked to distribute the introductory letter and consent to be contacted
      form to their blood relatives. Printed materials regarding this study will only be mailed to
      non-MDACC individuals with the expressed written or verbal permission from a consenting MDACC
      patient. All interested individuals will return the signed "consent to be contacted" form to
      the PI. Consented individuals will be interviewed by phone and/or mail to obtain updated
      family and medical history specific to their diagnosis of either MEN1 or MEN2. To verify
      accuracy of medical data collected, all non-MDACC participants will be asked if they consent
      to have their off-site medical records released to us for review. There will be no treatment
      or collection of blood or tissue in this study.

      Although this study presents minimal risk to participants, participant consent will be
      obtained due to the need to obtain permission to make contact with patients and their
      families.

      Approximately 1500 patients and their relatives will be included in this study. This will be
      done on an inpatient and outpatient basis.
