      All patients are treated with alteplase according to current guidelines. In addition,
      patients randomized in the active group are continuously exposed to transcranial 2-MHz
      ultrasound for 1 hour combined with intravenous administration of microbubbles. Controls are
      only treated with alteplase. The ultrasound beam is positioned at the thrombus/blood flow
      interface using color-coded sonography. Galactose-based microbubbles are administered via
      continuous intravenous infusion over 40 min.

      Early recanalization is assessed using MR or CT angiography 4 to 8 hours after symptom onset.
      The evaluation of angiograms is performed by 2 neuroradiologists blinded to group of
      randomization and clinical details. The primary outcome measure is the rate of early
      recanalization. Recanalization is assessed using the TIMI classification. Secondary endpoints
      include the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, mortality, and functional outcome
      on the modified Rankin scale at 3 months.
