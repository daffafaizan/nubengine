      therapy outcome failed to improve during the past years. The addition of immunotherapy with
      the anti-PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 as a novel treatment modality has the potential to improve
      the outcome without adding substantial toxicity to an otherwise intensive multimodality
      treatment, as MEDI4736 has been generally well tolerated. Based on the current evidence on
      immune checkpoint inhibition, there is a strong rationale to test this novel treatment
      modality also in the curative setting in order to improve local tumor control and prevent
      distant metastasis to improve the cure rate in this patient population.

      The trial investigates the addition of pre- and post-operative immune checkpoint inhibition
      with MEDI4736 to the previously established standard of care for stage IIIA(N2) patients,
      which is based on the trials SAKK16/96 and SAKK16/00. Patients whose tumor is deemed
      resectable at diagnosis will receive 3 cycles (21 days each) of standard chemotherapy with
      cisplatin (100 mg/m2) / docetaxel (85 mg/m2), followed by 2 cycles (14 days each) of
      neoadjuvant immunotherapy with MEDI4736 750 mg. Following surgery, patients with complete
      resection (R0) of their tumor will be administered adjuvant treatment with MEDI4736 750 mg
      for up to one year or until recurrence, death, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal
      (whichever occurs first). Patients with incomplete R1/R2 resection, including patients with
      extracapsular spread of mediastinal lymph node metastases, may undergo standard radiotherapy
      prior to adjuvant treatment with MEDI4736.
