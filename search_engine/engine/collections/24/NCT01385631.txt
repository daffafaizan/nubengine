      characterization (IVUS-TC) are relatively new expansions to intravascular assessments, and
      has the capacity to assess plaque composition and, potentially, to identify vulnerable
      plaques. One of the mechanisms by which statins improve patient outcomes may be by changing
      the composition of a "vulnerable" plaque. The main effect is believed to rely on a lowering
      of LDL-c. The question is whether a further reduction of LDL by adding ezetimibe to optimal
      cholesterol lowering therapy using statins may result in further plaque stabilization or
      reduction. This is the hypothesis of the current study.

      100 patients are randomized to Ezetimibe 10 mg per day or placebo. All patients are treated
      with Atorvastatin 80 mg. OCT and IVUS are performed at inclusion (typically the day after
      Primary PCI) and again at follow-up after 12 month.
