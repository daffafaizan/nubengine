    
      This was a prospective, randomized study. 170 participants who met inclusion and exclusion
      criteria were randomized to CM or NCYC (non-contingent yoked-control condition) arms. They
      were provided with a 4-day starter-pack of PEP medication (tenofovir + emtricitabine,
      Truvada) to be started only in the event of a high-risk sexual exposure. The two
      interventions were implemented simultaneously:

      The CM or NCYC intervention, remunerating (via vouchers) the participant based on his own
      (CM) or a yoked-participant's (NCYC) stimulant-metabolite-free urine samples for 8 weeks;

      and,

      Post-exposure prophylaxis, providing risk reduction counseling, adherence counseling and PEP
      medication for 28 days in the event of a high-risk sexual exposure to HIV.

      All participants were followed for 24 weeks, or 24-weeks post-HIV-exposure, whichever was
      longer.
