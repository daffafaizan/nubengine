      (MMPI) marimastat prolongs overall survival and time to progression in patients with small
      cell lung cancer who have achieved complete or partial remission after first line
      chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. II. Determine the tolerability and toxicity of
      prolonged administration of marimastat in patients with small cell lung cancer. III.
      Determine the effect of prolonged administration of marimastat on the quality of life of
      patients with small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo controlled study. Patients
      are stratified by stage of disease at diagnosis, response to prior chemotherapy/radiotherapy,
      type of thoracic radiotherapy, and cooperative group. Patients are randomized into two
      groups. Half of the patients take marimastat orally twice a day (breakfast and evening meal);
      the other half take placebo orally twice a day (breakfast and evening meal). Treatment
      continues for 2 years or until documented disease recurrence or progression and institution
      of further anticancer treatment, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, initiation of
      anticoagulant treatment, or development of intercurrent illness. All patients are followed
      every 6 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The planned sample size is 360, with an equal number of patients in both
      arms, accrued at a rate of 240 responders per year (resulting in an accrual period of
      approximately 1.5 years). The total duration of the study is estimated as 2.3 years.
