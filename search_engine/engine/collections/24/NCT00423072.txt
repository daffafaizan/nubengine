      infants and children with cleft palate (CP) and is often associated with long-standing
      conductive and, perhaps, sensorineural hearing losses. Most evidence suggests that OME in CP
      patients is a complication of inefficient Eustachian tube function (ETF). The investigators
      plan to use our most complete tests to characterize ETF in CP infants tested at age 5-24
      months and followed up through age 6 years by yearly collection of clinical data for the
      presence/absence of OME and repeat ETF testing. To obtain anatomical data, the investigators
      will obtain basal and lateral cephalograms at age 3 years in all subjects and perform MRI
      tests prepalatoplasty when possible and then at 3 and 5 years on a subset of the enrolled
      children. Functional-anatomical reconstructions based on the MRI data will be studied for the
      mechanical interactions underlying the phenomenon of ET constriction in CP patients and
      examined for the possibility of surgical interventions to correct identified abnormal
      interactions.
