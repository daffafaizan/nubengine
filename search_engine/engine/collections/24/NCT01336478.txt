      number of hematological malignancies but relapse remains a major problem, especially in
      patients with high risk disease. Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that recognize
      and kill virally infected cells and tumor cells. NK cells are identified by the expression of
      the CD56 surface antigen and the lack of CD3. Their ability to kill tumor cells makes them
      promising to evaluate as effector cells for immunotherapy.
