      will receive 2 weeks of AABM training preceded and followed by a 1-day ADP session.

      AABM training is a computer training program that participants interact with by pushing and
      pulling a joystick. Participants are asked to respond to the format of a presented picture,
      irrespective of the pictures' content. Training effect is achieved by presenting alcohol
      pictures in push format only and non-alcoholic drinks in pull format only. Training is
      conducted in 3 sessions per week for 2 weeks, for a total of 6 sessions.

      The ADP session is a one day human laboratory session taking place at the SFVA Medical
      Center. This human laboratory session involves the self-administration of alcoholic beverages
      by research participants under highly structured, observed conditions in order to evaluate
      the effects of the study intervention (AABM training) on alcohol craving and alcohol
      consumption.
