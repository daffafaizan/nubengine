      diagnosed early stage hormone receptor positive, Her2 negative breast cancer. These range
      from free and publicly available mathematical algorithms (e.g. NHS Predict, Magee formulae,
      Gage and Tennessee equations) that incorporate standard pathology results, through to
      expensive genomic tests (e.g. Oncotype DX ® and Endopredict ®). It is not known how the use
      of these different scores affects physician decision making with respect to ordering genomic
      tests, nor how well these algorithms predict for the results of Oncotype DX ® in the
      real-world setting. This pragmatic study will help to answer these questions.

      In summary: Month 1 to 3: pathology and chemotherapy data is collected, no physician
      questionnaires given. Month 4 to 6: pathology and chemotherapy data collected, plus physician
      questionnaire administered. Intervention teaching after 6 months of study activation. Month 7
      to 9: pathology and chemotherapy data collected, PREDICT 2.1 tool used, no physician
      questionnaire given. Month 10 to 12: pathology and chemotherapy data collected, PREDICT 2.1
      tool used, plus physician questionnaire administered.
