        -  Determine survival and time to treatment failure in patients with stage IIIB non-small
           cell lung cancer treated with induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and radiotherapy followed
           by consolidation docetaxel.

        -  Determine the response rate in these patients when treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, 22, 29, and 36 and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 29, and 36. Patients also
      undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily, 5 days per week, for 6.5 weeks.

      At least 1 week and no more than 4 weeks after completion of induction chemoradiotherapy,
      patients with stable or responding disease receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 30 months.
