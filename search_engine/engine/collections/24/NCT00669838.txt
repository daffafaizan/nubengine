      to avoid higher release of endogenous catecholamines that could trigger hemodynamic. The
      study was conducted in the Dental Department of the Instituto do Coração do Hospital das
      Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil). Patients were
      allocated into two groups through an aleatory numbered table: PL (plain 2% lidocaine, n= 31)
      and LE (2% lidocaine with 1:100.000 epinephrine, n= 28). The anesthetic amount was
      registered. DIXTAL monitor (São Paulo- Brazil) captured blood pressure, heart rate,
      oxygenation and electrocardiogram records.
