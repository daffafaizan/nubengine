      Up to three different doses of telavancin will be studied (n=6 per group). Blood samples will
      be collected throughout the study to determine the pharmacokinetics of telavancin. Each group
      will proceed after measurement of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the lower
      dose group before it.
