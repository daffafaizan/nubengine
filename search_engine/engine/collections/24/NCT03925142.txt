      refined grains with beef in a vegetarian diet on cardio-metabolic disease risk factors in
      adults in a cross-over, randomized controlled feeding trial. The hypothesis is that
      isocalorically replacing predominantly starchy vegetables and refined grains with 6 oz. of
      beef/day will enhance improvements in cardiometabolic disease risk factors, particularly
      atherosclerotic-promoting lipids and lipoproteins. It is also hypothesized that participant
      satisfaction and acceptance of a healthy eating pattern with 6 oz. of beef per day will be
      higher compared to without beef.
