      different nutritional compounds with zeaxanthin and omega fatty acids being the primary
      ingredients of interest) influenced visual motor function. Visual motor function refers to
      the processing speed of the visual system and how individuals respond behavioral to visual
      stimuli (e.g., reaction time).
