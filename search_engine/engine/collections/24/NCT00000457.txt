      alcohol for a minimum of 1 year), who want to stop smoking and provide them with 100%
      nicotine replacement. The 100% nicotine replacement will be undertaken using a nicotine
      patch. By measuring their nicotine levels at study entry we can determine the patch dosing
      needed. The patch dosing will vary from 22 mg to 44 mg. Those who are able to achieve tobacco
      abstinence by week 8 will enter a relapse prevention phase for the remaining 44 weeks. In
      this phase, they will be randomized to active or placebo bupropion (300 mg/day). After 44
      weeks of the relapse prevention trial (at week 52 of study participation), they will enter a
      post medication follow up for 6 months.
