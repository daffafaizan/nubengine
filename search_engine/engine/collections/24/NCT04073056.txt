      which local anesthetic is deposited adjacent to the antero-lateral aspect of the quadratus
      lumborum muscle. This results in posterior spread of local anesthetic through the middle
      layer of the thoraco-lumbar fascia, which theoretically communicates with the paravertebral
      space resulting in potentially longer-lasting and denser analgesia than wound infiltration.
      Like the more commonly used transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, the QL 2 block targets
      the anterior rami of T7-T12, ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and the lateral cutaneous
      branches of L1-L3. The QL 2 block derives from the TAP block, which is also a fascial plane
      block that is commonly used to treat pain following surgery involving the anterior abdominal
      wall. However, the QL block's more posterior location has recently been shown to provide a
      longer lasting and more profound analgesic effect than the TAP block, possibly by
      communicating with the paravertebral space. Although the TAP has been shown to be effective
      in a variety of surgical procedures involving an anterior abdominal wall incision including
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery the QL 2 block has until now, not been studied in the context
      of bariatric surgery. Conventional therapy has consisted of surgical infiltration of the
      incision ports with bupivacaine 0.25%. The study team proposes a study to compare the
      analgesic effects of the QL 2 block with conventional therapy, consisting of surgical wound
      infiltration, for postoperative analgesia following laparoscopic gastric sleeve gastrectomy.
