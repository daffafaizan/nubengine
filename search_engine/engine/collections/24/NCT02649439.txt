        -  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and surveillance are treatment options for prostate
           cancer patients with biochemical progression after localized therapy (biochemically
           recurrent prostate cancer). The primary goal in these patients is to prevent morbidity
           from their cancer and to do so with limited toxicity.

        -  Prostvac (Prostvac ; developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to BN
           Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a novel candidate prostate cancer
           immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. It is a viral vector based
           therapeutic cancer vaccine that is administered via subcutaneous injections. In a
           randomized controlled Phase 2 trial, Prostvac therapy was associated with a prolongation
           of survival in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. A phase III trial
           recently completed accrual of patients in this same population.

        -  There is also rationale to use therapeutic cancer vaccines such as Prostvac in earlier
           stage prostate cancer patients to maximize the potential therapeutic effect of immune
           stimulating therapy.

        -  Analysis of previous trials using therapeutic cancer vaccines alone suggests that such
           therapies may alter tumor growth rate.

      OBJECTIVE

      Primary Objective:

      -Determine if the therapeutic cancer vaccine prostvac can decrease tumor growth rate as
      measured by PSA rise after 6 months compared to a group getting surveillance alone.

      KEY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

        -  Patients with negative CT Scan and Tc-99m Bone Scan

        -  Patients with a PSA over 0.8 ng/ml for patients following radical prostatectomy or for
           patients following definitive radiation therapy: a rise in PSA of greater than or equal
           to 2 ng/mL above the nadir

        -  Patients with a PSA doubling time of 5-15 months

        -  No history of active autoimmune disease or history of organ compromising autoimmune
           disease

        -  ECOG 0-1

      DESIGN

        -  Randomized study

        -  Accrual goal is 36 evaluable patients per arm; randomized 1:1 to:

             -  Arm A: Prostvac for 6 months with an additional optional year of maintenance for
                eligible patients OR

             -  Arm B: Surveillance for 6 months, then Prostvac for 6 months with an additional
                year of maintenance for eligible patients
