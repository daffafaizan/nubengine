      injury of heart, kidney, liver, brain and spinal cord in experimentation on animals. And the
      clinical studies of RIPC were mainly focused on heart, RIPC's protection effect on hepatic
      ischemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing hepatectomy still remains unknown, So we
      designed this study to demonstrate the hypotheses.
