      screening mammography (SM) increased diagnostic yield for breast cancer in dense breasts
      (supplemental yield of 7.5/1000 screened). After implementing radiation dose reduction
      techniques, the performance of incident SM and prevalent screen MBI in women with dense
      breasts will be compared.

      Methods:

      Women presenting for SM with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts on past prior SM were
      enrolled and underwent digital SM and MBI. Study information was sent to all eligible
      patients in advance of their scheduled SM explaining the study and offering them
      participation. Eligible patients who requested to participate were offered an MBI on the same
      day as their SM or within 21 days of the SM. Participants may have participated in this
      screening study up to two times provided at least 24 months had elapsed since the initial MBI
      scan. This time period was selected as the average time for a tumor to double in size is
      approximately 20 months. Hence a 24 month time interval between MBI studies was to enable
      detection of interval cancers or cancers that were too small to be detected in the initial
      MBI scan.

      MBI was performed with 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi and dual-head cadmium zinc telluride detectors.
      SMs were read independently; MBIs were read in comparison with SM. MBIs were assigned an
      assessment score of 1-5 which parallels BI-RADS; scores of 3-5 on MBI were considered
      positive.
