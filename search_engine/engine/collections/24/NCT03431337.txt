    
      Double-blind comparative-effectiveness study of the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis
      with standard dose of amoxicillin/clavulanate 875mg/125mg bid for 7 days, as recommended by
      the Infectious Disease Society of America, with or without the addition of immediate-release
      amoxicillin 875 mg bid x 7 days. The study aims are 1) to confirm, or not, our recent
      findings of more rapid improvement in overall symptoms with the additional amoxicillin, but
      also of more frequent diarrhea and vaginal yeast infections and 2) to assess, from the
      participants' point of view, the balance between improvement and adverse effects.
