      retaining weight after pregnancy) and consequent persistent obesity. Women who are obese
      pre-pregnancy are 3-5 times more likely to gain weight, rather than lose weight, in the
      postpartum period than non-obese women.

      Obesity science supports that weight loss interventions should be multi-component with
      regular points of contact. Building upon this, we have designed a multi-component
      intervention that considers the demands on women in the postpartum period and utilizes
      technology for both provider decision support and for virtual contact with participants. The
      intervention will address diet, physical activity, and social support through the use of
      in-person meetings with WIC staff, text messaging, phone coaching, self-monitoring, and
      Facebook.
