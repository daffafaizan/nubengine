    
      4 independant, multicenter, prospective, signle-arm phase II trials, based on 2-stage Simon's
      optimal design, will be conducted in parallel to assess the efficacy of durvalumab when
      prescribed with tazemetostat, separately, in distinct cohorts of solid tumors:

        -  cohort A: patients with pancreatic cancer

        -  cohort B: patients with colorectal cancer not MSI-H or MMR-deficient

        -  cohort C: patients with metastatic solid tumors with positive interferon gamma signature
           and/or tertiary lymphoid structure positive

        -  cohort D: patients with soft-tissue sarcoma
