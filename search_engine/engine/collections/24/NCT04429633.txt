      trastuzumab-related cardiomyopathy, its clinical application has been hampered due to the
      lack of appropriate evaluation and treatment strategies. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the
      effect of early intervention strategy (GLS-based cardiotoxicity monitoring and administration
      of candesartan) by comparing with conventional intervention strategy (left ventricular
      ejection fraction-based cardiotoxicity monitoring and administration of candesartan) in
      breast cancer patients who treated with adjuvant trastuzumab.
