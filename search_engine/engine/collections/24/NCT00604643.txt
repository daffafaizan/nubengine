    
      The primary purpose of this registry is to provide an endovascular means of treatment for
      those patients experiencing a sub-optimal outcome related to the implanted AneuRx bifurcated
      stent graft and who are not deemed suitable candidates for treatment with an AneuRx Aortic
      Cuff. A sub-optimal outcome is defined as either a Type I or Type III endoleak and/or an
      inadequate seal zone (< 1 cm). For Registry purposes, a Type III endoleak will be defined as
      a proximal modular endoleak.
