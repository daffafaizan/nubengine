      modalities, RT and IMQ, an effective, adaptive immune response can be generated, resulting in
      systemic control of metastatic breast cancer after local treatment of cutaneous metastases.
      Additionally, based on investigators' recent preclinical data, the investigators intend to
      estimate in patients with metastatic breast cancer, if the addition of immunomodulatory
      cyclophosphamide can increase anti-tumor responses.

      This trial originally had one treatment arm IMQ/RT(patients were treated with IMQ and RT).
      Recent evidence has emerged that the addition of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide (CTX)
      increased anti-tumor responses, therefore the IMQ/RT arm is closed and the trial will
      continue with two additional cohorts (CTX/IMQ/RT and CTX/RT) which include cyclophosphamide.
