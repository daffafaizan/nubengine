      for poor adherence is high pill burden. A combination fixed dose drug approach appears to be
      an effective strategy to improve adherence and therapeutic response. In this study,
      investigators will compare the bioavailability and safety of GPO-VIR Z30, a combination fixed
      dose drug, with the liquid formulations of ZDV,3TC, and NVP, in children.

      This study will last approximately 8 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      two arms. Participants in Arm 1 will receive GPO-VIR Z30 for 2 weeks before receiving liquid
      formulations of ZDV, 3TC, and NVP for the following 2 weeks. Participants in Arm 2 will
      receive liquid formulations of ZDV, 3TC, and NVP for 2 weeks before receiving GPO-VIR Z30 for
      the following 2 weeks.

      This study will consist of 4 study visits after screening. Visits will occur at study entry
      and on Days 14, 28, and 56. Medical history and a physical exam will occur at all visits. A
      pregnancy test will occur for females at all visits. Pharmacokinetic tests, involving
      hospitalization for the 12 hour procedure, will occur on Days 14 and 28. Safety and adherence
      monitoring will occur by telephone on Days 7, 11 or 12, 13, 21, 25 or 26, 27, and 35. Home
      visits for directly observed therapy (DOT) may also occur.
