    
      The present study is a multicenter, prospective Phase II-study to evaluate the incidence of
      acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease at 2-years, the 2-year risk of non-relapse
      mortality, the 2-year progressive-free, and overall survival in patients with multiple
      myeloma who received a toxicity-reduced conditioning regimen combined of thiotepa and
      busulfan followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation from matched or mismatched,
      related/unrelated and haploidentical donor, and cyclophosphamide as post-transplant GvHD
      prophylaxis in comparision to a historical group.

      In this study will further determine toxicity and safety of cyclophosphamide as GvHD
      prophylaxis.
