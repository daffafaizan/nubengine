      D2 lymphadenectomy with distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.

      This study is an randomised controlled trial undertaken in 7 centers in South Korea. Patients
      with stage I-II gastric cancer who is going to have curative distal gastrectomy with D1+b or
      D2 lymphadenectomy are randomly assigned to use bio-absorbable felt(NEOVEIL®) or not to use
      it. Block randomisation will be done by a central interactive computerised system, stratified
      by center.
