      separate inform consent approved by the local ethics committee. The participation for this
      study consists of drawing whole blood, serum and plasma samples for genetics, proteomics and
      metabolomics analyses. The results from these studies are combined with baseline data from
      the original clinical imaging studies to find connections between genetic variation,
      metabolism, blood flow and body fat distribution in a cross-sectional setting.
