      trial of XC001. Approximately 12 subjects (N=3 per cohort) who have refractory angina will be
      enrolled into 4 ascending dose groups, followed by an expansion of the highest tolerated dose
      with 32 additional subjects. XC001 will be administered by a transthoracic epicardial
      procedure. Safety will be the focus for the initial 6 months after XC001 administration
      followed by one safety focused telephone evaluation at Month 12.
