    
      -  This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an
           investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
           investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that
           the intervention is being studied.

        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Merestinib or LY2874455
           as a treatment for any disease.

        -  Merestinib is an oral drug known as a MET kinase inhibitor that is being developed as a
           treatment for patients with advanced cancer. MET inhibitors work by stopping a signal
           that a cell receives instructing it to grow.

        -  LY2874455 is an oral drug known as an FGFR inhibitor that is also being developed as a
           treatment for patients with advanced cancer. FGFR inhibitors work by stopping a signal
           that a cell receives instructing it to grow.

        -  In this research study, the investigators are investigating whether Merestinib and
           LY2874455 is safe to give in combination in patients with AML. In previous laboratory
           studies, it was found that leukemia cells responded to treatment with a MET inhibitor
           and an FGFR inhibitor. However, it is not yet known whether this will also be the case
           with LY2874455 and merestinib when given to participants.
