      minimally invasive surgery, we propose to use a readily available and easily reproducible
      model: cholecystectomy. Each year in the United States, approximately 750,000 patients
      undergo a cholecystectomy. Patients clearly prefer the laparoscopic approach over the open
      procedure to abdominal surgery. Initial survey data suggest that patients may also prefer
      even less invasive approaches.

      Currently, the standard operative procedure for a patient with symptomatic gallstone disease
      is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed under general anesthesia with four small
      abdominal incisions. Although postoperative pain and cardiopulmonary and wound complications
      are much less compared to open cholecystectomy, considerable cost is generated from lost
      productivity in days off of work after the surgical procedure related in part to pain and the
      physiologic response to the stress of the operative procedure. Anecdotal data suggest that
      fewer incisions, especially fewer transabdominal incisions, translate into less pain, less
      need for narcotic pain medication and faster recovery, but randomized trial data are needed.
      We propose to compare the effectiveness of the novel single-port cholecystectomy with
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the current standard of care.
