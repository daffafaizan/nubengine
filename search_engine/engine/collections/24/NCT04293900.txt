      "gold standard" first-line treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, yet it is
      estimated that R-CHOP is not curative for 30- 50% of patients. Preliminary studies suggests
      that modifiable lifestyle factors such as body composition, exposure to endocrine disrupting
      chemicals, and changes in the gut microbiome may contribute to variation in R-CHOP treatment
      response. If true, it could be possible to modify these factors in an effort to improve
      treatment outcomes, however more detailed information is needed to confirm these preliminary
      findings and test whether lifestyle modification can improve outcomes.

      In this observational study, data will be collected on dietary intake, ability to be
      physically active, body composition, environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals
      and changes in the gut microbiome over the course of R-CHOP for NHL. The study will provide
      more detailed information on the usual trajectory of these lifestyle factors during R-CHOP
      treatment than has previously been collected, especially how these factors co-vary over time.
      The study findings are expected to inform future intervention studies aimed at improving
      R-CHOP treatment outcomes.
