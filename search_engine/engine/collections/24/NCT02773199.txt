      the day of the surgery regardless of the planned hour of the surgery. This results in a near
      standard fasting for patients with a planned surgery time in morning hours of the day.
      However, patients with a planned surgery time in the afternoon hours of the day are fasted
      more than 12 hours. This situation may not look very important for a healthy young adult but
      considering that the patient population in a hospital is mostly consisted of sick and elderly
      people, fasting and associated dehydration may have serious deleterious effects. Our
      objective is to observe and define these potential deleterious effects with a special focus
      on cardiovascular system of the patients.
