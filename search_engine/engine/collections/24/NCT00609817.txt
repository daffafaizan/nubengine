    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and the dose-limiting
      toxicities of GCS-100 in subjects with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and
      to identify the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended dose for further studies.

      The secondary objectives of this study are (i) to evaluate the safety of treatment with
      GCS-100 in combination with bortezomib (VelcadeTM) in subjects whose disease has progressed
      on GCS-100 alone; (ii) to evaluate the response to GCS-100 alone, in combination with
      bortezomib in subjects whose disease has progressed on GCS-100 alone, and during
      dexamethasone therapy in combination with GCS 100 plus bortezomib in subjects whose disease
      has progressed on GCS-100 plus bortezomib; (iii) to evaluate the utility of potential
      surrogate markers; (iv) to perform exploratory correlative analyses of bone marrow samples to
      define better the mechanisms of action and response to therapy.
