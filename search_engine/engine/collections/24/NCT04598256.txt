      pathologies in children. In the investigators' center, which is a pandemic hospital, only
      emergency endoscopic procedures were performed during the pandemic period, while emergency
      and elective endoscopic procedures are performed in accordance with the recommendations of
      the Ministry of Health during the normalization process. Staff and patients in endoscopy
      units are at risk for COVID-19 infection by inhalation of airborne droplets, conjunctival
      contact, and potential fecal-oral contamination. In order to reduce the risk of
      contamination, according to the recommendations of the European Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
      Association (ESGE); proper cleaning of endoscopic devices, non-reuse of disposable devices,
      cleaning the endoscopy hall with a disinfectant solution, use of gowns FFP2 / 3 masks and
      jewelry during the procedure, handwashing with soap and hand disinfection is recommended
      before and after each procedure. In addition, it is recommended that patients who have
      undergone endoscopic procedures should be followed up or communicated on days 7 and 14 in
      terms of the development of COVID-19 infection.

      It is recommended that patients should be questioned in terms of COVID-19 infection before
      endoscopy, but rapid antigen testing and serology are not routinely recommended. Molecular
      diagnosis (PCR, amplification) tests are recommended for patients at risk for COVID-19
      infection.
