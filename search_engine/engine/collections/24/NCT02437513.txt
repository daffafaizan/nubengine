      increased mortality in patients. For chronic or unresolved aspiration, patients are often
      given a tracheostomy for safer breathing and greater protection of the airways from aspirated
      material. However tracheostomies are associated with risks and complications and do not give
      a 100% guarantee of aspiration protection to the patient. They also impact the quality of
      life in a negative way for many patients. The current study will evaluate the performance of
      a new intralaryngeal device for airway protection in a small group of patients who have
      chronic aspiration. The study will look at the overall performance of this device in
      preventing aspiration in this specific group of patients as well as determine any unforeseen
      risks of using this device in the identified group of patients. The outcomes will form the
      basis of future studies with larger groups of patients.
