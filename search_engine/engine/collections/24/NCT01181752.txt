    
      Purpose:

      To determine the number of subjects who can proficiently administer one drop of Dexatrol (the
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that Crystal Eye Clinic staff provide to all patients who
      undergo cataract surgery) on their first attempt on postoperative day 1 and compare this to
      the number of subjects who can proficiently administer one drop of Dexatrol into the eye that
      received cataract surgery after using the medication for 30 days.

      Baseline/control subjects who are only tested on postoperative day 30 will be referred to as
      "Group A" subjects. Subjects who will be tested on postoperative day 1 and 30 will be
      referred to as "Group B" subjects. If "Group B" subjects can proficiently administer the
      medication on postoperative day 1, they will remain in "Group B" and researchers will
      determine their rate of success again on postoperative day 30. If subjects cannot
      proficiently administer the medication on postoperative day 1, they will be re-classified as
      "Group C" subjects and researchers will determine whether an educational session regarding
      the correct instillation of eye drops will improve the proficiency of these subjects when
      they are tested again on postoperative day 30. This will allow staff at Crystal Eye Clinic to
      understand the effectiveness of their current educational session and will determine the
      efficacy of an additional educational session. Researchers will also use questionnaires to
      determine if there are factors that affect the ability of subjects to properly instill the
      medication as well as if the proficiency of instillation correlates to whether patients
      experienced irritation or pain before or on postoperative day 30. Dexatrol will not be used
      outside of its approved indication.
