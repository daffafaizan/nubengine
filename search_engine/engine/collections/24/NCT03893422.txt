      multiple population studies demonstrating a difference between healthy individuals and
      patients with metabolic syndrome. Whole Biome has identified and created two medical food
      formulations (MFFs) aimed at improving metabolic syndrome via two mechanisms of action
      targeting the microbiome: (1) increasing butyrate production and (2) increasing mucin
      regulation.

      This randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study assesses the safety
      and metabolic effects of 2 MFFs on glucose control and the generalized inflammatory state
      associated with Type 2 Diabetes. The microbes have been fully characterized, certified as
      Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) and manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
      standards. The target population was patients with Type 2 Diabetes who either had not been
      treated with antidiabetic agents or treated with metformin +/- a sulfonylurea. Subjects were
      randomized in a balanced manner to receive capsules containing placebo, WBF10 or WBF11.
