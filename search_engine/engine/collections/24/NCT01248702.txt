      death is still a significant complication in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. There is
      strong evidence to support the role of ICDs for the primary prevention of sudden death in
      this population. However, in Canada and the United States, ICDs are underutilized.

      Critical pathways are algorithms that improve health care delivery and clinical outcomes
      while reducing practice variability. The use of a critical pathway to assess a patient's
      eligibility for an ICD may increase the appropriate use of this evidence-based technology.
