      tissue biopsy and circultating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy before entry the study.
      Patients who have no actionable mutations in EGFR or ALK and receive ICIs treatment and
      patients who carry actionable ROS1 fusion, ALK fusion or MET exon 14 skipping mutation and
      receive TKI treatment according to guidelines will take liquid biopsy assay to monitor the
      mutation status. The study will be ended when over 70% of the patients had a progressive
      disease (PD) in their targeted lesion.
