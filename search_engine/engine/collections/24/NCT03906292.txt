      allogeneic stem cell transplant remains the only proven curative therapy. To achieve cure or
      benefit from treatment-free remissions with pharmacologically-based therapies, it is
      estimated that patients will likely need to achieve a sustained reduction in tumor burden
      corresponding to a deep molecular response of at least 4 logs (MR4). Currently, only 30.8% of
      patients achieve a deep molecular response after 12 months of treatment with single agent
      nilotinib.

      The development of the novel and potent BCR-ABL1 allosteric inhibitor, asciminib, presents an
      opportunity to assess the effect of a different mechanism of inhibition of BCR-ABL1 in the
      first-line treatment of CML to enhance speed of response and to increase the patient
      population benefitting from deep molecular response. Dosing a combination of asciminib with
      an ATP-site inhibitor also has the potential to prevent the emergence of resistance due to
      point mutations being acquired in one of the binding sites.

      The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of asciminib as a single agent and in
      combination with either nilotinib or imatinib or dasatinib was assessed in a phase-I study.
      At the doses chosen here, all three combination treatments were well tolerated.

      Since in all patient cohorts the standard of care therapy will remain the backbone of initial
      therapy, there is no reason to expect an efficacy problem with the combination therapies.
