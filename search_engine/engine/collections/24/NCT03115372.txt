      I. Evaluate the efficacy of lay health worker (LHWs) outreach on colorectal cancer (CRC)
      screening among 3 Asian American groups (Filipinos, Hmong, and Koreans) in a cluster
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CRC education delivered by LHWs (intervention) to
      a CRC brochure and nutrition education (control).

      II. Examine the processes through which LHWs communicate with, connect to, and convince
      community members from 3 Asian American cultures of the importance of CRC screening using
      mixed methods.

      OUTLINE: Lay health workers (LHWs) are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (CRC EDUCATION): LHWs undergo training over 3 days and recruit 15 participants from
      their social network. Participants attend a CRC educational session conducted by an LHW over
      90 minutes at month 1 and 3. Participants receive phone calls from the LHW at months 2 and 4
      reminding them about CRC screening.

      GROUP II (CRC BROCHURE): LHWs undergo training over 3 days and recruit 15 participants from
      their social network. Participants attend a lecture on healthy nutrition for cardiovascular
      health presented by a professional health educator at months 1 and 3. After the first
      meeting, participants receive a brochure on CRC screening. Participants receive phone calls
      from the LHW at months 2 and 4 regarding changes in their nutritional behavior. Participants
      may attend an optional post-intervention LHW outreach session on CRC screening.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 2 months.
