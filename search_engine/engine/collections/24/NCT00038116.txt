      critical chemical called dopamine. The drug L-dopa can partially make up for the lack of
      dopamine. As time goes on, however, most patients notice that the drugs do not work as well.
      Oftentimes, patients develop great fluctuations in motor control. Off drugs they cannot move,
      and on drugs they have excess, exaggerated movements. Research in animals over the last 20
      years has shown that dopamine cells can be replaced by transplants of new cells obtained from
      fetal brain tissue. For the past 14 years, several laboratories around the world have been
      performing similar transplants of human fetal brain tissue on patients with Parkinson's
      disease. So far, it has been impossible to compare results from the different groups because
      no two centers are performing transplants in the same way.

      This study seeks to get around that problem using a controlled clinical trial that compares
      the embryonic dopamine cell implant surgery with a placebo treatment. A total of 40 patients
      were recruited--half received the cell implant surgery, while the other half received the
      placebo. After the double-blind phase of the study, patients in the placebo group had the
      option of receiving tissue implants. Fourteen of these patients eventually had transplants.
      At present, this study is providing long-term follow-up evaluation and treatment for the
      subjects.
