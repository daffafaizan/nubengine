      the durability of virologic and clinical response to nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors. Previous results of ACTG 175 suggest that either a switch to ddI or addition of
      ddI in patients receiving AZT results in better clinical, virologic, and CD4 cell response
      compared to continuation of AZT alone.

      Patients with prior AZT experience only are randomized to receive either d4T alone or
      AZT/3TC. Patients with prior ddI experience only are randomized to receive ddI/AZT or
      ddI/AZT/3TC. PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96: The study has been extended 6 months and treatment will
      be available until March 15, 1997 at the latest. Each patient will have regularly scheduled
      12 week safety visits during the extension period.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 1/22/97: The study has been extended for approximately 16 additional weeks
      beyond the current 6-month extension. Subjects will be unblinded to their assigned regimen
      beginning 2/21/97 and will continue therapy for up to 16 weeks in open-label fashion. AS PER
      AMENDMENT 5/9/97: The study has been extended for an additional 8 weeks; study drug will not
      be provided after 9/15/97.
