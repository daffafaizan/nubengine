      Moreover, repeated attempts itself would cause the arterial spasm or hematoma. The use of
      ultrasound as an adjunct to radial arterial cannulation has considered to be the best
      practice in adults and pediatrics. However, its usefulness or superiority for neonates and
      infants is not known. Therefore, we would compare ultrasound guided radial arterial
      cannulation with the usual palpation methods in infants undergoing cardiac surgery.
