      condition in a certain subgroup of patients with complex congenital heart disease and a so
      called Fontan circulation. Those patients are also prone to develop hepatic and myocardial
      fibrosis as well as to reveal collateral vessel formation. The investigators' hypothesis is
      that this pro-inflammatory condition is not only reflecting pre-stages of one or more of
      those 3 issues, but that this is also a main driving mechanism to develop and hepatic or
      myocardial fibrosis and collateral vessels.

      The objective of the here proposed study thus is to identify the mechanisms that promote
      hepatic and myocardial fibrosis, and collateral vessel formation, and thus provide insight
      into the determination of those Fontan patients that tend to develop those conditions. The
      investigators attempt to link the issues of hepatic and myocardial fibrosis and collateral
      vessel formation by directing our focus on the phospholipid, amino acid and bile acid
      metabolism and on cell surface markers, cytokines, and chemokines as surrogates for
      proinflammatory, profibrotic and proangiogenic conditions.

      This study would thereby allow for a deeper insight into Fontan pathophysiology and sequelae
      and might provide first steps towards the identification of possible diagnostic or eventually
      therapeutic targets.
