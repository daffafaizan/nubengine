    
      The outcome of interest is the contamination of scrubs with Staphylococcus aureus,
      Enterococcus species or Gram-negative bacteria as determined by surface swabs of healthcare
      worker scrubs after a full 8-hour shift. The outcomes will be analyzed both individually and
      collectively.

      Contamination will be defined as:

      - A swab that is determined to be positive for any Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus
      species, or Gram-negative bacteria after a hospital shift.
