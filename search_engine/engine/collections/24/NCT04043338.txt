    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group SAD study conducted at
      one study center. Up to 5 cohorts of 8 subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) are planned for
      evaluation. In each cohort, subjects will receive a single oral dose of XC130-A10H or
      matching placebo on Day 1. Dose escalation will not take place until the Principal
      Investigator, Sponsor, and Medical Monitor have determined that adequate safety and
      tolerability from the previous cohorts have been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the
      next cohort.

      Safety (i.e., adverse events [AEs], physical examinations, pulse oximetry, vital signs,
      orthostatic vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests,
      Columbia suicide severity rating scale [C-SSRS], and Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE])
      will be assessed throughout the study. Blood samples will be collected through 48 hours
      post-dose for the PK assessment of XC130-A10H and the metabolites.
