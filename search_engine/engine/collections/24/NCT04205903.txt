    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate
      (nilotinib) in combination with paclitaxel. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the toxicity profile
      (based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v.] 5.0) of
      nilotinib in combination with paclitaxel. (Phase Ib) III. To assess the efficacy of nilotinib
      versus (vs.) placebo in preventing paclitaxel-induced neuropathy when administered in
      combination with paclitaxel, as measured by patient reported outcomes using
      Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)-20 and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-20.
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of paclitaxel on pharmacokinetics (PK) of nilotinib in the study
      population. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the effect of nilotinib on PK of paclitaxel in the
      study population. (Phase Ib) III. To evaluate the effect of paclitaxel on PK of nilotinib in
      the study population. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate
      followed by phase a II study.

      PHASE Ib: Paclitaxel will be given weekly on days 1, 8, 15, of every 21 days, at a starting
      dose of 80mg/m2. Nilotinib will be given orally on cycle 1 Days 7, 14 once a day 24 hours
      prior to the paclitaxel infusion and again 30 minutes prior to the paclitaxel infusion on
      days 8, 15. During the cycle 1, PK will be obtained at baseline, during, and up to 24 hours
      after paclitaxel or nilotinib administration on the days 1, 7, 8. Patients will continue
      paclitaxel without nilotinib after cycle 1 as part of standard of care at the discretion of
      the treating investigator

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive nilotinib
      hydrochloride monohydrate PO on days 7, 8, 14, and 15 of cycle 1 and days -1, 1, 7, 8, 14,
      and 15 of cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15. In cycle 1. Patients also
      receive placebo PO on days 7, 8, 14, and 15 of cycle 1 and days -1, 1, 7, 8, 14, and 15 of
      cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
