      of PSA, PCA3, TMPRSS2:ERG will significantly improve specificity for high-grade prostate
      cancer by 10%. The subsequent exploratory aims will 1) create an optimal panel of urine,
      blood and tissue biomarkers that will select those cases most likely to benefit from a MRI
      targeted biopsy, 2) directly compare PSA and urinary biomarkers with MRI to determine which
      ones are value added in the setting of initial biopsy, 3) evaluate changes in these
      biomarkers and MRI to determine if longitudinal changes predict subsequent high-grade
      prostate cancer, and 4) optimize MRI imaging to improve test performance. Importantly, this
      study will create a unique, prospective, cohort that will become the foundational reference
      set for of a range of future biomarker studies.
