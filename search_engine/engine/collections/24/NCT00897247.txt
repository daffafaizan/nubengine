        -  Identify patients with known asbestos exposure at early stages of disease development
           (i.e., indolent premalignant pleural plaques and fibrosis vs malignant pleural
           mesothelioma).

        -  Determine the expression levels of tumor-associated proteins in these patients.

        -  Analyze samples of serum and pleural effusions obtained from these patients.

        -  Determine the proteomic profile of samples obtained from these patients.

        -  Determine the molecular mechanisms associated with the regulation of the extracellular
           matrix microenvironment proteins (e.g., osteonectin, intelectin, or matrix
           metalloproteins) involved in disease onset and progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo collection of body cavity fluid, including pleural effusion, and blood.
      Specimens, including fresh frozen malignant pleural mesothelioma tumor tissue, if available,
      are analyzed for proteomic profile, gene expression profile, and tumor-associated protein
      expression levels.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
