      anaesthesia from January 2018 to December 2019. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years old,
      pregnancy and allergy to local anaesthetics. Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion
      criteria were randomized to undergo an ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve block. Per-protocol
      all patients received postoperative metronidazole 500 mg for 3 days, laxative, a basis
      analgesia with NSAID and opioids as needed. Postoperative pain on the visual analogue scale
      (VAS) at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours, opioids needed, complications and length of hospital stay
      were recorded. Patients and ward personnel were not informed about the treatment arm. All
      Patients were further controlled 6 weeks after the intervention.
