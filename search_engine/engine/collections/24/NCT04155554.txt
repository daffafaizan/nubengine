      non-profit. The hypothesis of the present study is that bictegravir is associated with a
      lower incidence and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms than dolutegravir. The main outcome
      measure will be a global severity index (GSI) of neuropsychiatric symptoms arising from 10
      symptom domains, including somatization, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity,
      depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism. The
      secondary outcomes are to compare, between arms and during follow up, neuropsychiatric
      symptoms severity, neurocognitive performance, changes in self-reported symptoms, adherence
      and HR-QoL, correlation between symptoms (neuropsychiatric and other), drug exposure and
      HR-QoL, proportion of adverse events, proportion of virological failures and antiretrovirals
      resistance at virological failure.
