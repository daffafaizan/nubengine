      design study. Initial dose cohorts will contain single patients and dose escalation of no
      more than 100%. After the observation of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), or the second Grade
      2 adverse event, or at dose level 4 (12 mg/m2), the study will switch to a 3+3 design with
      3-6 patients per cohort. pharmacodynamics (PD) data.

      Dose escalation decisions will be based on the review of clinical safety and pharmacokinetic
      (PD) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data, and agreed upon by the Sponsor and investigators.

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have an estimated DLT rate of < 33%. Cohorts may be
      expanded at any dose level or at the MTD for further evaluation of safety, or PK parameters
      as required.
