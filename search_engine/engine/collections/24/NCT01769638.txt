           developed in Korea. This formulation is expected to enhance the dosing convenience and
           increase patient compliance while yielding pharmacokinetic profiles comparable to the
           conventional film coated tablet (FCT) formulation.

        -  Objective: The goal of present study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of
           a newly developed ODF formulation with a FCT formulation of sildenafil in healthy Korean
           male volunteers.

        -  Methods: This is a randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over, single-dose study
           conducted in 2 parts. Eligible subjects were healthy male volunteers between the ages of
           20 and 50 years and within 20% of their ideal body weight, and are equally divided into
           parts 1 and 2. Each subject will be received a single -dose of ODF and FCT formulations
           of sildenafil orally in a fasted state (part 1, 50mg; part 2, 100mg), with a 7-day
           washout period between the formulations. Blood samples are collected up to 24 hours.
           Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined for sildenafil and its active metabolite
           (N-desmethyl sildenafil). Adverse events will be also evaluated based on subject
           interviews and physical examinations.
