      parallel arms. The intervention to be studied will be an alternative application of
      riboflavin drops in the inferior fornix. As comparator serves a conventional riboflavin drop
      application directly on the center of the cornea. Our research hypothesis is that the
      application of riboflavin drops in the inferior fornix is not inferior to the corneal
      application with respect to the resulting riboflavin concentrations in the anterior chamber;
      which represents a sufficient corneal impregnation with riboflavin. This study is randomized
      but not blinded. Recruitment is anticipated to start in September 2019 and is scheduled to
      last 1-2 months. We will enroll 12 patients in each trial arm.
