    
      To evaluate the safety, dosimetry and efficacy of 99m-Tc labeled anti-HER2 single domain
      antibody (sdAb) (Product Code Name: 99mTc-NM-02) SPECT/ CT imaging of HER2 expression in
      Breast Cancer and compare it with the existing gold standard " HER2 expression detection" by
      biopsy tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
      method. It is also to establish a new clinical method of non-invasive HER2 expression
      detection in breast cancer using 99m-Tc labeled anti-HER2 sdAb
