      blood donors who have been rejected from blood donation due to low hemoglobin (females <12.5
      g/dl, males <13.5 g/dl) and low ferritin levels (<30 ng/ml) receive an iron-containing
      dietary supplement (sucrosomal iron) for three months with a daily intake of 30 g iron.

      Fifty donors will be included in the study. The study population will consist of two
      sub-groups (premenopausal women and postmenopausal women plus men).

      Our aim is to

        -  gain first findings concerning the extent of the change primarily in hemoglobin and
           secondly in ferritin concentrations

        -  observe acceptance and tolerance after intake of the test product for several months

        -  create pilot data for a following randomized controlled study.

      In addition, possible clinical symptoms associated with iron deficiency will be recorded by
      using appropriate questionnaires (Questionnaire on the assessment of health-related quality
      of life [WHOQOL-Bref], Fatigue questionnaire [FAQ], questionnaire on psychic symptoms of
      insomnia [RIS] and Restless Legs Syndrome).
