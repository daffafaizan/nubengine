      overcoming a number of dermatological conditions began in earnest to receive the attention of
      NASA researchers as a means of providing desired clinical outcomes to astronauts while in the
      confines of a space capsule over long periods of time. The research was well funded and
      supported by the U.S. government, and confirmed the value of light emitting diode (LED)
      low-level light therapy (LLLT), in particular red light from the 635nm frequency, for
      producing a variety of healthful effects within the dermis. The ability to achieve a
      reduction in the dimensions of exposed liposomes using red light is intended to be confirmed
      by analyzing the clinical data from a minimum of one hundred patients who were exposed to the
      635 nm frequency for 30 minutes by use of the subject device (Contour Light) during routine
      use to confirm that the device is safe and effective for its intended application. Please see
      the following clinical articles, appended in section 10.
