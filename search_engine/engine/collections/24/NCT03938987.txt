    
      Anti-CD19/4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T-cell: autologous, unselected CD3+ lymphocytes collected from whole
      blood or apheresis, transfected with a lentiviral vector containing a 2nd generation chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of a scFv recognizing CD19 and dual co-stimulatory
      intracellular signaling domains (4-1BB and CD3ζ). All patients will receive lymphodepleting,
      conditioning chemotherapy in the form of cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/day) and fludarabine (30
      mg/m^2/day) on Days -5, -4, and -3 prior to a CAR T-cell intravenous, single dose
      administration on Day 0.

      Phase 1b: Dose Finding/Escalation Dose Level 1: 0.5 x 10^6/kg Dose Level 2: 1.0 x 10^6/kg
      Dose Level 3: 2.0 x 10^6/kg

      Phase 2: Expansion Patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy as indicated prior to
      receiving the CAR T-cell intravenous, single dose administration on Day 0 at the RP2D as
      identified during Phase 1b.
