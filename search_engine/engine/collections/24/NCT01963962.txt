      unplanned pregnancy rates. However, our study of the copper T380 IUD vs. oral LNG for EC
      showed lower pregnancy rates 12 months after presenting for EC in the copper IUD group.
      Because there is a strong preference for the LNG IUD among women offered the IUD, the
      objective of this research project is to initiate investigation into, and use of the LNG IUD
      in the setting of EC. Our experienced team of EC researchers proposes the following aims to
      provide needed information in this understudied area:

      Aim 1: To assess uptake of the LNG IUD vs. the copper IUD among women presenting for EC
      exposed to standardized counseling.

      Aim 2: Gather baseline data on one-year continuation and pregnancy rates from women
      initiating the LNG IUD vs. the copper T380 IUD when presenting for EC.

      Aim 3: Assess willingness of women presenting for EC to participate in a future randomized
      controlled trial comparing the LNG IUD vs. the copper T380 IUD for EC.

      The study aims will be accomplished with a prospective observational trial of women who
      choose either method of EC. The investigative team will recruit 180 women who present for EC
      at two participating family planning clinics and follow study participants for 12 months.
      This project will compare continuation and pregnancy rates between LNG and copper IUD users
      in the year following presentation for EC. This proposal is another aspect in our growing
      research program offering highly effective contraception at the time of EC presentation.
      Results of this project will direct future study in this area aimed at reducing population
      unplanned pregnancy rates among EC users with the potential to inform a future RCT of the LNG
      vs. copper IUD for EC.
