      I. To assess change in thrombokinetics (platelet circulation life span).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Benefit rate (as defined by stable disease, partial response, or complete response by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v 1.1) at the end of study activities.

      II. To evaluate the safety of trastuzumab emtansine (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) (non-platelet
      toxicity).

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ado-trastuzumab emtansine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving response may continue treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
