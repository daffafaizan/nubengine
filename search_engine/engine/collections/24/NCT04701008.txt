    
      In this observational study, the investigators will monitor all patients with significant
      pain after any non-cardiac surgical intervention at the University of Alberta Hospital.

      After receiving an adequate dose of potent opioids (hydromorphone, morphine), the
      participants will receive up to 0,2-0,25 mg/kg IV ketamine bolus. In our center these boluses
      are given with 10-20mg increments.

      The adequate dose of opioids will be determined by the attending anesthesiologist, depending
      on what patients received intraoperatively and on their comorbidities.

      Pain scores will be assessed before and after administration of this drug. The incidence of
      any side effect after ketamine administration will be documented.
