      Recurrent T1-2 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (rT1-2) may be salvaged by 3D - CRT（3D-Conformal
      Radiotherapy）, IMRT（ Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy）, Brachytherapy (BT), BT combined 3D -
      CRT or IMRT . The aim of this study is to address the efficacy and toxicity profile of
      aforementioned four modalities for rT1-2 NPC.

      Methods and Materials:

      168 patients, median age 48 years (range 16-75 years） proven rT1-2 NPC were diagnosed and
      treated with four different irradiation modalities(3D-CRT,IMRT, BT , BT Combined 3D-CRT or
      IMRT) . Median time to recurrence was 30 months (range 1-180months). The median follow-up
      time was 28 months (range, 4-135 months).
