      relationship between the right IJV and an anatomical landmark in two different head
      positions: neutral and rotational.

      Methods: One hundred patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia with
      endotracheal intubation were enrolled in this study. The patients were placed in the supine
      position with a neutral head position and without a pillow. The apex of the triangle formed
      by the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and clavicle was marked
      (anatomical landmark point: AL point). The ultrasonography of the neck anatomy was performed,
      and a mark was placed at the central point of the IJV to the skin (ultrasonography point: US
      point). The other investigator measured the distances from the AL point to the US point
      (AL-US distance). The patient's head was then turned 30Â° to the left; the same procedure was
      repeated and the AL-US distance was again measured. The changes in AL-US distance were
      calculated.
