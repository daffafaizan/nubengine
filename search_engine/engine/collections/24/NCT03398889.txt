      carotid plaque burden as the dependent variable and coronary risk factors were predictors.
      The residual score essentially represents the distance off the regression line of predicted
      plaque. They were grouped into three categories: Unexplained atherosclerosis (with more
      plaque than predicted by risk factors; residual score >2); Explained (the amount of plaque
      predicted by risk factors, residual score >-2 and <2); and Protected (less plaque than
      predicted by risk factors, residual score <-2).

      DNA was extracted from stool samples in the lab of Dr. Allen-Vercoe at University of Guelph.
      RNA makeup of the intestinal microbiome was assessed in the lab of Dr. Gregory Gloor at
      Western. Plasma levels of trimethylamine n-oxide, p-cresylsulfate, hippuric acid, p-cresyl
      glucuronide, pheny acetyl glutamine and phenyl sulfate were measured by ultra-performance
      liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the lab of
      Dr. Bradley Urquhart at Western.

      Nutrient intake over the past year was calculated at the Harvard School of Public Health from
      the 131 item self-reported and semi-quantitative Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).

      Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated from the Chronic Kidney Disease
      Epidemiological (CKD-EPI) equations.
