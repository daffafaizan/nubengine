      The classic technique of wall closure is the Large Stitch technique that uses monofilament
      double-strand sutures with a SL/WL (Suture Lengh/Wound Lengh) 4:1 ratio, with a distance to
      the alba line and between each stitch of 1 cm.

      Nowadays, the Small Stitch technique is accepted as the technique of choice for closure of
      laparotomies in programmed surgery. It is based on a very long-term monofilament absorbable
      synthetic suture of Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (Monomax) 2/0 with HR (Half-circle Round body) 26
      needle. Stitches should be given with a distance to the alba line of 0'5cm and 0'5 cm of
      separation between stitches.

      There are very few studies about the role of Small Stitch technique in the field of Emergency
      Surgery where the increased morbidity of the patient and the higher rate of surgical wound
      infection can play a fundamental role, and could be improved with the use of new abdominal
      wall closure techniques.
