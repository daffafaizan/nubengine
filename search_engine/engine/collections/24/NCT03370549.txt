      Asian-Pacific Islander (API) women in the US:

        1. A growing incidence of HIV/AIDS. Although the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among APIs is low
           compared to those among Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics, HIV infection among APIs
           significantly increased (44%) between 2004 and 2007. Additionally, 75% of HIV
           transmission among API women is through heterosexual intercourse, which is substantially
           higher than percentages among other racial/ethnic groups of women.

        2. Poor mental health functioning exhibited by completed suicide rates. Young API women
           (ages 15 to 34) have not only the highest rates of completed suicide compared to other
           women of the same age in the US, but also experienced the largest growth in rates of
           suicide over the past decade.

      Our preliminary studies using both quantitative and qualitative methods found strong links
      between past trauma and poor sexual and mental health outcomes. For API women, reporting a
      history of forced sex was associated with higher odds of severe depression, substance use,
      getting pregnant, and HIV risk behaviors compared to API women who did not report a history
      of forced sex. API women continue to be vulnerable given their lower rates of HIV testing,
      lower mental health utilization, and premature dropout rates in mental health treatment
      compared to other racial groups. So far, no existing intervention targets both sexual health
      and mental health problems among API women. Specifically, this study builds upon data on API
      women from prior NIMH-funded work as the foundation for our intervention.
