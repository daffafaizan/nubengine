      cells (PBMCs) from ADEH+ patients results from aberrant pattern recognition receptors (PRR)
      signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) resulting in low level production of IL-12, an
      essential cytokine for IFNγ generation. This study will compare results from 40 ADEH+, 40
      ADEH-, and 40 non-atopic participants.

      Study procedures will typically be completed in one visit; however, participants may be asked
      to return for additional unscheduled visit(s) occurring as frequently as every 3 months for
      the duration of the study to provide an additional blood sample for further characterization
      of immune mechanisms leading to reduced IFNγ responses in ADEH+.
