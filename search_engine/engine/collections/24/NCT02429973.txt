      in patients with metastatic osteosarcoma who have previously received the most active drugs
      in this disease (methotrexate, cisplatin, adriamycin and ifosfamide). The treatment schedule
      consists of a maximum of 6 cycles of 3 weeks of gemcitabine+rapamycin. Gemcitabine is given
      at 800 mg/m2 in days 1 and 8 in cycles of 21 days. Rapamycin is given at 5 mg per day during
      treatment duration.
