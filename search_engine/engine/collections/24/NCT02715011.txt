      known), multicenter, dose escalation study with dose expansion to identify the RP2D and to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of JNJ-63709178 in
      adult participants with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are
      ineligible for or have exhausted standard therapeutic options. The study will be conducted in
      2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. The study is divided into 3 periods: a Screening
      Phase (within 28 days before the first dose of study drug), a Treatment Phase (first dose of
      study drug until the last dose of study drug) and a Post-treatment Follow-up Phase (up to the
      end of study participation or end of study). Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
