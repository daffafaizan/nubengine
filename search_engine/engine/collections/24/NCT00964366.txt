      being conducted at one clinical site. On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of the
      2 test products, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide or dapsone gel and the contra lateral side
      of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control. Approximately 25-30 male and
      female healthy subjects without facial acne, aged 18 to 45, will be randomly assigned to each
      product.

      The eligible subjects who qualify will be entered into a 2-week treatment phase. The first of
      application of the study medication will be supervised at the site, Monday through Friday of
      each week. Any additional applications should be applied by the subjects at home each evening
      and the times of application recorded on a diary card. Subjects will apply the study product
      at home on Saturdays and Sundays and record the times of application on a diary card.

      A blinded expert grader will rate comparative product tolerance during the study before study
      product is applied.

      Instrumentation measurements of TEWL will be utilized to evaluate product mildness.

      Duplicate sebum samples will be taken from the left and right forehead areas and assessed.

      Subject will complete questionnaires and all adverse events will be recorded.
