      with/without N2O/O2 in sedating uncooperative schoolchildren undergoing dental treatment.
      Thirty uncooperative healthy children aged six to nine were randomly selected to receive
      either one tablet of oral midazolam 7.5 mg and one tablet of hydroxyzine 10 mg with 100% O2
      (regimen A), or one tablet of oral midazolam 7.5 mg and one tablet of hydroxyzine 10 mg with
      50% N2O/O2 (regimen B) in a crossover design. Behavior was assessed using the modified Houpt
      behavioral rating scale, by evaluating the videotapes of all patients at both the
      pretreatment phase (injection, rubber dam RD, operating high-speed handpiece with touching
      the tooth without drilling) and the treatment phase (drilling, restoration).
