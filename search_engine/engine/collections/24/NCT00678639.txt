      chest pain are at intermediate risk for short term death or infarction. Most are admitted to
      the hospital for serial ECG's, cardiac biomarkers, cardiology consultation, and stress
      testing or coronary angiogram. However, the 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines suggest that these
      patients can be managed in an observation unit (OU). Recently, cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging (CMR) has proven more accurate than traditional testing modalities for the diagnosis
      of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and has also received endorsement from the American College
      of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Immediate application of CMR
      in an OU may improve health care utilization compared to standard hospital admission for
      intermediate risk patients.

      Research hypotheses:

        1. Patients in an OU CMR protocol will have lower cost for the index hospitalization than
           standard care.

        2. An OU CMR protocol for patients with intermediate risk chest pain will significantly
           improve the frequency of correct cardiovascular admission decisions when compared to
           standard care.

      Methods summary:

      110 ED patients at intermediate risk for short-term death or infarction, with nondiagnostic
      Electrocardiograms (ECG) and normal initial cardiac biomarkers, will be randomized to
      standard care or OU CMR protocols. Subjects in the OU CMR protocol will undergo CMR perfusion
      and stress testing, followed by serial biomarkers. Standard care subjects will be admitted
      for usual cardiac testing. ACS (infarction, death, coronary revascularization, unstable
      angina) will be assessed by evaluation of hospital course and phone follow-up at 30 days.
      Cost of hospital care will be compared among groups.
