      ultimately requires insulin treatment. Patients requiring high insulin dosages represent a
      particular treatment challenge and often have uncontrolled glycemia despite progressive dose
      increases and are especially prone to insulin related lipotoxicity and weight gain.

      Glucagon-like peptide agonists (GLP-1) such as liraglutide have many actions that position
      them to break the vicious cycle in this population through the following mechanisms: (1)
      weight loss; (2) improved hepatic steatosis; (3) improved pancreatic steatosis; (4) decreased
      glucagon levels; (5) improved beta-cell function.

      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that liraglutide is both effective and safe when
      added to a high dose insulin treatment regimen. Liraglutide will improve glycemic control,
      weight, metabolic parameters, as well as patient satisfaction, with minimal adverse events.
      The study also proposes to study the mechanisms through which such improvements might occur,
      especially beta-cell function, glucagon levels, and hepatic and pancreatic fat content.
