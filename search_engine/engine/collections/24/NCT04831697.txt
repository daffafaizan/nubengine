      multi-caregiving intervention on improving outcomes among AAW, ages 40-64 years with type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) and multi-caregiving responsibilities using a pilot randomized design
      compared to diabetes enhanced usual care. The goals of the study will be assessed under the
      following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of the multi-caregiving intervention as measured by
      recruitment, session attendance, retention, and treatment adherence in AAW with T2DM Aim 2:
      To test the preliminary efficacy of the multi-caregiving intervention on glycemic and blood
      pressure control in AAW with T2DM compared to group-delivered, nurse led diabetes enhanced
      usual care at 6 months Hypothesis 1: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention will
      have significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c at 6 months compared to AAW who receive
      diabetes enhanced usual care Hypothesis 2: AAW who receive the multi-caregiving intervention
      will have significant reductions in blood pressure at 6 months compared to AAW who receive
      diabetes enhanced usual care Aim 3: To test the preliminary efficacy of the multi-caregiving
      intervention on self-care behaviors and quality of life in AAW with T2DM compared to
      group-delivered, nurse led diabetes enhanced usual care at 6 months Hypothesis 1: AAW who
      receive the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant improvements in self-care
      behaviors (diet, physical activity, medication adherence, and blood glucose monitoring) at 6
      months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care Hypothesis 2: AAW who receive
      the multi-caregiving intervention will have significant improvements in quality of life
      (SF-12 scores) at 6 months compared to AAW who receive diabetes enhanced usual care

      In the final 6-month assessment, study participants will be asked to participate in 30 to
      40-minute, semi-structured interviews by telephone. Findings will help refine the
      intervention and emphasize elements that enhance participant uptake and motivation for
      sustained behavior change for the future R01.
