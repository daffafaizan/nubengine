      features such as wrinkling, uneven skin color, roughness and brown spots. An effective
      treatment for sun-damage that is commonly prescribed is topical retinoic acid. However, the
      major drawback of topical retinoic acid use has been frequently observed irritation
      characterized by redness, dry skin and severe itching. In this study, we examine whether a
      daily skin care regimen comprised of an ultra mild cleanser and an effective moisturizer can
      help improve tolerance to retinoid treatment.

      Subjects for whom retinoid treatment is indicated for sun-damage will be recruited into the
      study. The retinoid intolerance will be established via prior history (detailed
      questionnaire) and a 2-week retinoid treatment (Tazarotene 0.1% cream) phase followed by
      clinical evaluation and determination of retinoid intolerance.

      Subjects that exhibit retinoid intolerance will continue with the study. Approximately 30
      subjects will be put on a controlled daily skin care regimen during the remainder of the
      study period while the rest of the subjects will continue their normal skin care habits. The
      controlled skin care regimen will consist of facial cleansing with a Dove ultra mild
      emollient cleanser and application of Dove facial moisturizer, used as normal. During this
      period, subjects will be evaluated to determine reduction of retinoid intolerance symptoms.
