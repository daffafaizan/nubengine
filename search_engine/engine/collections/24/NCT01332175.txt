    
      Randomised, placebo-controlled trial of Provent® versus Placebo-Provent® versus continuous
      positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) to define the effects of Provent® on the severity of
      obstructive sleep apnea, daytime symptoms as well as on measures of cardiovascular risk in
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

      Patients successfully treated with CPAP will be randomised to one of three arms for a
      duration of 2 weeks:

        1. Withdraw CPAP and use Provent®

        2. Withdraw CPAP and use Placebo-Provent®

        3. Continue treatment with CPAP
