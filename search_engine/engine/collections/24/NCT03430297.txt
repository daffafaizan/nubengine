           study treatment, treatment will be considered to give after occurrence of progression
           defined by RECIST1.1 as evaluated by the initial investigators, these subjects must
           terminate the treatment when further progression is validated.

        2. The subjects in dacarbazine treatment group are allowed to be crossed to receive JS001
           after progression of disease; however, they need to be re-evaluated if they meet the
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Subjects need to provide one tumor tissue specimen for archival or one newly acquired biopsy
      tissue from the site that is previously not irradiated for evaluation of PD-L1 expression
      status when they participate in the study. The PD-L1 expression status of specimen will be
      evaluated in the central laboratory using immunohistochemical (IHC) method. Subjects with
      positive or negative PD-L1 can be enrolled in this study, and the clinical activity in the
      two subgroups will be evaluated in accordance with the prespecified subgroup analysis.
