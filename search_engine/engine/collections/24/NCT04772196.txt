      low vitamin D status, to worse outcomes. In orthopaedic patients, vitamin D deficiency is
      prevalent among those scheduled to undergo surgery.

      Vitamin D is important for calcium homeostasis and bone health, as well as for activation and
      differentiation of macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. A recent retrospective
      review of outcomes in revision total joint arthroplasty patients showed that patients with
      low vitamin D had higher rates of postoperative complications and periprosthetic infections.
      Additionally, another retrospective study correlated low vitamin D levels with lower patient
      reported outcomes (PROs) after total hip arthroplasty. Current retrospective studies suggest
      that having low vitamin D levels may lead to impaired fracture healing, increased wound
      complication rates, and a higher risk of infections.

      Given this background information, this study will investigate a series of patients
      undergoing ankle arthrodesis and first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP) arthrodesis. Our study
      will serve to enhance the current knowledge as a level 1 randomized control study on the
      effect of Vitamin D supplementation on the complication rate following these two arthrodesis
      procedures. Our endpoints for complications will be defined as infection, wound healing
      complications, need for readmission, need for re-operation and nonunion as evidenced
      clinically and radiographically.
