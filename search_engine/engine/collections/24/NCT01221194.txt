      groups. We plan to enroll patients from three sites: Scott and White Hospital in Temple
      Texas, Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK , and Trinity College Dublin at St James Hospital.. The
      two treatment arms will involve a Standard Therapy Group, and a Stocking Therapy Group. The
      Stocking Therapy group will use the special padded and friction reducing stockings in their
      standard shoes during the course of the study. Patient enrollment will occur over a one-year
      period. All patients will be followed for 30 months. The Standard Therapy Group will receive
      therapeutic shoes, standard insoles, patient education and regular foot evaluations by a
      physician every 10-12 weeks. The Stocking Therapy Group will receive standard therapy as
      described above but use the special stockings instead of their usual hose. The investigator
      at each site will be blinded regarding the treatment.
