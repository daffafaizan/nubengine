      treatment for patients with migraine through the following specific aims:

      A) The primary aim of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current
      stimulation applied to the motor cortex in patients with migraine induces a significant
      decrease in the pain associated with migraine attacks as compared with sham tDCS. We will
      also measure changes in the number of migraine attacks, abortive drug intake (e.g. opioids,
      triptans), as well as overall improvement in the quality of life to assess the effects of
      this treatment.

      B) Determine whether the clinical effects of tDCS are long-lasting. We will therefore compare
      the amelioration of migraine-associated pain between active and sham tDCS after 1, 2 and 4
      months of treatment.

      C) Determine whether tDCS changes the threshold for pain detection as compared with sham
      tDCS. Patients with migraine have a lower threshold for pain as compared to healthy subjects
      and we hypothesize that this threshold as measured by Von Frey Hair Test and Quantitative
      Sensory Test will increase after stimulation with tDCS.

      D) Finally, we will examine whether 1 month of tDCS treatment is safe for use in migraine
      patients. Safety will be assessed through neuropsychological tests and adverse event
      reporting.
