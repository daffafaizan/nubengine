      promising strategy to reduce future educational disparities. However, current interventions
      are limited by cost and have not been widely disseminated. Recognized as a target for
      research to improve early childhood development and school readiness among at-risk families,
      the primary care setting offers an ideal opportunity to reach the millions of children living
      in poverty.However, what remains unknown is how to more efficiently leverage the primary care
      setting to deliver a sustainable and effective preventive intervention to promote positive
      parenting behaviors and encourage early childhood development in low-income families.
      Therefore, the investigators designed Sit Down and Play (SDP) a brief parent-directed program
      delivered in the primary care setting. Modeled after the widely disseminated literacy program
      Reach Out and Read and grounded in social cognitive theory, SDP is intended to take place
      during each pediatric well-child visit occurring in a child's first two years with the goal
      of promoting positive parenting behaviors.
