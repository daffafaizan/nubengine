      cystic fibrosis (5 samples which are acquired through a secondary use) and 40 healthy
      individuals to assess whether these biomolecules could be used as markers of the pulmonary
      disease in cystic fifbosis. Moreover by comparing miRNAs expression level between Cystic
      fibrosis (CF) patients with severe (n=20) or moderate (n=20) pulmonary impairment, we want to
      assess whether some of these miRNAs may be used as markers for the severity of CF pulmonary
      disease. The identification of sensitive and early markers, from a non-invasive sampling
      could enable more effective and early treatment of CF patients.
