      evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (CHO cells) in the
      subjects from healthy adults and elderly adults aged 18 years and above (aged 18-60 and 60-85
      years) . The phase Ⅱ clinical trials designed 4 research group, including an immunization
      procedures (0, 28, 56 days), two doses (20μg/0.5ml, 40μg/0.5ml) and two ages group (adults
      and elder): Each group including 120 participants. Vaccination or placebo group will be
      randomly assigned to receive in a 5:1 ratio, 480 in total.

      Cellular immune blood samples were collected from the top 96 subjects (i.e., the top 24 in
      each study group, vaccine group: control group =5:1), and Elispot test and cytokine staining
      (ICS)/flow assay were performed.
