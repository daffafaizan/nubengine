      prognosis AML or MDS. Donor lymphocyte infusions alone re-induce remission in a minority of
      these patients, which may be the result of poor differentiation of the leukemic cells. The
      study drug 5-Aza is effective in AML and MDS.In addition to direct cytotoxicity, it alters
      gene expression and induces differentiation of leukemic blast cells. Furthermore,
      DNA-demethylating treatment results in an induction of transcription and cell surface
      expression of formerly unexpressed KIRs (killer Ig-like receptors) in NK cells, which are
      involved in the specific recognition of leukemic target cells and who are able to generate a
      specific graft-versus leukemia effect. The increased expression of MHC class I and II
      molecules on the surface of the recipient's leukemic cells and the de novo expression of
      formerly silenced KIR genes in donor NK cells due to treatment with 5-Aza may result in an
      increased susceptibility of myeloid leukemic cells to the allogeneic graft versus leukemia
      effect. Therefore, the graft-versus leukemia effect by donor lymphocyte infusions and NK
      cells from the original donor may be supported by additional therapy with 5-Azacitidine.
