      clinics has not been studied to this date. However, there are some guidance saying says that
      doctors should offer the patient the option of a chaperone wherever possible before
      conducting an intimate examination. The aim of this study is to compare the female patients'
      perception and preference regarding the presence of a chaperone during their first anorectal
      examination conduct by a male physician. Adult women will be investigated during their first
      visit to a Coloproctology Clinic at University Hospital. Only senior professionals will be
      examining the patients. This will be a prospectively randomized trial. Patients will be
      selected to be examined with or without the presence of a female chaperone. After that, they
      will answer a questionnaire form about how they feel during the examination and whether or
      not they would prefer having or not a chaperone present during the anorectal examination. The
      enrollment period will be two years from July 2018. Sample size estimated for the study is
      188 patients (94 in each study group).
