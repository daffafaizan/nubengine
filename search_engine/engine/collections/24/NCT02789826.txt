    
      The surgical procedure for resection of cancer stomach aiming at resection of the tumor mass
      with safety margin and its drainage lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy).

      # Tumor resection;

      Will be done by one of the following techniques:

        1. laparoscopic gastrectomy (totally laparoscopic, laparoscopy-assisted, and hand-assisted)
           types of gastrectomy (according to site of tumour)

        2. Open gastrectomy (according to the site of tumor). # Lymphadenectomy; Will be done
           according to Japanese Gastric Cancer Association guidelines for optimal lymph node
           dissection levels for Early Gastric Cancer (1):

             -  D1+alpha -(perigastric lymph node dissection) for mucosal cancer, for which EMR is
                not indicated and for histologically differentiated submucosal cancer of < 1.5 cm
                in diameter;

             -  D1+ beta for preoperatively diagnosed submucosal cancer without lymph node
                metastasis (N0), for which D1+ alpha is not indicated, and for early cancer < 2.0
                cm in diameter with only perigastric lymph node metastasis (N1);

             -  D2 for early cancer > 2.0 cm in diameter. Follow up: all patients will be followed
                up clinically for the outcomes for each surgical technique.
