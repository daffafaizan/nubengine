      metabolic rate at rest and during a cognitive challenge. To determine this, the investigator
      will measure basal (resting) metabolic rates using a technique called indirect calorimetry
      (IC). This is accomplished by wearing a loose-fitting face mask that measures oxygen intake
      and carbon dioxide output.

      To more accurately measure the amount of carbohydrates, fats and proteins that the body is
      metabolizing, participants will be asked to provide two urine samples (one at the beginning,
      and one at the end, of the study).

      To determine what version of ApoE the participant inherited, the investigator will conduct a
      genetic test on DNA isolated from the participant's blood.
