      The increase in breast cancer survival is largely due to the benefits of hormonal therapy,
      such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), for the treatment of hormone-sensitive
      breast cancer. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that AIs are more effective than
      tamoxifen at reducing breast cancer recurrences. However, breast cancer patients receiving
      AIs have a higher incidence of osteoporosis, bone fractures and musculoskeletal symptoms,
      particularly joint pain and stiffness. Musculoskeletal pain, which occurs in up to 50% of
      patients treated with AIs, often does not respond to conventional pain medications, may lead
      to noncompliance, may cause major disability, and may interfere with quality of life. Many
      women are unable to tolerate these life-saving drugs because of severe joint pain, therefore,
      safe and effective treatments that alleviate these symptoms are needed.
