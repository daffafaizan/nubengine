    
      The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if the nurse-led
      sexual rehabilitation intervention improves sexual recovery and functioning in patients with
      gynaecological cancers (GC) who are treated with either external pelvic radiotherapy only
      (i.e., RT) or external pelvic radiotherapy combined with brachytherapy (i.e., RTBT) compared
      with usual care (Q1).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate if the nurse-led sexual rehabilitation program
      decreases vaginal symptoms and body image concerns, fear of (non-)coital sexual activity,
      treatment-related distress, psychological and sexual distress, and vaginal physical symptoms
      (assessed during physical examination by the radiation oncologist), and improves/increases
      generic-related health related quality of life related to gynaecological cancer, relationship
      satisfaction, and frequency of dilator use, (Q2); to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
      intervention (Q3); and to evaluate whether an improvement in sexual functioning is moderated
      by treatment characteristics and pre-treatment patient characteristics, such as age or sexual
      functioning, and mediated by reduction of vaginal symptoms (and by regular use of dilators in
      women treated with RTBT) (Q4).
