      undergo a liver biopsy. Patients will be from a unique cohort of successfully treated
      patients, who are at least 6 months post gene transfer (patients will be at varying
      timepoints post gene transfer, with the current maximum time post gene transfer being 9.5
      years) and have been treated with self-complementary and over-sized AAV vectors will advance
      the state-of-the-art, in the following aspects:

        -  Provide a clearer insight into the AAV life cycle in human liver

        -  Define the number of human hepatocytes that are transduced

        -  Improve our understanding at the human hepatocyte level of long-term consequences of AAV
           mediated transgene expression from the liver that will include (i) changes in the
           pattern of gene expression in human hepatocytes following AAV mediated gene transfer,
           (ii) information on the epigenetic signature in the liver following AAV mediated gene
           transfer and how this changes with time and (iii) the consequences of transgene
           expression in hepatocytes including the endoplasmic reticulum stress response This study
           will provide new data addressing several unknowns with AAV mediated gene transfer in
           humans that will better inform on safety and efficacy following AAV gene transfer for
           patients who have already participated in gene therapy studies as well as those
           considering this treatment option.
