      currently self-infusing Vivaglobin therapy for at least six months prior to changing to
      Hizentra® therapy. Following screening and enrollment, subjects will continue to self-infuse
      Vivaglobin® for seven infusions and then be converted to subcutaneous Hizentra® treatment
      which they will continue for the next 6 months. The study will determine if Hizentra®
      provides improved subject satisfaction by Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for
      Medication. Diaries related to the local site reactions, the number of infusion sites per
      subject/per dose, volume of Hizentra® per site, duration of infusions, systemic side effects
      of the new medication and dose on IgG levels and antibody titers, and local site reactions
      with Hizentra®.
