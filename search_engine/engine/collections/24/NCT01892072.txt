      cell lines and tumor tissues. Another study observed a sequential elevation of VEGF in
      low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and early stage HCC. Clinical analyses have
      discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular
      invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to
      investigate the VEGF signaling in HCC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating HCC
      growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in HCC growth,proliferation
      and apoptosis.
