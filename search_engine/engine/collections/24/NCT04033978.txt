      frequent consequence of the decision making process alteration. This bias is characterized by
      a fast decision making when probabilistic judgments would be necessar.

      Cognitive remediation aims at reducing the impact of cognitive deficits. The program that
      will be used in the present study focuses on the jump to conclusion bias. In schizophrenia,
      the positive impact of programs targeting such a bias, and more generally social cognition,
      has already been shown in numerous studies. However, despite the fact that jumping to
      conclusion is one of the main goals of these programs, their effects on decision making are
      poorly investigated in literature.

      The program should impact decision making and reduce the jumping to conclusion bias. The
      benefits will probably be linked with a change in the P300 signal. They will probably appear
      earlier and with bigger amplitudes.
