      including the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and temporal summation (TS). Then, they will
      be offered on the double-blind design a several weeks treatment with either pregabalin or
      duloxetine. Patients will be followed-up weekly by phone for their pain relief and will be
      re-assessed in the lab toward the end of the treatment. The investigators suggest that
      patients with less-efficient CPM (deficient pain inhibition) will "earn" more pain relief
      from the treatment with duloxetine, while the patients with the enhanced pain summation will
      response better to pregabalin.
