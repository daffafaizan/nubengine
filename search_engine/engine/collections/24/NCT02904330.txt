      disease have thyroid over activity and hyperthyroidism. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include
      goitre, fatigue, heat intolerance, sweating, weight loss despite good appetite, shakiness,
      inappropriate anxiety, palpitations of the heart, shortness of breath, tetchiness and
      agitation, poor sleep, thirst, nausea and increased frequency of defaecation.

      The rationale of this study is to obtain safety and tolerability data when K1-70 is
      administered as an intramuscular injection or as an IV infusion to subjects with Graves'
      disease.

      This information, together with the pharmacokinetic data, will help establish the doses and
      dosage regimen suitable for repeat administration to patients.

      This is an open-label study. The expected duration of each subject's participation in the
      study is approximately 18 weeks (including a screening period of up to 4 weeks).
