      trial in patients with AD. Each subject enrolled in the trial will be randomized to receive a
      single IV dose of 0 (placebo) or 25 Î¼g/m2 bryostatin. A total of 15 subjects (5 in the
      placebo arm and 10 in the treatment arm) will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of
      screening evaluations and on study evaluations divided into two segments, an inpatient
      segment and an outpatient segment. The four-day inpatient segment will consist of baseline
      evaluations and a 1-hour IV infusion of study drug followed by evaluations at multiple
      evaluations over the first 72 hrs post dose. During the outpatient segment, patients will be
      followed for AEs and have a final evaluation at 2 weeks post dose and a 4-week telephone
      safety follow up. Evaluations will include safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics as assessed by PKC activity
