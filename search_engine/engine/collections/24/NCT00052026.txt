      pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF). Blockade of the sympathetic nervous system
      with β-adrenergic inhibitors could be expected to ameliorate these detrimental effects in a
      manner analogous to the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the
      overactive renin-angiotensin system.

      Carvedilol may be superior to pure beta-blockers in the treatment of CHF through its
      mechanism of action of blocking not only β-receptors but also α-receptors, which would allow
      vasodilation to reduce the afterload on the failing heart. Since beta-blockers may initially
      produce a negative inotropic effect on the heart, long term treatment has been needed to show
      benefits of removal of the adrenergic stimulation. The investigators will monitor the safety
      and efficacy of carvedilol administration in children with chronic CHF due to systemic
      ventricular dysfunction.
