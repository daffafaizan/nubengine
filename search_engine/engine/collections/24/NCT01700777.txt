    
      A randomized control trial of "HABIT-ILE" therapy at intensive frequency contrasted with
      regular frequency intervention. The protocols have been developed on the basis of bimanual
      therapy (HABIT) developed at Columbia University. The intervention takes place either in a 2
      weeks day and night camp, either in regular/conventional intervention (1 to 5 hours a week).
      Children of all groups will benefit from 90h of intensive treatment (children in regular
      frequency will be crossed over afterwards to benefit from HABIT-ILE. Both in the camp and the
      regular interventions, there is at least one therapist for each child.
