    
      Objective: To compare the medium-term outcome of Titanium-Sapphire laser trabeculoplasty
      (TiSLT) vs. Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT) in uncontrolled Open-angle Glaucoma (OAG)
      patients.

      Methods: Prospective, masked, randomized comparative clinical study. Thirty-seven OAG
      patients with uncontrolled IOP and no previous filtration surgery (22 females and 15 males,
      mean age of 68 years) participated. Eighteen were treated with TiSLT and 19 with ALT. All
      patients underwent a comprehensive eye examination including visual acuity, IOP, goniocscopy
      and slit-lamp biomicroscopy and visual field examinations. Patients were examined
      pre-operatively and then at 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months, 1 year and 18 months
      post-operatively.

      Main outcome measures: Final IOP, delta IOP and number of anti-glaucoma medications.

      Results: The 18 patients in the TiSLT arm had an average of 8.3(±2.7) mm Hg or 32% reduction
      from pre-operative IOP (P<0.001). The 19 patients in the ALT arm had a mean IOP decrease of
      6.5 (±4.3) mm Hg (P<0.001) or a 25% IOP reduction. Patients in both groups achieved a similar
      decrease in IOP (P>0.05). TiSLT patients had statistically significant fewer IOP spikes
      compared to the ALT group. (P=0.002). Two patients (1 in each arm) underwent trabeculectomy
      and were considered failures. Mean follow-up time was 15 months.

      Conclusions: TiSLT provides similar efficacy to ALT in IOP reduction in OAG patients, and may
      offer better safety with fewer IOP spikes see post-operatively.

      Application to clinical practice: If confirmed in additional studies, TiSLT may be used as an
      alternative to ALT in OAG patients.
