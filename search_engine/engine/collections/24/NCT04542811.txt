    
      Acupuncture is a Traditional Chinese Medicine method that has been used for 3000 years to
      control symptoms, treat illnesses, and relieve pain. Acupuncture is widely used in many
      countries today as a complementary therapy, especially in cases of chronic pain. Migraine is
      one of the diseases in which acupuncture treatment is commonly used. Studies conducted so far
      have focused more on the effect of acupuncture on pain intensity in patients with migraine.
      Data comparing the impact of acupuncture on both the attack frequency and disability in
      migraine are relatively scarce.
