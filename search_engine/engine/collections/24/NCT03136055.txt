      and in Part B with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or
      irinotecan). Adaptive Simon's two-stage design is used. The overall plan hinges on the
      activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient
      activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A
      and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study
      will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).
