      of daily living such as reading and driving, can be a huge nuisance requiring continual
      dabbing with a tissue and can cause infections and abscesses of the tear drainage system. The
      current, standard investigations for tear drainage delay have significant limitations with
      two separate scans in separate departments being required. A functional MRI scan would be
      able to combine these two scans and provide both better anatomical and functional detail than
      each one respectively. This would have several major benefits:

        1. Improved diagnostic information to guide the treatment choice

        2. Reduced scan resource usage as one scan would provide all the required functional
           anatomical and functional information.

        3. Improved patient convenience

        4. Improved safety as radiation is used for CT DCG, where MRI The study involves
           investigation of both controls with normal tear drainage and individuals with known tear
           drainage delay. Both groups are required for the development of the protocol as the
           speed of tear transit will differ greatly which will facilitate optimisation of the MRI
           scan protocol. This will also provide preliminary data on the speed of tear passage in a
           normal lacrimal drainage system and in an impaired system.

      Several other functional lacrimal drainage MRI studies have been done. However, a clear
      protocol has not been developed and there is no data on normal and abnormal MRI appearances
      and tear transit times.

      The normal standard of care will not be delayed by this investigation as it will be conducted
      while patients are awaiting other lacrimal investigations (DCG and DSG) or lacrimal surgery,
      none of which would be affected by this study.
