      failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) by recruiting a prospective CARDIATEAM
      cohort (n=1600 individuals) from existing cohorts using a defined set of selection criteria
      and will include type2-Diabetes mellitus (T2DM)and non-diabetic patients with a large
      spectrum of demographic, metabolic and cardiac clinical data. This will yield a wide range of
      T2DM - related phenotypes including common confounders such as BMI, smoking, age and blood
      pressure.

      To clarify the phenotype of DCM and to differentiate it from the other forms of HF such as
      HFpEF or HCM, CARDIATEAM will perform unbiased clustering analysis from an in-depth
      phenotyping of these patients' populations
