      (H0). The two assessments will be performed in random order (central randomization stratified
      by participating center), but within 30 minutes (no change of ongoing treatment during the
      assessment period). Two investigators not involved in patient care and blinded to the results
      of the alternative technique will performed independently the hemodynamic assessment using
      one of the two modalities for hemodynamic assessment tested in the study. They will interpret
      the results at bedside and propose a therapeutic change to the attending physician, according
      to the hemodynamic profile. The latter will finally: precisely identify the clinical problem
      to be solved (e.g., therapeutic target of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign not reached, tissue
      hypoperfusion), choose a therapy adapted while taking into account the clinical scenario and
      the results of both the transpulmonary thermodilution and TEE, evaluate the efficacy of this
      treatment (problem solved or not) and its tolerance (potential side-effect attributable to
      the treatment). In addition, the presence or resolution of signs of tissue hypoperfusion will
      systematically be assessed at H6, H12 and H24. Primary and secondary outcomes will be
      assessed by an independent committee of experts.
