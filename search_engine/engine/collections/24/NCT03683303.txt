           This study employed a single-blind experimental design. Study participants were
           randomized into the experimental and control groups. Participants in the experimental
           group used the mHealth App as intervention while those in the control group received
           normal verbal instructions. The levels of wound care knowledge, skills, and anxiety
           related to dressing change in the two groups were compared before intervention (T1),
           after intervention (T2), and before discharge (T3).

        2. Study setting & samples:

      The recruitment site of this study was conducted in a plastic surgery ward at a 1500-bed
      university hospital located in Southern of Taiwan. Samples were recruited either hospitalized
      patients or their primary caregivers from March to December 2016. Inclusion criteria were of
      Taiwanese nationality, were aged 20 years and above, had a wound classification score of 6-10
      points according to Strauss (2000), required self-care of wound at home, and had a habit of
      using smartphones. Exclusion criteria included special care conditions, such as (1) other
      comorbidities (such as severe infection or severe compression injuries with comorbid open
      fractures) and (2) being a special patient, such as one with mental illness. Sample
      estimation based on the F test of MANOVA statistics was carried out using the G Power 3.1
      software. Each group had at least 31 samples (effect size = 0.25, ‚àù = 0.05, power = 0.85). A
      total of 76 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria for this study. There were 6
      patients who were not willing to participate in this study; therefore, 35 participants were
      randomized enrolled in each of the experimental and control groups.
