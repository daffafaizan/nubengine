      hypoglycaemia physical, psychomotor, executive and cognitive function significantly
      deteriorate. These are important prerequisites for safe driving. Accordingly, hypoglycaemia
      has consistently been shown to be associated with an increased risk of driving accidents and
      is, therefore, regarded as one of the relevant factors in traffic safety. Despite important
      developments in the field of diabetes technology, the problem of hypoglycaemia during driving
      persists. Automotive technology is highly dynamic, and fully autonomous driving might, in the
      end, resolve the issue of hypoglycemia-induced accidents. However, autonomous driving (level
      4 or 5) is likely to be broadly available only to a substantially later time point than
      previously thought due to increasing concerns of safety associated with this technology.
      Therefore, solutions bridging the upcoming period by more rapidly and directly addressing the
      problem of hypoglycemia-associated traffic incidents are urgently needed.

      On the supposition that driving behaviour differs significantly between euglycaemic state and
      hypoglycaemic state, the investigators assume that different driving patterns in hypoglycemia
      compared to euglycemia can be used to generate hypoglycemia detection models using machine
      learning neural networks (deep machine learning classifiers).
