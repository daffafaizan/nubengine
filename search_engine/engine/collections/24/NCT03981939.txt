    
      This is a retrospective follow-up observational study of participants with CD with and
      without complex perianal fistula (CPAF) from January 2002 to March 2017. The study will
      verify the potential of using procedure codes to reliably identify participants with CPAF in
      Validation Study (Objective 1), compare Crohn's participants with CPAF (cases) to matched
      participants without CPAF (controls) to determine the disease burden and healthcare resource
      utilization of Crohn's related CPAF in Ontario, and will describe the participant's journey
      among Crohn's participants following the first diagnosis of CPAF (Objective 3).

      The study will enroll approximately 600 participants (300 participants with CPAF and 300
      participants without CPAF). All participants will be enrolled in 2 observation groups:

        -  CD Participants with/without CPAF (ICES data)

        -  CD Participants with CPAF - The Ottawa Hospital (TOH)

      The data will be collected through Ontario health administrative data. Participants will be
      observed retrospectively who were diagnosed with CD with and without fistula between index
      period: April 2002 and July 2013. Participants will be followed up retrospectively from the
      index period (that is onset of CPAF) to the end of study (Objective 2), and for 5 years
      following the (Objective 3) index date defined as onset of CPAF will be selected based on the
      first time they meet the first code in the case definition identified in Objective 1 between
      April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2012. The overall time for data collection in this study will be
      approximately 7 months.
