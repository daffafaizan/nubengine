    
      The CRUSH Project (Connecting Resources for Urban Sexual Health) is a demonstration project
      at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center's East Bay AIDS Center (EBAC) and Downtown Youth Clinic
      (DYC) offering interventions aimed at reducing HIV-1 incidence among young MSM of color in
      the East Bay region. CRUSH has two major components:

        1. Providing enhanced testing and linkage to care (TLC+) for HIV positives, aimed at
           increasing the proportion of HIV positive Y/MSM who are in care, virologically
           suppressed, and receiving intensive risk reduction counseling.

        2. Providing comprehensive sexual health services to high risk HIV-negatives, including but
           not limited to the provision of PrEP and PEP when clinically appropriate.

      In addition, the CRUSH Project will offer a substudy of CRUSH, and will enroll HIV negative
      CRUSH participants who are eligible to receive PEP. Stribild® is a single-tablet, four-drug,
      once-daily complete regimen that is FDA-approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in
      treatment-naïve HIV-infected adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate
      ≥70ml/min/1.73m2. Because of limited data, no antiretroviral drug or combination of drugs has
      been approved for PEP. Current PEP guidelines generally call for using a 28-day course of a
      3-drug regimen that has been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection
