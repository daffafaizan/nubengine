      Primary

        -  Estimate the overall survival at 2 years of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
           multiforme treated with bortezomib in combination with temozolomide and regional
           radiotherapy followed by maintenance therapy comprising bortezomib and temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  Investigate further the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the molecular characterization of tumor tissue and correlate these findings
           with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 29, 32, 36,
           and 39 and oral temozolomide on days 1-42. Patients undergo external-beam fractionated
           regional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Maintenance: Beginning 2-6 weeks after radiotherapy, patients receive bortezomib IV on
           days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days
           for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline (from surgery) and periodically during study
      for further analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
