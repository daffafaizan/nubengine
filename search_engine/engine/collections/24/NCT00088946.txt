      Primary

        -  Compare the effects of erlotinib vs green tea extract (Polyphenon® E) vs placebo on the
           2-year recurrence rate in former smokers with resected superficial transitional cell
           carcinoma of the bladder.

        -  Develop an effective chemopreventative strategy (as an adjunct to standard care) for the
           medical management of superficial bladder cancer in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects associated with these drugs in these patients.

        -  Determine a safe and effective chemopreventative dose of erlotinib in these patients.

        -  Correlate the modulation of 1 or more biomarkers with bladder cancer recurrence and/or
           progression in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Determine the risk of clinical bladder cancer progression in patients treated with these
           drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease stage (Ta vs T1 vs carcinoma in situ) and participating
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib and oral green tea extract (Polyphenon® E)
           placebo once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral green tea extract (Polyphenon® E) and oral erlotinib
           placebo once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral erlotinib placebo and oral green tea extract placebo once
           daily.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of disease recurrence or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
