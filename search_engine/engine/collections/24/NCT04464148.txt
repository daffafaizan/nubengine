      persons with PTSD and AUD. The study will serve as a pilot study to determine feasibility and
      collect pilot data for NIH R01 proposals. All participants will be titrated to 800 mg/day of
      pregnenolone over the course of 4 weeks and maintain this dose for the remainder of the
      study. The study will consist of a screening visit to determine eligibility (Baseline I) and
      a Baseline II visit where participants will receive study medication, and follow-up visits at
      Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Participants will complete a variety of assessments at each study
      visit, including clinician-rated and self-report measures of PTSD, alcohol use, depressive
      symptoms, cognitive performance, and side effects. Blood work will be done to ensure
      participant health and safety prior to randomization into the study, as well as to assess
      pregnenolone blood levels. All participants will meet with a study clinician at each visit to
      monitor safety and assess any adverse events.
