        -  Determine the feasibility of combining paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin induction
           in patients with metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis in first
           relapse following first line treatment with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin.

        -  Determine the response rates to this regimen in these patients

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and ifosfamide IV and cisplatin IV daily for 5
      days. Patients with stable or responding disease repeat treatment every 3 weeks for 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
