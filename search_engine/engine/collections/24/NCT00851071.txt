      Device Clinic. Patients with ICDs experience some level of anxiety which can impact the
      number of shocks that they receive from their Device. 100 of these patients will be
      randomized into one of 2 groups; those receiving three sessions of Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) and those receiving usual care. We hypothesize that if these ICD patients
      receive short term (CBT) they will experience less anxiety and have a lower rate of device
      firings than the patients that did not receive CBT. Furthermore, we will study mechanistic
      pathways involved in the reduction of anxiety in ICD patients. We will extract initial heart
      rate variability (HRV) data from device interrogation. We hypothesize that the CBT
      intervention arm will have a higher normalization of HRV. Patients will repeat questionnaires
      at 3, 6 and 12 months.
