      trained and calibrated examiner. Clinical parameters measurements including; probing pocket
      depths (PPD; the distance from the gingival margin to the base of the gingival sulcus),
      clinical attachment level (CAL), full mouth gingival index (GI)21 and plaque index (PI)20
      scores using a periodontal probe were registered following saliva and GCF sample collection.
      Then, non-surgical periodontal therapy (NPT) consisted of scaling, root planning, and oral
      hygiene instruction was applied. Clinical measurements, recruitment of GCF, and saliva
      samples were repeated after three weeks.

      Gingival Crevicular Fluid and Saliva Sample Collection Selected anterior teeth for GCF
      sampling were isolated from saliva using cotton rolls, a gentle stream of air was conducted
      parallel to the root surface for 5 to 10 seconds to dry the area.

      The periopaper strips were gently inserted into the gingival crevice until resistance was
      felt and were left in place for 30 s and were collected from mesio-buccal sulcus of teeth in
      the anterior region of each patient (two samples per patient and per visit). The samples
      containing blood were discarded and were placed in sterile Eppendorf tubes and were stored at
      -20Â°C until the assay procedure.
