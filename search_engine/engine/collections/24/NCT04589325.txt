      will be randomized to receive either Ixekizumab or placebo in addition to their conventional
      therapy. The primary aim is to examine the effect of Ixekizumab on endogenous insulin
      production when administered to persons with newly diagnosed T1D. The planned study duration
      is 52 weeks with an extension phase for 3 years and includes 74 patients at 19 centers in
      Sweden. During the extension phase the participants will be examined during a visit after 1
      and 3 years after the end of the study regarding insulin production (C-peptide and proinsulin
      secretion during a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test), glycaemic control, T1D auto-antibodies and
      insulin doses.
