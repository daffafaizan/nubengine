      biofeedback is an effective treatment approach for panic disorder. At the same time, the
      investigators want to clarify the change of bio- and psycho- indices present through the
      process. Patient recently experienced panic attacks are recruited in this study. The
      diagnosis of "Panic Disorder" is made by psychiatrists according to The Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5) criteria. Subjects are randomly assigned to
      medication group or biofeedback therapy. The biofeedback therapy is conducted by
      psychologists following the structure way. Every subject will be measured both the bio and
      psycho indices on week 0, 3, and 6 under 6-week observation. In the end of the study, the
      investigators hope to analyze and clarify the treatment effects of our design, and also to
      exam the meanings of these indices, in order to find out an effective treatment approach.
