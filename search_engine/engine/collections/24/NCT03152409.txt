      study are:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the clinical effect of aspirin augmentation on depression.

      Aim 2: To assess the inflammatory profile of the blood of the aspirin augmentation responders
      compared with the non-responders.

      Aim 3: To evaluate whether immune gene expression patterns are associated with antidepressant
      response to aspirin.

      Aim 4: To collect samples for later, more detailed immunologic characterization.
