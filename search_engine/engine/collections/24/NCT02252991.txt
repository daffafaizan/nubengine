    
      This is an open monocentric study, randomized in two parallel arms with a waiting list.

      The duration of the physical activty will vary according to the duration of the treatment:
      from 2 to 6 months.

      Several questionnaries (fatigue, quality of life, ...) will be given to patients at the
      inclusion, at the end of the period of treatment and 3 to 6 months after the end of
      treatment.

      One hundred patients are necessary in this study (fifty in each arm). We expect to a
      stability of the fatigue in Arm A compared to an increase of the fatigue in arm B.
