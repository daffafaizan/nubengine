      agonist on the hypo-dopaminergic syndrome and quality of life of patients with de-novo
      Parkinson's disease.

      The study consists of three parts:

        1. The first part consists of a detailed clinical description of these patients, focusing
           on neuropsychological symptoms. The objective is to describe patients with and without
           apathy and hypo-dopaminergic syndrome.

        2. From this population, a small number of patients with and without hypo-dopaminergic
           syndrome will be selected in order to compare serotoninergic and dopaminergic
           denervation by positron emission tomography (PET).

        3. In patients with hypo-dopaminergic syndrome the motivational effects of a dopamine
           agonist will be tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

      We hypothesize a significant improvement of apathy in the rotigotine group versus placebo
