    
      A multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, two-arm longitudinal trial of the
      safety and effectiveness of the AttenueX Device in reducing incontinence. Subjects randomized
      to the control arm will have the AttenueX Device inserted at the end of the 3-month control
      period. For those subjects who are randomized to the treatment group, the AttenueX Device
      will be inserted into the bladder on Day 0, and replaced every 90 days by a new device for
      nine months. Subjects randomized into the treatment group will be followed for a minimum of
      12 months after receiving the AttenueX Device, while subjects randomized into the control
      group will be followed for 3 months without the AttenueX Device and a minimum of 12 months
      after receiving the AttenueX Device.
