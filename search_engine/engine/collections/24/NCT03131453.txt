    
      The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, adaptive design
      with variable treatment duration planned approximately 2000 cognitively unimpaired
      participants aged 60 to 75 years, with at least one APOE4 allele (Homozygotes or
      Heterozygotes) and, if Heterozygotes, with evidence of elevated brain amyloid.

      The screening period is expected to last about 12 weeks. Participants received disclosure of
      their individual test results for APOE genotyping and brain amyloid status.

      Treatment duration was variable (event driven trial) for at least 60 months, Participants
      returned to the study site every three months for drug dispensing and every six months for
      safety and efficacy assessments, including neuropsychological scales with input from the
      study partner. Brain MRI scans were conducted at month 6 and month 12, and on a yearly basis
      thereafter.

      A Follow-up visit was scheduled 12 weeks after the end of the Treatment Epoch. An additional
      CSF and / or PET AD biomarker assessments were to be conducted on a voluntary basis at year 2
      and 5.

      The study (also known as the Generation Study 2) was conducted as part of the Alzheimer's
      Prevention Initiative (API) program.

      The study was terminated early ..provide reason...... The protocol was modified at
      termination and.................patients were followed, etc...

      We need a reason why the two arms were combined
