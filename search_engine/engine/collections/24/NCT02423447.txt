      production) in this study. It is the goal of the proposed study to compare the efficacy, as
      assessed primarily by sputum weight, of these two different devices (the Electroflo 500 and
      the G5 Flimm-Fighter) for airway clearance (AC) in CF patients with mild to moderate lung
      disease, who have stable lung health and perform AC at home as part of their routine
      therapeutic regimen.
