      have shown feasibility and safety in dedicated centres. Compared to thoracotomy the procedure
      is believed to achieve equal oncologic results and survival, perhaps better.

      Publications have shown that mediastianal lymph node dissection during VATS is similar.

      However, two recent reports have shown potential lower N1 (hilar and intrapulmonary)
      upstaging in VATS surgery After optimal staging the percentage of unforeseen N+ the
      percentage of unforeseen positive nodes can reach 15%

      Nodal upstaging at final pathology is dependent on the quality of:

        -  pretreatment staging, the better, the less upstaging

        -  surgery, ie mediastinal, hilar and intrapulmonary lymphadenectomy

        -  pathologic examination If we accept that pretreatment staging and pathologic examination
           are equal in two comparable surgical cohorts, the finding of unforeseen N+ or nodal
           upstaging is a quality marker of surgery. When surgical techniques are changing, it is
           important to look at this marker.

      In absence of a randomized trial, we believe a cohort analysis is useful. By including all
      patients, open or vats, and comparing cohorts instead of the surgical technique used, the
      selection bias is absent. We compare three cohorts. In the first (20007-2009) almost all
      patients where operated through a thoracotomy. In a second cohort, (2010-2011) the experience
      with vats was early. In the third period (2012-2013), a standardized vats technique with
      extensive intrapulmonary and mediastinal lymphadenectomy was used.
