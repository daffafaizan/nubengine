      psychological state and social adaptation. Being one of these interventions, vaccination may
      cause fear and anxiety in children. This fear and anxiety may affect children's future
      treatment and care experiences and result in fright and avoidance in them. Thus, it is
      important to try and reduce biological stress and to cope with psychosocial stress. One of
      the methods which can be used for this purpose is virtual reality headset used as a
      distraction method. This study was conducted with a randomized controlled experimental design
      to determine the effect of virtual reality headset on children's fear and anxiety during
      vaccinations. The population of the study consisted of first grade students attending primary
      schools in the city center of Ordu. The study was completed with 84 students in the
      experimental group and 85 students in the control group. With the sample number obtained as a
      result of the study, the test power was found to be 89.8% when the alpha error was 0.05 and
      the effect size was kept at 0.5. The data were collected using the Child and Parent
      Introductory Information Form, Children's Fear Scale, and Children's Anxiety Scale-State
      Scale.
