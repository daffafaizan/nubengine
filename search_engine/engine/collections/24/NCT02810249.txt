      be interviewed to collect data on their emotional and cognitive processes (illness
      representation) in response to the threat of a potential HIV infection, and what factors
      (social, cultural, individual characteristics, and experiences in health care) influence
      their likely use of PrEP. The sample for this study will include 20 to 30 African American
      YMSM, aged 16-24, residing in Durham, Wake, and Orange counties of North Carolina.

      The in-depth interview guide and the 26-item descriptive survey PrEP Knowledge, Sexual
      History, and Demographic Instrument were developed for this study using a combination of the
      concepts from the adapted Common Sense Model of Illness Representation (CSM) and questions
      adapted from the Adolescent Trial Network's (ATN) 082 study's questionnaire. Participants
      will be asked questions relating to African American YMSM's likely use of HIV Pre-Exposure
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV risk-reduction strategy. Once informed consent is obtained, the
      interview will commence and study participants will be individually interviewed to discuss
      what factors influence their likely use of PrEP. Each participant will complete the
      descriptive survey and the one-on-one interview.
