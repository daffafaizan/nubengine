      the body, is effective for treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in female teenagers.
      Creatine may have effects of interest in the brain. The reason for the MRI component of this
      study is to learn about new ways to see inside the brain. The investigators will use magnetic
      fields and radio waves to look at the brain and chemicals in the brain. The investigators
      hope that this technique will have medial use in the future.

      The primary hypothesis is that compared to placebo, 2g, 4g, and 10g of creatine monohydrate
      for eight weeks will be associated with a significant increase in brain phosphocreatine (PCr)
      concentrations. A secondary hypothesis is that decreased depressive symptoms measured with
      the Children Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale (MADRS) will be reciprocally correlated with increased Î²-NTP concentrations.
