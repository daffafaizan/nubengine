      refractory to conventional chemotherapy. So far only limited experience is available on
      thalidomide for newly diagnosed myeloma. Therefore the Nordic Myeloma Study Group decided to
      perform a trial comparing traditional melphalan-prednisone therapy with melphalan-prednisone
      + thalidomide/placebo. The study design is a multicentre double-blind randomised
      placebo-controlled trial. Mainly patients >65 years of age will be included since patients
      <65 years will be treated with high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support. The
      primary end-point is overall survival. Secondary end-points are quality of life, response
      rate, time to response, response duration and toxicity.
