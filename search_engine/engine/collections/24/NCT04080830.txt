      high risk of recurrent IS and other major vascular events. Current antithrombotic therapy
      guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation (OAC) alone for the secondary prevention of IS in
      this high-risk population. However, these guidelines are largely based on evidence from
      randomized-controlled trials that did not include patients with acute IS. With the exception
      of the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (EAFT), all randomized-controlled trials evaluating
      antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF included primary prevention populations. Moreover,
      the EAFT trial does not inform the management of patients with severe stroke, as these
      patients were excluded from this trial, and it did not evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      combination OAC and antiplatelet therapy.Current observational studies also provide very
      limited information about the optimal antithrombotic regimen for different stroke mechanisms
      in acute ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack(TIA) with atrial fibrillation. In fact ,
      the regularity of recurrence, the specific mechanism of ischemic stroke and the optimal
      antithrombotic regimen for different stroke mechanisms in these patients are still not clear,
      which limited clinical treatment level of these patients. Patient Registration Study of Acute
      Ischemic Stroke/transient ischemic attack(TIA) With Atrial Fibrillation (AISWAF) is a
      single-center prospective, consecutively, observational study, was conducted in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke/TIA with atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study was to understand
      the stroke mechanism, the regularity of stroke recurrence and its influencing factors, to
      establish a risk stratification model for stroke recurrence, and to preliminarily explore the
      relationship between stroke mechanism, risk stratification and antithrombotic regimen in this
      population.The clinical, imaging and laboratory information were collected at baseline.
      During the 1-year follow-up period, three months, six months and one year after admission,
      the patients were followed up by telephone or face-to-face to record the status of
      antithrombotic therapy, compliance, functional status, recurrence of ischemic stroke,
      intracranial hemorrhage, major extracranial hemorrhage as well as other vascular events and
      deaths.
