      swabs will be subjected to sequence analysis of 16S rRNA. Endotypes (e.g. TH1 vs TH2
      inflammation) and phenotypes of the subjects (e.g. severity, exacerbation, lung function,
      etc.) will be assessed. The planned sample size is 140 adult asthma subjects. Patients will
      have nasopharyngeal swabs taken at baseline, 3 months (after optimization of asthma treatment
      at baseline) and at 1 year. They will undergo assessments, including clinical course, lung
      function, exhaled nitric oxide, skin test, and blood test (including eosinophils and
      immunoglobulin E levels). All subjects will be followed up for 2 years to assess subsequent
      exacerbations and levels of asthma control. The 16S data retrieved from the official website
      of HMP (http://www.hmpdacc.org/) will be used as the geographic reference for this study.
      Sequences assigned to different taxonomic levels, from phylum to genus using the RDP
      (ribosomal database project) database, will be clustered into operating taxonomic units
      (OTUs). Bioinformatic tools will be used to assess the relations of microbiota, asthma
      endotypes and phenotypes and change of microbiota pattern upon optimization of asthma drug
      treatment.
