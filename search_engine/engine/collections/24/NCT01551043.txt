      and tolerability, and persistence of donor lymphocytes engineered to express a chimeric
      antigen receptor targeting CD19 which is linked to the CD3:4-1BB signaling chains in patients
      with CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Upon enrollment, donors will undergo
      leukapheresis and patients will undergo an optional bone marrow/lymph node biopsy
      approximately four weeks prior to dosing. Between dosing and treatment, patients may undergo
      an additional chemotherapy treatment depending upon their disease. At dosing, patients will
      receive redirected donor lymphocytes targeted against CD19 (allo-CART-19 cells). The cell
      dose will be given as a split infusion over three days to enhance the ability to manage any
      infusion related toxicity. Patients will be monitored weekly for four weeks. At the end of
      four weeks, patients will undergo a second leukapheresis and second optional bone
      marrow/lymph node biopsy. At this point the patient will also undergo restaging. Observation
      and monitoring of patients will continue on a monthly basis until week 24 post dosing. Annual
      follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be carried out for 15 years in accordance with
      FDA guidelines for retroviral vectors. Ten subjects will be targeted for this study, with an
      expected rate of drop out of 30% due to disease progression between enrollment and week four
      post dosing.
