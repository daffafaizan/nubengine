    
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and common anxiety disorder that follows
      exposure to an overwhelming traumatic event. The majority of patients with PTSD also meet
      criteria for other psychiatric disorders and PTSD is associated with an increased risk for
      suicide attempts.

      PTSD is responsive to psychological and pharmacological treatments, such as selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but response rates rarely exceed 60%, and even fewer
      patients (20-30%) achieve clinical remission. Thus, there is a clear need to develop novel
      and improved therapeutics for PTSD.

      The study is divided into 4 phases:

      Phase 1 (Screening): a 1 week no drug screening period to assess study eligibility.

      Phase 2 (Pre-Treatment Testing Period): Eligible patients will be enrolled into a 1 week
      Testing Phase, which will include neuropsychological and neurophysiological testing as well
      as blood draws and electrocardiogram.

      Phase 3 (Treatment Period): Eligible patients will be enrolled in a two-armed 6-week period
      of double-blind placebo-controlled acute treatment. All subjects who continue to meet
      eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two groups: GSK561679 (at a fixed dose of
      350 mg/day) or placebo. Randomization will be performed at a 1:1 ratio into two treatment
      groups. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological testing will be repeated after 5 weeks of
      the double-blind treatment period.

      Phase 4 (Follow-up Period): Safety follow-up visits will be conducted 1 week and 1 month
      after the end of the treatment Phase 3.
