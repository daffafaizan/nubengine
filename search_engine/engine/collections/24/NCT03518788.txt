      physical and radiological examination. Patients will also complete questionnaires for quality
      of life assessment (EORTC QLQ 30) and symptoms (VAS for pain). Patients will then be
      randomized into one of the two arms.

      For patients included in arm 1, a permanent drainage (Pleur-X) is provided under local
      anesthesia performed on an outpatient basis while for patients included in arm 2 a
      pleurodesis with talc in VATS is planned under general anesthesia. Arm 2 patients will be
      hospitalized for 5 days.

      Patients will then be followed up to 3 months after surgery. During this period a medical
      examination will be required at 1 week, 4 weeks and 3 months after the intervention during
      which the patient will be asked to complete questionnaires for the evaluation of quality of
      life (EORTC QLQ 30) and symptoms (VAS for pain ). A chest radiograph will be performed after
      four weeks to evaluate the primary parameter. Adverse events will be collected throughout the
      study period.
