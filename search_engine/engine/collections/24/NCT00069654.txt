      contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by
      activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation. Patients with
      coronary artery disease, however, have deficient synthesis or increased degradation of NO due
      to endothelial damage or dysfunction. Reduced NO could contribute to symptoms and progression
      of coronary artery disease through vasoconstriction, platelet activation, inflammatory cell
      attachment to the arterial wall, and increased growth of cellular elements of the vessel
      wall. We have recently determined that nitrite, formed by the auto-oxidation of NO, can be
      converted to bioactive NO, in part through reactions with deoxyheme proteins that exist not
      only in red blood cells, but also within the vessel wall. An alternative source of bioactive
      NO may be via the diet, as nitrates reductases present in oral bacteria. Nitrite may then be
      converted to NO within the acidic environment in the stomach and absorbed into the
      bloodstream, or absorbed directly and converted to NO in the bloodstream via reaction with
      deoxyheme proteins. This study is designed to determine the contribution of daily
      nitrate/nitrite to NO adducts in blood and to vascular dilator tone assessed directly in the
      forearm and indirectly through treadmill exercise testing. Findings in this study may have
      important clinical implications not only in coronary artery disease, but also in other
      conditions associated with regional endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO
      bioactivity (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking,
      estrogen deficiency), and possibly account for the cardiovascular benefit of diets rich in
      vegetables shown in epidemiological survey studies.
