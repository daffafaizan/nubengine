      and development. Although breastfeeding has many benefits for the infant and the mother,
      breastfeeding rates drop drastically during the first three months after birth. There is a
      number of factors that influence the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. One of the
      key factors is maternal self-efficacy in relation to breastfeeding. The aim of the study was
      the development and evaluation of an intervention to enhance maternal perceived self-efficacy
      in order to contribute positively to the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. This
      was done by using a complex intervention approach (MRC framework) to design and assess a
      multi-center controlled trial, involving midwives and nurses working at the Complejo
      Hospitalario de Navarra (CHN) of the Servicio Navarro de Salud and at the Cl√≠nica Universidad
      de Navarra (CUN). These health professionals were trained to deliver the intervention. The
      intervention was focused on self-efficacy related aspects and took place at three instances
      with every mother: in the final stage of pregnancy, during the maternal hospital stay after
      giving birth, and in the first days after discharge. The participants in the control group
      received the standard care as provided in each health institution.
