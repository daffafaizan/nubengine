      of perinatal morbidity and mortality.

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder in which a person's breathing pauses or
      becomes shallow during sleep. These periods of low oxygen lead stress and inflammation which
      that may be harmful to both the mother and her fetus. OSA in pregnancy has been associated
      with poor maternal-fetal outcomes, including low birth weight, preterm delivery, FGR,
      gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and higher rates of neonatal ICU
      admission.

      Auto-titrated positive airway pressure (aPAP) is a machine that gently delivers pressurized
      air via a mask to keep a patient's airways free of obstruction during sleep. It is currently
      unclear whether treatment of OSA during pregnancy in women with known FGR can improve fetal
      and neonatal outcomes.
