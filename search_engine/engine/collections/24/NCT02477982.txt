    
      Anaesthesia maintenance upon initiation of CPB will be achieved by propofol (1%) bolus (1
      mg/kg TBW) immediately followed by 2 mg/kg TBW/hr infusion that will be continued till
      weaning from CPB. During CPB an additional propofol bolus doses can be administered to
      prevent awareness according to the clinical judgment of the responsible anaesthesiologist.
      Any additional doses given and their timings will be recorded.

      Blood samples of 2 ml each will be collected from the arterial line of CPB machine until the
      end of CPB then from sub-clavin arterial catheter routinely inserted in such surgeries.
      Sampling process will follow the following schedule; at baseline prior to dosing, followed by
      samples at 1, 3, 5,7 min after the propofol bolus dose, then every 20 minutes during propofol
      infusion, just before discontinuation of the propofol infusion and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30,
      60 minutes after the end of infusion. In addition, just before any rescue propofol dose
      administration, an unscheduled sample will be withdrawn
