      infarction, and heart failure. Its myocardial complications result from increased mechanical
      load on the heart. Under physiological conditions of increased myocardial load and resulting
      myocardial stretch, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
      synthesis and secretion occur contributing to maintenance of optimal cardiorenal and blood
      pressure homeostasis. However, studies indicate that in subjects with cardiovascular diseases
      the biological structure of these hormones may be altered, thus reducing their favorable
      protective activities. New studies indicate that early and moderate hypertension is
      associated with a derangement of the natriuretic peptide system which is characterized by the
      lack of activation of biologically active ANP and BNP, while severe hypertension is
      characterized by cardiac release of altered molecular forms of ANP and BNP that have reduced
      biological properties and/or enhanced degradation.

      The broad objective of proposal is to advance the biology and therapeutics of the natriuretic
      peptides (NPs) with a special focus on the cardiac peptide BNP in human hypertension. The
      investigators' proposal is based upon the biological properties of BNP (i.e., natriuretic,
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone suppressing, vasodilating, anti-fibrotic, anti-hypertrophic and
      positive lusitropic), its mechanistic role in human hypertension, and thus its potential as
      an innovative chronic protein therapeutic to enhance the treatment of patients with
      uncontrolled and or resistant hypertension. Importantly, BNP is an endocrine hormone normally
      produced by the human heart, and its use as therapeutic agent has been approved in USA for
      more than a decade and has been proven to be safe.
