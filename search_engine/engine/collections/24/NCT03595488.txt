    
      This is a single blind, placebo controlled trial to be conducted in adult patients with AERD
      to determine the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in treating symptoms of chronic
      rhinosinusitis.

      All subjects will be treated with the FDA-approved and the commercially available dose for
      adult atopic dermatitis of 300 mg every 2 weeks administered subcutaneously, based on the
      observed efficacy and safety of this dose. In addition to atopic dermatitis, this dose has
      also been shown to be efficacious in adult asthma.15 Patients will not be treated with a
      loading dose since other studies of dupilumab in asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal
      polyposis have not used a loading dose.

      There will be a one month screening period to determine the patient's eligibility and
      establish symptom control and baseline parameters.

      Patients will continue their background medications for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal
      polyposis and asthma. These medications may include nasal corticosteroids, nasal
      antihistamines, systemic antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, 5 lipo-oxygenase
      inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta agonists, and long acting muscarinic
      antagonists. These controller medications will not be dispensed or supplied by the sponsor.
