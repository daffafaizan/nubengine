      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, participants in the present
      study could enter a long-term extension study SYR-322/OCT-001 (NCT01263496) that was planned
      separately.
