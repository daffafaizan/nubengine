      vaccinia virus encoding the gene for sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with metastatic
      melanoma. II. Determine the efficiency of viral infection and GM-CSF gene insertion and
      function in these patients. III. Determine the capacity of this regimen to generate antiviral
      and antitumor immunity in these patients. IV. Determine the frequency of regression of
      injected and uninjected lesions in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of intralesional recombinant vaccinia virus encoding
      the gene for sargramostim (GM-CSF) (rV-GM-CSF). Patients are stratified by center. Patients
      receive small pox (vaccinia) vaccine via multipuncture technique on day 0. On day 4, patients
      with a progressive major reaction to the initial vaccination receive rV-GM-CSF
      intralesionally twice weekly for 5 weeks. Only 1 lesion is treated and at least 1 measurable
      lesion is left untreated in each patient. Patients with responding disease after week 5 are
      retreated at a clinically appropriate dose and schedule. Cohorts of 5 patients receive
      escalating doses of intralesional rV-GM-CSF until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. Additional patients receive rV-GM-CSF at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients (15 for each phase) will be accrued for this
      study.
