      groups of patients, (with severely reduced, moderate, and mildly reduced to normal renal
      function). Secondary aims are to explore whether specific situations/characteristics result
      in higher probability of delayed elimination of contrast, and whether there is a link between
      elimination time and adverse post-contrast outcomes (post-contrast incidences of acute kidney
      injury; post-contrast changes in eGFR within 5 days from baseline; 1-month post-contrast
      change in eGFR; 1-month post-contrast incidences of eGFR decline >=5 mL/min/1.73m2; 1-month
      dialysis and mortality).
