      of applied electrical current. To this end, a wire with tiny stimulating electrodes is
      implanted into one or both sides of the brain. An electrode is a small piece of metal used to
      take an electric current to or from a power source. These electrodes are connected under the
      skin on the scalp to a small electrical unit called an INS (implantable neurostimulator),
      which is similar to a heart pacemaker. The device sends out electrical impulses that appear
      to change the normal flow of electricity in the brain.

      The wires which house the electrodes will be implanted on both sides of the brain oriented
      towards the centromedian thalamus-parafascicular complex. This region of the brain has to
      date the greats number of documented cases revealing significant improvements in motor tics.

      This region of the brain will also provide a target where physiological changes related to
      motor tics are likely to be discovered.

      The device we propose for this study has several features that make it more suitable for use
      in the TS population than other devices. It is self-contained in the skull and brain, and
      contains no tunneled neck connector wire and no chest pacemaker deice. This will help to
      lessen infection, and will assist in limiting device-related fractures due to tics involving
      neck region. Also, the system can record electro-encephalograph data from the area of the
      electrodes, which will assist us in gathering information about what specific physiological
      changes are correlated with tics.
