      The three-drug combination of oxaliplatin with 5-FU/LV (fluorouracil/leucovorin) in the
      second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer have shown a significant increase in
      response rate compared to 5-FU/LV alone. Oxaliplatin has recently been FDA-approved for this
      indication and is now a standard first-line agent in combination with a fluoropyrimidine.
      Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the growth factor receptor, has shown
      activity with and without irinotecan in subjects with colorectal cancer refractory to
      irinotecan alone. Cetuximab has also been shown to be safe and effective when administered
      with infusional 5-FU/folinic acid plus irinotecan. These results suggest that the addition of
      cetuximab to fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin-based regimen in the 1st line setting should be
      explored. The use of the oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, to replace infusional 5FU has
      been widely used for improved convenience and possible safety. We have chosen a modified
      biweekly CapeOx (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) regimen due to its improved tolerance and
      response rate with a fixed dose of capecitabine given its widespread practice and ease of
      use.
