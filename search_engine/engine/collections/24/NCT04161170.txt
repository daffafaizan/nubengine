      existing digital healthcare applications (apps) is that there is a limit of sustainability
      that most people do not continue to use digital healthcare apps, thus, it can be possible
      only with monitoring and intervention by medical staff.

      Not only users, but also medical staff can access integrated biometric data on the digital
      integrated healthcare platform so that individual patient-specific management systems that
      monitor and intervene can continuously motivate patients to manage themselves. Also, it could
      be a prerequisite for the successful management of patients with diabetes using digital
      healthcare apps, many existing apps have been identified as failure cases in previous
      studies. In this clinical trial, investigators will study the efficacy of digital integrated
      healthcare platform based on monitoring and intervention by medical staff using AI
      (aritifical intelligence)-based diet management solution.

      In addition, in this clinical trial, the latest medical device, real-time continuous glucose
      monitoring system (CGMS) will be applied to monitor blood glucose levels. It has been
      reported that glucose level is well controlled when the number of self blood glucose
      measurement is performed frequently, but in practice, patients have time and space limitation
      in self blood glucose measurement, and it is difficult to change the management pattern of
      patients by encouraging self blood glucose measurement. Therefore, by applying a CGMS every
      three months, not only the patient but also the medical staff can access the 24-hour blood
      glucose values, and can actively participate in the blood sugar management of the patients.
      Therefore, investigators plan to conduct clinical trial using digital integrated healthcare
      platform using AI-based diet management solution and real-time CGMS
