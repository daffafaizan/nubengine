    
      This is a prospective, international, multicenter study performed in 2 steps:

        -  From 0 to 12 weeks: randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study;

        -  From 12 to 52 weeks: open label, treatment only study.

      The study will assess the efficacy of DESIRIAL® in reducing the vulvovaginal symptomatology
      after a single injection. One hundred twenty one postmenopausal women of minimum age 45, with
      symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy, refusing estrogen therapies for treatment of
      symptoms or with contraindications for such therapies, with at least one moderate to severe
      vulvovaginal symptom among dryness sensation, dyspareunia, itching / irritation and pain, who
      have given her informed consent and met all the eligibility criteria, will be enrolled.
      Patients will randomly (2:1 ratio) receive a 1mL-injection of DESIRIAL® (Desirial Only group,
      DO) or placebo (Placebo and Desirial group, PAD) in the vestibular and vaginal mucosa using
      the multi-puncture and/or retrolinear technique at D0. If still eligible 12 weeks after,
      patients from PAD group receiving placebo at Day 0 will be treated with DESIRIAL®. Group DO
      will be followed up at 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks timepoints.Group PAD will be followed up at
      4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 weeks timepoints. Phone interview will be performed between 3 and 5
      days after injection to check safety. Variation of vulvovaginal symptomatology, sexual
      function and vaginal pH will be measured using vulvovaginal symptomatology questionnaire,
      Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and vaginal pH indicator strip respectively. Safety will
      also be assessed through collection of adverse events.
