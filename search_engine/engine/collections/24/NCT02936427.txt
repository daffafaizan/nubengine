      complications and hospital stay. Newer methods of pain relief with fewer systemic effects
      have become even more important. Continuous wound infiltration catheters (CWI's) aim to
      deliver local anaesthetic agents directly into the wound (4). This technique goes back to
      1994, and has been established in this hospital and is used in a non-structured manner in
      thoracic surgery. Recent studies have demonstrated that the addition of dexamethasone (a
      steroid) to local anaesthetic agents in similar nerve blocks significantly improves the
      analgesic affect and prolongs the duration of the analgesia. To the best of the investigators
      knowledge this has not been tested in a thoracic surgery cohort of patients, though it has
      been tested safely and effectively in the thorax in healthy volunteers and in postoperative
      analgesia in abdominal and musculoskeletal post op patients. The investigators aim is to
      assess whether the addition of perineural dexamethasone to the local anaesthetic in CWI's is
      superior to the local anaesthetic alone in thoracic post operative patients, and at which
      dose. They also want to assess the levels of pain experienced 1 month post op to evaluate the
      potential effect of dexamethasone on post thoracoscopy pain syndrome.

      The investigators aim is to compare the use of local anaesthetic agent in combination with
      perineural dexamethasone with the current practice of local anaesthetic alone at relieving
      pain in the immediate post op pain period. The investigators also want to assess whether the
      8mg dose of dexamethasone used in similar studies is the optimal dose or whether a similar
      effect can be observed at a smaller dose of 4mg.
