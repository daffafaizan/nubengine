      times per week for 8 weeks for 24 training sessions. Each session is directed by a licensed
      physical therapist and lasted 60 min (including rest period of 10 min). Brain activity and
      gait assessment will be performed at visits 0 (baseline), 24 (post-test), and at 3 months
      (follow-up) after training.

      Primary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on spatio-temporal
      parameters measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA,
      USA), muscle activation patterns measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc.,
      Scottsdale, AZ, USA), metabolic energy cost parameters measured by portable cardiopulmonary
      metabolic system (Cosmed K4B2, Rome, Italy) and cortical activation measured by functional
      Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (NIRScout, NIRx, Germany).

      Secondary objective is to demonstrate the effects of hip assist robot on motor function
      improvement evaluated by Short Physical Performance Battery Protocol and Score Sheet (SPPB),
      Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Push and
      Release (P&R) test, Functional Reach Test (FRT), Korean version Fall Efficacy Scale (K-FES),
      Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Range of Motion (ROM).
