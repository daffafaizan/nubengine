      immune changes that could increase the risk of infection with HIV. While several studies have
      aimed to characterize immunologic changes in women using hormonal contraceptives, the nature
      and the magnitude of these immune changes have not been adequately defined due to limitations
      in study design rigor, and small and statistically underpowered sample sizes.

      The study will prospectively recruit cohorts of HIV-uninfected women initiating hormonal
      contraception to characterize systemic and lower genital tract innate and adaptive
      immunologic changes that occur over the course of 1 year. This study will test the
      overarching hypothesis that hormonal contraceptives induce systemic and mucosal immune
      changes capable of altering susceptibilities and/or responses to diseases including HIV
      infection, and that these effects vary markedly in nature and magnitude by contraceptive type
      and will be modified by the vaginal microenvironment. The main aim is to determine the
      immunologic alterations in female genital and systemic immune profile associated with depot
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), Etonogestrel implant (Eng-Implant) and Levonorgestrel IUD
      (Lng-IUD).
