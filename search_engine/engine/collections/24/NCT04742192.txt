    
      This prospective, multicountry, multicentre, non-interventional study plans to include
      patients who have undergone surgery for early-stage (IA to IIIB on the basis of pathologic
      criteria) non-squamous NSCLC up to 6 weeks prior to enrolment into the study. Eligible
      patients should have availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen(s) to
      be primarily tested for EGFRm at validated local laboratories or a central laboratory. The
      informed consent will be obtained from the patients during their routine clinical care visit
      before data are collected from the medical records. The data on socio-demographics, tumour
      staging, histology, surgical management, and neoadjuvant therapies will be collected from
      available medical records at the treating facility by the investigator. If PD-L1 testing is
      conducted as part of routine clinical care, the available results will be recorded. Patients
      will be followed prospectively and follow-up will be considered as complete once EGFRm status
      of the patient's tumour sample is known and any planned adjuvant therapy has been recorded.
