      redution, stable respiratory rates, and predictable cardiovascular responses. Dexmedetomidine
      facilitates patient comfort, compliance and comprehension by offering sedation with the
      ability to awaken patients. This study is being done to determine sedation efficacy and
      dosing; measure reduction or eliminate the need for rapid sedative infusion during
      bronchoscopy; improvement of patient comfort and safety during complex bronchoscopy;
      establish a new paradigm for moderate sedation during flexible bronchoscopy
