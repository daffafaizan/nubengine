    
      A consecutive cohort of 20 neurologically asymptomatic (absence of numbness, tingling,
      burning or pain in the feet) patients with Type I from the practice of Dr. Richard Noto
      (gatekeeper) and associates will be asked with their legal guardians to enroll in this
      case-controlled study using a battery of safe, neurological tests which are unlikely to be
      painful. A second group of 20 subjects who are nondiabetic and healthy (age/sex matched) will
      also be enrolled and undergo the same battery of neurological tests. The battery of tests is
      highly accurate, objective and safe. Subjects will be referred and enrolled from the private
      practices of community pediatricians. A BMI derived from the subject's height and weight will
      be assessed by Dr. Noto. Subjects who are felt to be acceptable by the inclusion criteria
      will then receive consecutive numbers from 1 to 40 and their initials will follow their
      specific number for each study.
