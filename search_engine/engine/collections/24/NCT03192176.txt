    
      This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group,
      multi-center study to assess the efficacy of ESN364 in postmenopausal women suffering from
      vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes).

      This study will consist of a screening period (Days -35 to -1, including the screening visit
      [Visit 1] and a minimum 7-day collection of baseline vasomotor symptom frequency and severity
      assessments), a 12 week treatment period (Day 1 [Visit 2] to Week 12 [Visit 5]), and a follow
      up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

      The study will be performed on an ambulatory basis. The screening visit (Visit 1) will occur
      up to 35 days prior to randomization. Eligibility will be assessed via physical examination,
      clinical laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG, Pap smear, mammography, and endometrial
      biopsy. Subjects will receive an electronic diary in which to record daily vasomotor symptoms
      during the duration of the screening period. Subjects must have â‰¥7 consecutive days of
      vasomotor symptom recordings to participate in the study. Subjects are encouraged to continue
      recording for the duration of the whole screening period. The electronic diary will be
      reviewed by study site staff on Day 1 (Visit 2) to confirm study eligibility. Subjects may be
      rescreened 1 time upon approval of the medical monitor.

      During the treatment period, subjects will return to the study site every 4 weeks for
      assessments.

      The follow-up visit will occur approximately 3 weeks following the last dose of study drug.
