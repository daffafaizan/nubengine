      the infection and the impenetrability of the blood-brain-barrier for most drugs. Thus, cure
      usually requires a combination of neurosurgical evacuation of abscess material and 6-8 weeks
      of high-dose intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy to ensure eradication of bacteria within the
      abscess cavity. Disadvantages include risks of nosocomial infections and line-associated
      complications (e.g. bleeding, venous thrombosis, or need for replacement due to malfunction)
      in addition to the considerable costs of such long-term admission. However, improved insights
      into the pharmacokinetic properties and favourable bioavailability of some oral antibiotics
      may allow such treatment at an early stage. To date, there are no randomised controlled
      trials to guide treatment of bacterial brain abscess.

      The investigators wish to determine whether a treatment strategy of transition to oral
      antibiotics after two weeks of treatment is non-inferior to continued IV antibiotics in
      clinically stable brain abscess patients assessed by the proportion with a favourable outcome
      at six months since randomisation.
