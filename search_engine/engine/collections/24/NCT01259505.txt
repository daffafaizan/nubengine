      especially in breast cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray
      technique. We have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from these
      molecules and identified that these peptides significantly induce the effective tumor
      specific CTL response in vitro and vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we
      evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response of these peptides. Patients will be
      vaccinated once a week until patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
      On each vaccination day, CDCA1，URLC10，KIF20A，DEPDC1 and MPHOSPH1 peptides (0.5, 1 or 2mg of
      each peptide) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection.
      Repeated cycles of vaccine will be administered until patients develop progressive disease or
      unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. In the phase I study, we evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of these peptides vaccine. Also we evaluate the immunological and clinical
      response of this vaccine therapy.
