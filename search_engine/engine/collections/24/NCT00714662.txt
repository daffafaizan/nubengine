      least 6 months will be evaluated for eligibility. Patients with previous adverse reactions to
      FX series dialyzer will not be included in this study. Detailed demographic physical
      characteristics of the participants will be recorded, including age, gender, underlying
      diseases, blood pressure, intradialytic complications, as well as indices of nutrition,
      inflammation, and dialysis adequacy. Eligible patients will first undergo a 4-week run-in HD
      with conventional-flux dialyzer twice weekly plus high-flux dialyzer once weekly (i.e., basic
      formula), followed by random allocation into two separate groups. Patients in group A will
      continue HD with the basic formula, while those in group B will receive HD using high-flux
      membranes thrice weekly. Three months later, all participants will be put back on HD with
      basic formula for 1 month (wash-out period). Group A patients will then be switched to
      receive HD with high-flux membranes thrice weekly, and group B patients will be changed to
      undergo HD with basic formula for another 3 months. Laboratory tests will include monthly
      biochemistry and hemogram, plus blood and urine specimens taken on 4 occasions before and
      during the study (baseline, end of the first 3 months, end of wash-out, and end of the second
      3 months) to investigate selective markers and indices for nutrition, inflammation, and
      dialysis adequacy.
