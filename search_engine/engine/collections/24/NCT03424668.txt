      based prospective study of approximately 25,000 men and women resident in Norfolk United
      Kingdom. They were aged 39-79 years when first recruited from general practice age sex
      registers at baseline assessment 1993-1997. While part of a ten country half million
      participant European collaboration originally aimed to investigate diet and other lifestyle
      determinants of cancer, the objectives of the Norfolk cohort from inception were expanded to
      encompass the trajectory of health, ill health and mortality in a population over time and to
      examine the biological and lifestyle determinants of health and chronic disease. Detailed
      data on sociodemographic, lifestyle, medical and family history were collected and a
      biological sample bank including urine and blood samples established. Participants have been
      followed up through repeat examinations, mailed questionnaires as well as through record
      linkage with routine health records including death certification by cause, cancer
      registration and hospital admissions by cause till present.
