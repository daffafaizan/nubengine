    
      Patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic preperitoneal or open inguinal hernia repair will
      be evaluated by means of scrotal/testicular ecocolordoppler ultrasound investigation before
      and after surgery in order to rule out the potential impact of the surgical procedure on
      testicular arterial and venous blood flow

      Ecocolordoppler will evaluate:

        1. testicular arterial flow (Peak Systolic Velocity Testicular Artery - End-Diastolic
           Velocity Testicular Artery - Resistive Index testicular Artery)

        2. venous impaired outflow using varicocele classifications (DUBIN - scale 1-3; HIRSCH
           scale 1-5)

        3. testicular volume
