      (COVID-19), including 2348 deaths. Although the impact factors of clinical outcomes among
      hospitalized patients still need to be clarified, some of the therapeutic regimens have shown
      their potency in the treatment of severe cases. Investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of
      psychological and physical rehabilitation based humanistic care in the treatment of
      COVID-2019. As the national medical team sent to Wuhan, investigators proposed a
      Psychological and physical rehabilitation based humanistic care regimen generated from our
      experience in treating patients with COVID-2019. In addition to routine therapy,
      investigators will apply this comprehensive humanistic care regimen to the patients according
      to their condition to see the efficacy to this regimen.
