      with external beam radiotherapy in patients with high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the
      extremity or trunk. II. Assess the radiographic and pathologic response rates to this
      preoperative regimen in the subset of these patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of doxorubicin. Patients receive doxorubicin
      intravenous (IV) bolus followed immediately by doxorubicin IV over 4 days every week for 5
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with measurable disease receive
      external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks concurrently with doxorubicin treatment.
      Patients with measurable disease undergo surgical resection of the residual mass 4-7 weeks
      following completion of chemoradiation. Patients who have no measurable disease and have
      undergone prereferral excision undergo surgical resection of the prior surgical scar and
      tumor bed followed by external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Cohorts of 3
      patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 4 months for 2 years, and
      then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study at a rate of 5-6
      patients per month.
