    
      Project ALERT is a substance abuse prevention program that targets middle school students.
      The purposes of this evaluation are to test its immediate and one-year effectiveness in a
      randomized experimental design that will span a total of 2.5 years for each of two cohorts.
      The cohorts are spaced one year apart to reduce our implementation and data collection
      burdens at any one time. The design for the two cohorts is identical. In schools randomly
      assigned to the treatment group, instructors receive Project ALERT training and materials
      prior to beginning the program and have access to technical assistance on request. In schools
      randomly assigned to the control group, teachers implement whatever substance abuse
      prevention curricula they normally would (if any).
