      disease burden and economic costs. Still, it often remains undetected and untreated, which in
      turn increases the likelihood of a chronic course, treatment resistance and rising healthcare
      costs. One solution to address early detection and disease burden could be widely accessible
      depression screening. Our previous trial in cardiac patients provides first evidence that
      depression screening combined with written individual-targeted feedback on the screening
      results improves depression severity and encourages greater patient participation and
      engagement in mental health. To amplify these effects in a broader setting, the
      internet-based DISCOVER randomized controlled trial (RCT) now aims at addressing affected but
      yet undetected individuals on the internet. In order to evaluate the effect of feedback in
      this setting, a total of 1076 individuals reporting elevated levels of depression (PHQ-9
      score â‰¥ 10) will be randomized into three groups. They either receive a) no feedback (control
      group), b) standardised or c) tailored feedback on their depression screening results. The
      primary hypothesis is that feedback reduces depression severity six months after screening
      compared to no feedback. The secondary hypothesis is that tailored feedback is more
      efficacious as compared to standard feedback. Futher outcomes are guideline-based depression
      care, depression-related help-seeking behaviour, a health economic evaluation, clinical
      outcomes (somatic symptom severity and anxiety), health-related quality of life, illness
      beliefs, intervention acceptance, depression diagnosis and adverse events.
