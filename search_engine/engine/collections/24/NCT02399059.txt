      and decreases SSI infection rate. SSI leads to an immunocompromised situation, as immunologic
      defense is focused on controlling the septic focus, leaving unattended the neoplasm. It has
      been described that SSI may result in a worse oncologic outcome. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate prospectively the effect of peritoneal lavage with clindamycin and gentamicin on the
      oncologic outcome of colorectal tumours.
