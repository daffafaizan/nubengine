      mg/m2 (d 1-4), followed by hyperfractionated radiotherapy (hfRT; 45 Gy, 2x1.5 Gy/d) with
      concurrent carboplatin (100 mg/m2) and vindesine (3 mg) (d 1, 8, 15), then surgery and, if no
      or R1/2-resection, additional hfRT (24 Gy; 2x1.5 Gy/d) versus (arm B) 3 cycles of cisplatin
      55 mg/m2 (d 1 + 4)/etoposide 100 mg/m2 (d 1-4),followed by surgery and then RT (1.8 Gy/d)
      with 54 Gy or, if no or R1/2-resection, 68.4 Gy.

      The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). With 500 patients evaluable an
      improvement of median PFS from 10 to 14 months could be detected.
