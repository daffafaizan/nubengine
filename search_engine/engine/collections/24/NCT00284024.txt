      nutrition. There are many ways to help women breastfeed when they are having difficulties
      with the process, mostly involving support from a lactation consultant. However, some women,
      despite all appropriate non-medical interventions and support do not produce sufficient
      breast milk to meet the nutritional needs of their infant.

      This is a feasibility study to determine how domperidone affects breast milk production in
      women with insufficient milk supply feeding term infants. This project will serve to refine
      and advance the design of a subsequent full-scale clinical trial.

      The goal of this study is to: a) refine the intervention strategy (drug dosage), b) to define
      the target population and ensure adequate enrollment, c) assess protocol adherence and
      subject retention, and d) collect preliminary data to establish measures of clinical
      efficacy.
