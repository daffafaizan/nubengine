      mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg) in a treatment ratio of 1:1:1 and no less than a ratio of 1:1 for
      female: male subjects. The study comprises single dose and multiple dose phases. The
      randomized dose administered in the single dose phase will be the subject's dose level for
      the multiple dose phase. A single dose of OCA (5 mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg) will be administered on
      Day 1. PK, safety, and tolerability will then be assessed for 3 days. On Day 4, the multiple
      dose phase will begin at the same dose level (5 mg, 10 mg, or 25 mg), with subjects receiving
      OCA once daily for 14 days. PK, safety, and tolerability will be assessed for 2 weeks at the
      clinical site following the last investigational product (IP) dose on Day 17. Subjects will
      be confined at the inpatient trial site from Day 0 until the morning of Day 30. They will
      return to the study site on Day 37 for follow up.
