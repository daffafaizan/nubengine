      global population: the pedometer. Several measurements per questionnaire also will be carried
      out repeatedly (weekly) in order to correlate this level of objective physical activity with
      the levels of fatigue and quality of life. The hypothesis we formulate is as follows: the
      number of weekly steps is negatively correlated with the level of fatigue, positively with
      the quality of life and well-being.
