    
      Open-label, crossover study comparing the peak post-prandial glucose levels and the
      incremental post-prandial glucose area under the curve (AUC) during closed loop (CL) control
      alone and during CL control with liraglutide in an inpatient research setting. Data generated
      during outpatient baseline evaluation and liraglutide dose titration phases of the study will
      be compared to assess the short-term efficacy of this agent during open-loop continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump treatment.
