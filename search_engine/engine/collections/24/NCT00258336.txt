        -  Determine the efficacy of immunotherapy comprising rituximab, autologous immunoglobulin
           idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine (FavId™), and sargramostim (GM-CSF), in terms of response
           rate (partial and complete) and event-free survival, in patients with indolent B-cell
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate development of an immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-4 hours once weekly for 4 weeks.
           Patients are evaluated for response at month 3. Patients with responding or stable
           disease proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients with progressive disease are removed
           from study.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive rituximab as in induction therapy in months 7, 13,
           and 19. Patients also receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine
           (FavId™) subcutaneously (SC) once on day 1 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC once daily on
           days 1-4 in months 4-6, 8-11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24. Patients with continued
           response after completing 2 years of therapy may continue to receive FavId™ and GM-CSF
           once every 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients will be accrued for this study.
