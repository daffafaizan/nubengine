      usual care (eUC) in 20 Bronx practices serving over 5,000 children ages 2-12 years with
      persistent or uncontrolled asthma. Eleven eUC practices will receive guideline information
      and assess children's asthma severity and control, but active intervention components will
      not be provided. Practices will join the study in 4 waves over 4 years (4-6 practices per
      year). Provider adoption of guidelines and utilization of care in all patients (~5,000) ages
      2-12 years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from intervention and eUC practices will be
      evaluated using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data and practice-based screening for asthma
      severity and control. Investigators will also enroll a random subset of 512 caregivers of
      children with persistent/uncontrolled asthma from both study arms to systematically evaluate
      caregiver-reported child morbidity outcomes and obtain measures not available in EHR.

      Intervention consists of academic detailing in the EHR that follow national asthma guidelines
      and outreach worker care coordination for patients with persistent or uncontrolled asthma.
