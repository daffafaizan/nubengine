      (balance) disturbances have been demonstrated to be associated with neck pain. Specific
      therapeutic exercise directed to neuromuscular impairments and manual therapy for the
      cervical spine are effective interventions for improving dizziness symptoms, neck
      impairments, functional ability and quality of life. However, the effects of these
      interventions on the actual impairment of joint position sense and balance remain uncertain.
      Adaptive changes in the sensorimotor and postural control systems may need to be specifically
      addressed. Currently, it is not known whether the clinician has to train every impairment or
      can choose between sensorimotor training and balance training in the rehabilitation of neck
      pain. Different training approaches may have specific influences on the different outcomes
      and their outcomes will be important to inform the optimal and efficient management of
      persons with chronic neck pain.
