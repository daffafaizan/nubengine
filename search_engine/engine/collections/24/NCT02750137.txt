      cannulation compared to EMLA. After several critical incidences of adverse reactions that
      occurred with its application, a departmental audit was carried out to look at the incidence
      and severity reactions with its application as well as its outcome on intravenous
      cannulation. The findings of the departmental audit showed that the incidence of adverse
      reactions seemed to occur more commonly compared to other studies.

      A prospective observational study was carried out to look at the incidence and severity of
      skin reactions following routine clinical application of Ametop.

      This study aims to achieve the following:

        1. Investigate the incidence and severity of adverse skin reactions following topical
           application of Ametop prior to intravenous cannulation

        2. Assess the success rate of intravenous cannulation

        3. Identify the possible risk factors associated with adverse skin reaction.
