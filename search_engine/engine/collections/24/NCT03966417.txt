      severely deconditioned and are thus likely to benefit from cardiac rehabilitation programs.
      In this controlled trial, patients after TAVI will be randomized to either exercise training
      or usual care.

      The aim of our study is to compare the effect of exercise training vs. usual care on:

        1. exercise capacity

        2. vascular function

        3. parameters of heart failure, inflammation and homeostasis

        4. arrhythmogenic potential

        5. health-related quality of life
