      The objective of the HeartFlow ADVANCE Registry is to evaluate utility, clinical outcomes and
      resource utilization of FFRCT-guided evaluation in clinically stable, symptomatic patients
      with CAD in order to further inform patients, health care providers, and other stakeholders
      about which technologies are most effective and efficient in the diagnosis and management of
      CAD.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine if the availability of FFRCT, in addition to coronary anatomy from the
           cCTA, will lead to a significant change in the coronary management plan.

        2. To assess the real world outcomes of utilizing FFRCT to guide invasive management and/or
           medical treatment.

        3. To assess resource utilization, following standard practice for diagnostic and treatment
           pathways incorporating FFRCT as the preferred CAD diagnostic test.

        4. To provide society including patients, health care providers, and other stakeholders
           with information about which diagnostic technologies are most effective and efficient in
           managing patients with CAD.
