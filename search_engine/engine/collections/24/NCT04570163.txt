      (such as "cardioband" and "edge-to-edge" techniques of the tricuspid valve) performed in
      Berlin/ Brandenburg (primarily at the Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin). Based on the
      development and the increasing use of interventional therapies in tricuspid and pulmonary
      valve diseases, the impact on the patients' symptoms and life expectancy after interventions
      will be investigated. The aim is to identify patient subgroups that benefit the most.

      Primary endpoints: Total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalization.

      Secondary endpoints: NYHA class, NTproBNP, liver and kidney function (laboratory
      measurements), valve function, cardiac function, and cardiac morphology.
