      cancer outpatients. At baseline, measurement of tissue factor-bearing microparticles (TFMP)
      was performed by impedance-based flow cytometry based on established methods. (Zwicker et al,
      2009) Patients were classified as having high or low TFMP levels based on a reference
      repository of plasmas from sixty cancer patients. The top tercile of tissue factor-bearing
      microparticle concentrations from the reference specimens (3.5 x 104 microparticles/Âµl) was
      considered a cutoff for "high" and corresponds with previously described "detectable" levels.
      Patients with high levels were randomized (2:1) to enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily
      or observation. Randomization was stratified based on cancer diagnosis. Low TFMP patients
      were observed without anticoagulation. Both the treating physicians and patients were blinded
      to microparticle status in the observation arms.
