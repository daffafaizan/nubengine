        -  To determine the ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) to
           identify men who can safely avoid unnecessary biopsy.

        -  To assess the ability of the MP-MRI-based diagnostic pathway to improve the rate of
           detection of clinically significant cancer as compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
           biopsy.

        -  To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an MP-MRI based diagnostic pathway.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T2-weighted imaging,
      diffusion-weighted MRI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) followed by template prostate
      mapping and transrectal ultrasound biopsy.

      Some patients may undergo blood, urine, and tissue sample collection periodically for
      biomarker studies. Samples are banked for future research analysis.

      Patients complete a quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D) at baseline, during, and after
      completion of study. An economic analysis will be performed for cost-effectiveness.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up periodically.
