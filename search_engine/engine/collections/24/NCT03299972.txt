      600 million reported in 2000, to >2 billion by 2050, there is an increasing interest in
      health issues related to ageing. One area of particular interest is sarcopenia, defined as
      the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength and physical function as a consequence of
      ageing. Sarcopenia has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease, poor
      metabolic and cognitive function, reduced quality of life and early mortality. Studies have
      reported beneficial effects of both resistance exercise and increasing protein intake
      independently and in combination on markers of sarcopenia (mostly increases in muscle mass,
      strength and physical function). However, little is known about the effects of combined
      intervention on energy metabolism, appetite and cognitive and endocrine function. This
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups trial will investigate these,
      alongside assessing the effects of combined intervention on total lean tissue mass, muscular
      strength and functional performance.
