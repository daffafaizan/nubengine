      weight loss. The investigators propose a 2-arm randomized controlled trial in which 258
      participants who lose at least 5 kgs in a weight loss program will be randomized to one of
      the following: 1) daily weigh-ins and weekly feedback, 2) daily weigh-ins,weekly feedback,
      and a weekly escalating lottery-based financial incentive.

      Study participants will be obese volunteers recruited from a major community-based weight
      loss program (Weight Watchers), who have lost at least 5kg during the 4-6 months prior to
      enrolling in the study. Upon enrollment, these participants will have an active online
      membership with Weight Watchers. Among these participants, the following will be assessed: 1.
      Assess the effectiveness of escalating lottery rewards, relative to the control group, on
      maintenance of weight loss over the ensuing 6 months (Phase I); 2.The degree to which weight
      loss is maintained in the intervention group relative to usual care during the 6 months
      following the cessation of the interventions (Phase II).

      During Phase I, incentives will be provided to some study participants (escalating lottery
      arm) for the first 6 months and participants will be followed for 6 more months to examine
      effects following cessation of incentives.
