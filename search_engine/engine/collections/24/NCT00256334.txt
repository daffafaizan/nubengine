      treatment will be approximately 14 days before standard of care surgical resection of tumor.
      Resveratrol will be ingested as 20 mg pills or in the form of freeze-dried grape extract
      which is prepared by the California Table Grape Commission used under GMP guidelines for
      human consumption.

      The first two patients receiving resveratrol will be treated at a dose of 20 mg/day, the
      third and fourth patients at a dose of 80 mg/day, and the fifth and sixth patients with a
      dose of 160 mg/day. All patients receiving grape extract will receive 125 mg/day that will
      have to be mixed with one 8 oz glass of water. There will be no dose adjustments. If a
      patient has any side effects which are attributed to the resveratrol, it will be
      discontinued.
