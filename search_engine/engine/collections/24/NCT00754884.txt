      widespread pain and tenderness. Fibromyalgia occurs in around 2% of the US general
      population, is more common in women and is associated with substantial morbidity and
      disability. Treatment of fibromyalgia has been disappointing; roughly one-third of patients
      have had a clinically important therapeutic response to medications or no-medicinal
      treatment, event with the newest drugs reported in the literature. Pathophysiology of
      fibromyalgia is unknown, but abnormalities in central neurotransmission might play a role.
      Some studies have shown that salmon calcitonin increases peripheral and central levels of
      endorphins. Increasing endorphins levels may decrease pain. Then, it is feasible that nasal
      administered salmon calcitonin may decrease several of the symptoms and signs of patients
      suffering fibromyalgia.
