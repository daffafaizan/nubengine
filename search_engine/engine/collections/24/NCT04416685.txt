      retrospectively reviewed. This retrospective cohort study identified all consecutive patients
      with T3 (stage IIA to III) adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas, who underwent
      concomitant venous (PV/SMV) resection. Those patients with locally advanced tumors that were
      not responded to neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. The local ethical committee was approved
      this study.

      Data collection included demographical features, tumor characteristics including the PV level
      of the tumor considering computed tomography results, neoadjuvant therapy, surgical data,
      hospital stay, morbidity and mortality.

      Anatomical classification was established based on the relationship between portal confluence
      (PC) and tumor location (Figure I). Those tumors located superior to the PC were classified
      as Level I, whereas tumors on the confluence inferiorly located to PC were classified as
      Level II and Level III.
