      in conjunction with a suspected or proven infection, is a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality. It is an extremely common presentation in emergency departments. Most sepsis
      protocols and guidelines call for blood cultures to be obtained in patients with sepsis, in
      order to identify blood stream infections (BSI) which are usually caused by bacteria in the
      blood.

      Blood cultures obtained in the emergency department are costly, subject to false positive
      results, and only positive about 10% of the time. Also, they rarely change patient
      management.

      C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory marker that rises rapidly in the presence of
      bacterial infections. Because CRP rises as much as 100 times normal levels in the presence of
      bacterial infections, we have used it successfully to identify patients with sepsis who do
      not require a blood blood culture, we believe that physicians knowledge of CRP levels can
      help to guide their decision to order blood cultures.Patients with sepsis (2 or more SIRS
      criteria and presumed infection) will have their CRP levels measured using a point of care
      device (Alere Afinion AS100 Analyzer) prior to blood tests being ordered. Patients will be
      randomized to either have their CRP value shown to the attending physician or not. Rates of
      blood culture ordering and safety outcomes will then be compared between the two groups.
