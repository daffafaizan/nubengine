    
      The study is designed as a single center, post-market, non-randomized, open-label,
      observational clinical study with retrospective and prospective enrollment to evaluate the
      2-year post implantation survivorship of the PyroTITAN™ HRA device following the
      implementation of a new proof test to identify and eliminate devices with sub-standard
      mechanical integrity. The results will be compared to data collected in a prior study
      conducted before implementing the new proof test. The PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis
      device configuration will include humeral resurfacing CAP without cement. Patients will be
      selected retrospectively and prospectively for recruitment into the study based upon the
      normally accepted criteria for primary shoulder resurfacing arthroplasty.

      137 subjects with PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasties will be implanted and
      followed for up to 60 months.
