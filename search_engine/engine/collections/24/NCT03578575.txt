      medicine is the future trends, and the theory of body constitution is the most potential
      study for the individualized medicine and to research the process and prognosis of disease.
      Technique of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is also involved to comprehend to the mechanism
      of the prescriptions under the theory of body constitution.

      The nasopharyngeal cancer is a Chinese-specific disease, and radiation therapy has remarkable
      effect. There are many studies proving that Traditional Chinese medication can relieve the
      side effect of radiation therapy. The study will combine next-generation sequencing and TCM
      diagnostic tool, and analyze the transformation of body constitution and the performance of
      genes related to radiation therapy. The results may reveal the molecular mechanism of TCM
      constitutions and the benefit of Danggui BuxueTang, and may be used for early screen and
      prevention to other cancers or diseases. Furthermore, it can help to develop the potential
      drugs.

      The study plans to collect 120 cases within two years. The participants would be divided
      randomly to the experimental group and control group. The blood sample would be taken for
      next generation sequencing analysis before the radiation therapy, and after the radiation
      therapy combined with traditional Chinese medication. The result of samples would be compared
      with each other to identify "Qi deficiency gene" and "TCM effective gene".
