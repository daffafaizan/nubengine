    
      The CCPS is designed as a multi-center, longitudinal, observational study that will collect
      clinical and biological data and specimens from children with a CPS and their relatives. The
      investigators plan to:

        1. Establish and maintain a framework for recruitment, participation, and surveillance of
           children with cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) in clinical and translational
           research studies;

        2. Define the natural history of disease in children with CPS; and

        3. Evaluate the clinical impact and effectiveness of standard and emerging tumor
           surveillance strategies.

      The study will enroll approximately 350 Children and 700 Relatives per year. The
      investigators plan to collect demographic and diagnostic data at enrollment. Longitudinal
      follow-up will be performed at least annually.

      The CCPS includes the establishment of a biorepository, with a hub and spoke structure, with
      a central repository at Emory University/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta for prospective
      collection of some tissues, linked to local biorepositories at participating institutions.
      Information about inventory of tumor specimens already banked locally will be available in
      the database, along with reference to existing genomic studies of the tumor, such that
      investigators may identify and request such tissue or data for specific studies, subject to
      approval of the CCPS Scientific Committee.
