      MRI sequences in adults with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

      The MRI sequences and their primary outcomes are:

        -  Four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI and wall shear stress (WSS)

        -  Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) MRI and kinetic transport constant (Ktrans)

        -  T1 and T2 mapping (T1 and T2 relaxation times)

      Feasibility is tested by the production of high-quality images that enable calculation of the
      primary outcomes. Reproducibility is tested by calculating interscan, intra- and
      interobserver variability. Clinical relevance is tested by assessing the association between
      primary outcomes and disease severity which is expressed by AAA diameter
