      ovarian cysts. The advantages of laparoscopic surgery over conventional open surgery are less
      pain, shorter recovery time, shorter hospital stay, and consequently faster return to normal
      activity as well as better cosmetic effects. However, laparoscopic surgery is more
      challenging compared with open surgery, partly because surgeons must operate in a
      three-dimensional (3D) space through a two-dimensional (2D) projection on a monitor, which
      results in loss of depth perception and consequently more cognitive workload on the surgeon.
      In traditional 2D laparoscopic procedures, the surgeon has to mentally transform and process
      the 2D image into a 3D image using motion parallax through movement of the laparoscope,
      relative position of instruments, and shading of light and dark. During the past 3 decades,
      3D imaging systems have been introduced in and attempt to improve in-depth perception and
      spatial orientation during minimally invasive surgery. The anticipated advantages for the
      surgeon are greater accuracy and speed in manual skills, translating to decreased operative
      time, a reduced learning curve, and enhanced safety.

      Nevertheless, studies, to date, examining the potential advantages and disadvantages of 3D
      versus 2D imaging systems have produced contradictory results. Moreover, there have been no
      studies exploring the advantage of 3D imaging system in patients undergoing laparoscopic
      ovarian cystectomy. The aim of this study was to gain subjective and objective data to
      determine whether 3D imaging systems in the treatment of ovarian cyst are superior to 2D
      systems in terms of surgical outcomes.
