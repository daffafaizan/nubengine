      high-risk localized disease and radical prostatectomy is a standard therapy for this subgroup
      of patients. However, despite best local therapy, about 30-60% of high-risk patients will
      eventually develop biochemical relapse and a significant proportion of these patients may
      progress with metastatic disease and die from prostate cancer. Currently, there is no data
      supporting the use of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk disease since studies
      failed to demonstrate clinically significant benefit with standard androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT). Following improved outcomes in other malignancies with the use of neoadjuvant
      therapy with active drugs in the metastatic setting, there is a growing interest in
      evaluating new-generation androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy in earlier stages of
      prostate cancer. Therefore, the goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      neoadjuvant therapy with ADT and abiraterone versus maximal androgen blockade using ADT,
      abiraterone and apalutamide for patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.
