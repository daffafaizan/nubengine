      improving voluntary motor function in Huntington's disease, symptoms that seem to be most
      important for the functional disability associated with the disorder. To achieve this,
      patients are randomised to ACR16 45mg qd, ACR16 45mg bd, or placebo treatment in equal
      proportions in a parallel design for treatment duration of 26 weeks.
