      room, the investigators will first perform an axillary ultrasound guided core needle biopsy
      percutaneously. Patients will have already undergone prior injection of radioisotope and blue
      dye and as a standard procedure or the sentinel lymph node dissection. After induction of
      anesthesia, the investigators will identify the location of the sentinel node with a gamma
      probe to identify the "pre-incision hot spot." Axillary ultrasound will then be used to
      identify the location of the lymph node and a percutaneous core needle biopsy of the targeted
      lymph node will be performed. The core biopsy specimen will be evaluated for the presence of
      blue staining and radioisotope uptake intraoperatively. The core biopsy specimen will then
      will be sent for pathologic analysis. The percutaneous biopsy should take about 10 minutes of
      additional operating room time. The operation will then proceed as planned with dissection
      and removal of the remaining sentinel node(s). Core samples and sentinel lymph nodes will be
      evaluated in a similar fashion per existing sentinel node protocol.
