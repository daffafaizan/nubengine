      20min on five consecutive days) on auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia patients using
      the change in ratings on the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) by patients before
      and after stimulation. We hypothesize that tDCS will modulate the abnormal neuronal activity
      found in schizophrenic patients and thereby decrease their auditory hallucinations when
      measured after stimulation.

      AIM 2: To evaluate the long term effects of tDCS by having patients give a rating on the AHRS
      after one month has passed since stimulation and comparing this value to their baseline score
      and their score immediately after stimulation. We hypothesize that there will remain a
      significant reduction in auditory hallucination score in participants who received tDCS at
      one month.
