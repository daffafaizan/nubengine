    
      In 2017, China CDC conducted a study titled "A Study of Immunogenicity and Seroconversion
      With Sabin IPV Schedules in China". This study offers evidence that two doses of sIPV
      administered at 4 and 8-11 months of age and three doses of sIPV administered at 2, 3, and 4
      months of age both provide serological protection against poliomyelitis. At present, all the
      infants in the monitoring cohort were over 18 months old and at least one year had elapsed
      since the last dose of sIPV inoculation.

      Since there is no any data about the protection duration of two-dose Sabin IPV schedules,
      China CDC propose to follow up the study cohort when all subjects are at least 18 months old
      to monitor persistence of antibody. So that, if the antibody levels are not high enough to
      protect children from the disease, remedial measures can be taken as soon as possible.So
      China CDC conduct this follow up study ,to

        1. Evaluate the proportion of seroprotection of antibody against poliovirus at over 18
           months of age infants after a 2-dose or a 3-dose primary schedule of Sabin IPV in
           Chinese children.

        2. Measure neutralizing antibody titers against poliovirus type I, II and III at over 18
           months of age infants after 2-dose Sabin IPV schedule, compared with 3-dose Sabin IPV
           schedule.
