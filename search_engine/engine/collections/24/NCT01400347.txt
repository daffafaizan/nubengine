      the weight or resistance applied but also by doing an exercise that would better target the
      desired muscle. Information regarding selected lower extremity muscle activity during
      specific exercise and the influence of fatigue and speed on muscular activation may enhance
      exercise prescription for all parties involved. Specifically, selection of specific training
      or rehabilitation exercises may be guided by increased awareness of specific muscle
      activation patterns during common exercises.

      Methods and Measures: Healthy subjects between 18 - 35 years old will be recruited from the
      community by a sample of convenience and word of mouth. Potential participants will report to
      the Institute for Human Performance. The potential participants will be asked to complete all
      documentation including informed consent, and health screening questionnaire. The qualified
      participants will be familiarized with the set up and specific exercises. If eligible,
      surface EMG recordings will be collected from the back extensors, gluteal muscles (buttocks),
      hamstrings (posterior thigh), quadriceps (anterior thigh), and gastrocnemius (calf) during
      squat and lunges exercises.

      For data analysis, a within subject measures analysis will be conducted using general linear
      models. Specifically, we will use paired t-tests and an analysis of variance (ANOVA). When
      applicable, post-hoc tests will be used to uncover differences among the groups of subjects
      on descriptor variables such as age, height, weight, rate of perceived exertion, and maximal
      and sub-maximal voluntary muscle performance variables (i.e. EMG amplitude, frequency). The
      statistical significance level will be set at alpha = 0.05 for all analyses performed.
