      survival of patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease treated with tretinoin
      liposome. II. Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior response to
      treatment (refractory vs recurrent vs post marrow transplant). Patients receive tretinoin
      liposome IV over 30 minutes every other day for 28 days. Treatment continues every 28 days
      for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who are eligible for stem cell or marrow transplant receive at least 2 courses
      before crossing over to transplant. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 105 patients (35 per strata) will be accrued for this study
      over 2-3 years.
