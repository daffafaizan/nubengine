      primary care physicians working in primary care practices affiliated to one of three
      collaborating laboratories in the Leuven, Ghent or Antwerp regions.

      Primary care practices will be allocated and randomized to either the intervention or control
      group. Physicians in PCPs randomized to the intervention will be offered order sets based on
      indication when using the CPOE for ordering laboratory tests. The effect of order sets will
      be analyzed for 17 common indications for ordering laboratory tests in Belgian primary care:
      diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, general check-up, unexplained
      fatigue, anemia, liver pathology, medication monitoring, gout, chronic kidney disease, lung
      embolism, acute coronary syndrome, diarrhea, thyroid disease, sexually transmitted disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis and obesity.
