    
      Longitudinal, comparative, controlled, observational multicenter study based on a cohort of
      1500 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients with CIRs from the COVID-RIC1 cohort: 750 accepting
      vaccination and 750 refusing vaccination matched on age (+/-10 years), gender, rheumatism and
      recruiting center. Schedule: 4 visits over a 12-month period.

      An observational routine care study was initiated in 15 French hospitals to assess the
      SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in France in a population with CIRs. The project plans to screen
      5000 CIRs patients. The COVID-RIC3 study will thus be proposed to these pre-screened subjects
      according to their agreement or refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19 based on a question
      asked at the time of their inclusion in COVID-RIC1.

      The efficacy and safety of the SARS-CoV2 vaccines as well as the vaccine-induced humoral
      immune responses and their maintenance over time in immunosuppressed patients with CIRs are
      essential to guide vaccine recommendations in these specific immunocompromised populations in
      terms of "boost" or booster.
