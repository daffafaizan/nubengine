      trial. The study was conducted in the fall semester of 2016 and in the fall semester of 2017
      in the midwifery department of a university.

      The study universe comprised 79 students who took the course about vaginal delivery (which is
      included in the midwifery curriculum) provided using simulation-based training and 90
      students taking this course for the first time. The study included 120 participants,
      including 60 randomly selected students who agreed to participate in the study, were enrolled
      in midwifery, and took the course explaining vaginal delivery for the first time and 60
      randomly selected students who received this education using simulation-based training.

      The simulation training included the activities that midwives should do during the birth and
      management of vaginal delivery. Bone pelvis, fetal head, fetus, cervical
      dilatation-effacement, fetal descensus, maternal-neonatal birthing simulators and chicken
      breast model for episiotomy were used by the researchers to monitor, manage, and provide care
      for the progress of labor. The students in the control group received theoretical training
      about management and care of vaginal delivery. In addition, the researchers demonstrated them
      how to monitor and manage the delivery process and provide care.

      Data collection tools included a personal information form, medical malpractice tendency
      scale in nursing, and caring assessment questionnaire.

      Statistical analyses were made using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS)
      Statistics 22 software. The findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics (average,
      standard deviation, frequency, and percentage). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to
      determine normal distribution of the data.
