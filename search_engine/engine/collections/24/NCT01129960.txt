    
      Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus.
      It currently affects about 1% of the population but its prevalence is expected to increase in
      coming years (European Medicines Agency 2007) in step with the increase in diabetes mellitus
      prevalence, which is expected to affect 220 million people by 2010

      The clinical development of ESL to treat neuropathic pain is based on its chemical and
      pharmacodynamic relationship to sodium channel blockers, including carbamazepine, which is
      effective for treating some neuropathic pain conditions. Preclinical data supports the
      theoretical background.

      This study will examine the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      Eslicarbazepine acetate for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain.
