      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of gefitinib as first-line therapy, in terms of response rate
           (complete and partial response) or stability of disease, in patients with de novo or
           recurrent stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine combined with cisplatin when administered after
           first-line gefitinib in these patients.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Within 3 weeks after documented disease progression, patients receive gemcitabine
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weeks 3, 6, 12, 18, and then every 12 weeks
      thereafter during gefitinib treatment. During chemotherapy, quality of life is assessed 1
      week prior to starting chemotherapy treatment, day 1 of courses 3 and 5, and then every 12
      weeks until disease progression.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 'A total of 24-63 patients will be accrued for this study.
