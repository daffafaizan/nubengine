    
      Clinical Study Objectives:

      Primary clinical study objective

      Cohort A:

      1.- To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of
      selinexor in combination with imatinib among unresectable and/or metastatic GIST patients
      with prior failure to at least imatinib for advanced/metastatic disease.

      Cohort B:

      1. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR: CR+PR+SD ≥ 16 wks)

      Secondary clinical study objectives (both cohorts A and B)

        1. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR: CR+PR+ SD ≥ 16 wks)

        2. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS)

        3. To evaluate overall survival (OS)

        4. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR)

        5. To evaluate the safety profile according to CTCAE 4.03

        6. To compare PFS on selinexor and imatinib and on selinexor in monotherapy with PFS on
           last prior anti-cancer therapy.

      Translational Study Objective - To explore the relationship between GIST genotype and CBR
      with selinexor and imatinib, and selinexor as single-agent

      Pharmacokinetics Study Objective

      - To measure the plasma concentration of imatinib and selinexor at limited timepoints
      specificed in schedule of assessment.
