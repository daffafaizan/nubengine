      are widely used for headache treatment in North American emergency departments.
      Metoclopramide, FDA pregnancy category B, is used in clinical practice for acute headache in
      pregnant women. Small studies have found magnesium sulfate to be effective in migraine,
      tension and cluster headaches, although there is no data regarding efficacy or tolerability
      in pregnant women.

      Our study would be similar to a Turkish study published in 2004 which compared magnesium
      sulfate to metoclopramide for acute headache treatment in nonpregnant individuals; they found
      the drugs equally effective 30 minutes after administration. Serum magnesium levels in
      pregnant women are often lower than in nonpregnant women; magnesium deficiency has been
      explored as contributing to headache frequency and severity. Magnesium sulfate use has been
      well established during pregnancy for decades, administered intravenously to delay labor or
      to women with preeclampsia for 24 to 48 hours, initially with 4 to 6 gram bolus then 2 grams
      per hour. For headache treatment, magnesium sulfate dose would be far lower, 2 grams. We
      would like to determine the efficacy and tolerability of magnesium sulfate for headache
      relief in pregnant women, as well as evaluate efficacy of metoclopramide in pregnant women.
      We do not find published randomized trials evaluating headache treatment in pregnant women.
