      disorders (ASD) is to examine the acute (12 week) and long-term (1 year) effects of
      aripiprazole on problem behaviors associated with ASD and development in three behavioral
      domains which appear particularly affected by ASD. We are also examining the safety and
      tolerability of aripiprazole in a range of children with autism. 20 children will be enrolled
      in the treatment part of the study. An additional 10 children, self selected by guardian
      desire not to pursue pharmacological treatment, will serve as a nonrandomized control group.
      This group will be provided with support but not any other treatments, come in for fewer
      visits and will be asked not to seek pharmacologic treatment outside the study. As of January
      2010, we have completed enrollment in the treatment arm. Currently, we are only looking to
      enroll individuals in the control arm in which participants would not take any psychiatric
      medication.
