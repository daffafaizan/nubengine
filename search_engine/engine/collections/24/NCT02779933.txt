      of early/late onset HAP. Another outcome was assessed to evaluate the relation of risk
      factors early/late onset HAP and mortality. The crucial time for evaluating the presence of
      risk factors was their presence from hospital admission to the moment of fulfilling the
      criteria for pneumonia. Risk factors were divided into two groups, on factors of the patient
      (uncontrollable) and by the hospitalization (controllable). Factors of the patient were:
      gender (male/female), age at enrollment (years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
      Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, multi-organ failure presence (MOF), hypertension, ischemic
      heart disease (IHD) chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), continual use of renal replacement
      therapy (CRRT), acute renal insufficiency (ARI), diabetes mellitus (DM), Chronical
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), immunosuppression or leukopenia <1.5x109/l, impaired
      consciousness with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) <8 tracheotomy, head trauma/neurosurgery,
      abdominal surgery-thoracotomy. Side factors hospitalization were: aspiration into the lungs,
      urgent intubation, reintubated, sedation, bronchoscopy, nasogastric intubation, enteral
      feeding continuously/intermittently intolerance of enteral nutrition, physiotherapy, repeated
      transport of the patient from the ICU, length of hospital stay, length of mechanical
      ventilation, 30-day mortality.
