      developed countries throughout the world.The beneficial therapeutic effect of Photodynamic
      Therapy (PDT)in the treatment of AMD is modest. The treatment benefit of PDT may be moderated
      by PDT-induced, non-selective effects in the choroidal circulation (resulting in
      hypoxia-induced stimulation of angiogenesis through increased vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF)production), direct injury to the retinal pigment epithelium, and subretinal
      fluid/hemorrhage or post-treatment inflammation secondary to PDT. There is potential that
      supplemental Avastin (through VEGF inhibition) or intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide (ITA)
      treatments (through non-specific membrane stabilizing, anti-neovascular, and
      anti-inflammatory activities) could minimize the effect of these processes, enhancing the
      efficacy of PDT. Presently, PDT, the current gold standard,in combination with Avastin and/or
      Kenalog is being more widely used in exactly this fashion and may become the standard of care
      without the necessary randomized clinical trial. However, the treatment benefit of these
      interventions is uncertain as is their safety profile.

      This randomized, controlled trial addresses the potential supplemental therapeutic effect of
      intravitreal injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide and/or Avastin in conjunction with
      photodynamic therapy for the treatment of sub-foveal CNVM secondary to AMD.
