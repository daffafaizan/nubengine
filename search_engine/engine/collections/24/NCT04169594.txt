      Statistical Parametric Mapping in patients with unilateral hemiplegic stroke and unilateral
      lower limb amputation. Data collected will then be compared against a normative dataset.

      The findings from this study will then be used to build a decision support tool in
      combination with clinical analysis which could focus clinical recommendations for gait
      training, physical therapy, exercise and orthotics prescription to reduce unnecessary joint
      forces in affected and unaffected segments.
