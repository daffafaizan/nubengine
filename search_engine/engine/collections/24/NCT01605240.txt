      no difference between ibuprofen and codeine in terms of pain relief or side effects.

      Following ethics approval (submitted and approved) by the University of Manitoba ethics board
      a study group of fifty patients (25 in each arm) will be recruited to participate in the
      study.All patients will complete informed consent following both a verbal and written
      explanation of the study. Following the closed reduction they will all receive regular
      acetaminophen; (dose 15mg/kg) and either ibuprofen (10mg/kg) or codeine (1mg/kg) depending
      upon the group they were randomised to. This will have to be single blinding as the codeine
      formulation used by the hospital is a clear red liquid (5mg/ml) and the ibuprofen a cloudy
      colourless liquid (20mg/ml). They will also be given a "rescue" medication to be taken if the
      caregivers feel that the pain relief is not sufficient 1 hour after the study medication.
      This rescue medication will be the alternative medication in the study.
