    
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing public health problem owing to its prevalence as well as
      its high morbidity and mortality rates. The identification of high-risk populations is of
      great importance particularly because the onset of T2D can be prevented or delayed by
      lifestyle modifications. Among high-risk populations, women with previously diagnosed
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at particularly high risk of developing T2D. The
      success in reducing the occurrence of T2D among women with previous GDM could be achieved
      only if appropriate preventive measures are undertaken. According to the American Diabetes
      Association (ADA) and the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA), lifestyle modifications aimed
      at reducing body weight and increasing physical activity are recommended and women are
      encouraged to be breastfeeding their infants. Certain factors have been suggested as
      determinants of behavioral practices in women with prior GDM including cognitive and
      environmental factors. A better understanding of these issues is essential for developing
      effective preventive strategies and possibly reducing the prevalence of T2D in the
      population. Moreover, in utero exposure to maternal impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes
      may increase the risk of developing overweight or diabetes in offspring. Since March 2012 we
      thus test the presence of childhood metabolic alterations predictive of future T2D in
      GDM-exposed and unexposed offspring and investigate environmental factors during the
      postnatal period that are associated with prevention of metabolic alterations.
