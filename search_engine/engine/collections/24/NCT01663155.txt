      treatment. Our goal is to determine if chest x-rays,computer aided detection (CAD)and a CT
      scan can detect disease earlier when treatment is more effective. If we improve the detection
      of disease, we will see if screening reduces the incidence of symptomatic advanced lung
      cancer relative to no screening in people at high risk to develop lung cancer.
