      been hypothesized that these latter could be related to dopaminergic depletion within the
      fronto-striatal network. However, the nature of this relationship is not clearly understood.
      In this study we aim to assess the role of daily dopaminergic stimulation on the retrieval
      processes needed to perform different cognitive tasks. A group of PD patients will be
      administered declarative memory task both "on" (standard medication intake) and "off" (12/18
      hours after the last medication intake). A group of comparable normal controls will also
      present with the same cognitive task twice, without any drug assumption. Understanding the
      effect of dopamine treatment on declarative memory processes will allow standard medication
      treatment to be adjusted in order to take into account both motor and cognitive features of
      Parkinson's disease.
