      failing 1st-line treatment with immunochemotherapy containing rituximab and anthracycline,
      who are not eligible for either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, defined
      as age > 65 years, or > 60 years old with HCT-CI score >2. This trial evaluates the CMR rate
      12 weeks after tisagenlecleucel (CTL019) infusion, the incidence and severity of adverse
      events, progression-free survival, and overall survival after one and two years after
      tisagenlecleucel (CTL019).
