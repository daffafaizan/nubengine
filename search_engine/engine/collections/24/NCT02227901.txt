      I. Establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for tipifarnib (R115777) in combination with
      temozolomide with radiation in patients not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs).

      II. To define the safety of R115777 in combination with temozolomide with radiation in this
      patient population.

      III. To assess for evidence of antitumor activity in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

      TIPIFARNIB: Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY DURING RADIATION THERAPY: Within 5-9 days after starting tipifarnib,
      patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) daily and receive temozolomide PO
      daily for 6 weeks.

      POST-RADIATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning at week 10 post-radiation therapy, patients receive
      temozolomide PO on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 1 year or 12 complete
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months.
