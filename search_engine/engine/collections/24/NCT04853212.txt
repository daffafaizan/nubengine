        -  to research the abundance of bacterial strain of R. gnavus in mucosal sampling by
           biopsy;

        -  to study the interaction between R. gnavus bacterium and mucus from histological
           sampling;

        -  to correlate the expression of genes of intestinal mucus with the variations of
           identified microbiota of mucus biopsy;

        -  to study the interaction between bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells during
           culture;

        -  to demonstrate perturbations of the immune responses by dysbiosis.
