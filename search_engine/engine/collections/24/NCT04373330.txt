      disability and reduced quality of life. Veterans with migraine are more likely than those
      without headache to experience medically related discharge/retirement, post-traumatic stress
      disorder, sleep disturbances, and difficulty reintegrating back into civilian life.

      Despite advances in our understanding of migraine, it remains poorly understood and often
      proves refractory to validated drug and non-drug interventions. Therefore, there is
      tremendous potential value in pursuing alternate intervention pathways for migraine
      management. Although empirical support remains limited, engagement in regular exercise
      routinely is recommended for managing and preventing migraine.

      This innovative approach, if successful, could be disseminated rapidly to the VAMC in the
      United States, thereby making a substantial impact on the public health burden of migraine
      and other lifestyle related chronic diseases amongst our nation's Veterans. Consistent with
      the VA's Whole Health Initiative, this HELP-VM approach facilitates and supports Veterans'
      capacity to take charge of their own health and well-being, and recognizes the many health
      benefits of reducing sedentary activity for migraine and beyond.
