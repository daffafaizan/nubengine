      established in order to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Our goal is to determine
      if statin therapy plus intravenous normal saline, in patients with chronic renal
      insufficiency undergoing angiography, is superior to placebo plus intravenous normal saline
      therapy in the prevention of CIN.
