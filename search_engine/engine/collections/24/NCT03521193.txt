      registered in this trial. Subjects who experienced transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke
      with a clinical indication to PFO closure and symptomatic for migraine with/o aura are
      considered for a migraine score analysis at baseline before PFO closure and during the
      subsequent follow-up (FU) at 6 and 12-months, together with lab evaluation for platelet
      reactivity tests (P selectin, Thromboxane B2), Prostaglandin E1 and 2 (PGE1, PGE2),
      serotonin, cytokines and prostaglandin PGE1 urinary metabolite run under aspirin therapy.

      The research questions are as follows:

      Does the presence of a large PFO have any impact on migraine with aura?

      Do migraineurs with aura and PFO have higher biomarkers of platelet activation than control
      patients? and are they at higher risk of stroke and TIA recurrences based on high on
      clopidogrel platelet reactivity?

      What is the effect of PFO severity on monthly migraine frequency and aura frequency?

      What is the result of PFO closure in migraineur patients with PFO? Do Migraine with aura
      patients with large PFO have higher platelet activation and better migraine resolution after
      PFO closure?
