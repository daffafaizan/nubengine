      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is one of the best indicators of quality care in
      patients with STEMI. Hospitals with more strategies to improve this quality of care have a
      shorter door-to-balloon time. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness, in the time between
      the arrival in the ER and the balloon time, of an educational and organizational intervention
      for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction for emergency nurses.

      The aim of this study is to improve the time between arrival to ER and balloon time.

      The study consists of two phases:

      Phase I (PRE): in this phase, the aim is to describe the attendance times and to evaluate the
      causes of delay in attendance in STEMI patients. With the findings, a plan will be drawn up
      that includes the integration of an educational program for emergency nurses and
      organizational measures; oriented to improve the early diagnosis and delays in STEMI.

      Phase II (POST): in this phase, the aim is to evaluate the effectiveness in improving delays
      in the care of patients with STEMI after the implementation of the educational and
      organizational intervention developed in phase 1. On the other hand, will evaluate the
      satisfaction of the emergency nurses with the training they received through educational and
      organizational intervention.
