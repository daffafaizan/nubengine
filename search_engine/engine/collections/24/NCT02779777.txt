    
      This phase 2 study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in
      approximately 36 eligible subjects with MDS who have no known curative treatment. Eligible
      subjects may have received no more than 2 prior systemic regimens. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive tipifarnib orally with food according to one of 2 dose regimens. In the
      absence of unmanageable toxicities, subjects may continue to receive tipifarnib treatment
      until disease progression.

      Disease assessments will be performed at screening and at least once every approximately 12
      weeks starting at the end of cycle 3. Determination of ORR will be assessed by the
      Investigator according to the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson 2006).
      Upon disease progression, all subjects in the study will be followed approximately every 12
      weeks for survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months after
      accrual of the study has been completed, whichever occurs first.
