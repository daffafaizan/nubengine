      nerve stimulation (PTNS) treatment compared to an inactive sham intervention in female
      subjects with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in an intent-to-treat
      analysis. The primary outcome measure will be the Patient Global Impression of Improvement
      (PGI-I) a single item questionnaire assessing overall impression of improvement over time at
      the initial 12 weeks endpoint.

      It is hypothesized that subjects randomized to the PTNS arm will demonstrate a greater
      improvement in both pain and quality of life scores, when compared with subjects who are
      randomized to the sham arm.
