      practitioner acceptability in a pilot study of a new-to-market spherical silicone hydrogel
      olifilcon B with Tangible Coating daily disposable soft contact lens (SiHyDD) to three (3)
      benchmark soft daily disposable lenses (DD) and, subsequently, of a new-to-market hydrogel
      etafilcon A with Tangible Coating spherical daily disposable (HydDD) soft contact lens to
      three (3) other hydrogel daily disposable lenses. .

      The primary outcome variables for this study are subjective comfort and lens preference.
