      combining a BCI system (subproject 1) and a 3D electro-cap (subproject 3). Then, this system
      and an eye-controlled device (subject 2) are further integrated to a smart communication
      system. The outputs of the system are presented with the original voice the ALS patients,
      which will be achieved by using the voice reconstruction technology (subproject 4) in this
      project. All the user-interfaces of the BCI and eye tracking systems will be re-deigned by
      employing human factors engineering to increase the usability of the proposed smart
      communication system for ALS. Finally, the validity of the system in improving the life
      quality of ALS will be assessed through clinical study.
