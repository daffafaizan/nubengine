      Two-hundred-forty children, 6 to 17 years of age, were recruited to participate in the study.
      Following the collection of baseline data, all families in the study received standard
      environmental control education prior to randomization to the control or experimental group.
      This education provided parents and children with information about such topics as the
      child's sensitivity profile, the relationship between exposure to allergens and asthma, and
      the risks of passive smoking. All families were given information on how to receive
      environmental control aids and services available by mail at no or reduced costs.

      Once families were randomized, those in the control group received no additional
      intervention. Those in the experimental group received a home-based allergen control
      intervention delivered by trained environmental counselors. Primary outcomes were changes in
      asthma-related quality of life and changes in targeted allergen levels in the home. Secondary
      outcome measures included self-efficacy for environmental allergy control, FEV1, and
      parent-reported health care utilization.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
