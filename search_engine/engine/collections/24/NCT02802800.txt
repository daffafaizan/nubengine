      research however regarding its use among hockey players and even less research exploring
      water based training. International field hockey competitions are played on wet turf and it
      is felt that water training may be beneficial to these players. The study will explore
      whether water based plyometrics will prove to have additional benefits compared to land based
      plyometrics for the Jamaican hockey athletes. The members of the Jamaica hockey clubs will be
      recruited to participate in this study. Recruitment will be done by the principal
      investigator Dr. Roopchand-Martin. A total of 34 persons will be recruited and they will be
      randomly allocated to aquatic or land based training. All training programmes will be
      conducted at the section of physical therapy and training will be done two times per week for
      6 weeks. Baseline assessments will be done independent evaluators for lower limb power using
      the Standing Broad Jump and Vertical Jump Test, anaerobic power using the Running Anaerobic
      Sprint test, agility using the Illinois agility and T tests, flexibility using the Sit and
      Reach Test and performance during game play on wet artificial turf in relation to time-motion
      analysis for total distance covered, and total time, average and maximum pace, average and
      maximum heart rate, time in heart zones 1-5, and changes in rate of perceived exertion.
