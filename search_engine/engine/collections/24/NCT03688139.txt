      effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions
      such as Engage - a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for
      late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of neural reward systems. This
      study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other reward system measures to assess
      target engagement in depressed older adults receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group
      of depressed peers receiving supportive therapy. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either Engage or supportive therapy and will complete research assessments at baseline and
      weeks 3, 6, and 9 (end of treatment).
