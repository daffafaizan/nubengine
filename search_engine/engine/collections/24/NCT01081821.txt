      looks like the drug being studied but has no active ingredients) in healthy volunteers. This
      study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by
      chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned
      drug) study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of
      JNJ-39758979 and placebo in 36 healthy Japanese male volunteers. Part 2 is a randomized,
      double-blind study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple
      doses of JNJ-39758979 and placebo in 24 healthy Japanese males and 24 healthy Caucasian
      males. For Part 1, the participation period is a maximum of 56 days, including a screening
      visit, a 7-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For Part 2, the participation
      period is a maximum of 202 days, including a screening visit, a 17-day in-clinic period and
      two follow-up visits. For both parts of the study, safety evaluations, which will include ECG
      (a cardiac function test), vital signs and monitoring of side-effects will be performed.
      Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected for evaluation. Part 1: volunteers
      will receive a single oral (by mouth) dose of JNJ-39758979 (50, 100, 300, or 600mg) or
      placebo; Part 2: volunteers will receive an oral dose of JNJ-39758979 (300 mg) or placebo
      once a day for 14 days.
