    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To determine the 6-month progression free survival (PFS6) rate when patients with advanced
      fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) are treated with daily oral ENMD 2076

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the overall response rate using RECIST v 1.1 criteria when patients with FLC
           are treated with daily oral ENMD 2076.

        -  To evaluate the median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to Progression (TTP), and
           Overall Survival (OS).

        -  To determine the safety of ENMD-2076 as defined by the frequency and severity of adverse
           events when patients with FLC are treated with daily oral ENMD-2076
