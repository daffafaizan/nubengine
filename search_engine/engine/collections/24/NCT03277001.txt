      a long way to go for high-risk VTE patients in China.The incidence of AECOPD complicated with
      VTE in Asian population is high and the mortality rate is high.Rivaroxaban, a new oral
      anticoagulant, has been widely used in the treatment and prevention of VTE.However the
      question about the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant compared with LMWHs for the
      prevention of symptomatic VTE and VTE-related death post-hospital discharge in high-risk
      AECOPD patients is still unknown. Thus this study is to evaluate if the prophylactic
      anticoagulation effect by Rivaroxaban is non-inferiority than Enoxaprine in high risk AECOPD
      and to evaluate the safety of using Rivaroxaban to prevent VTE in high risk AECOPD comparing
      with Enoxaprine.
