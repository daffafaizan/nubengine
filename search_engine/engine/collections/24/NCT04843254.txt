      commonly utilized patient-centred and self-reported measure of outcomes in the stroke
      population. The SS-QoL scale is a health-related outcome measure that comprises 49 items in
      12 areas of vision, mobility, thinking, social roles, self-care, language, personality,
      family roles, work/productivity, upper limb function, mood and energy. It covers a more
      extensive inclusion of capacities ordinarily influenced by stroke.

      The Stroke Specific Quality of Life questionnaire, originally developed in English, has been
      translated into many languages to assess for its validity and reliability ever since, but not
      any of the Pakistani native versions are made or tested. Previous studies have shown that the
      translation of the scale would end up giving a standard measure to be utilized in clinical
      practices and research studies while sanctioning clinicians and specialists to share
      information and have an insight into patient's health-related concerns post-stroke. Thus, it
      is imperative to translate this questionnaire into psychometrically sound versions of
      indigenous Pakistani languages such as Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi and Pashto. This may
      promote an easy understanding of the local population in Pakistan where the languages are
      spoken and will provide a valid measure of stroke-specific health outcomes to be clinically
      utilized by practitioners and researchers across the country.
