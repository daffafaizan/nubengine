      challenges that were not foreseen. The strength of this movement is based on the
      understanding of (1) the complexity with which people face their nutritional challenges; and
      (2) the interconnection between food systems and overlapping health risks associated with
      malnutrition, obesity, and climate change.

      Maintaining an adequate weight, a healthy and sustainable diet pattern are complex
      well-established challenges. However, current nutritional approaches to lose weight, based on
      functional experiences, often fail to promote long-term adherence to dietary recommendations
      and maintaining lost weight.

      The ambiguity and complexity that involves an interactional nutrition, based on the
      experiences involved in how people act at the individual level and their relationships with
      the environment and dynamic systems, brings up the challenge of designing meaningful learning
      experiences to promote a change of culture and positive impact.

      Current social changes demand the search for novel nutritional approaches based on
      methodologies that result in meaningful experiences. We need new ways to build diets that
      balance the needs of individuals and society as a whole, new ideas that address global
      challenges, new strategies that result in differences that matter, and a sense of purpose
      that includes everyone involved.

      With that in mind, Nutrition Thinking® arises as a nutritional approach based on the values
      and methodologies of Design Thinking, an abstraction of a mental model for addressing complex
      problems and conducting projects based on empathy, collaboration, and experimentation.
      Therefore, Nutrition Thinking® represents a new nutrition learning matrix based on experience
      for the co-creation of authentic and sustainable diets.
