      more in the context of liver transplantation given the necessary immunosuppression, high
      surgical time, high hospital stay and intensive care, politransfusions, etc. Negative
      pressure therapy is well established for the treatment of open wounds, its use having been
      recently indicated on closed surgical wounds. The evidence to justify this intervention is
      still limited.

      The objective of our clinical trial is to evaluate whether the prophylactic use of a negative
      pressure therapy device (PICOⓇ) on the closed wound of the liver transplant, reduces the
      postoperative complications of surgical wounds, compared to the use of dressings conventional
      postoperative After signing the informed consent of those patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria, they will be randomized into two groups to install the PICOⓇ device or conventional
      dressings on the wound. After 7 days, the PICOⓇ device will be removed and both preoperative
      and postoperative variables will be studied in terms of incidence of surgical site events,
      stay, etc.
