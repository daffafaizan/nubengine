      Treatment group will receive a 5-minute mindful movement video-based intervention before
      their previously scheduled pelvic exam. Control group will not receive the mindful movement
      video-based intervention and will instead be given a handout about the benefits of
      mindfulness to read prior to the pelvic exam. Control group will be given access to the
      mindfulness intervention via an online link upon completion of participation in the study to
      ensure they are provided the opportunity to benefit from mindfulness practice.

      Participants will be recruited from a group of female patients at the Lowe Foundation Center
      who have already been scheduled for an upcoming pelvic exam. Therefore the pelvic exam
      procedure itself is standard of care, the experimental piece is the mindfulness intervention
      before the pelvic exam - either the video, or the written educational materials depending on
      whether participants are randomly assigned to the treatment or control group.
