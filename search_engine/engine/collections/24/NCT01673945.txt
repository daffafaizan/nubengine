      potentially expanding the therapeutic applications of EUS. This prototype is a modification
      of the CLA scope and it is characterized primarily by a shifting of the orientation of the
      endoscopic and US views from oblique to forward. The US transducer is located adjacent to the
      working channel, at the endoscope tip, to display a forward-viewing image along to a scanning
      plane that is parallel to the insertion direction with a 90Â° scanning range. It has a 3.7 mm
      working channel without elevator, which allows exit of the FNA needle or any other accessory
      used parallel to the longitudinal axis of the scope.

      Preliminary experiences with this scope have reported potential advantages over the
      conventional linear scope (CLA-EUS) for pseudocysts drainage and for hilar biliary
      strictures. Moreover, a large experience still unpublished from the Catholic University,
      Rome, Italy in the use of the FV-EUS for FNA of solid and cystic lesions throughout the GI
      tract has shown the FV-EUS to be highly effective with a performance that seems at least
      comparable to that of the CLA-EUS. To date, however, no data comparing the performance of
      both scopes for FNA of target lesions are available to better clarify the advantages and
      disadvantages of one scope over the other.

      We designed a randomized comparative trial in which patients will be randomized to undergo
      examination with CLA-EUS or with FV-EUS. In case of failure of: (i) visualization of the
      presumed lesion; (ii) failure in performing the FNA with the scope used based on
      randomization, a second attempt will be made using the other scope.
