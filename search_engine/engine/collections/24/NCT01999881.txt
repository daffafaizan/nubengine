      I. Determine the effect of an eight-week exercise intervention on biomarkers of inflammation,
      oxidative stress, exercise capacity, and quality of life in lung cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of an eight-week exercise intervention on markers of stress and
      quality of life in the support person of lung cancer patients.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients and their support persons undergo a supervised combined aerobic exercise
      comprising walking, cycling, or video-based aerobics and strength training using resistance
      bands for 40 minutes 2 days a week at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinic (UWHC)
      and 3 days a week at home over 8 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients and their support persons undergo the usual care over 8 weeks.
