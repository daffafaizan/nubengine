      adenocarcinoma cannot be anticipated before pathological assessment of rectal specimen. The
      purpose of this prospective monocentric study is to look for early seric biomarkers
      predictive of tumor response (good and bad responders) in patients treated by preoperative
      radiochemotherapy (45 Gy) for rectal adenocarcinoma using a proteomic approach. All patients
      with locally-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma will be enrolled. Sequential samples of sera will
      be collected before, during preoperative treatment and before surgery, and analysed using a
      MALDI-TOF-TOF method. Proteomic analysis will be correlated to pathological response in order
      to identify potential early biomarkers of tumor response.
