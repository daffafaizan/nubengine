      and lungs that develops against harmful particles or gases with exacerbations. COPD
      exacerbations are characterized by worsening of dyspnea, coughing and expectoration.
      Exacerbations requiring hospitalization are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in
      COPD. Bronchiectasis is the irreversible extension of the bronchi. Usually follows with
      chronic sputum cough, airway obstruction and recurrent infection episodes. The association of
      bronchiectasis and COPD has long been known and its incidence is in the range of 30-50%.
      Coexistence of bronchiectasis with COPD may lead to worsening of the functional parameters as
      well as alteration of the microbiological pattern in exacerbations and may negatively affect
      the exacerbation result parameters.
