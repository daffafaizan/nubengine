      which can lead to significant pain and functional limitations. The prevalence of this
      condition is growing as the population continues to age. Substantial controversy exists
      regarding the management of lumbar spinal stenosis. Surgery has traditionally been the
      treatment of choice, although physicians typically recommend a trial of nonsurgical care
      prior to surgery. The most effective means of nonsurgical treatment has not been identified,
      although a "standard" regimen has been developed.

      There is presently no evidence in the literature regarding the relative effectiveness of
      surgical versus nonsurgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, or the efficacy of the
      standard nonsurgical treatment approach. This randomized clinical trial will compare surgical
      decompression versus nonsurgical treatment (i.e., physical therapy) of lumbar spinal
      stenosis. The results of this study should help clarify which treatment strategies are the
      most effective for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
