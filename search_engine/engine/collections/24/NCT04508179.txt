    
      This first-in-human (FIH) study consists of a placebo-controlled, sequential, dose escalation
      study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 7HP349 following
      single and multiple oral dose administration to healthy male subjects, with a separate,
      open-label food effect cohort at the optimal pharmacokinetic dose (OPD). The study will be
      carried out in 3 parts.

      Part A: This is a placebo-controlled, within-cohort randomized, double-blind, sequential,
      single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability and PK of
      7HP349 following administration of single oral doses in healthy male subjects, and to define
      the OPD of 7HP349.

      Part B: This is a placebo-controlled, within-cohort randomized, double-blind, sequential,
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability and PK
      of 7HP349 following up to 5 once daily oral doses in healthy male subjects.

      Part C: This is a randomized, open label, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study to
      evaluate the effect of the fed or fasting prandial state on the single dose PK of 7HP349.
