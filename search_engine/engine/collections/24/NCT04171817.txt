      treatment in holistic patient care and reduce patient stress, pain and anxiety. However, the
      risk of transmission of pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a
      challenge to the sustainability of hospital-based Animal-Assisted visitation programs. Pilot
      data suggest that a low-cost chlorhexidine-based intervention targeted to the dogs involved
      in the visitation programs holds high potential to prevent pathogen transmission during
      sessions. Therefore, child participants will be enrolled who interact with 40 dogs over
      twelve sessions (four observational, eight where the dog is randomized to intervention or
      control) at two enrollment centers. The following aims will be tested: 1) To identify
      program-related risk factors for acquisition of hospital-associated pathogens by pediatric
      patients during animal-assisted intervention (AAI) sessions during an initial run-in phase of
      no intervention; 2) To determine the effect of chlorhexidine (CHX)-based interventions on
      acquisition of hospital-associated pathogens and microbial communities by patients during AAI
      sessions via a multicenter randomized controlled trial; and 3) To determine whether the
      specific benefits achieved by the visitation program, i.e. reduction in blood pressure, heart
      rate and self-reported pain and anxiety, are impacted by the interventions. If findings
      support the hypothesis that chlorhexidine interventions are effective to prevent pathogen
      transmission through a multicenter, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial and does not
      reduce Animal-Assisted visitation program benefits to the children or impact the welfare of
      the therapy dogs, then this will provide strong evidence on which to base recommendations for
      infection control guidelines for programs nationally.
