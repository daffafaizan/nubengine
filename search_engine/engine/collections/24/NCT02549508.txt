      pressure during wakefulness may improve therapy comfort and potentially adherence without
      compromising therapy efficacy. SensAwake™ is a unique pressure relief technology developed by
      Fisher & Paykel Healthcare which detects irregularity in the flow signal indicative of the
      transition from sleep to wake. When the transition from sleep to wake is detected the device
      promptly reduces the pressure to help facilitate a return to sleep.

      It is hypothesised that AutoCPAP with SensAwake will improve patient comfort and compliance
      in the PTSD and OSA patients who are naïve to CPAP therapy.

      The investigators will not be blinded to the study. The participants will be blinded to the
      study.
