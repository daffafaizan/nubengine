      corticosteroids with placebo for brain radionecrosis following radiosurgery for brain
      metastases. This is a two-arm clinical trial with parallel group design for longitudinal
      quality of life endpoint. Patients will be stratified according to age (â‰¤ 65 years vs. > 65
      years), pathological confirmation of necrosis (yes vs. no), MDASI-BT mean global score
      (symptom + interference scores) ( < 4.0 vs. > 4.0) and prior whole brain radiotherapy (yes
      vs. no). The primary and secondary objectives are detailed below.

      Primary Objective:

      To investigate whether the addition of bevacizumab to standard corticosteroid therapy results
      in greater improvement in symptoms (clinical and patient-reported symptom improvement
      associated with radionecrosis and less radionecrosis treatment-induced symptoms) compared
      with standard corticosteroid therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with bevacizumab and corticosteroid therapy.

        2. To compare self-reported health related quality of life (HRQOL) using LASA,
           Dexamethasone Symptoms Questionnaire-Chronic (DSQ-C), and MDASI-BT symptom and
           interference score between treatment arms.

        3. To compare intracranial progression-free survival and time to maximum radiographic
           response between treatment arms.

        4. To compare the dose and duration of corticosteroids required between treatment arms and
           correlate steroid requirement with DSQ-C and MDASI-BT scores.

      Patient event monitoring will occur every 2 months after treatment up to 6 months. Then event
      monitoring will occur up to one year.
