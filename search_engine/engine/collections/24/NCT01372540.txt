      I. To determine the safety and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of filanesib (ARRY-520) when
      combined with carfilzomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of ARRY-520 when combined with
      carfilzomib.

      II. To explore potential markers for patient selection and obtain a preliminary assessment of
      the biological activity of ARRY-520 when combined with carfilzomib.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive filanesib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 and
      carfilzomib IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 courses of
      therapy, patients may continue with dosing of carfilzomib on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 and
      filanesib as tolerated. If patient progresses on carfilzomib maintenance with administration
      on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 they may increase the intensity and add in days 8 and 9 dosing.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then
      periodically thereafter.
