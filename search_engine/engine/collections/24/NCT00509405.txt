      K citrate on bone mineral density, microarchitectural composition of bone,nutritional
      parameters, lean body mass, parameters of skeletal muscle mass and strength, 24h and exercise
      induced blood pressure changes in otherwise healthy, elderly ambulatory subjects of both
      genders.

      Potassium citrate (60 mEq) is supplied as tablets with a wax matrix (10 mEq of citrate per
      tablet) and ingested in three doses/day. All subjects will receive daily oral 500 mg of
      calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D to ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D supply.
