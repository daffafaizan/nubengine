      intratumoral Natural Killer (NK)-cell infiltration in tumor biopsies taken before and after
      an exercise intervention in patients randomized 2:1 to one of two study arms: I) High
      Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) (N=20) or II) usual care, prior to radical prostatectomy.

      In addition to this the investigators wish to investigate the effect of HIIT exercise on the
      infiltration of other immune cells into the tumor, tumor vessel morphology, modulation of
      tumor-metabolism, -biology and signaling.

      Finally the aim is to explore the effect of pre-operative HIIT exercise on physiological
      (e.g. cardiovascular fitness, body composition, metabolic profile and metabolic inflammatory
      markers) and psycho-social (e.g. fatigue, emotional well-being, anxiety) endpoints relative
      to usual care.
