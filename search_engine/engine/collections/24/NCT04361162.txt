    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial study testing the safety and effectiveness
      of the combination of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and radiation therapy.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will be in this research study for as long as the study interventions are safe
      and beneficial. Participants will then be followed for up to 5 years.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Ipilimumab

        -  Nivolumab

        -  Radiation Therapy It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research
           study.

      Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are both antibodies. An antibody is a protein that attaches to other
      cells to fight off infection. The antibodies in ipilimumab work by not allowing cancer cell
      growth. The antibodies in nivolumab work by causing programmed cell death of the cancer
      cells. Radiation therapy may increase the likelihood of response to interventions like
      ipilimumab and nivolumab.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipilimumab and nivolumab for
      microsatellite stable pancreatic cancer. but they have been approved for other uses.
