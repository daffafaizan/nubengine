      its prognosis and treatment mainly depend on the discovery of the primary disease and the
      early stage of metastasis, while traditional imaging and histological methods are difficult
      to meet the clinical requirements for the early diagnosis and accurate staging of
      PCa.Positron emission tomography (PET) has the characteristics of precision and non-invasive,
      so the development of PCa targeted molecular probe is of great significance for improving the
      specificity and accuracy of PCa diagnosis.

      PSMA is a highly specific prostatic epithelial membrane antigen, which is highly expressed in
      solid tumors such as Prostate cancer. More than 90% of Prostate cancer cells express PSMA, so
      PSMA can be used as an important imaging target for Prostate cancer.

      The radionuclides used for PET imaging include 18F (T 1/2 =109.8min), which has a suitable
      half-life and cyclotron preparation to enable the high yield synthesis of 18F labeled tracer,
      so it can be used in more patients and provided to other departments without on-site tracer
      production facilities.In addition, coordination labeling method is simple, easy to realize
      automatic synthesis technology and medicine box preparation.Therefore, 18F-labeled PSMA
      targeted molecular probe is a hot spot in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

      [Al18F]PSMA137 is a novel PSMA targeted tracer labeled with 18F. NOTA is used as a
      bifunctional chelating agent to facilitate better chelation with Al18F. It has a higher tumor
      uptake and a faster metabolism in normal organs with a lower background.[Al18F]PSMA137, as a
      novel targeted molecular probe, shows excellent properties in tumor cell uptake.This project
      provides research on [Al18F]PSMA137 PET/CT imaging for patients with suspected PCa, and
      provides basis for early diagnosis of PCa, formulation of treatment plan and efficacy
      evaluation.
