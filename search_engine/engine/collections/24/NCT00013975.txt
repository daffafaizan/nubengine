      causing endothelial injury. However, little is known about determinants of endothelial cell
      repair and regeneration. We propose that mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
      constitutes one mechanism for ongoing endothelial repair. EPCs are a bone marrow derived cell
      population that can be isolated from peripheral blood. Among human peripheral mononuclear
      cells, EPCs are relatively abundant with an estimated frequency of 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000
      cells. Evidence suggests that EPCs can participate in angiogenesis under pathophysiological
      circumstances. Under normal conditions, however, adult organisms undergo little if any active
      angiogenesis. One explanation for this set of observations is that high circulating levels of
      EPCs may exist to allow these cells to participate in functions beyond angiogenesis. We
      hypothesize that one such function is in the repair of ongoing endothelial injury. To test
      this hypothesis, we will measure peripheral blood EPC activity by ascertaining the number of
      EPC colony forming units from peripheral blood sampling. We intend to correlate this
      biological determinant with the degree of endothelial dysfunction assessed by flow-mediated
      brachial artery reactivity, and an atherosclerotic risk stratification method developed by
      the Framingham study. We hypothesize that a correlation will exist between the
      atherosclerotic risk profile, endothelial function and EPC activity and that the EPC activity
      will therefore become a novel surrogate biological marker for cumulative cardiovascular risk.
