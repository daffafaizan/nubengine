      Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), Transverse Myelitis (TM), optic neuritis (ON), related conditions
      and healthy controls. While patients will be treated according to decisions with their
      treating physician, this study will collect data and samples from patients prospectively to
      gain a better understanding of the disease. We are seeking to understand why some patients
      respond to medications, while others do not. We also seek to understand what happens
      biologically, preceding relapses. Gathering these data and samples will allow researchers to
      identify new ways of diagnosing and treating these diseases. Data and samples will be shared
      with researchers around the world to support collaborative efforts to treat these conditions.

      Patients will agree to share medical records, complete questionnaires and donate samples on a
      timed basis.
