      drug craving, suggesting that perindopril should be evaluated as a treatment for MA
      dependence. Candesartan works similarly to perindopril but should lack the U-shaped dose
      response. Like perindopril, candesartan is used for hypertension. Whereas perindopril reduces
      the synthesis of angiotensin II, candesartan blocks angiotensin II receptors.
