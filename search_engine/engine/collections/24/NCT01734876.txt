      parkinsonian patients when usin Tactile Touch. As the method consisted of a combination of
      Music Therapy and Aroma therapy we chose just to study the effects of the Tactile Touch.

      VAS 10 cm scale and the Pain-O.Meter. All measures were repeated during the study period.

      carefully registered and supervised by specialists in neurology at the three different study
