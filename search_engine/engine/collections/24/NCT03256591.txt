      and reduction in fresh stillbirths. HBB has successfully integrated some aspects of
      simulation into an educational curriculum that teach the management of neonatal emergencies
      in resource-constrained countries.

      High levels of physical, emotional and conceptual realism are important features of
      simulation-based learning that impact learning outcomes. Formal debriefing is characterized
      as the most important element of simulation based education. Structured feedback in a safe
      learning environment provides the opportunity for learning of clinically relevant material.
      Guided reflection transfers the responsibility for learning to the participants and
      solidifies knowledge, skills and behaviors for transfer to clinical practice.

      Simulation based training brings special advantages and may enhance HBB training. Critical
      elements of simulation such as enhanced realism and post-event debriefing may carry potential
      to strengthen HBB training to attain maximum impact. However, evidence for the effectiveness
      of this combined approach is limited.
