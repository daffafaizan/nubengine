      initial diagnosis of CRC subjects will be screened for frailty using validated
      questionnaires, physical tests and non-invasive measurements. Frailty characteristics and
      HRQL are determined by Geriatric 8 (G8), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS),
      Euroqol- 5 dimensional (EQ-5D), Lawton Instrumental Activity of Daily Living scale(IADL),
      Mini Nutrition Assessment (MNA), 6 Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT), Identification of
      Seniors At Risk - Hospitalized Patients(ISAR-HP) and the EORTC-QLQ-C30/CR29 (HRQL in CRC
      patients). Physical tests include the Timed to Get Up (TUG) test and the hand grip strength
      test. Furthermore, the non-invasive measurements consist of a sarcopenia analysis using an
      existing CT/MRI scan and measurement of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE reader).

      Additional patients characteristics including medication use, medical history, tumor
      characteristics, neoadjuvant therapy and laboratory results of preoperative routine blood
      sampling will be collected. At three, six and twelve months after diagnosis, EORTC
      QLQ-C30/EORTC QLQ-CR29 and EQ-5D questionnaires are used to determine HRQL and disability
      free survival.
