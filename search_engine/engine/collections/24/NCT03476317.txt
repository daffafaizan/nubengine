      non-immunosuppressive medications, in the management of refractory CD or IBDU. Refractory
      patients include those patients who have experienced loss of responsiveness (LOR) or primary
      nonresponse to an immunomodulator or a biologic. Investigators will treat participants with a
      combination of gut microbiota-targeted therapies to restore a healthy gut microbiome
      composition. Investigators believe that this strategy will both treat the gut inflammation
      associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as salvage response to immune
      suppressive therapies.

      Investigators will also evaluate the effect of PEG lavage alone on fecal calprotectin and gut
      microbiota. Participants in this arm, will be undergoing a PEG lavage in preparation for a
      endoscopy for clinical care. They will be asked to provide stool samples, prior to and after
      their PEG lavage. Participants will not be receiving any investigational treatments.
