      during the natural cycle and to check the inter-cycle variations.

      Because of the many clinical decisions that are based on AMH levels alone the results of this
      study could bring reassurance to the continuous use of AMH in daily practice. More
      importantly, no studies to date have been performed on the newer automated assays evaluating
      variability of AMH levels.
