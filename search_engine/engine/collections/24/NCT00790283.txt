      rates depending on patient vascular morphology and lesion-related factors, the indication for
      and technique of stent deployment, and others. Drug-eluting stents (DES) improve the
      treatment of many coronary artery lesions by significantly reducing in-stent restenosis.
      However, there have numerous limitations resulting from the need for long-term dual
      antiplatelet therapy, the consequent bleeding risk (old patients, surgery, colon or gastric
      cancer, trauma), the unknown side-effects of long-term antiplatelet therapy, the cost
      associated with a long-term thienopyridine regimen, the body's reaction to the stent polymer,
      and the 0.2% per year increase in late stent thrombosis in comparison with bare metal stents
      (BMS).

      For these reasons, continuous research is devoted to improve the effectiveness of bare metal
      stents. The ideal stent should be non-thrombogenic, with a low rate of restenosis and late
      thrombotic events. The NUMEN stent has been designed to meet these criteria, using an
      extremely low stent strut thickness.
