        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with stage IIIB or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin, irinotecan, and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive disease receive up to 6 courses
      of therapy. Patients also receive oral thalidomide once daily beginning on day 1 and
      continuing until disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39-70 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.
