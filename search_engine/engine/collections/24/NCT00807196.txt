      refractory disease currently remains incurable. Being a radiosensitive tumor, we hypothesize
      that combining different modalities of treatment including targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT),
      and a graft versus lymphoma effect related to an allogeneic non myeloablative stem cell
      transplant may increase response and survival rates in a safe manner in patients with
      persistent disease following initial treatment. In this study patients who are not eligible
      for a standard stem cell transplant approach because of relapsed or refractory disease and
      who have a related sibling donor are treated with RIT followed by an allogeneic non
      myeloablative blood stem cell transplant
