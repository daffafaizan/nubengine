      emergency departments, operating rooms and intensive care units. In patients with poor
      peripheral perfusion (low blood flow) due to peripheral vascular disease, low body
      temperature, or shock and the use of medications to raise the blood pressure, clinicians have
      difficulty obtaining an accurate measurement. Several studies have demonstrated the utility
      of forehead sensor measurements under these clinical conditions. Forehead sensor measurement
      is considered to be a more central measurement than with digit or ear sensors. However the
      sensor requires a head band for accurate measurement. On a regular basis, the forehead sensor
      has led to pressure ulcer development at Barnes-Jewish Hospital despite following vendor
      recommendations for alternating placement every 8 hours from one side of the forehead to the
      other. An alternate sensor placed on the nose has recently demonstrated rapid detection of
      induced drops in oxygen saturation. It has also demonstrated correlation with arterial oxygen
      saturation measured in a clinical laboratory. The oxygen saturation measurement from the nose
      is also considered a central measurement. However, studies of the nose sensor were conducted
      in healthy subjects or during anesthesia care over several hours. Therefore, research is
      needed to examine the accuracy of the nose sensor in the ICU patient population. In addition,
      due to concerns for sensor related pressure ulcers in patients with decreased perfusion, the
      sensor needs to be evaluated for extended periods of time.
