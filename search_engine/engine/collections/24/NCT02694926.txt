      In a prospective trial the efficiency of a german-wide education programme in patients with
      chronic adrenal insufficiency will be evaluated by using a questionnaire before and after
      training.

      Patients:

      Patients will be recruited out of the patient population of the participating nine medical
      centers. To achieve a anticipated number of 450 patients, each center will include al least
      50 patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency under established replacement therapy .

      Trial flow:

      During sessions of 90 minutes duration, patients and relatives are educated in basic
      knowledge on adrenal insufficiency including the correct behaviour in emergency settings.
      Participants are provided with emergency cards and sets and are trained in self-injection of
      glucocorticoids. To evaluate the standardized education programme, patients complete three
      questionnaires (before, shortly after and 6-9 months after the training) at nine endocrine
      centres. All centres had been certified by the German Endocrine Society for the education
      programme. Questionnaires assess general knowledge on adrenal insufficiency and document the
      influence on patients' feeling of security.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Documentation and analysis will be performed at the Department of Medicine I, Endocrine and
      Diabetes Unit, University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany. Data will be documented after
      pseudonymisation in a data base. Data analysis is mainly descriptive.

      Stopping rules:

      Participation of patients is fully voluntarily. Patients are able to stop participation in
      the study at any point in time. In addition, patients might claim the elimination of all data
      material at any point in time.
