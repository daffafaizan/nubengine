      packet. This packet contains questions about how you feel about your appearance and your
      overall well-being. You will be asked to have photographs of your breast(s) taken with two
      different types of digital cameras (2D and 3D). These are the same type of photographs
      routinely taken for all patients having breast reconstructive surgery. The photographs and
      measurements will be taken during your routine clinic visit. You will not be identifiable in
      the photographs.

      The photographs will be used to develop automated methods for evaluating the appearance and
      shape of the breasts.

      You may be asked to complete additional follow-up visits for this study. These visits would
      take place at a regularly-scheduled clinic visit that takes place just before a surgical
      procedure is planned. At these visits you would be asked to fill out another questionnaire
      packet and to allow the research the research staff to repeat the photographs. The number of
      follow-up visits needed would depend on your individual treatment plan. A final study visit
      would take place once you feel you are finished with your breast reconstructive process. At
      this point, your participation in the study would be completed. Breast reconstruction is
      different for each patient. The length of time of the reconstructive process depends on the
      procedure(s) that you and your surgeon have agreed upon. These options will be discussed at
      your regularly scheduled clinic appointments.

      This is an investigational study. A total of up to 300 patients will take part in this study.
      All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.
