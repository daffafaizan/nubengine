    
      Patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) whose left ventricular ejection
      fraction(LVEF) was <40%, were assigned to a high BNP group (BNP â‰¤ 3000 pg/mL) or an
      extra-high BNP group (BNP > 3000 pg/mL) , depending on their admission plasma BNP levels.
      Each group was then subdivided into rhBNP or dobutamine subgroups according to intravenous
      administration with either rhBNP or dobutamine for 24-72h. The effects of rhBNP and
      dobutamine on patients in the high and extra-high BNP groups were compared.
