      patients with portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT). Our previous prospective study revealed
      that sorafenib combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin
      plus fluorouracil/leucovorin confer a survival benefit to HCC with major PVTT. However, HAIC
      of fluorouracil is not such for advanced HCC. Whether HAIC of oxaliplatin is as effective as
      HAIC of oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin is controversial. Thus, the investigators
      carried out this prospective randomized control study to find out it.
