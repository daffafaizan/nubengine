      rectal cancer treated with one of the following three regimens: bolus injections of
      fluorouracil (5-FU) prior to and following pelvic irradiation plus protracted venous infusion
      (PVI) 5-FU radiosensitization vs PVI 5-FU prior to and following pelvic irradiation plus PVI
      5-FU radiosensitization vs bolus 5-FU with leucovorin calcium and levamisole prior to and
      following pelvic irradiation. II. Describe relapse patterns and tolerance associated with
      these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type
      of prior surgery (abdominoperineal resection vs anterior resection), nodal status (N0 vs N1
      vs N2-3), depth of tumor invasion (T1-2 vs T3 vs T4a vs T4b), time from surgery to study
      entry (20-45 days vs 46-70 days), participating center, and performance status (0-1 vs 2).
      Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil
      (5-FU) IV on days 1-5 and 29-33. 5-FU is then given as a continuous infusion beginning on day
      57 and continuing concurrently with radiotherapy for 5 weeks. Following a 28 day break from
      treatment patients receive 5-FU IV on days 1-5 of a 28 day course. Postradiotherapy treatment
      repeats for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive 5-FU IV continuously on days 1-42. 5-FU and radiotherapy
      are then administered as in arm II. Arm III: Patients receive leucovorin calcium (CF) IV
      followed by 5-FU IV on days 1-5 and 29-33. Patients also receive oral levamisole twice daily
      on days 1-3, 15-17, 29-31, and 43-45. CF IV and 5-FU IV are then given on days 57-60 and
      85-88 concurrently with radiotherapy. Following a 28 day break from treatment patients
      receive CF IV and 5-FU IV on days 1-5 and 29-33 and oral levamisole twice daily on days 1-3,
      15-17, 29-31, and 43-45 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All
      patients receive radiotherapy 5 days per week for 5 weeks starting on day 57. Patients are
      followed every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,800 patients (600 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
