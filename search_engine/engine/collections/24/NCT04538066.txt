    
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin-1 to
      placebo for long-term efficacy in the treatment of moderately severe AD (Mini Mental State
      Examination, 2nd edition scores of 10-18 at baseline) in the absence of memantine. Eligible
      subjects will receive 7 doses of bryostatin (i.v., 20Î¼g) or matching placebo during the first
      12 weeks. A second course of treatment consisting of 7 doses will begin 30 days after the
      final dose of the first treatment period. Cognitive tests will be assessed at intervals
      during the study and 4 months after the final dose of study drug. The primary endpoint is the
      total SIB score assessment obtained at Week 28, following completion of 2 courses of
      treatment.
