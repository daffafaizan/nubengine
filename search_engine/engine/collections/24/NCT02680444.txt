      promote mental health, brief and cost-effective interventions teaching beneficial emotion
      regulation techniques can not only counteract the negative but also foster positive
      functioning. The tools of mindfulness (i.e., objective awareness and acceptance) and positive
      reappraisal (i.e., positive re-evaluation of negative events) can mutually benefit one
      another to promote well-being. However, there is currently little research testing the
      viability of brief, self-administered interventions combining training of mindfulness and
      positive reappraisal. The current study explored the effects of a randomly-assigned
      Mindful-Reappraisal intervention (n=36) compared to Reappraisal-Only (n=34) and an active
      control (n=36) on university students' daily affect over five days. Time by condition
      interactions were analyzed with planned contrasts and multilevel growth modelling.
