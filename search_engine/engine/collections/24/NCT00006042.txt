        -  Determine the minimum effective dose of pretransplant cyclophosphamide to induce
           engraftment of haploidentical allogeneic bone marrow without the use of myeloablative
           conditioning in patients with hematologic malignancies.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of graft versus host disease and nonhematologic
           toxicities with this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate the pretreatment phenotypic and functional immunologic characteristics in
           these patients in relation to risk of graft rejection with this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cyclophosphamide.

      Patients receive fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -2; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour
      on days -6, -5, and 3; total body irradiation on day -1; and allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive tacrolimus IV or orally twice a day on days
      4-50; oral mycophenolate mofetil on days 4-35; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV
      starting on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cyclophosphamide until the minimum
      effective dose necessary to induce chimerism without unacceptable toxicity in these patients
      is determined.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 months, at one year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 23 patients will be accrued for this study.
