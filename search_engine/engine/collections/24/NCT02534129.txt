      cream, on preventing radiation dermatitis (RD) when compared to an over the counter ointment,
      Aquaphor, in women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer following lumpectomy or
      mastectomy surgery. Presently there is no known fully effective topical protectant from RD
      and there is no consensus among radiation oncologists on how best to treat RD. This study
      seeks to identify a more effective option for patients receiving radiation therapy. Each
      participant will apply the DIFINISA53™ cream to one area of the treated skin and Aquaphor to
      another area of treated skin. Skin reactions will be evaluated using medical professional
      assessment, participant assessment, and photographic assessment by a third party.
