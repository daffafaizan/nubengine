      evaluation of a device claimed to reduce pressure ulcers in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery.

      Data acquisition will be based on systematic sampling of cardiac surgery operations based on
      odd and even calendar dates. On odd dates the Dabir micropressure overlay will be functional
      on the operating room tables. On even dates the Dabir micropressure overlay will not be
      functional on the operating room tables. Data on baseline characteristics, operative
      parameters, and primary and secondary endpoints will be gathered from STS and wound care
      sources, which are routinely collected for all patients. There will be no additional patient
      information and data collected specifically for this study.
