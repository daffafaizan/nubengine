      answer, percentage of correct answers) further to the neuromodulation. The specific question
      is to estimate the effect on the performances of access at the semantic representations of
      this method, according to the age. One of the hypotheses in the research on the normal ageing
      is the difficulty of access to these representations (fundamental process for the cognitive
      functions, such as the language and the memory) at the healthy elderly. By using the
      neuromodulation the investigators wish to explore this hypothesis and to understand if the
      neuromodulation can have a beneficial effect on the improvement of the behavioral
      performances of the elderly.
