    
      Vulvar Paget's disease is a rare skin tumour and generally seen in postmenopausal, Caucasian
      women as an erythematous, eczematous, scaling or ulcerating plaque. Initial symptoms are
      irritation, burning, pain and a skin lesion. The origin of vulvar Paget's disease is not yet
      entirely understood. The treatment of choice is surgical excision, despite high recurrence
      rates. The mutilating consequences of surgery can lead to impressive morbidity to address
      this, several series report the use of topical 5% imiquimod cream for vulvar Paget's disease.

      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, evaluate the safety, immunological
      effect of topical 5% imiquimod cream for vulvar Paget's disease and the quality of life
      during treatment.
