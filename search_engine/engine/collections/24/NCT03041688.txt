    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of KRT-232 (AMG-232) in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m^2
      for 10 days), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of KRT-232 (AMG-232) in combination with a standard dose of decitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of KRT-232 (AMG-232) and decitabine when
      used in combination.

      II. To evaluate tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) signaling induced by KRT-232 (AMG-232) and
      decitabine as measured by macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) induction.

      III. To correlate KRT-232 (AMG-232) and decitabine exposure with pharmacodynamics endpoints
      (efficacy, toxicity, changes in p53 signaling).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) of KRT-232
      (AMG-232) and decitabine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers of response to KRT-232 (AMG-232) and
      decitabine in AML.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of KRT-232 (AMG-232) and decitabine in AML
      blasts.

      IV. To determine the variability of decitabine incorporation into genomic deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) and correlate with systemic pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2 inhibitor KRT-232.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10 and MDM2 inhibitor
      KRT-232 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 4-10 and 18-24. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 4 cycles in patients with evidence of persistent AML.

      Starting cycle 2, patients with no morphologic evidence of AML receive decitabine IV over 1
      hour on days 1-5 and KRT-232 PO QD on days 4-10. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
