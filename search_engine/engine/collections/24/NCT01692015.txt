    
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 people, usually causing
      nosebleeds, skin blood spots, and/or anaemia as a result of bleeding from the nose or gut.
      The majority of people with HHT also have abnormal blood vessels (arteriovenous
      malformations) in internal organs such as the lungs, liver and brain. Management of this
      multisystem disorder is highly challenging.

      The Lead Applicant has spent 20 years working on this rare disease, and identified multiple
      areas where more evidence is required to assist clinicians and patients with this lifelong
      condition. A particular issue is whether the diet influences HHT or its complications in any
      way.

      In this study, people will fill in two questionnaires, one giving details of their diet, and
      another details of their nosebleeds. They will also be asked to consider participating in an
      accessory study arm which includes weighing food for one week and providing a food diary, in
      addition to having a single set of blood test.
