      493 volunteer smokers, wishing to quit. They were divided into 5 arms: 4 treatment groups of
      0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0g/day respectively, and one placebo, divided BID. Treatment was
      administered during one week prior to smoking cessation, then continued during 8 weeks (56
      days), followed by another 4 weeks without treatment (up to day 84). The primary endpoint was
      complete smoking cessation during at least 28 consecutive days. There were 6 on-site visits
      and 4 telephone interviews.
