      patients with ED with and without childhood trauma, (2) To develop our understanding about
      how change happens for these patients. The investigators will do this by compare two
      treatment models; (1) Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT) and (2) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
      (CBT), for EDs both treatment types delivered at Modum Bad Psychiatric Center, department of
      ED.

      Patients included in this randomized controlled trial will receive treatment at Modum Bad,
      satisfy DSM-V criteria for ED and half of the patients will in addition have a history of
      childhood trauma. A total of 86 patients who have received either CFT or CBT are followed up
      two year after completion of the treatment. The study utilises a rich data set collected
      outcome measures at altogether 5 time points and process and sub-outcome measures at 13 time
      points. The investigators will take advantage of our established collaborative networks, both
      nationally and internationally and existing procedures, where all patients are assessed with
      the same clinical instruments based on current state-of-the-art methods.
