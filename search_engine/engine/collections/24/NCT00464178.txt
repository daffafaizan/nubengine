      role of angiogenesis in its pathogenesis has become a subject of much investigation. Micro
      vessel density (neovascularization) is inversely related to prognosis in Multiple Myeloma.
      Response to thalidomide was felt to correlate with a decline in microvessel density (Singhal
      et al NEJM). While the mechanism of neovascularization is yet to be fully elucidated, a
      number of models have shown VEGF to play a central role.

      Thalidomide has been shown to synergize with a number of agents used to treat MM, including
      bortezomib. (Wang et al ASH 2005) This would justify the use of other therapeutics with known
      antiangiogenic activity in conjunction with established antimyeloma therapies.

      Bortezomib, which has the precedence of known synergy with Thalidomide and has an extremely
      well established optimal dose, schedule, response rate, event free survival, and overall
      survival would make it an excellent candidate for combination therapy with other established
      antiangiogenic compounds.

      There have been several reports of the role of VEGF in multiple myeloma. It has been shown
      that multiple myeloma cells secreteVEGF, which further promotes production of IL-6 in BMSCs,
      as well as migration and proliferation of the tumor cells. Thus VEGF is both an autocrine
      growth factor and trigger of IL-6-mediated paracrine multiple myeloma cell growth. Recent
      reports have highlighted the major role of VEGF in multiple myeloma pathogenesis,
      demonstrating the VEGF also increases microvessel density in the bone marrow. VEGF also
      inhibits dendritic cells. Taken together, these preclinical reports make strong suggestion
      for the promise of VEGF targeted agents in multiple myeloma (Le Gouill et al 2004).
