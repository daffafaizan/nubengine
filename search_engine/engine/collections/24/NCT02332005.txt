      safety study will enroll 400 adult diabetic subjects with diabetic peripheral neuropathy
      (DPN) to investigate the effect of diepalrestat (BNV-222) 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo on MNCV
      and patients' perception of nerve function over 12 months as measured by VAS scales and
      composite clinical outcome patient reported scales that evaluate numbness, tingling,
      cramping, paresthesiae, hyperesthesia, coldness, weakness and spontaneous pain perception of
      upper and lower extremities, and the effects on other measures of nerve motor and sensory
      conduction. Subjects will be assessed at screening and baseline, with office visits every 12
      weeks, for a total of 6 visits. Subjects will be assessed by testing motor nerve conduction
      velocity and other assessments at each office visit. A subgroup of 24 patients will be
      selected for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing for up to 48 hours with additional blood draws on
      Day 7 and 14. This study will investigate the ability of diepalrestat to reduce the ongoing
      deterioration of nerve function which is a hallmark of the DPN process.
