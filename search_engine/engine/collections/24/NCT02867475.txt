      Because of a recent research, it is shown that a narrative message from a peer generates an
      identification, a sense of self-efficacy and intention to practice in sedentary patients with
      breast cancer.

      The investigator hypothesize that a promotional message about physical activity, issued by a
      self-determined peer (intrinsic motivation), compared to a non-self-determined peer
      (extrinsic motivation), generate higher scores of positive beliefs about physical activity
      and intention to engage in a physical activity program for sedentary patients.

      These promotional messages will be delivered through two videos, one featuring the
      self-determined pair, the other featuring the non-self-determined pair.
