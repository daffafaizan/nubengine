      known as 'sensory tricks' or Geste antagoniste in focal dystonia. Sensory tricks, which we
      will refer to as 'tricks' since some involve motor as well as sensory input, are various
      stimuli used by dystonic patients to transiently diminish their spasms (Jankovic and Fahn
      1993). The phenomenon of tricks is evidence for the abnormality of sensorimotor integration
      in focal dystonia, yet it is little studied or understood. A survey of the history and
      characteristics of tricks will lead to a better understanding of this puzzling phenomenon,
      and a step toward the understanding of the mechanism of focal dystonia.
