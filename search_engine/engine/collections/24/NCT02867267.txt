      effect as to the 28-day all-cause mortality and the augmentation of mHLA-DR (monocyte Human
      Leukocyte Antigen DR) at the secondary endpoint. Therefore, we intend to verify this finding
      through a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial and the trail will
      include subjects with impaired immunologic functions.
