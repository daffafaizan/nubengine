    
      Patients admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as
      determined by PCR and/or CT scan showing typical radiological findings (ground glass
      abnormalities) and requiring O2 3L/min to get an SpO2 higher or equal to 95%.

      Patients will be randomised for their position : a group with prone positioning at least 6
      hours a day during hosital stay until oxygen weaning or intubation (interventional group) and
      a group with no instruction regarding positioning (control group). In the interventional
      group, patients will be suggested to spend 6 hours or more in prone position and will report
      themselves the time spent in prone position each day. In the control group, patients won't be
      given any instruction regarding positioning.

      Patients will be clinically assessed as usual : monitoring 4 to 8 times a day in the ward and
      continuous monitoring in ICU.

      The need for admission to ICU, high flow nasal oxygenation, non invasive ventilation or
      intubation or the occurrence of death will be recorded.
