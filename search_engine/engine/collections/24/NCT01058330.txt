      Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC syndrome), Legius syndrome, Costello syndrome and
      neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is one of the most common genetic disorders presenting in
      childhood with an incidence of 1/3000. NF1 is associated with skeletal abnormalities such as
      short stature, scoliosis, and long bone fracture with non-union. We recently reported that
      children with NF1 have abnormalities of bone and muscle architecture as evidenced by
      decreased bone mineral density, decreased bone strength, and low muscle mass, all of which
      may predispose them to fractures and scoliosis (Stevenson et al., 2005, 2007, 2009). Our
      preliminary data show that children with NF1 have poor motor coordination and muscle
      strength, potentially secondary to abnormal neuromotor learning. We hypothesize that poor
      motor coordination and decreased muscle strength contribute to the osteopenia in NF1. Our
      objective is to identify effective and non-invasive strategies to improve motor coordination,
      muscle strength, and bone and muscle architecture in children with disorders of the Ras
      pathway, in hopes of decreasing fractures and improving physical activity levels. Plyometric
      physical training consists of quick, high-intensity, weight-bearing movements, and is an
      encouraging intervention for use in these children.
