      preterm using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) in standard medical
      practice and compare it with the gold standard MRI and ultrasound imagings. It would be
      possible to check do we need to use all the 3 examinations or Hammersmith examination would
      be enough reliable predictor. Secondary aim is to explore the relationships between MRI brain
      /cranial us abnormalities and HINE at term-equivalent age in infants born preterm in
      prediction of neurological outcome at 1 year of chronological age.

      This study will be only single arm/single group. This group would receive the regular
      practice of MRI, Ultrasound (US) and Hammersmith assessments. The 3 assessments would be
      compared in relationships with the neonatal developmental outcomes (developmental
      milestones).
