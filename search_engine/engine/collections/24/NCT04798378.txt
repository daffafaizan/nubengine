      powered braces and functional electrical stimulation can help restore functional arm movement
      in these individuals. Powered braces and muscle stimulation may be triggered by detecting
      movement or electrical activity of proximal muscles that the person still can control. The
      overall objective of this study is to establish that children and adults with chronic, stable
      neurological motor impairment can achieve voluntary control over the NuroSleeve myoelectric
      elbow-wrist-hand orthosis, that incorporates optional functional electrical stimulation, and
      that they can use this voluntary control to perform functionally beneficial tasks to enhance
      independence, mental and physical health. While myoelectric prostheses have been studied for
      decades in children with limb loss, it is necessary to gather pilot data on the use of
      orthoses with optional electrical stimulation in people with intact yet paralyzed limbs.
      These adults and children have persistent motor deficits even after intensive physical and
      occupational therapy. The NuroSleeve and similar devices could help all people who have arm
      weakness.
