      treatment for bleeding piles. Currently the HALO is a Doppler guided procedure though when
      the Doppler mechanism does not function it has been noted that the results are similar. This
      prompts the question does the Doppler guide the operation to tie off the important vessels to
      shrink he piles, or can the vessels that underlie the visible piles be treated without
      Doppler. Professor Phillips from St.Marks has reviewed the protocol and agrees that it is
      well designed and worthwhile.
