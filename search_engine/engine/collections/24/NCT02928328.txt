      reduce the pain and sensitivity induced by application of capsaicin to the tongue of healthy
      human subjects. Thirty, pain-free men (n=15) and women (n=15) for the oral cavity study.

      Subproject II This study will test the hypothesis that intramuscular injection of GABA alone
      will not be painful, but will reduce muscle pain sensitivity in healthy human subjects.
      Thirty, pain-free men (n=15) and women (n=15) will be recruited for the intramuscular GABA
      injection studies

      Subproject III This study will test the hypothesis that intramuscular injection of GABA with
      glutamate will decrease the intensity of glutamate-evoked muscle pain in healthy human
      subjects. Thirty, pain-free men (n=15) and women (n=15) will be recruited for the
      intramuscular glutamate and GABA injection studies.
