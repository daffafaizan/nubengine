      shoulder pain will be developed and implemented in general practice. The purpose is to
      improve quality of care and provide GPs with a simplified and efficient tool to handle
      patients with common shoulder- related pain. The study is a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized
      trial with a hybrid design including a effectiveness, cost and implementation assessment of a
      guideline-based intervention in clinical practice (2). General practitioners in Norway will
      be recruited and the GP offices will be randomized to the time of crossover from current
      treatment as usual (TAU) to the implementation of the intervention. The intervention is a
      tailored strategy that includes workshops for general practitioners covering information and
      access to a decision support tool, an education program where the general practitioner learn
      an evidence-based approach to shoulder pain and access to patient information materials.
      Outcomes will be measured at patient and GP levels, using self-report questionnaires, focus
      group interviews and register based data.
