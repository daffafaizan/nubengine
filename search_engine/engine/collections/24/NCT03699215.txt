      recruitment period of 12 months is estimated from the beginning of the study. From the date
      of inclusion of the first patient, the final duration of the study will be 1.5 years.

      The study will end when performing the last cardio-resonance and echocardiography that should
      be performed 6 months after the inclusion of the last patient in the study.

      Upon arrival of the patient at the Coronary Unit, he will receive, in a randomized and
      double-blind manner, without a loading dose, the 24-hour infusion of Levosimendan, or
      placebo.

      The continuous infusion of levosimendan 0.1 micrograms / kg / min will be administered during
      24h. If the initial dose is tolerated and a greater hemodynamic effect is needed, the
      infusion rate can be increased to 0.2 micrograms / kg / min. The dose of Levosimendan
      infusion can be reduced to 0.05 μg / kg / min in case of clinical intolerance or systolic
      hypotension <90 mmHg.

      Continuous perfusion of the placebo 0.1 micrograms / kg / min will be administered for 24h.
      If the initial dose is tolerated and a greater hemodynamic effect is needed, the infusion
      rate can be increased to 0.2 micrograms / kg / min. The dose of infusion of the placebo can
      be reduced to 0.05 μg / kg / min in case of clinical intolerance or systolic hypotension <90
      mmHg.
