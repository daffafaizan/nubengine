      satisfaction, decreased empathy, anxiety, depression, increased medical errors and decreased
      patient satisfaction. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that programs
      incorporating mind-body practices increase resilience in healthcare providers and can reduce
      burnout and perceived stress while increasing empathy. The Benson-Henry Institute for Mind
      Body Medicine (BHI) has developed a clinical program for patients known as the Stress
      Management and Resiliency Training Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP or SMART
      Program for short). This study is to evaluate the effect of the SMART-3RP on physician and
      academic faculty well-being, perceived stress, burnout, compassion, and job satisfaction.
