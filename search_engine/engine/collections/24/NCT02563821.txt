      number of legally induced abortion at the third trimester of pregnancy. Psychological pain is
      frequently associated to physical pain in these kinds of interventions. So anaesthetists are
      more and more involved in voluntary termination of pregnancy analgesia.

      In France, Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA) with CEI mode is usually used for
      voluntary termination of pregnancy analgesia. But recent studies have shown that PIEB mode as
      compared to CEI mode increases maternal satisfaction during labour. This may be attributed to
      a more extensive spread of epidural solution when delivered as a bolus rather than continuous
      infusion.

      Few trials have been interested in investigating the best mode of PCEA for legally induced
      abortion analgesia.

      This study includes women who undergo voluntary third semester termination of pregnancy.
      Patients are randomized to PIEB or CEI for pain analgesia. In this randomized, double-blind
      study, the investigators assess the degree of satisfaction of the patients (primary outcome),
      the incidence of motor block, total drug consumption and adverse events (secondary outcomes)
      between the two study groups.

      The different values are collected during the intervention on a specific paper for each
      patient and the degree of satisfaction is reported on this paper just before the patient
      leaves the birth room (approximatively 2 hours after the expulsion).
