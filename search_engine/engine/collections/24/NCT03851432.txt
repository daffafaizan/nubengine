    
      A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (a 24-week
      core period followed by a 28-week extension period), to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Janagliflozin (25 mg and 50 mg) compared to placebo, all in combination with Metformin, in
      patients diagnosed with T2DM who are not achieving an adequate response from Metformin
      monotherapy. Approximately 390 patients with inadequate glycemic control with Metformin
      monotherapy will receive once-daily double-blind treatment with Janagliflozin 25 mg or 50 mg
      , both in combination with Metformin , for 52 weeks, or receive 24 weeks of double-blind
      treatment with placebo in combination with Metformin followed by 28 weeks of single-blind
      treatment with Janagliflozin 25 mg or 50 mg, both in combination with Metformin. During the
      treatment, if a patient's glycemic level remains high despite treatment with study drug and
      reinforcement with diet and exercise, the patient will receive treatment with Linagliptin
      (rescue therapy) consistent with local prescribing information.
