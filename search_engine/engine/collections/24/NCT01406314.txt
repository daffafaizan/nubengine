    
      This study is an open label, dose characteristic study assessing safety and pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic considerations of GSK2315698A. GSK2315698A is a ligand known to bind to
      serum amyloid protein (SAP), a key component of an anti-SAP approach to the treatment of
      systemic amyloidosis. Safety assessments will include adverse events, vital signs, ECGs and
      other relevant clinical laboratory tests. Dose administration routes will also be determined
      focusing on the tolerability of intravenous dose administration versus subcutaneous. The
      study aims to recruit up to 30 patients with a medical diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis.
      Subjects will be asked to attend 2 dosing sessions, each session will involve an intravenous
      infusion of GSK2315698A over 48 hours followed by a single subcutaneous dose in session 1 and
      up to 3 subcutaneous doses in session 2 to be administered over a 24 hour period.
