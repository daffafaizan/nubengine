      chronic back pain. Shortening the delay of 5-10 years between first symptoms and making a
      diagnosis of AS has become a challenge especially because effective treatments have become
      available. Easy to apply referral parameters for physicians in primary care may contribute to
      make the diagnosis earlier.

      Methods: Orthopedists and primary care physicians were offered to refer patients with i)
      chronic low back pain (duration >3 months) and ii) onset of back pain at an age < 45 years to
      a specialized rheumatology outpatient clinic for further diagnostic work-up if at least one
      of the following screening parameters was present: 1) inflammatory back pain (IBP), 2)
      positive HLA-B27, 3) sacroiliitis as detected by imaging. The final diagnosis was made
      according to expert opinion.

      It was analyzed, which parameters or combination of parameters performed best in making a
      diagnosis of axial SpA.
