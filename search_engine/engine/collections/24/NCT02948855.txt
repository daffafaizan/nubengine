    
      1. This study plans to research the correlation between Bregs and thymoma complicated with
           autoimmune diseases and the regulation the severity of the disease.

        2. Clarify different expression levels of Notch2 signaling pathway in thymoma complicated
           with autoimmune diseases, and the effect on Regulatory B Cells(Bregs).

        3. Find the effective regulation mode of Notch2 signaling pathway and the regulation of
           Bregs cell development and function in LncRNA.
