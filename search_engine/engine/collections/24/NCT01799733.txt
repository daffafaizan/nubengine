      (LWT+Am BWL)vs. Early Wake Therapy plus evening bright light (EWT+PM BWL)administered in the
      luteal phase of two separate menstrual cycles, and preceded by 2 evaluation months. To lessen
      the patient's burden, the 1-night EWT or LWT and the following 7-day BWL interventions will
      be conducted at home, given at a fixed point in each menstrual cycle, from day 1 to 7 after
      the mid-cycle luteinizing hormone(LH) surge (ovulation). We anticipate that LWT+7 days of AM
      BWL (vs. EWT+PM BWL) will produce much greater mood benefits and larger physiological
      responses, than the one-time light pulses used in our earlier phase-shift studies.
