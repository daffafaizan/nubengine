      role in cocaine addiction in humans. Doxazosin is a long-acting and selective alpha
      1-adrenergic receptor blocker, which inhibits the binding of norepinephrine to alpha
      receptors in the autonomic nervous system. This study will evaluate the efficacy of doxazosin
      in reducing cocaine-using behavior in treatment seeking cocaine-dependent individuals, and
      will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related alpha 1 receptor
      antagonists for treatment of cocaine addiction.

      This 12-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will provide treatment for
      cocaine-dependent patients and includes a 8-week maintenance medication trial (weeks 3-10).
      At the end of this period, subjects will have a 2-week study medication taper (weeks 11-12).
      Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive Doxazosin up to 8 mg/day or placebo.

      At the beginning of week 1, participants will receive Doxazosin, or placebo according to
      their randomized assignments, and are maintained on these agents through week 12. At the end
      of the study (weeks 11-12), participants will undergo discontinuation from active/inactive
      medication over a 2-week period. Subjects who wish to be transferred to an appropriate
      treatment program or research program will be referred to upon request, during the study
      weeks 11-12.
