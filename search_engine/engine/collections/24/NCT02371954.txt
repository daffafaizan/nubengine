      intervention or a psychoeducation condition. Participants randomized to HOLA will participate
      in a group exercise, 3 times a week, for 16 weeks. The exercise is a moderate intensity walk
      at a centrally located park in Miami-Dade county and will last for an hour (10 minute
      warmup/stretching, 30 minute walk, 5 minute cool down). Groups will consist of 6 participants
      and be led by a community health worker. During the cool down phase, participants will plan a
      pleasant event to be done in between sessions. Participants randomized to the psychoeducation
      component will receive a fotonovela and will meet once a month after they receive the
      fotonovela to discuss their thoughts on the materials they received. These discussion groups
      will last one hour and will consist of 10 participants. A total of 60 participants will be
      randomized (30 to HOLA, 30 to fotonovela). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post
      intervention, 6 months post-intervention, and 12 months post-intervention.
