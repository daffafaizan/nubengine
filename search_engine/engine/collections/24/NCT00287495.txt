      doses of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) in patients with Kaposi s sarcoma (KS). It will also assess,
      in a preliminary manner, the activity of BAY 43-9006 in this disease and its effect on
      biological markers. BAY 43-9006 is a potent inhibitor of wild-type and mutant c-Raf kinase
      isoforms. In addition, this agent also inhibits p38, c-kit, vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor 2(VEGFR2), VEGF-R3, and platelet derived growth factor receptor beta
      (PDGFR-B). There is evidence that several of these receptors, and especially VEGF-R2,
      VEGF-R3, and PDGF-RB, are important in KS pathogenesis. The principle tumor cells of KS
      lesions are spindle cells, which are derived from endothelial cells. Spindle cells
      proliferate in response to VEGF, VEGF-C (a ligand for VEGF-R3), and PDGF, and the stimulation
      of spindle cells by these factors appears to be an important component in the pathogenesis of
      KS. There is also evidence that c-kit is important in KS. Because BAY 43-9006 can inhibit the
      function of these receptors and c-kit, it may have specific activity against this tumor. BAY
      43-9006 is metabolized at least in part by CYP 3A4, and ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor
      commonly used in AIDS patients, is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4. Also, AIDS patients are often
      quite sensitive to drug toxicities. Thus, patients with AIDS-KS on ritonavir may be
      particularly sensitive to BAY 43-9006.

      OBJECTIVES: To assess the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics of BAY 43-9006 at oral dose
      regimens of 200 mg once daily, 200mg twice daily, or 400 mg twice daily, up to the toxic
      dose, in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi s sarcoma (KS) who are receiving ritonavir.
      Also, to assess in a preliminary manner the pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile of BAY
      43-9006 in patients who are not receiving ritonavir.

      ELIGIBILITY: Key eligibility criteria are as follows: patients 18 years of age or older, with
      or without HIV infection, and with KS and at least 5 cutaneous lesions untreated by local
      therapy; patients with HIV infection must have KS that is progressing or stable on highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); patients with extensive active, visceral, or
      symptomatic KS are excluded.

      DESIGN: Patients with AIDS-KS who are receiving ritonavir will be administered BAY 43-9006.
      An initial group of patients will be administered 200 mg BAY 43-9006 once daily, and
      subsequent groups will receive 200 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily respectively. Also
      two groups of patients with KS and not on ritonavir will be administered 200 mg and 400 mg
      BAY 43-9006 twice daily respectively. Patients will be studied for toxicity,
      pharmacokinetics, KS response, the effect on biological markers such as target receptor
      kinase phosphorylation and signaling molecules in KS tissue. Other parameters that will be
      assessed will include VEGF levels, the viral load of KSHV, and KS lesion blood flow by
      non-invasive techniques. If patients tolerate BAY 43-9006, they will receive it for up to 24
      weeks. If they have evidence of stable KS or a tumor response, they may receive the drug for
      up to 54 weeks total.
