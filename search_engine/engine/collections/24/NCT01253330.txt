      plans than are parents of younger children. Adolescents are also typically "early adopters"
      to technological solutions and text messages are integral in today's teen culture. Text
      messages are gaining acceptance in health care both as appointment reminders and direct
      inquiries. The purpose of this randomized crossover study is to examine the effect of
      participant designed medication reminders on asthma control, asthma related quality of life,
      and medication adherence. In addition, this study will provide data regarding the usage,
      usability, and acceptability of an online system designed for creating text message
      reminders.
