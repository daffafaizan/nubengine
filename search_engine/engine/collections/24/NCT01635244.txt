      on-going interest in defining those hemodynamic characteristics in the interest of avoiding
      residual LV outflow obstruction and prosthesis-patient mismatch (residual LV outflow
      obstruction despite a normally functioning prosthesis ) after aortic valve replacement.
      Attempts to compare hemodynamics between prostheses have been limited by different sizing
      systems used by various manufacturers (precluding meaningful comparison of valves by valve
      size) and biological variability of in vivo gradients and effective orifice area for any
      valve (making potentially small differences in hemodynamics difficult to detect). Assessment
      of hemodynamics during increased cardiac output associated with exercise testing has been
      used to better define potentially subtle differences in hemodynamics between valve
      prostheses. In addition, assessment for change in LV geometry (notably including LV
      hypertrophy) after aortic valve replacement has been used as a surrogate marker of aortic
      prosthesis hemodynamics.
