    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), multicenter,
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), parallel-group (each group of patients will be
      treated at the same time), dose range finding study of JNJ-38518168 in patients with active
      RA despite concomitant MTX therapy. The study will consist a screening period, a 24-week
      placebo-controlled period and a 4-week follow-up period between the last dose and the last
      visit. The duration of participation in the study for an individual patient will be up to 34
      weeks (including screening). The patients will be assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a
      1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and JNJ-38518168 (3 mg or 10 mg or 30 mg). Safety assessments and
      evaluations to determine the efficacy of JNJ-38518168 to reduce the signs and symptoms of RA
      will be performed at study visits. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
