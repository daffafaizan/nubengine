      for this study. Eligible who consent will be asked to conduct several activities, which will
      be video taped and timed.

      The activities include:

        -  Timed up and go: patients will be asked to rise from a chair and walk 10 feet (3 m),
           turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down.

        -  QuickDASH tasks: open a jar, carry a shopping bag, cut food with a knife, wash back,
           wash a wall, and hammer a piece of wood.

        -  KOOS JR tasks: go up/down stairs, stand upright

        -  PROMIS PF tasks: lift heavy object repeat x5, shoelace or buttons, wash hair

      Patients will then be asked to complete a survey consisting of a number of validated
      questionnaires used to collect patient reported outcome measures and assess frailty. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions, the control condition or the frailty
      wellness platform condition. Patients assigned to the frailty wellness platform condition
      will be given an orientation to a health tracking program. They will be asked to fill out the
      questionnaires at 3 separate time points on the program site (accessed via phone or computer)
      at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months, following orientation. One year later, at the patient's
      second Annual Wellness Visit, the patient will be asked to fill out the Health Risk
      Assessment and the study will conclude.
