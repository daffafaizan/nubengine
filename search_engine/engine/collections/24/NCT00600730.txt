      impact of repeated hypoglycemia on the brain.

      During the past decade many studies have shown that appropriate magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) methods may be used to assess alterations in brain regional activation in response to
      external stimuli or tasks. Thus, this non-invasive technique will enhance our ability to
      learn more about brain function, during hypoglycemia and may delineate information about the
      role of the brain in hypoglycemia associated autonomic dysfunction.
