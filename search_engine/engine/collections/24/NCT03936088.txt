      application improves pain outcomes in adults with knee osteoarthritis. The investigator's
      secondary aim is to determine if self-reported Healthcare-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
      scores predict response to mindfulness treatment in OA. The investigators hypothesize that
      the use of an mHealth intervention for mindfulness training may be an effective adjunct
      treatment of chronic knee osteoarthritis pain; specifically, that regular use of a
      mindfulness application will result in a statistically significant reduction in pain outcomes
      and improvement in physical function as determined by the KOOS scoring system. The
      investigators also hypothesize that those with lower baseline self-reported HRQoL scores are
      more likely to see a greater improvement in their pain and function with use of a mindfulness
      application than those with higher baseline scores.
