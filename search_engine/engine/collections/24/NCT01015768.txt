      hours of contact lens wear, which is past the peak staining time and more typical of daily
      lens wear time. A silicone hydrogel lens and multipurpose solution combination shown to
      induce significant corneal staining ( e.g. equivalent Grade 3 out of Grade 4 scale) will be
      used to evaluate potential corneal compromise. The study will be a prospective,
      single-center, double-masked, contralateral, daily wear investigation in adapted soft contact
      lens wearers. After a three day washout period (without lens wear, lenses will then be worn
      on one day for eight hours. Corneal staining and barrier function will be determined for a
      regimen and a saline control situation for each subject. Staining will be graded using the
      Efron Grading Scale, and permeability data will be estimated as the fluorescein penetration
      rate, Pdc in nm/sec for the test and control condition.
