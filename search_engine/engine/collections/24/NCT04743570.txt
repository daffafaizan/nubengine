      disease development and progression in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) will be
      investigated. Patients with AP will be administered Methylnaltrexone (Relistor®)
      intravenously. This medication is defined as the investigational product. Relistor® is
      approved and sold on the Danish marked for treatment of opioid-induced constipation. This
      PAMORA have not previously been investigated in patients with pancreatitis. The dose regimes
      for this study will be according to label. It has previously been shown, in patients with
      opioid-induced obstipation and healthy subjects, that opioid antagonism incl. PAMORA
      treatment increases gut motility, relaxes gastrointestinal sphincters, increases the
      intestinal water content and improves the immune response, without affecting analgesia. The
      affinity of PAMORAs to the µ-opioid receptors is much stronger than opioid analgesics.
      Therefore, they as antagonists have the potential to counteract the harmful effects of
      opioids on the gut mucosa, bacterial translocation and inflammation despite the high levels
      of exogenous opioids present in patients with pancreatitis. PAMORAs do not cross the
      blood-brain barrier and consequently do not interfere with analgesia or other central effects
      of opioids.

      We hypothesize that treatment with the PAMORA methylnaltrexone will antagonize the harmful
      effects of opioids without reducing analgesia in patients with AP and hence reduce disease
      severity and improve clinical outcomes. If successful, this sub-study will for the first time
      document the effects of a targeted pharmacotherapy in AP with the potential benefit of
      improved patient outcomes.
