    
      This is a multicenter, open, non-randomized and dose-escalating and -expansion Phase I/II
      trial and it studies the tolerance, PK and efficacy of SHR2554 alone or in combination with
      SHR3680 in the treatment of patients with metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.
      The Phase I part is a dose-escalating study including Ia (dose-escalation monotherapy) and Ib
      (dose-escalation combination therapy). Approximately 18-30 patients in Phase Ia will only
      receive one of five dose levels of orally SHR2554. Approximately 30~48 patients in Phase Ib
      trial will receive SHR2554 combined with SHR3680, in which 2~3 different dose levels of
      SHR2554 will be selected based on the result of the Phase Ia. Phase II part is a
      dose-expansion study. Primary endpoints of the study are dose-limiting tolerance (DLT),
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate.
