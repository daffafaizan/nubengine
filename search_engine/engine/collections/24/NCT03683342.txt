    
      Patients scheduled for unilateral forefoot surgery, aged over 18 years old and ASA status
      I-III without any contra-indications for regional anesthesia will be enrolled.

      After a standard randomisation, patients will be allocated in either of two groups : ankle
      block or sciatic nerve block at the popliteal fossa. In both groups the patients will have a
      multimodal analgesic regimen followed by a patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) of morphine.

      The primary endpoint is the analgesic duration, defined by the time between the end of the
      block procedure and the first IV request of morphine from a PCA.
