      nasal only continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks in patients with sleep-disordered
      breathing. However, the physiological mechanism for this difference in efficacy is not known;
      although, it has been hypothesized to involve the retroglossal and/or retropalatal region of
      the upper airway. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in retroglossal
      and retropalatal anterior-posterior space with the use of oronasal vs. nasal CPAP masks using
      real-time cine magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI).
