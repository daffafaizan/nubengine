      eligibility in which volunteers after signing informed consent will have a medical history,
      physical examination, ECG, hematological and biochemical blood tests, Mini Mental State
      Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression scale (GDS-30) and body sway test.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive three doses Namisol® (3 mg or 5 mg or
      6,5 mg) and placebo in double-blind crossover design (visit 1 to 4). The wash-out period
      between visits will be at least 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 weeks. Each visit will be preceded
      by baseline assessment measures. The safety and tolerability profiles of Namisol® will be
      evaluated on each intervention visit by using a standardized THC adverse effects checklist
      and self-reporting, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, body sway, Visual Analogue Scales (subtest
      feeling high), and Test for Attentional Performance (TAP, subtest alertness) and a follow up
      phone call the following day. Four blood samples will be collected on each visit to determine
      the relationship between the pharmacodynamic effects (VAS-feeling high, TAP-alertness and
      body sway) and the plasma concentrations of THC and its active metabolites 11-OH-THC and
      THC-COOH. In addition, a blood sample will be only collected on the first intervention day
      for genotyping of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
