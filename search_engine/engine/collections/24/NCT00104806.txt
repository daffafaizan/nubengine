      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response rate and the rate of hematological improvement in
           patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with arsenic trioxide and
           cholecalciferol (vitamin D).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression to acute myeloid leukemia, defined as blast â‰¥ 20%, in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear
           cell apoptosis and p21 protein expression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D)* once daily on days 1-28. Patients also
      receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5 (week 1) and then twice weekly for 3
      weeks (weeks 2-4) for course 1 and twice weekly for 4 weeks for all subsequent courses.
      Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: * Patients who do not achieve a complete hematologic response receive escalating doses
      of cholecalciferol (vitamin D) at 3, 6, and 9 months during therapy in the absence of disease
      progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      At the completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
