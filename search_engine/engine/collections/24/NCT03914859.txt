      difficult to establish due to the lack of relevant exposure biomarkers for reporting
      multi-exposures.

      The main objective of this study is to highlight a relationship between exposure to PAHs,
      genotoxic effect biomarkers on spermatozoa and follicular cells, as well as embryonic quality
      and embryo implantation rates at a given time. IVF attempt. This study therefore analyzes the
      possibility of using this exposure biomarker as a reliable means of evaluating the quality of
      gametes in order to estimate the chances of success in IVF.

      Subsequently, the results of this study will make it possible to personalize and evaluate the
      effectiveness of the preventive measures put in place upstream of the MPA route by allowing
      To identify a relationship between PAH exposure and sperm DNA gamete quality in humans, serum
      AMH concentration and ovarian response to gonadotropic stimulation for IVF in women.

      To highlight a relationship between individual exposures to complex PAH mixtures and
      infertility.

      The methodology based, on the feminine side, on the analysis of follicular cells makes it
      possible to study cells close to female gametes within the cumulo-oocyte complex, without
      losing the chance of pregnancy for the couple.
