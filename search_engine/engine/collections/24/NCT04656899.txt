    
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial in Phase I is to determine whether the
      Pillsy intervention can improve adherence to buprenorphine-naloxone compared to Service As
      Usual.

      This will be a collaborative study between WSU, Pillsy, Inc, and the clinical site Ideal
      Options (opioid use and other substance use disorders treatment center). The overarching goal
      is to evaluate if the use of the Pillsy system will improve treatment adherence. The study
      coordinator will work closely with the clinical site, conducting a scripted screening, by
      phone or in person, documenting substance use, addiction treatment history, medical and
      psychiatric history, medication, addiction treatment goals, and availability of social
      support.

      The Pillsy device is a smart cap that tracks pill bottle openings and uses lighted reminders
      to prompt patients when to take their medication. The Pillsy Helper feature is a smartphone
      application that sends text and phone reminders as well as links to the participant named
      family and friend support networks. The Pillsy Helpers feature allows participants to name
      friends and family members who will also receive a text message notification 1 hour after a
      missed dose to reach out to offer support. In addition, the prescriber will be contacted when
      the patient has missed a dose, giving the prescriber the opportunity to intervene. Study
      participants will be randomized to one of two groups. The control group will receive the
      Pillsy cap alone. The active group will receive the Pillsy cap and smartphone application
      with associated benefits. To measure adherence, all participants will provide a urine sample
      at each study visit and complete a questionnaire (ex: AUDIT, Fagerstrom, Addiction Severity
      Index, Timeline Follow-Back) and survey that assesses their satisfaction with treatment.
