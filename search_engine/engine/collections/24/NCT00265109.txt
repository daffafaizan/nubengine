      facial "scarring"), is a relatively common disorder that causes marked distress and
      impairment in functioning. Recent data suggests that adults with BDD may respond to serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SRIs); however, response to SRIs is often only partial. About one third
      of patients do not respond to an SRI. Furthermore, patients may stop taking SRIs because of
      side effects (e.g., sexual side effects). For these reasons, additional monotherapy and SRI
      augmentation strategies are greatly needed.

      Levetiracetam is primarily used as an antiseizure medication and has a wider safety margin
      than other antiepileptics. Preliminary scientific studies may suggest that it may be helpful
      for certain psychiatric symptoms and disorders. In the present study we propose to obtain
      pilot data on 1) levetiracetam monotherapy and 2) levetiracetam augmentation of SRIs in
      patients with BDD.
