    
      The study is conducted in 2 parts: a randomized, blinded part in which subjects are assigned
      randomly (by chance) to LiRIS 400 mg or LiRIS placebo; subjects who complete this part and
      are eligible to continue, may participate in the open-label part in which all subjects
      receive LiRIS 400 mg.

      In both parts of the study (blinded and open-label), LiRIS is inserted into the bladder
      during cystoscopy, remains in the bladder for 14 days, and is removed during cystoscopy. In
      addition to the 14 day period with the LiRIS/LiRIS Placebo, there is a screening period of up
      to 2 weeks and a follow up period of 4 weeks.
