      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The risk of HBV reactivation is high when patients were
      treated with CHOP, especially in combination with rituximab. The aim of this study is to
      compare entecavir with lamivudine, 2 commonly used anti-virus agents, for preventing the risk
      of HBV reactivation in patients with NHL on CHOP/R-CHOP.
