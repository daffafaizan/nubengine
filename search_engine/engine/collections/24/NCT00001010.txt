      given over long time periods, and experiments in vitro (in the test tube) suggest that ACV
      may stimulate the action of AZT against HIV. It is necessary to obtain information on how
      these drugs perform in HIV-infected humans.

      The first 12 patients will take AZT capsules every 4 hours, and 6 of the patients will also
      take ACV 6 times a day. Later groups of patients will receive higher doses of AZT if the
      earlier doses are tolerated without significant adverse effect. It was initially planned to
      stop treatment after 12 weeks, but if the first 10 patients who have entered the study have
      tolerated treatment well, the duration of treatment will be extended with a crossover in
      dosage. The treatment may be lifelong, depending on the results obtained with regard to
      safety and effectiveness of the drugs. Blood and urine samples will be obtained periodically
      in order to estimate blood levels of the drugs, to study the excretion of the drugs, and to
      determine the effects of the drugs on HIV and on the immune system and medical condition of
      the patient.
