      EGRIFTA速 been studied in Type 2 diabetic HIV-infected subjects who are receiving oral
      hypoglycemic agents, GLP-1 analogues, or insulin. The present study will assess the potential
      of EGRIFTA速 to induce or exacerbate DR in HIV-infected subjects on antiretroviral therapy who
      have concomitant abdominal lipohypertrophy and T2DM, and explore the long-term effects of
      EGRIFTA速 on glycemic control and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in this
      population.
