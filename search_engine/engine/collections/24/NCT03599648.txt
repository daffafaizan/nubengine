      delay (DD). Approximately 50% of children with DD have a comorbid mental disorder or serious
      behavior problems- a prevalence three times as high as that found in typically developing
      youths. Behavioral parent training (BPT) is the gold-standard intervention for treating child
      behavior problems in typically developing children and in children with DD. However, high
      levels of parental stress are associated with reduced or no response to BPT for children with
      DD. Consequently, parental stress may attenuate the efficacy of the gold-standard,
      empirically supported treatment for behavior problems among children with DD. As such,
      parental stress is a critical point of intervention for improving both parent and child
      outcomes in families of children with DD. The purpose of this study is to quantify the
      therapeutic benefit of adding a parent stress-reduction intervention prior to delivering BPT
      in order to more effectively reduce child behavior problems, and to investigate the
      mechanisms through which intervention outcomes occur.
