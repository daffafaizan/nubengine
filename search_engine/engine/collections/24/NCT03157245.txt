      related to a high risk of venous thrombosis. Catheter is one of the most common complication
      of parenteral nutrition and is also related to thrombosis.

      The combination of theses conditions increases the risk of venous catheter thrombosis. ,
      Since, there is no data evaluating this risk nowadays, the objective of this study is to
      determine the incidence of thrombosis on central venous catheters in patients hospitalized in
      a surgical critical care unit, in the immediate postoperative period of urological or
      digestive carcinological surgery, and receiving parenteral nutrition.
