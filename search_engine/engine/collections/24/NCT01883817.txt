      long-chain omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or placebo on prefrontal cortical
      structural and functional connectivity using several neuroimaging techniques: DTI (Diffusion
      Tensor Imaging), 1H MRS(Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy), and fMRI (Functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in psychostimulant-free children with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is postulated that DHA supplements will increase brain
      activation and reduce ADHD symptomatology.
