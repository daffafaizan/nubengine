        -  Assess disease free survival in patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis treated with a
           preparative busulfan/cyclophosphamide regimen followed by allogeneic bone marrow or
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the risk of primary graft failure in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a preparative regimen consisting of oral busulfan every 6 hours on
      days -7 through -4 and cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2. Patients then receive allogeneic
      bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Patients registered on protocol
      FHCRC-1106.00 randomized to stem cell transplant receive unmodified G-CSF-mobilized stem
      cells from an HLA-identical donor.

      Patients receive cyclosporine/methotrexate or tacrolimus/methotrexate as prophylaxis for
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Patients receiving marrow from unrelated donors are
      eligible for appropriate GVHD prophylaxis studies.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months after transplant.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study over approximately
      3.5 years.
