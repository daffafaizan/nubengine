      16-week treatment period. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria for provisional
      enrollment received the study drug for the screening period (solifenacin) at the same dose as
      that before the start of the study (2.5 or 5 mg), once daily after breakfast orally for 2
      weeks. After the screening period, patients meeting the eligibility criteria for formal
      enrollment received the study drugs for the treatment period (solifenacin 2.5 or 5 mg and
      mirabegron 25 mg), once daily after breakfast orally for 16 weeks. Mirabegron dose could be
      increased to 50 mg at week 8 visit if the patients met all of the following criteria: (1) had
      an inadequate response to mirabegron at the dose of 25 mg; (2) was judged by the investigator
      or coinvestigator to have no safety concerns; and (3) agreed to increase the dose.
