      cancer genetics (oncotrees, METREX). The purpose of this protocol is to allow us to work on
      software problems reports that may contain human subjects data in them. The data should be
      coded, by which we mean that if there are any links between identifiers and names, we do not
      possess the links to decode the names. Occasionally our assistance leads to a more formal
      research collaboration. This protocol seeks to clarify the guidelines under which we can
      provide assistance to users of our human genetics software and to establish a formal
      procedure under which we can seek IRB approval for the serendipitous collaborations that
      arise from providing that assistance. We cannot predict the sizes of samples or the diseases
      studied in the data sets sent to us, so most of the medical aspects of this protocol are
      necessarily general. We rely on the data being coded and the collectors of the data having
      their own institutional approvals to protect against most risks. The scientific aspects of
      investigating problem reports cannot be hypothesis driven because we cannot guess what
      problems will arise. On the engineering side, the basic hypotheses are that: 1) our software
      is likely to contain some bugs or other weaknesses, which cannot be easily found except by
      having others use the software and 2) a good way to improve the functionality of the software
      is to encourage users to submit problem reports and other suggestions.

      This protocol has been in effect since early 2002. The only amendments during that time were
      to set up three collaborations, as described in Sections 4.6 and 4.7 and 4.8. The protocol
      has been quite useful and no changes are proposed in procedures.
