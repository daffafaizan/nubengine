    
      The HIV intramural research program of NIAID conducts clinical investigations to increase our

      knowledge of the biology, pathogenesis and immunology of HIV infection and vaccine

      development. After all study-related interventions, follow-up, and primary specimen and data

      analyses are complete for an IRB-approved protocol, some human specimens may remain in

      storage, and data may continue to be analyzed to meet secondary and exploratory objectives.
      This protocol will allow for additional laboratory and data analyses to be continued to
      complete the analyses described under closed NIAID protocol #14-I-0011, Phase 1 Study of
      Safety and Immunogenicity of Ad4-HIV Vaccine Vectors in Healthy Volunteers.
