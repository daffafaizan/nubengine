    
      Boston Scientific is developing the present PROENCY registry to collect real world data with
      the Promus™ Stent and to compare outcomes to the Cypher™ and Endeavor™ stents.

      All three stents have received CE Mark and are commonly used in Europe. All the data
      collected in this registry will be from patients treated according to the physician's
      choices, per Product Directions/Instructions for Use, per approved indications and per local
      standard of care.

      The results from this registry will provide an understanding of the use and outcomes
      associated with the Promus™, the Endeavor™ and the Cypher™ stent systems in a real world
      setting.
