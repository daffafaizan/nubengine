      (KMC) is one of the nonpharmacological methods that are effective in alleviating pain. The
      aim of this randomized controlled study determine the effect of KMC on pain in infants during
      vaccination. The study subjects were 128 healthy, 1-month-old infants and their mothers. A
      sociodemographic questionnaire, the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), a pulse oximeter, and
      a chronometer were used in collecting the data. This study indicate that KMC reduced crying
      duration, heart rate, and pain in vaccinated infants, whereas it increased oxygen saturation
      levels in the blood.
