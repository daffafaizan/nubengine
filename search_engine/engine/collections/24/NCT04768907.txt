    
      Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) is a serious and life-threatening disease that arises
      as a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). At the
      onset of aGvHD, skin is the most frequently affected region (80% of patients) while GI tract
      or liver are involved in about 50% of patients (Martin 1990). aGvHD symptoms for the lower GI
      tract include watery diarrhea (â‰¥500 mL), severe abdominal pain or bloody diarrhea (Ferrara
      2009). While the incidence of severe GI-aGvHD has slightly decreased during the past decade,
      treatment remains unsuccessful in most cases (Gooley 2010, Castilla Llorente 2014), with a
      2-months overall survival (OS) rate of 22% in steroid non-responsive or steroid refractory
      (SR) patients, non-responders to ruxolitinib (Jagasia 2020).

      MaaT013 (pooled allogeneic fecal microbiota) is a live biotherapeutic product being developed
      by MaaT Pharma (Lyon, France) for the treatment of steroid-resistant, gastrointestinal aGvHD
      (SR-GI-aGvHD) adult patients with refractory, not eligible or who have failed second-line
      systemic therapy.

      MaaT013 is still in clinical development phase and is not approved yet for marketing in any
      region. During the development program, MaaT Pharma has undertaken initial development with
      closely related product candidates, leading to the Phase II HERACLES study in which MaaT013
      preliminary safety and efficacy were assessed in the context of SR-GI-aGvHD. In addition, a
      pivotal Phase III study (ARES trial) is planned
