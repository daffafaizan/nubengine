      majority of the Belgian population doesn't reach the recommended amount and intensity of
      physical activity to profit from these health benefits. A physical activity counselor can
      possibly play a crucial role for these physically inactive individuals. He/she can design an
      individualized exercise program to stimulate the person to become lifelong physical active.
      Research has shown that exercise promotion at work can result in a lower absenteeism,
      prevention of burn-out and a positive corporate identity.
