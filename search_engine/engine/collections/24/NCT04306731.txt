      urology and to test its effects against lower urinary tract infections (UTI) in females.
      Urinary tract infection (UTI ) is the second most common bacterial infection, affecting women
      at a much higher frequency than men. There is a higher rate of recurrence of UTI, and a
      recurrent infection will follow 25-35% of initial UTI episodes within 3-6 months.

      Intermittent or prolonged low dose antibiotic therapy has been used to treat and prevent
      recurrent UTI. Emerging of resistance to antimicrobial agents, enormous economic burden, and
      the side effects of antibiotics have led to the search for an alternative non-antibiotic
      prophylaxis of recurrent UTI. Nanotechnology structured water is a new type of drinking water
      that has been prepared using different types of energy fields and electromagnetic fields to
      produce this structured water, which has new and different characteristics from the ordinary
      water.

      In the current study, the efficacy of nanotechnology structured water magnalife was compared
      with low-dose Trimethoprim and bottled drinking water for the prevention of recurrent UTI.
