      provide feedback to the user. The use of mass-market sensors such as accelerometers offers a
      promising solution for the general public due to the growing smartphone market over the last
      decade.

      Thus, the proposed EE estimation function has been created using accelerometry data collected
      from 10 volunteers equipped with a smartphone and two research sensors (Armband and
      Actiheart) used to estimate EE during several controlled activities. The research sensors'
      data serves as reference during the creation and evaluation of the proposed function.

      It has been evaluated with data of 6 other volunteers in free-living conditions. This new EE
      function using the smartphone technology is dedicated to light- and moderate-intensity
      activities, and we believe it can be a new way to help people controlling their daily
      physical activity level.
