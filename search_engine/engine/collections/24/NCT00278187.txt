      Primary

        -  Evaluate the response rate in patients with locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic
           (stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer treated with volociximab and erlotinib
           hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the time to disease progression and duration of response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the safety of this drug regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive volociximab IV over 30 minutes once every 2 weeks and oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride daily for 52 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
