      current stimulation, or tvDCS. It currently is not clear what effects this type of
      stimulation has on the excitability of the brain and spinal cord in people with spinal cord
      injury. In this study, subjects will participate in 3 sessions, with at least 1 week in
      between sessions, during which they will get a different condition of tvDCS. We will test the
      excitability of the brain and spinal cord before and after tvDCS in each session.
