      attention, memory, executive functions, and mental processing speed. Although data have
      demonstrated improvements in cognition following kidney transplant and the reversibility of
      the memory problems evidenced in dialysis, neurotoxicity in transplant patients occurs in
      >40-50% of the patients treated with tacrolimus. Attention and working memory impairment have
      been observed in patients treated with sirolimus or tacrolimus, while cyclosporine-treated
      patients demonstrated performance similar to that of healthy volunteer controls, which may
      indicate that the cognitive deficit found was partly related to treatment. ENVARSUS XR is a
      new FDA-approved formulation of tacrolimus. A hallmark difference between ENVARSUS XR and
      other forms of once- and twice-daily tacrolimus products is the unique, proprietary MeltDose®
      drug delivery technology (Veloxis Pharmaceuticals, Hørsholm, Denmark) which reduces
      tacrolimus' particle size to a molecular level. The decreased surface area of the drug
      particles results in complete absorption and increased bioavailability in a once-daily dosing
      formulation. In stable kidney transplant patients, ENVARSUS XR pharmacokinetics are
      characterized by a steadier and more consistent concentration time profile over 24 hours,
      reduced peak and peak-to-trough fluctuations and similar exposure while benefiting from ~ 20%
      less total daily dose than twice daily tacrolimus. This open-label, prospective phase
      clinical trial is designed to evaluate whether switching patients from TAC-IR to ENVARSUS XR
      treatment improves cognitive function.
