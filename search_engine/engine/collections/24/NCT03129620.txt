      remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period. In response to
      an anoxic insult, perfusion to vital organs is preserved; however, when this injury is
      profound concomitant injury to nonvital organs is observed. Controlled hypothermia (CH) has
      been accepted as a neuroprotective therapeutic modality for neonates with moderate to severe
      HIE because of its role in attenuating secondary brain injury. Neonates exhibit varying
      degrees of multiorgan dysfunction after a hypoxic-ischemic insult, although the added
      beneficial and potential adverse effects that CH has in these babies have not been completely
      delineated or understood.

      CH has been shown to alter normal physiologic functioning of several organ systems. Specific
      physiologic changes as a consequence of CH have been demonstrated in both animal and human
      models. The observed reduction in cardiac output and reflexive increase in systemic vascular
      resistance in response to CH alter renal perfusion and subsequently reduce glomerular
      filtration . Drugs that are renally cleared may develop a prolonged half-life in this
      setting. Finally, drug metabolism may further be affected by altered hepatic blood flow and
      temperature-dependent effects on hepatic enzyme activity . Collectively, the potential
      effects of CH on drug metabolism and clearance are significant warranting further
      investigation. The investigator aims to evaluate the combined effects of hypoxia and
      hypothermia on ampicillin clearance and excretion
