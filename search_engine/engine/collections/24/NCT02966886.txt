    
      Patients who have 10-15 degrees of retroversion will be randomly assigned to one of two
      standard of care treatment groups: TSA with eccentric glenoid reaming or TSA with augmented
      glenoid component implantation.

      Patients whose condition involves > 15 degrees of retroversion will be randomly assigned to
      one of two standard of care treatment groups: TSA with augmented glenoid component
      implantation or posterior glenoid bone grafting.

      The primary objective will be measured by the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder
      Index (WOOS) score pre-operatively and at post-operative time intervals (i.e. 3, 6, 12 and 24
      months).

      Secondary Objectives: i) To determine the survivorship of the components as measured by the
      degree of radiographic lucencies and component alignment determined by a CT scan at 1 and 5
      years post-surgery between study arms in both age groups.

      ii) To determine the difference in disease specific quality of life between treatment
      allocations in both age groups as measured by the Constant score, the American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment form (ASES) and the EuroQol Group EQ-5D-5L
      score pre-operatively and at post-operative time intervals (i.e. 3, 6, 12 and 24 months), as
      well as adverse events, and health care utilization.
