      Common symptoms among depressed men include feelings of hopelessness and helplessness,
      irritability, and anger. MSM are among those at highest for HIV acquisition due to high-risk
      behaviors, including unprotected sexual intercourse and drug abuse. Bupropion is an
      antidepressant medication commonly used to treat depression. The purpose of this study thus
      was whether bupropion could help MSM with mild-to-moderate depression reduce their high-risk
      behaviors.

      Participants in this trial were randomly assigned to receive either bupropion or placebo for
      6 months. Study visits lasting approximately 2 hours each occurred at Day 0, and at Months 4,
      6, and 9; included in these visits were physical examination, testing for HIV and sexually
      transmitted disease (STD), depression screening, and an interview-administered questionnaire
      inquiring into sexual activity and drug use. Shorter study visits, lasting 15 - 30 minutes
      each occurred at Day 15, and Months 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, and included depression screening and
      physical exam.
