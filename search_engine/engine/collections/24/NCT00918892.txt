        -  To determine if candidate genes display differential expression between normal and
           cancer breast tissues.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected breast cancer tissue samples (paraffin embedded blocks) and
      normal adjacent tissue are used for immunohistochemistry studies of expression of candidate
      genes.
