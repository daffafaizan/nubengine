    
      Primary Objective(s)

        1. Evaluate performance of the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) (EPI) to reduce the number of
           initial prostate biopsies by greater than or equal to 15% for men with an elevated
           Prostate-Specific Antigen 2-10ng/mL presenting for a biopsy in consultation with their
           urologist.

        2. Compare performance of both the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) 15.6 and 20 cut-points with
           respect to the biopsy decision process.

        3. Assess physician satisfaction with the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) report including
           test result presentation, graphics and interpretation.

        4. Assess urologist / patient satisfaction for ease of understanding test results and role
           on biopsy decision process.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Determine the medical economic impact of the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) test in the
           prostate biopsy decision process.

        2. Correlation of the ExoDx Prostate(IntelliScore) score with the actual biopsy result by
           utilizing the Receiver Operating Characteristic of the Area Under Curve for
           discriminating high-grade (greater than or equal to Gleason Score 7, International
           Society of Urological Pathology 2 and 3) from low-grade (Gleason Score 6, International
           Society of Urological Pathology 1) and benign disease on initial prostate needle biopsy.
