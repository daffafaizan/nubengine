    
      THX-110 is an investigational drug and is being developed for the treatment of patients with
      Tourette syndrome and other conditions. THX-110 consists of an active substance from cannabis
      (dronabinol, tetrahydrocannabinol, THC) and PEA, a substance that occurs naturally in the
      human body, in animals and plants.

      Dronabinol and similar active substances are already approved in some countries for the
      treatment of other conditions. In some countries, various cannabis-based medications are
      currently being used in the treatment of patients with Tourette syndrome, mostly without
      official approval.

      PEA has already been used and well tolerated in numerous clinical trials. The combination of
      PEA and dronabinol is assumed to show better efficacy compared to treatment with dronabinol
      alone.

      The planned study will evaluate the efficacy of THX-110 in the management of tics and other
      symptoms in patients with Tourette syndrome. Other objectives are to assess study drug dosage
      and to identify side effects that may be associated with the study drug.

      In the first part of the study, half of the patients will receive THX-110, while the other
      half will receive a placebo. The treatment phase will last 12 weeks. After completion of the
      first part, patients can decide if they want to participate in the second part of the study.
      In this optional second part of the study, all patients will receive THX-110 for 12 weeks.
