      receive painful shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Data in
      post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients and ICD patients suggest that amiodarone is
      mortality-neutral; it neither confers increased nor decreased mortality. However, these data
      are derived from patients largely with normal intraventricular conduction, manifesting as a
      QRS complex duration on the surface ECG <120 ms. Amiodarone, in addition to potassium-channel
      blocking effects, is a sodium channel-blocker. Because sodium channels mediate cardiac
      depolarization, and a QRS complex >120 ms is indicative of abnormal depolarization,
      amiodarone may not be benign in patients with such conduction defects. Patients with cardiac
      resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-D), who all have abnormal baseline
      intraventricular conduction, may therefore be adversely affected by amiodarone. Anecdotal
      clinical data suggest that this may be the case, but the question of amiodarone's cardiac
      safety profile in CRT patients has never been studied.
