      high dose chemotherapy with autologous or syngeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation in patients with stage IV breast cancer. II. Assess the overall survival of
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients begin study treatment within 50-150 days after autologous or syngeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Patients are stratified according to
      overexpression of HER2-Neu (yes vs no), which determines the type of therapy. Arm I
      (overexpression of HER2-Neu): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes followed by the
      initial loading dose of trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes. If the loading dose is tolerated
      well, then patients receive maintenance trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment with
      paclitaxel followed by maintenance trastuzumab repeats once every week for 12 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II (no overexpression of
      Her2-Neu): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes once every week for 12 weeks.
      Patients with hormone receptor positive disease also receive antihormonal therapy (tamoxifen
      or anastrozole) as clinically indicated. Patients with isolated metastasis such as a single
      bone lesion may receive radiotherapy to that site after completion of study treatment.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study over
      2-3 years.
