      intravascular hypothermia as part of the early hospital management and treatment for acute
      cervical SCI. Each year in the US, there are over 11,000 new cases of para- and quadriplegia
      and 100,000 new cases of partial but permanent neurological losses due to acute SCI. Thus the
      potential for clinical hypothermia following SCI to improve neurological outcome has
      significant value. Many patients suffering SCI become permanently dependent on caretakers and
      become a financial liability to both the family and society. Hypothermia has the potential to
      improve outcome so that more patients suffering SCI can regain independent motor and sensory
      function and remain economically productive members of society. The use of modest hypothermia
      through intravascular cooling may ultimately lead to better care of the patient with acute
      SCI and may also have more widespread uses in patients presenting with stroke or cardiac
      arrest. In the long-term, this research may lend support to the use of hypothermia that could
      in turn save money for the patients, hospitals, the government and society as a whole.
