      and week 8 for Chinese medicine practitioner (CMP) investigators assessments. The Western
      Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) and EQ-5D-5L will be assessed
      and filled up at different timepoints. The treatment group will receive both Tui-na and study
      medication and the wait-list control group will receive Tui-na alone. CMPs will provide
      consultation under Chinese medicine theory. Study medication compliance and adverse events
      will also be assessed at each visit.
