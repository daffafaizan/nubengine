      response) to arzoxifene hydrochloride in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial
      cancer. II. Determine the time to progressive disease, time to treatment failure, response
      duration, and survival in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer receiving
      arzoxifene hydrochloride. III. Assess the safety of this treatment in these patients. IV.
      Measure changes in serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and
      sex hormone binding globulin during this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral arzoxifene hydrochloride daily at a fixed dose. Treatment
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
