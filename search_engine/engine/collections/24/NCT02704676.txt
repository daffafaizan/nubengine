      maternal decidua, the perinatal dynamics of maternal serum CA-125 requires clarification.
      Clinical studies of CA-125 levels and its function in hypertensive pregnant patients are
      limited and offered contradictory results (Cebesoy et al., 2009).

      And so we investigate CA-125 in normal pregnancy and in pre-eclampsia, comparing mild and
      sever pre-eclampsia to determine relationship of CA-125 and severity of the disease.

      Patients will be divided in three groups:

        -  Control: 40 normal healthy pregnant women attending the ER in labor.

        -  Mild pre-eclampsia: 40 patients fulfilling the following criteria.

             -  Blood pressure: systolic blood pressure >140 and <160 , Diastolic blood pressure
                >90 and <110

             -  Proteinuria: 300 mg (+) assessed by urine urignost 3AÂ® (urine strips from DIALAB).

             -  No symptoms of severity as headache.

             -  Normal investigations for different organ function (as liver and kidney function).

        -  Severe pre-eclampsia :40 patients fulfilling anyone or more of the following criteria
           (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2010)(ACOG):

             -  Systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg

             -  Diastolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg (on two occasions at least 6 hours apart while
                the patient is on bed rest)

             -  Proteinuria of 5000mg (5g) or higher on a 24-hour urine collection or at least 3+
                on two random urine samples collected at least 4 hours apart

             -  Oliguria < 500 mL urine output in 24 hours

             -  Cerebral or visual functional disturbances (cns irritability)

             -  Pulmonary edema or cyanosis (not due to excessive intravenous volume replacement)

             -  Epigastric or right-upper quadrant abdominal pain

             -  Impaired liver function on laboratory analysis (elevated aspartate aminotransferase
                (AST), alanine amino transferase(ALT), or lactate dehydrogenase(LDH))

             -  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/uL)

             -  Fetal growth restriction.
