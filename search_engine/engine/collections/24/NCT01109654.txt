      decade for the use in ART. The potential advantages of GnRH antagonists over the GnRH
      agonists include the avoidance of an acute stimulation of endogenous gonadotrophins and a
      dramatic reduction in the length of analogue treatment.

      Despite the plus points of GnRH antagonists in ART, there has been some concern over the
      lower pregnancy rate reported, which may be the cause of a lower acceptance of GnRH
      antagonists in ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Interestingly, a
      separate meta-analysis did not reach the same finding. The probability of live birth after
      ovarian stimulation for IVF was found not to be dependent on the type of analogue used for
      pituitary suppression Cetrotide, a GnRH antagonist from Merck Serono, is currently approved
      for the inhibition of premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges in women undergoing
      controlled ovarian stimulation in majority of the regions. It is given either as a
      single-dose regimen of 3 mg injection or as a multiple-dose regimen of 0.25 mg daily
      injection. Both regimens have been shown to offer equivalent efficacy and safety outcomes.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objective:

        -  To assess the effectiveness of Cetrotide regimens, when used with Gonal-f, in routine
           ART treatment cycles

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the effectiveness of Cetrotide regimens on other efficacy endpoints

        -  To survey the types of Cetrotide regimen used and their success rates

        -  To assess the safety of Cetrotide regimens

        -  To explore the association between subject characteristics and treatment outcomes
