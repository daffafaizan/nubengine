    
      * Methods: Compare TIMI frame count, coronary clearance frame count in baseline/hyperemic
      coronary angiography with FFR, CFR, IMR and derive correlation, receiver-operating
      characteristic curve to find new tools estimating coronary hemodynamics by conventional
      angiography only.

      A TIMI frame count is measured by counting the angiographic image cine frames during a head
      of radiocontrast column runs from the entry of left anterior descending artery (LAD) to the
      distal end.

      A coronary clearance frame count is measured by counting the angiographic image cine frames
      during a tail of radiocontrast column runs from the entry of LAD to the distal end.

      Baseline angiography is performed without any stimulation and hyperemic angiography is
      performed after intracoronary injection of adenosine 300ug or nicorandiol 2mg.
