      (PPI) treatment will receive a maximal therapy consisting of 2 x 40 mg of PPI before the
      meals (morning and evening) and a H2 blocker before bedtime (standard practice). They will be
      reevaluated endoscopically and clinically 2 months later (standard practice). If reflux
      persists, objectivized by impedancemetry (standard practice), they will be asked to
      participate in this study.

      Lanreotide autogel 120 mg deep subcutaneously every 4 weeks will be added to the treatment. A
      total of 3 injections per patient have been foreseen in this proof of concept study.

      Patients will be reevaluated clinically after 2, 4 and 8 weeks. At the end of the study a new
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and impedancemetry will be performed.
