    
      Due to anti-arrhythmic pharmacological drugs failure to suppress atrial fibrillation (AF),
      interest towards preventive pacing treatments is increasing. The importance of this option in
      the panoply of the preventive tools is fully justified, only by considering the
      insufficiency, the complexity, or the poor reproducibility of the other non-pharmaceutical
      approaches.

      Preventive pacing therapies rely on their potential effect on different onset modalities
      emphasized by previous studies, and more generally by stabilizing atrial tissue when
      potential triggers are appearing.

      On top of that, cardiac stimulator can deliver these therapies when identifying these
      triggers but also can offer incomparable diagnostic tools, in terms of sensitivity,
      specificity and continuity in the monitoring.

      Four preventive pacing therapies have already been evaluated, the objective of this study is
      to show the clinical benefit brought by the new features of the Selection 9000 / Vitatron T70
      DR.
