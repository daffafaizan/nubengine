      20 patients will be tested in this trail.

      Consecutive patients that have senile cataract will be examined preoperatively as is done
      usually and the data of the examination will be collected/ a special attention will be given
      to the type of cataract and lens stability.

      Systemic diseases will not be considered as exclusion criteria.

      Patients with dens or mature cataract will be excluded.

      Patients will be explained about the new device and those who will agree will sign a consent
      form.

      During the cataract surgery all steps will be done as usually except of the capsulorhexis
      which will be done by using the new device.

      The capsulorhexis will be photographed for further evaluation by a microscope camera.

      After the operation the surgeon will record his impression about the convenience of using the
      new device, the shape and form of the capsulorhexis and its stability and any other relevant
      information.

      Post operative follow up will be done as usually, one day, one week, 3 weeks and six weeks
      after operation. The results of those examinations will be recorded and collected with
      special attention of IOL stability, the shape of capsulorhexis and intra ocular post
      operative inflammation if will occur.

      The data, including the surgeons' comments, shape and form of capsulorhexis IOL stability and
      the rest will be collected and processed.

      In case in which the use of the device will not perform a round and regular capsulorhexis, or
      instability of the capsule will occur or a un predicted intraocular inflammation will be seen
      the trail will be stopped immediately
