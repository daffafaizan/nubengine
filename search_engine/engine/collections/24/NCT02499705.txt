      to determine environmental mechanisms that contribute to variation in taste sensitivity.
      Significant controversy surrounds the possibility that consumption of artificial sweeteners
      (AFS) leads to weight gain. Given that the five FDA approved AFSs are found in thousands of
      foods (Yang 2010) this marks a clear and significant gap in knowledge. Our preliminary data
      demonstrate a 3-fold decrease in sweet taste sensitivity following consumption of a beverage
      sweetened with two packets of Splenda for just 10 days. These data provide strong evidence
      that repeated exposure to sucralose reduces perception of sweet taste intensity, most likely
      by down-regulation of the sweet taste receptor. Adolescents may be more sensitive to exposure
      to AFS because of changes in metabolism during this period of development. Physiologic
      insulin resistance occurs during adolescence (Moran, Jacobs et al. 1999); this change in
      insulin sensitivity may predispose adolescents to greater impairments in sweet taste
      intensity by altering the relationship between sweet taste and post-ingestive reward, as
      suggested by the Davidson and Swithers model (Davidson and Swithers 2004). Therefore, it is
      imperative that we gain a greater understanding of the physiological consequences of AFS use
      in adolescents, since alterations in sweet taste perception, metabolism and brain reward that
      occur in response to AFS exposure may promote weight gain.
