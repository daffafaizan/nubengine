        1. To test the feasibility of the DASH Cloud intervention compared to education control
           among women with prehypertension and hypertension via a 3-month randomized controlled
           trial.

        2. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the DASH Cloud intervention relative to
           education control on blood pressure, weight and medication adherence at 3 months.

      This study will enroll 50 adult women aged 21-70 with pre-hypertension or hypertension in a
      3-month randomized controlled trial to test the initial feasibility of DASH Cloud. Women will
      be randomized to either the DASH Cloud intervention or DASH Light and followed up 3 months
      post randomization. The investigators will recruit participants from the Durham, NC area.

      Women randomized to the DASH Cloud intervention will be asked to track their diet daily using
      a smartphone diet tracking app. Based on the foods/beverages entered, the intervention will
      send daily or weekly text messages with feedback about DASH adherence and information videos
      about how to follow DASH. Women randomized to DASH Light will also be asked to track their
      diet using the smartphone diet tracking app and will receive basic informational materials
      about DASH.
