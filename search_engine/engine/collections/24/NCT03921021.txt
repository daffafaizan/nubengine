    
      This is a phase II study of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab in advanced gastric and
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has progressed on at least 2 lines of prior
      therapy for advanced disease. Pembrolizumab has recently received FDA approval for PD-L1
      positive gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma based on the Keynote-059 study. The efficacy of
      pembrolizumab monotherapy is modest in PD-L1 positive patients (defined as a combined
      positive score, CPS, of > 1), with only a ~15% overall response rate. This study will examine
      the addition of the oncolytic virus, OBP-301, administered prior to pembrolizumab in this
      patient population. Patients will be enrolled in a two-stage design, with 18 patients in the
      first stage. All patients will receive OBP-301 at 1x1012 viral particles (VP)/ tumor
      injection administered every two weeks x 4 injections as well as standard dose pembrolizumab
      200 mg IV every 3 weeks. The tumor will be injected with OBP-301 four times (d1, d15, d29,
      d43). The preference is to inject the primary tumor endoscopically. Metastatic lesions may be
      injected on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the PI (Shah). All patients treated
      with OBP-301 will be eligible for the safety cohort. 41 subjects will be recruited in total
      for both stage 1 and 2, to achieve 37 evaluable patients.

      The primary endpoint is to examine the efficacy of OBP-301 with pembrolizumab in PD-L1
      positive advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in the 3rd or 4th line
      setting, as assessed by the RECIST response rate and to to examine the safety of multiple
      OBP-301 intratumoral injections in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
