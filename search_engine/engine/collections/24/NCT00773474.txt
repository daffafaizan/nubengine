    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study

      Patients will be treated with lonafarnib 200 mg PO BID daily on days 1-21 of every 21-day
      cycle until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator's discretion.

      1 Cycle = 21 days of lonafarnib (plus the time required to recover from toxicity if
      encountered).
