    
      This is a randomized single-blinded controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups. One is the traditional acupuncture treatment group, one is the
      non-traditional acupuncture treatment group and the other is an acupuncture-like placebo
      treatment. Patients will be put into groups and then compared. The chance of getting into
      each group is 1:1:1, i.e. equal chance.
