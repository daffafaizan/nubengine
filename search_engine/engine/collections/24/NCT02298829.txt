      their previous long-term follow-up assessment. Blood samples for the determination of
      antibodies to AUX-I and AUX-II and neutralizing antibodies to AUX-I and AUX-II will be
      collected at each long-term follow-up visit.

      At each long-term follow-up visit, a flaccid penile examination will be performed and a
      curvature deformity measurement (with the penis in the erect state) will be recorded.
      Subjects will also be asked to complete the Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) and the
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. At each visit, medical,
      surgical, or other treatments for Peyronie's disease since the last assessment will also be
      collected and recorded.
