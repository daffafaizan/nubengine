      treatment: 1) independent single-agent activity, 2) enhanced localization of Doxil is
      possible tumoral interstitial pressure via increased half-life (if liposomal egress is
      diminished) and decreased [42], 3) improved Doxil distribution, and 4) likely favorable
      toxicity profile since Doxil's only common problematic toxicity is to the skin
      (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or PPE). Lenalidomide has also antiangiogenic properties,
      with a different mechanism of action than Avastin. Given the preliminary results of the
      effect of the combination of Doxil with Avastin, showing an increase in progression-free
      survival, we are interested in using a new thalidomide analog to maximize the angiogenic
      inhibition. This study will test the feasibility of combining all 3 drugs, and gather
      preliminary data on the potential activity of the combination in patients with platinum
      resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
