    
      Persisting ventilatory failure associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome, sleep apnoea or neuromuscular disease is increasingly
      managed with domiciliary non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

      Optimal settings of non-invasive ventilation are usually titrated manually and require time
      and expertise. The development of systems lead to automated analysis and development of
      algorithms to adjust ventilators. However, there is a paucity of optimal algorithms,
      particularly the problem of upper airway obstruction. Therefore, the central aim of this
      study is to develop the automated setting of an end-expiratory positive airway pressure
      (EPAP), because upper airway obstruction is relatively common in this group of patients. We
      hypothesise that an automated end-expiratory airway pressure (AutoEEP) adjusting algorithm
      could overcome these problems and further optimise and adjust ventilator settings. Using
      non-invasive ventilation in patients with hypercapnic ventilatory failure, awake and asleep,
      we will measure physiological outcome parameters and apply an AutoEEP algorithm, comparing it
      against usual care.
