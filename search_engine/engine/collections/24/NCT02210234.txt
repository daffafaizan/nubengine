      mouth on the University of Florida campus and in the surrounding area, in May of 2010.
      Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups, to consume either
      50 grams or 100 grams of whole wheat bran cereal daily, for three weeks. Blood was drawn from
      fasting subjects before consumption (baseline) and after three weeks of cereal consumption.
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and cultured with a broad based
      mitogen and autologous serum for 10 days. PBMC were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated
      antibodies on Day 0 and Day 10 of culture, at each blood draw. Data was acquired by flow
      cytometry and analyzed. Overall compliance was assessed using self-reported data and by
      counting left-over bags of cereal.
