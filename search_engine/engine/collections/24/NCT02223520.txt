    
      The TREAT PARENTS Trial, or Treating Parents to Reduce NICU Transmission of S. aureus, is a
      placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that
      treatment of S. aureus colonized parents with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine
      gluconate antisepsis will decrease neonatal S. aureus acquisition. All neonates admitted to
      the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center NICUs will be
      pre-screened and parents will be approached for enrollment in the study. After consent and
      baseline screening, 400 neonate-parent pairs will be randomized; only neonates who have a
      parent colonized with S. aureus will be randomized. Parents will receive a 5 day treatment
      with intranasal mupirocin plus topical chlorhexidine gluconate antisepsis or placebo.

      After recruitment and informed consent, parents will undergo pre-randomization screening. If
      both parents screen negative for S. aureus colonization, the neonate will be ineligible for
      the randomization and parents will be informed that the parents are not colonized at that
      time with S. aureus. If either parent screens positive for S. aureus, then both parents as a
      pair will be eligible for randomization to one of the two possible masked treatment arms. The
      neonate-parent "pair" will be the unit of randomization and each parent will be allocated to
      the same group if both consent.

      After the baseline neonate testing for S. aureus colonization, repeat testing will be
      performed every 7 days for the neonates until the neonate acquires S. aureus colonization or
      is discharged from the NICU.
