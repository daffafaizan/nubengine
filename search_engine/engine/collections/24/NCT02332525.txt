      of elderly people with mild cognitive impairment

      ◇ Test design: Open-labeled, prospective, pre-post study

      ○ Oral vibratory stimulus: As an optimal algorithm drawn through the first year study, the
      vibratory stimulus is applied 10 times for 15 days (a 5-minute stimulus is applied two times
      a day for 10 days, and it is composed of repeated 15-second vibratory and 15-second
      non-vibratory stimulus with a strength of 3.3V).
