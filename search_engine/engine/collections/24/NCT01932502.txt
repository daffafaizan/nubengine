    
      The study is designed to answer frequently asked questions when clinicians replace existing
      1,4-benzodiazepine to Onfi, as follows:

        1. What should be the optimal equivalent doses for conversion?

        2. How quickly should it be converted?

        3. Would there be significant improvement of seizure control?

        4. Should we expect difference in tolerability? If so, what are common adverse events?

        5. Would the tolerance to the therapeutic effect differ with Onfi after conversion?
