      patch records oxygen saturation using an FDA cleared pulse oximeter, Nonin 3150 WristOx2Â®
      with Bluetooth Low Energy. We have developed advanced signal processing algorithms to detect
      apneas and hypopneas. Many of these techniques for analyzing breathing sounds and detecting
      apneas and hypopneas have been published in peer-reviewed journals.

      The goal of this study is to validate the patch against polysomnography (PSG) for use as an
      aid in the diagnosis of sleep apnea for adult patients. Our primary objective is to assess
      whether the estimated apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) calculated by the patch agrees with the
      results of an in-laboratory PSG.
