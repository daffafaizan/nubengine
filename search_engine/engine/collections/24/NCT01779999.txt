      of the whole upper limbs venous district, axillary, subclavian and jugular veins for
      detecting possible pre-existing thrombosis; positioning is performed with real-time
      ultrasonography guide with a portable device. Patients are recontrolled one week after
      positioning; patients who report pain, swelling, fever, skin colour changes, exit site
      tenderness, or any symptom suspected for thrombosis or infection, are immediately seen. A
      duplex ultrasound complete examination of the upper limb and neck vessels is performed, and
      at the same time the whole arm and the exit site is inspected to exclude infections;
      diagnostic criteria for DVT include incompressibility of the vein and direct visualisation of
      PICC-surrounding thrombus; in uncertain cases, a doppler examination is performed.If the
      examination is negative for thrombosis, further controls are performed at 2,3,4 weeks after
      positioning, then once a month.If a DVT is detected, we register the position and extension
      of the thrombus, and its main characteristics (clot, mural or occlusive thrombosis); the
      catheter is left in place and a therapy is prescribed with LMWH at full doses, according with
      ACCP guidelines 2008 (confirmed in 2012 edition). Then, the patient is recontrolled weekly
      until removal of the catheter.
