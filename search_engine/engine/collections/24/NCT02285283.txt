    
      CRSwNP patients scheduled for medically-indicated sinus surgery will undergo screening
      ELIspot assay to identify patients with fungal sensitivity based on positive fungal induced
      interleukin 4 (IL-4) ELIspot. Enrolled fungal sensitive CRSwNP patients will undergo their
      sinus surgery and randomized into either placebo or itraconazole 200 mg taken by mouth twice
      a day (PO BID) for 24 weeks in addition to standardized post-surgical regimen (9 days of
      perioperative prednisone, saline irrigations and pain medication as needed). Patients will be
      followed as outpatient in rhinology clinic for 48 weeks total. During these post-op visits,
      compliance with medications will be determined. Patients will be questioned about any
      possible side effects or adverse events to post-operative medications. Then, the patients
      will be evaluated by 2 nasal specific quality of life questionnaires and nasal endoscopy. The
      goals of the nasal endoscopy are to evaluate the state of the sinus mucosa and to determine
      recurrence of nasal polyps.
