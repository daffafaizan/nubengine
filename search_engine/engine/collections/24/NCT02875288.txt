      surgical infiltration which was a change from the historical practice of infiltration with
      lidocaine/bupivacaine, plain bupivacaine or no local anesthetic at all. The change was made
      due to the perceived benefits in analgesia past the 12-24 hours that plain bupivacaine was
      effective. It is not clear, however, that there are statistically significant benefits in
      terms of reduced narcotic use and length of hospital stay and improved pain control and
      return of function post-operatively.

      Primary outcomes: The investigators will then measure narcotic use post-operatively as
      calculated by combining measures of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use for first 24 hours
      added to in-patient oral narcotic use (by referencing the electronic medical record (EMR)) as
      well as out-patient oral narcotic use as reported by patients. Subjective pain levels and
      pain interference scale and physical functioning scale will be evaluated pre-operatively and
      post-operatively with use of the Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry
      (PASTOR) developed by the Defense and Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management
      (DVCIPM) as a measure of perioperative pain and function.
