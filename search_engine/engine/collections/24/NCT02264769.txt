      sustained uterotonic activity, which can be associated with a number of side effects and
      unpredictable efficacy. Carbetocin in a single 100 mcg dose has apparently greater efficacy,
      with a similar side effect profile to that of oxytocin. In addition, some studies have also
      shown that there is less blood loss and less requirement for additional uterotonic drugs when
      carbetocin is administered. Studies conducted by the investigators group at Mount Sinai have
      shown similar efficacy between the doses ranging from 20 to 100 mcg of carbetocin. In the
      investigators study, the investigators are going to compare those two doses of carbetocin to
      determine that 20 mcg is not inferior to 100 mcg to produce adequate uterine tone in elective
      cesarean delivery. This study will be a randomized, double - blind, non inferiority study.
