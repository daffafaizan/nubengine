      'The primary aim of our study is to compare invasive and non-invasive techniques to select a
      dominant perforator when harvesting a DIEP-flap for autologous breast reconstruction.

      The secondary aim is to compare Dynamic Infrared Thermography (DIRT) and Laser Fluorescence
      Angiography (LFA) of Indocyanine green (ICG) in order to see whether they could be useful in
      the early detection of insufficient perfusion following the microvascular anastomotic
      procedure in DIEP flaps.

      Material and Method:

      Patients selected for breast reconstruction with autologous tissue were examined with
      preoperative CTA and a handheld Doppler Ultrasound for perforator mapping. Thereafter visual
      images from same area was obtained with dynamic infraredeed thermography (DIRT) and
      Indocyanin green fluorescent angiography (ICG-FA) before and after dissection of the skin
      flap with preserved medial and lateral DIEP perforators. Reconstructed breasts with
      hemi-DIEP-flaps were intraoperatively evaluated with DIRT and LFA immediately after the
      completion and opening of the microvascular anastomosis.The recorded images from the
      different techniques were assesses in relation to clinical outcome.
