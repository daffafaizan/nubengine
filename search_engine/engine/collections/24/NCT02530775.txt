      outcomes in comparison to non-instrumented fusion in patients with "STATIC" degenerative
      spondylolisthesis. At the time of scheduling surgery, patients who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be asked to participate. Patients who agree, will be
      randomized to either non-instrumented or instrumented arthrodesis group. Intra-operative,
      peri-operative, and post-operative data will be collected and compared. The investigators
      predict to get very similar clinical outcomes between the two groups, with possibly less
      complications from the non-instrumented group and definitely a reduction in cost compared to
      the instrumented group.
