      interventions to reduce the devastating impact of malaria in early childhood. Although two
      African studies have provided the proof of principle, further studies are needed to address
      several key issues. IPTi needs additional evaluation in a variety of settings and
      populations, alternative drugs and treatment schedules need to be tested and the long-term
      effect of IPTi on risk of malaria illness through early childhood needs to be clarified.

      Many of these issues are currently being addressed in a series of studies conducted under the
      auspice of the IPTi Consortium. However, all these studies are based in sub-Saharan Africa
      and are thus almost exclusively concerned with the potential of IPTi to prevent P. falciparum
      malaria.

      In order to determine whether IPTi is also an effective intervention in areas where there is
      a high prevalence of non-falciparum infections, further studies outside Africa are urgently
      needed. In addition, although initial IPTi studies have not shown a rebound in malaria
      morbidity following the intervention, the influence of IPTi on the acquisition of functional
      malaria immunity needs further investigation.

      This proposal brings together investigators, experience, and resources to conduct a clinical
      trial of IPTi complemented by careful epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in two
      highly endemic areas of Papua New Guinea, where infections with all 4 human Plasmodium
      species are common. The studies will be based at the PNG Institute for Medical Research,
      which has excellent infrastructure and a strong history of malaria research and
      community-based studies
