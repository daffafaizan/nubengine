      extensively researched. Breastfeeding rates remain suboptimal despite known advantages
      including reduced lifetime risk of maternal ovarian cancer, more rapid return to
      pre-gestational weight, improvement in maternal/neonatal bonding, reduction in neonatal
      allergic/immunologic conditions. Both non-modifiable and modifiable factors affecting a
      mother's decision regarding breastfeeding have been identified. Modifiable factors include
      breastfeeding knowledge, self-efficacy, and confidence. Breastfeeding self-efficacy has been
      positively correlated with breastfeeding duration. There is a lack of local data on
      breastfeeding rates, duration, and self-efficacy in the Augusta University women's health
      population as well as a lack of documented improvement of these factors following educational
      programs. Our study aims to create a program that is easily accessible and available to our
      patient population in the form of a free application available on Apple devices capable of
      accessing the internet (e.g., i-phone, i-pad, etc.). This study will be a randomized control
      trial. The intervention group will have access to the application while the control group
      will not. Our hypothesis is that the application will improve breastfeeding rates, duration,
      and self-efficacy if offered to patients at 32 through 36 weeks gestation. This will be
      assessed by comparing initial self-efficacy survey results with survey results at six weeks
      and six months postpartum for the intervention versus control groups.
