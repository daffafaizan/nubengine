      meeting the eligibility criteria will be obtained from electronic health records (EHRs). A
      research assistant will contact the potential participants via phone to invite them to the
      study and confirm eligibility. All eligible participants will complete informed consent
      followed by baseline assessment over the phone before randomization. Participants will be
      randomly allocated using a computer-generated randomization sequence. All participants will
      continue with their usual diabetes care including all medical visits, tests, and diabetes
      support programs throughout the study. In addition, the intervention group will receive the
      text messaging intervention. Control participants will receive usual care only. After three
      months of follow-up, all participants will complete post-intervention assessments via phone
      interview. Data on glycemic control (HbA1c) at baseline and post-intervention will be
      extracted from EHRs, as according to the protocol used for primary care providers in the
      Balearic Islands, patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c >8% ) must request an HbA1c
      determination every six months. Results of the most recent determination will be extracted
      from electronic medical records. For those patients with no recorded HbA1c within the
      previous three months, the research assistant will contact the primary care center and the
      patient to arrange blood test analyses.
