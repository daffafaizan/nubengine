      include several testing cycles as described in the figure 1. In each cycle, several research
      products (up to 4) will be tested on up to 20 participants in a partial or full cross-over
      design. Once cycle 1 is completed, blood parameters will be analysed and ketoindex will be
      calculated as area under the curve (AUC) of total ketones (BHB + AcA) over 4h / quantity of
      ingested MCTs in g. Based on ketoindex and ketones Thalf (T1/2: time to reach half of
      AUC-infinite of total ketones) values, new products will be developed for cycle 2.
