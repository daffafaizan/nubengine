    
      This study was designed to explore the effects of omega-3-acid ethyl esters on the lipid and
      lipoprotein profile in the blood in hyperlipidemic patients receiving a
      hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor in comparison with the control
      group of patients not treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters in an unblinded manner by use of
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using highly-sensitive gel filtration columns,
      which is a technique for analyzing lipoprotein.

      Study participants who gave consent and were assessed as eligible in the eligibility
      assessment will be stratified by the factors of "fasting triacylglycerol (TG; <300 mg/dL or
      300 mg/dL≤) and age (<65 years or 65 years≤) at the start of the screening period" and
      allocated to either the group treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters or the group not treated
      with omega-3-acid ethyl esters (1:1 ratio).
