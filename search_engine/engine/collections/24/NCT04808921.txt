    
      The clinical performance of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test was evaluated in a prospective
      clinical study conducted at a single (1) CLIA waiver investigational site in Miami, Florida,
      U.S. Consenting patients of any age, gender, or race/ethnicity who presented at the test site
      with COVID-19 like symptoms during the 2021 COVID-19 season were sequentially enrolled and
      tested. Five (5) minimally trained operators with little laboratory experience and who
      received no training on use of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test and were, therefore,
      representative of the intended users performed the study test evaluations.

      A subject's participation in this study will consist of a single visit. Following the
      completion of the informed consent process and a review of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria to
      determine eligibility, each subject will receive a unique study identification number.
