      approximately 60 patients undergoing ACL repair or TKR will be recruited. All blocks will be
      conducted preoperatively in an induction room.Dose assignation will be done using an
      up-and-down sequential method, where the dose of each subsequent patient depends on the
      response of the previous patient, called the Biased Coin Design.

      The assignment of each subsequent concentration will be based on the response of the previous
      patient.As soon as we recruit 45 patients with random dose assignment, we will terminate the
      enrollment procedure.

      The injectate will be prepared and administered by a research assistant using syringes
      connected to the block needle. The operator and the patient will be blinded to the
      concentration injected.
