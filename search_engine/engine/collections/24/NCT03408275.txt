    
      Whole blood samples were collected from pregnant women enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal
      Study of Parents and Children observational birth cohort study and were analysed for lead.
      Dietary pattern scores were derived from principal components analysis of a food frequency
      questionnaire. Associations of quartiles of dietary pattern scores, and of food groups
      categorised by frequency of consumption, with the likelihood of blood lead concentration
      (B-Pb) ≥5 µg/dl will be identified with adjusted logistic regression (n=2167).
