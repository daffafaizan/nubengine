      disease, which is not amenable to curative resection. Single modality local therapy, either
      surgery or radiation, only cures a fraction of such patients.

      Radical radiation is not feasible for all patients with unresectable Stage IIIA or IIIB
      non-small cell lung cancer, based upon the extent of the loco-regional disease or the medical
      state of the patient. Patients of good performance status receiving protracted high-dose
      palliative radiotherapy do obtain a survival benefit from this therapy. Studies have shown a
      survival advantage by adding chemotherapy to radical radiation therapy: but studies in the
      high-dose palliative radiotherapy setting are lacking. Two regimens of concurrent
      chemotherapy with high-dose palliative radiotherapy have been developed locally, with
      established MTDs. These 2 regimens do warrant a comparative assessment in a phase II trial,
      prior to a phase III trial against high dose palliative radiation alone (36Gy/12#/5).

      This is a randomised phase II trial comprising of 2 arms for randomization as follows:

      Arm A:External beam radiation, 40 Gy/20#/5 per week, Plus concurrent Vinorelbine, IV,
      25mg/m2, days 1, 8, 22 and + Cisplatin 20mg/m2, IV, weekly

      Arm B:External beam radiation, 30 Gy/15#/5 per week, Plus concurrentGemcitabine, 200mg (flat
      dose) IV days 1, 8, 15

      An equal number of patients will be randomised to each arm. The randomisation will be carried
      out by the Princess Alexandra Trial Centre.

      Patients will be assessed at baseline, weekly during treatment, and then at 3 weeks, 6 weeks
      and 12 weeks post treatment then 3 monthly thereafter.
