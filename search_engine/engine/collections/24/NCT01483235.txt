    
      This study is a two group randomized controlled trial, non-inferiority design, where the rCRP
      (intervention group) will be compared with the sCRP (control group). Eligible patients will
      be asked to participate in the study at the cardiac rehabilitation program intake clinic.
      Consenting participants will be asked to sign an informed consent and undergo a baseline
      assessment. This assessment will consist of a medical history, exercise capacity (stress
      test), blood test, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, lifestyle behaviours and
      psychosocial measurements. The baseline assessment will be done before participants start the
      program. Consecutively, randomization will take place stratified according to gender to
      either the sCRP or rCRP. The same assessment called exit assessment will be performed at four
      to six months from baseline, at the cardiac rehabilitation program exit clinic (at program
      completion) and at 16 to 20 months from baseline (one year follow-up from cardiac
      rehabilitation program completion) to assess the immediate and sustainable effect,
      respectively.

      The following research questions will be addressed:

        1. Is the reduced cardiac rehabilitation program (intervention group) as effective as the
           standard cardiac rehabilitation program (control group) for improving exercise capacity
           and ischemic heart disease risk factors at both program completion (four to six months
           from baseline) and at one year from program completion (16 to 20 months from baseline)?

        2. Will the reduced cardiac rehabilitation program have better adherence than the standard
           cardiac rehabilitation program?
