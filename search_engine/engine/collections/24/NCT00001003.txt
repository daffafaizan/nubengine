      therapeutically effective dose is attained in the lungs. Therefore, this study will establish
      the amount of PEN that is deposited in the lungs of patients enrolled in protocols ACTG 021
      and ACTG 081, who are being treated with PEN administered from the Marquest Respirgard II
      nebulizer.

      Approximately 4 weeks after patients in ACTG 021 and ACTG 081 have begun PEN aerosol therapy
      for the prevention of PCP, patients undergo the first radioactive aerosol study. The patient
      inhales a mist while sitting with his/her back against a gamma camera. The resulting picture
      outlines the lungs. This mist contains a single dose of PEN mixed with a small amount of
      radioactivity (99m-technetium ertechnetate). The gamma camera determines where the particles
      deposit in the lungs. The radioactivity exposure is equivalent to a typical xray of the ribs.
      This procedure takes about 45 minutes; 6 hours later another 30-minute gamma camera image is
      obtained. Blood is withdrawn to measure the blood level of PEN as done in ACTG 021 and ACTG
      081. The entire procedure is repeated near the end of the prophylactic schedule (about 10-12
      months after the start of aerosol PEN treatments).
