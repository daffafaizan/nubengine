      network. The function can be evaluated using instrumental, such as voice analysis computer
      programmes, scales, or well structured questionnaires. There are many scales for assessment
      of perceptual speech but there is no validated for head and neck patients. The study will
      assess the construct validity and adaptation of the Turkish translation of Speech Specific
      Perceptual Speech Evaluation as known as London Speech Evaluation Scale. The investigators
      developed the Turkish translation of this scale (LSE-T), according to the cross-cultural
      adaptation guidelines. Two translators translated the LSE into Turkish and a native English
      language speaker reverse-translated it into English. The back translation was sent to the
      original author for proofreading. The LSE scale consisted of 6 parameters and 4 scores
      related with perceptual speech in head and neck cancer patients.
