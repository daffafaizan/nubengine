      multicenter, parallel-group study of adult subjects with COPD. The study was double blinded
      through the use of both unit dose vial (UDV) and metered-dose inhaler (MDI) placebos, as
      appropriate. The primary efficacy analysis utilized the placebo control. Secondary analyses
      of the primary efficacy endpoint utilized the active control, and included comparisons
      between the placebo and active control. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In
      October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010,
      Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
