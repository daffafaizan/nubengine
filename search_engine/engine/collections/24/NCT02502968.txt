      consolidation therapy. Leukemic stem cells that are dormant in the bone marrow are presumed
      to be a major reason for AML relapse. Allogenic stem cell transplantation is an option only
      for a minority of AML patients in 1st CR. BL-8040 is a novel CXCR4 inhibitor that has a dual
      mechanism of action: inducing mobilization of leukemic blasts from the bone marrow which
      enhances cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and has direct antileukemic, pro-apoptotic
      properties. The treatment with BL-8040 in combination with consolidation therapy (standard
      consolidation with high-dose cytarabine) should improve the efficacy of the consolidation
      therapy resulting in longer lasting remissions.
