      follicular or transformed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will receive a dosimetric dose of
      fission-derived Iodine I 131 Tositumomab followed by a therapeutic dose of tellurium-derived
      Iodine I 131 Tositumomab. Blood Pharmacokinetics, total body clearance, tumor and organ
      dosimetry, and biodistribution will be assessed following administration of the dosimetric
      dose.
