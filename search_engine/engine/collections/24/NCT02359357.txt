    
      This study is the first time in human study and consists of two parts.

      Part 1A:

      Part 1 of the study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation,
      first-time-in-human study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profiles following single
      oral administrations of FDL169 to healthy male volunteers. Sixty-four (64) male subjects (8
      per cohort) will be included in Part 1 of the study. Up to eight dose levels of FDL169 are
      planned to be tested in Part 1 of the study.

      Part 1B:

      Open label. Following completion of Part 1A of the study, an additional cohort of 8 subjects
      will receive a single dose of FDL169 in both fasted and fed states

      Part 2:

      Part 2 of the study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study
      to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profiles following multiple oral administrations of
      FDL169 to healthy male subjects. Forty-eight male subjects, in cohorts of twelve, will be
      included in Part 2 of the study. It is planned to test up to four dose levels of FDL169 in
      Part 2.
