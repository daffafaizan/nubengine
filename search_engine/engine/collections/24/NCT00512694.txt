    
      The Duke Lupus Registry is a prospective cohort comprised of patients with lupus seen in the
      Duke Rheumatology clinic.

      The Duke Lupus Registry has two main purposes:

        1. Improved patient care. By following disease activity scores and medication usage, we
           expect to improve our care of the patients seen in clinic.

        2. Future research on lupus outcomes. This may encompass a broad array of areas, including
           but not limited to cardiovascular health, pregnancy and fertility, infections,
           medication use, quality of life, and depression.

      At each office visit, patients will complete a questionnaire, physicians will measure lupus
      activity, and patients may be asked to provide a small blood sample. Patients will not be
      required to make extra visits to Duke in order to participate -- all paperwork and blood
      draws will occur during a regularly scheduled office visit with the physician.
