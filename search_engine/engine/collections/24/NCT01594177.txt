    
      Primary objectives:

      To compare the pathological complete response (pCR = ypT0/is ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant
      treatment of afatinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel + trastuzumab followed by
      epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide/ trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast
      cancer.

      Secondary objectives:

      To determine the rates of ypT0 ypN0; ypT0; ypT0/is; ypN0; and regression grades according to
      Sinn.

      To determine the response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes by physical
      examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) after 6 weeks of the 2
      anti-HER2 agents alone and at surgery.

      To determine the breast and axilla conservation rate after treatment. To assess the toxicity
      and compliance. To correlate skin toxicity and diarrhoea with pCR. To examine and compare
      pre-specified molecular markers such as EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, TGFÃŸ, EGF, AREG, HBEGF, BTC,
      EPIGEN, EREG, NRG1, NRG2, neuroglycan, tomoregulin, NRG4 and NRG3K-RAS, MET, IGF1R, IRS1,
      PTEN, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, AXL, RET, and PDGFR; EGFR signature, Ki67, p95HER2, and PI3K
      mutation before start of afatinib+trastuzumab, before and after chemotherapy.
