    
      Background:. Genetic variations are potentially key to inter-individual differences in
      responses to treatment with the appetite suppressant sibutramine.

      Overall Aims: To evaluate influence of genetic variation in candidate adrenergic and
      serotonergic control mechanisms on weight loss and gastric emptying response to sibutramine
      in obesity.

      Methods: 180 overweight or obese (respectively BMI of 25-29.9 or 30 kg/m2) people treated
      with sibutramine (10 or 15 mg/day) or placebo for 12 wks. We shall collect DNA from venous
      blood sample at study entry, and use SERT-P genotype at baseline to stratify patients
      according to LL vs LS/SS genotype in both obese and overweight groups. The primary outcome
      measurement will be the association of clinical response (weight loss) and the influence of
      SERT-P and 2-MSP variation. A secondary outcome for descriptive purposes is the gastric
      emptying response to sibutramine treatment. Gastric emptying of solids will be measured using
      stable isotope method.

      Anticipated Results: SERT-P genotype is significantly associated with the magnitude of weight
      loss in obese and overweight individuals.

      Significance: Our study will provide the first evidence of the pharmacogenomic effects of
      sibutramine on weight loss in obesity and appraise the association of weight loss with change
      in gastric emptying.
