      and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Prescribing gastric acid-reducing agents such as
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine receptor antagonists (H2RAs) as an adjunct to
      pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to improve PERT efficacy and dietary fat
      absorption has become accepted clinical practice in CF, despite limited evidence to support
      the practice. Establishing the efficacy and true health benefit of acid suppression for
      nutritional status and outcomes in CF is particularly important in light of potential health
      risks and cost associated with long-term or even lifetime use of these medications.

      This study aims to characterize changes in fat malabsorption using the coefficient of fat
      absorption (CFA) as the primary endpoint in subjects who are on and off acid suppression with
      a PPI in addition to PERT. Additionally, the SmartPillÂ® will be used to evaluate duodenal
      power of hydrogen (pH) while on and off acid suppression, and the malabsorption blood test
      (MBT) will be used to characterize changes in fat absorption. Associations will be explored
      between changes in nutritional status (weight, height, BMI), clinical GI symptoms, and
      quality of life in subjects treated with PPI vs. placebo.
