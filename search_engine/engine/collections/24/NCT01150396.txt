    
      The study includes a regional cohort (Western Norway) of approximately 50 extremely preterm
      infants born per year over a three year period. Detailed information on fetal condition
      (growth, circulation, infection), neonatal resuscitation and clinical course (details on
      ventilatory support, circulation, pulmonary function as assessed with a neonatal spirometry
      technique, cerebral imaging, nutrition, growth) will be recorded. Biobank samples of blood
      and amniotic fluid from the mother, and from placenta, blood, urine, and tracheal aspirates
      will be collected form the infant, primarily to examine for inflammatory parameters. After
      discharge, follow-up at 6, 12, 36 and 56 months will be conducted using standardized tests
      (Ages & Stages, INFANIB, Denver Developmental Screening test, Bayley scales, WPPSI and ABC
      movement tests).
