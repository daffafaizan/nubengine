      produce sufficient amounts of thyroid hormones. The substitution therapy is guided by
      measurement of the pituitary gland hormone thyrotropin (TSH). Patients with central
      hypothyroidism in whom pituitary insufficiency leads to hypothyroidism, TSH cannot be used to
      guide therapy. So far there are no reliable methods for therapy control in patients with
      central hypothyroidism.

      The measurement of small endogenous metabolites might give investigators a metabolomics
      profile. This could help to discriminate between euthyroid, hypothyroid and hyperthyroid
      state and therefore could be used for diagnosis and therapy control of thyroid dysfunction
      diseases.
