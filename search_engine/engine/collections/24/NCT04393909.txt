    
      The goal of this study is to improve the safety of diagnosis and therapy for a set of
      conditions and undifferentiated symptoms for hospitalized patients. The investigators will
      employ a set of methods and tools from the disciplines of systems engineering, human factors,
      quality improvement, and implementation science to thoroughly analyze the problem, design and
      develop potential solutions that leverage the current technological infrastructure, and
      implement and evaluate the final interventions.

      The aims of this study are to:

        1. Analyze the problem of diagnostic error over the acute episode of care, identifying
           system and cognitive factors for a set of morbid, costly common conditions and
           undifferentiated symptoms by using system engineering and human factors methods, as well
           as electronic health record and administrative data review.

        2. Design, develop, and iteratively refine intervention components using lessons learned
           from problem analysis and a participatory process that involves patients, clinicians,
           and institutional stakeholders.

        3. Implement an intervention for patient and clinician subjects on general medicine units.
           Using a pre-post, interrupted time series study design, the investigators will evaluate
           the effect of the intervention primarily on diagnostic and therapeutic errors. The
           investigators will use mixed methods to understand barriers and facilitators of
           implementation.
