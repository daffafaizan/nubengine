    
      The three parts of this study will be:

      Retrospective Chart Review-

      A chart review will be completed on all patients that have had an uncemented total elbow
      arthroplasty using the press-fit technique at Vanderbilt Hand & Upper Extremity Center. The
      chart review will include:

        -  A historical data form

        -  An operative data form

        -  A radiographic assessment form

      Questionnaire Mailing- We will mail prospective study patients a DASH (Disabilities of the
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire to complete with a mailing letter explaining the
      request for this information. The DASH will be modified to ask patients regarding their
      pre-operative time as well.

      Clinical Data Collection-

      We will enroll patients who have already had/or will be having a uncemented total elbow
      arthroplasty using the press-fit technique. If the patient already has a file completed
      through the chart review we will not complete the historical data form, operative form, or
      previous radiograph assessments. If the patient does not have a file completed through the
      chart review the data collection will include:

        -  An Informed Consent Document

        -  A historical data form

        -  An operative data form

        -  A radiographic assessment form

        -  Patient-completed DASH questionnaire

        -  Elbow Assessment Form
