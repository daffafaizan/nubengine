    
      The research design includes a cohort eFHS Study and an embedded randomized factorial trial
      on a subset of the cohort.

      For the primary e-cohort, the investigators will build a custom mobile app for use within the
      Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to digitally collect data, compare it against research
      clinic-collected data, quantify risk factor burden, and perform CVD risk prediction. The app
      development will focus on 1) CVD risk factor data that would benefit from more frequent
      ascertainment than the every four to eight year FHS examination cycles; 2) circumstances
      where in vivo assessment may be superior to clinic-based assessment; 3) key endpoints of the
      FHS that are considered FHS landmarks. In addition to the eFHS App, participants will be
      offered wireless devices (Withings BP) to measure blood pressure and an Apple Watch to
      measure heart rate and steps per day.

      For the messaging trial, the investigators will conduct a randomized factorial trial phase to
      test the effect of messaging strategies. Participants will be sent a weekly notification
      through the eFHS app. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of 8 groups defined
      according to the following: using personalized reminder messaging vs. standard neutral
      messaging; notification sent on a weekday vs. weekend; notification sent in the morning vs.
      the evening. The three main comparisons will be simultaneously evaluated according to a 2x2x2
      factorial design.
