      multicomponent educational intervention to improve medication use and management of
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, relative to a statewide intervention that
      has been ongoing. Medication use and symptom severity outcomes will be compared among 29
      intervention counties and 10 demographically similar non-intervention counties. The long-term
      effectiveness of the statewide intervention will also be evaluated. Medicare and Minimum Data
      set data from 2011 to 2014 will be used to evaluate prescribing and other outcomes in 1)
      outpatients with dementia, and 2) nursing home residents, based on exposure to interventions
      among healthcare and nursing home providers. Measurable goals included increasing the
      appropriateness of antipsychotic prescribing and reducing anticholinergic use. Effect
      modification will be evaluated by level of participation in the intervention and other
      prescriber and nursing home facility characteristics.
