      Studies have shown a high number needed to treat for each saved prostate cancer related
      death.

      After prostatectomy, 80% experience erectile dysfunction. Sexual life is a central part of
      people's identity, self-esteem and quality of life. Stem cells have generated a large amount
      of promising data suggesting that stem cells can alleviate erectile dysfunction, by
      regenerating nerves as well as endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the corpus cavernous.

      Animal studies have used stem cell therapy to improve erectile dysfunction in rats after
      cavernous nerve damage, with invariable high success rate.

      In this pilot study will include 30 patient's with erectile dysfunction 3-9 mdr after
      prostatectomy. The men have no spontaneous erectile function and no response to drug
      treatment.

      Liposuction is carried out in general anesthesia. Isolation of stem cells will be done
      simultaneously and the stem cells injected into the corpus cavernous directly after the
      isolation is carried out.

      This is a clinical study evaluating an innovative cell therapy procedure.The objective of
      this study was to evaluate the effects of injection of stem cell of adipose origin.

      The project will run over a period of twelve months. Patients will be followed for a period
      of six months. Treatment efficacy will be assessed from validated questionnaires.
