      have arrhythmias in the atria (top chambers of the heart). These are called inapproriate
      shocks, but the pain is similar to the pain patients feel with an appropriate shock (a shock
      for a ventricular arrhythmia). This study is being conducted to determine if taking magnesium
      can reduce the number of shocks patients with ICDs experience and to see if magnesium
      supplementation improves patients quality of life. Magnesium's impact of the
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and intracellular magnesium concentrations will also be studied.

      Comparison: Magnesium compared to placebo in patients with ICDs to evaluate the number of ICD
      shocks and patient perceived quality of life.
