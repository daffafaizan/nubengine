      PF-3512676 in all trials which combined PF-3512676 with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The decision
      was made subsequent to DSMC recommendation to close two phase III randomized trials in
      non-small cell lung cancer which also combined PF-3512676 with cytotoxic chemotherapy, citing
      lack of efficacy concerns as the primary reason with safety issues (sepsis, thrombocytopenia)
      also contributing to the decision. Subjects were allowed to complete standard of care
      treatment and protocol follow-up. Data collection was completed on 31 January 2008.
