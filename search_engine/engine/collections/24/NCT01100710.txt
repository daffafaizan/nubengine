      assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance tomography (cMRI, 1.5 Tesla), and clinical variables
      including increasing age and gender on high sensitivity cTnT (TnThs) levels in healthy
      individuals. Therefore we measured TnThs in serum samples of 120 healthy volunteers aged
      between 20 and 70 years. All individuals underwent cMRI including stress testing using
      dobutamine or adenosine.TnThs concentrations were related to cMRI and clinical findings.
      Partial correlation, as well as linear and hierarchical regression analyses were used to
      identify independent predictors and their relative contribution for prediction of TnThs
      values.
