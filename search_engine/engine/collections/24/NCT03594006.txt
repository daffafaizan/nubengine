    
      This proposed cancer care delivery research project aims to validate a new instrument (CCI;
      cancer care coordination instrument) designed to assess cancer patients' perceptions of care
      coordination. Care coordination (CC) is important for all patients, and it is especially
      important for cancer patients as they have complex episodes of care, multi-disciplinary
      interventions, prolonged duration of care, and an overall high symptom burden. Further, CC is
      critical for cancer patients due to several transition points between stages of care
      (diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end of life), varied settings of care (inpatient,
      ambulatory), and multiple physicians (medical, surgical, radiation oncologists) and other
      healthcare providers (e.g., oncology nurses, primary care physicians, physicians/nurses'
      assistants) providing care.

      A CCI validated in ethnically/racially diverse samples can be utilized to identify potential
      targets for intervention and improvement in CC for specific populations and to reduce or
      eliminate the disparities in cancer health outcomes. Validation of the CCI under this
      proposal will have widespread applicability to oncology care across varied practice
      environments and will form a foundation for the creation of similar tools for other chronic
      and complex conditions.
