    
      Women in group A will undergo controlled ovarian stimulation according to the following
      protocol:

      Pituitary down-regulation will be achieved using buserelin (Suprefact®, Hoechst, Frankfurt,
      Germany) at a fixed daily dose of 200 mg s.c., according to a long agonist protocol, starting
      on day 2 of the normal menstrual cycle. Treatment with r-hFSH (Gonal-F®, Serono Austria GmbH,
      Vienna, Austria) will be started in women with serum E2 concentrations <200 pmol/l and no
      follicles >15 mm in diameter or ovarian cysts on ultrasonographic examination. The initial
      r-hFSH dose will be 250 IU s.c. daily for 5 days, after which the dose will be increased to a
      maximum of 450 IU per day using a step-up protocol with steps of 50 IU/day.

      Once the leading follicle has reached a diameter of 14 mm, patients will receive r-hLH
      (lutropin alfa; Luveris®, Serono Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria) at a dose of 75 IU s.c. for a
      maximum of 10 days. A dose of 75 IU LH per day was chosen based on findings from a
      controlled, prospective, dose-finding study in gonadotrophin-deficient women (WHO I
      classification) (7). Ovulation will be induced by administration of HCG (Profasi®, Serono
      Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria), 10 000 IU i.m. or s.c., when at least two follicles have
      reached a diameter of >17 mm.

      Oocyte retrieval will be performed by ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration techniques
      34-38 h after administration of HCG. IVF will be performed according to standard practices at
      our institution. A maximum of three embryos will be transferred 48 h after oocyte retrieval
      (ESHRE Committee on Good Clinical and Laboratory Practice, 1995 ). Patients will receive
      micronized progesterone, 600 mg/day, by vaginal administration for at least the first 3 weeks
      of pregnancy, beginning on the day of embryo transfer.

      Women in group B will undergo ovarian hyperstimulation according to the following protocol:

      No pituitary down-regulation will be performed. Treatment with r-hFSH (Gonal-F®, Serono
      Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria) will be started in women with serum E2 concentrations <200
      pmol/l and no follicles >15 mm in diameter or ovarian cysts on ultrasonographic examination.
      The r-hFSH dose will be 150 IU s.c. daily for 11 consecutive days.

      Once the leading follicle has reached a diameter of 14 mm, patients will receive r-hLH
      (lutropin alfa; Luveris®, Serono Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria) at a dose of 75 IU s.c. for a
      maximum of 10 days. A dose of 75 IU LH per day was chosen based on findings from a
      controlled, prospective, dose-finding study in gonadotrophin-deficient women (WHO I
      classification) (European Recombinant Human LH Study Group, 1998 ). Ovulation will be induced
      by administration of HCG (Profasi®, Serono Austria GmbH, Vienna, Austria), 10 000 IU i.m. or
      s.c., when at least two follicles have reached a diameter of >17 mm.

      Oocyte retrieval will be performed by ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration techniques
      34-38 h after administration of HCG. IVF will be performed according to standard practices at
      our institution. A maximum of three embryos will be transferred 48 h after oocyte retrieval
      (ESHRE Committee on Good Clinical and Laboratory Practice, 1995 ). Patients will receive
      micronized progesterone, 600 mg/day, by vaginal administration for at least the first 3 weeks
      of pregnancy, beginning on the day of embryo transfer.
