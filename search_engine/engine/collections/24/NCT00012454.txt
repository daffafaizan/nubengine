      disability. Despite the success of recent clinical trials of antithrombotic drugs for the
      secondary prevention of stroke, annually about 10% of patients with recent cerebrovascular
      accidents have recurrent strokes. The development of new treatment strategies for the
      secondary prevention of stroke is an important issue for modern medicine. There is increasing
      evidence that inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation plays an important role in
      the pathogenesis of stroke. Control of molecular inflammation at the sites of endothelial
      activation can be achieved by induction of mucosal tolerance. The induction of mucosal
      tolerance with repeated, low-dose, intranasal administration of antigen causes a shift of
      immune response from proinflammatory T(H)1 type to anti-inflammatory T(H)2 type at the sites
      of inflammation. E-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed only on activated endothelium
      in response to proinflammatory cytokines. The major goal of proposed study is to test whether
      repeated administration of low-dose, intranasal E-selectin can induce mucosal tolerance to
      this compound causing a shift of immune response from T(H)1 to T(H)2 type in patients with
      recent stroke or TIA, and secondly to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this strategy
      for the secondary prevention of stroke.
