      in recent years. Many of these systems adhere to the skin with an adhesive in place for
      between 2 and 14 days, or even longer, depending on the system under consideration.
      Unfortunately, an increase in skin reactions has been observed in diabetic patients using
      these new technologies, sometimes leading to discontinuation. The number of studies
      evaluating the cutaneous tolerance of the patches used by these technologies is limited, so
      the prevalence of these skin intolerances is unknown.

      The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and consequences of skin reactions
      to skin adhesive systems for the treatment of diabetes. It will be implemented with the
      following design:

        -  observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study involving 4 Diabetology centres and
           over a period of 6 months.

        -  Establishment of an observatory on skin reactions to freeStyle libreÂ® (FSL) and all
           other adhesive systems related to new technologies for the treatment of diabetes

        -  A questionnaire will be systematically proposed to the patients concerned, during the
           usual diabetes follow-up consultations made by all investigators.
