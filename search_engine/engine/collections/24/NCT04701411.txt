      containing 120 million cells of allogeneic expanded adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
      [eASCs]). Darvadstrocel is being tested to treat complex perianal fistula in pediatric
      participants who have Crohn's disease (CD). This study will look at the safety and efficacy
      of darvadstrocel in the treatment of complex perianal fistula in CD .

      The study will enroll at least 20 patients who will receive a single dose of darvadstrocel.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 52 weeks.

      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic. In unavoidable circumstances, such as
      the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, exceptions may be granted for alternative methods for
      conducting participant visits with approval by the medical monitor and/or sponsor.
