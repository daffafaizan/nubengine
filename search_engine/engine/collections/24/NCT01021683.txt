    
      This is a prospective (study following patients forward in time), open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), multi-center (conducted in more than one center)
      observational study to examine the correlation between a sufficient blood concentration of
      itraconazole and disappearance of a fever (defeverscence) when itraconazole injection is
      administered for resolving unknown neutropenic fever of participants who are given
      itraconazole oral solution as a prophylaxis under general treatment conditions. The
      recommended dose of the drug will be 200 milligram (mg), which will be administered
      intravenously, twice daily for 2 days (a total of 4 doses) and then 200 mg once daily for 12
      days. After the administration for a total of 14 days, itraconazole oral solution 200 mg
      (which is equivalent to 20 ml) twice daily will be continued for a total of 14 days until
      clinically significant neutropenia is resolved.
