        1. The use of PRP will allow to initiate sooner the compressive treatment during the post
           graft surgery evolution, in fewer days on average than the traditional method (18 ds).

        2. The use of PRP will maintain the same initial size of the graft. The study's domain
           corresponds to burn sequelae on children in treatment with reconstructive surgery due to
           retractile sequelae located on their upper and lower limbs, with functional compromise
           during their growth process.

      One of the treatments used for this problem is the surgical technique of with release of burn
      contractures and skin graft.

      Split skin grafts are at risk of suboptimal "take" due to bleeding and infection which would,
      on the one hand, delay the initiation of the rehabilitation with preventive compression to
      avoid the retraction of the grafted area.

      20% of the children that arrive in COANIQUEM (approximately 7,000 annually), require
      rehabilitation. Of these, 32% have surgery and 9% of those are release of burn contractures
      and skin graft mainly on extremities.
