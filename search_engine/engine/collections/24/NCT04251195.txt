      (HVLT-R) to assess the baseline use of semantic clustering and verbal memory recall
      performance. Participants will then be randomly assigned to either a control group or a
      verbal training group. Participants in both groups will undergo a short session (15 minutes)
      of VR training. Finally, participants will be invited to perform an alternate version of the
      HVLT-R to assess initial change in semantic clustering and verbal memory recall performance
      after the training. They will also complete the VR Experience Questionnaire and the simulator
      sickness questionnaire (SSQ) in order for the research team to gain feedback from
      participants regarding their experience and tolerability of the VR session.
