      United States. While increased physical activity can reduce this risk, less than half of
      adults in the United States meet the minimum recommendation guidelines for physical activity.
      Gamification, or the application of game design elements to non-game settings, has
      demonstrated promise in increasing physical activity when designed using insights from
      behavioral economics. However, the best way to design goal-setting within these interventions
      has not been well-examined. In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will
      evaluate the effectiveness of four different goal-setting strategies within a gamification
      intervention to increase physical activity among adults with elevated risk for ASCVD. The
      trial will include a 2-week run-in period to estimate a baseline, followed by an 8-week
      introductory phase, an 8-week maintenance phase, and then after the intervention is completed
      an 8-week follow-up period.
