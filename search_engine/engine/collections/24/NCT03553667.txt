      patients will be sedative with BIS-guided Propofol/Alfentanil Target-Controlled Infusion. The
      BIS will be maintained between 40-70 with electromyography(EMG) < 30%. Ce(effect site
      concentration) of Propofol is adjusted according to BIS score. Ce of Alfentanil is adjusted
      between 15-75 ng/ml. Patients have spontaneous respiration during the procedure with O2
      simple mask. If the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry(SpO2) < 95%, prescribe chin lift
      first. Nasopharyngeal airways is given if chin lift can not improve the saturation.
      Crystalloid, usually Lactate Ringer, is infused with the rate 4ml/kg/hr. The goal of Standard
      group is to maintain mean arterial pressure(MAP) > 60%. If MAP < 60%, 3ml/kg crystalloid is
      challenged in 10 minutes. If MAP still less than 60% after the second fluid challenge,
      Ephedrine 4-8mg iv is prescribed. ClearSight group is to maintain stroke volume(SV). If SV
      decreases more than 10%, 3ml/kg crystalloid is challenged in 10 minutes. If MAP still less
      than 60% after the second fluid challenge, Ephedrine 4-8mg iv is prescribed.
