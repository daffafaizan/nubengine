      athletes with non-operative biceps or rotator cuff tendinopathy. This will be directly
      measured by evaluation of upper extremity biomechanics measurements, strength testing,
      patient reported functional outcome scores, and identifying time required for clearance of
      return to sport. These outcomes in patients undergoing BFR therapy in addition to traditional
      rehabilitation will be compared to patients undergoing traditional rehabilitation only.
