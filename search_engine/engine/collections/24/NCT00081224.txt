    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the pathological complete response rate in patients with stage II or III
           adenocarcinoma of the rectum treated with neoadjuvant celecoxib and capecitabine in
           combination with pelvic irradiation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rectal function of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to recurrence or progression and survival time of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate cellular and molecular markers in pretreatment tumor samples with response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-7
           and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5. Patients undergo pelvic radiotherapy once
           daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat weekly for 5.5 weeks.

        -  Surgery: Patients undergo surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant
           chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients with a curative resection receive oral capecitabine
           twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
