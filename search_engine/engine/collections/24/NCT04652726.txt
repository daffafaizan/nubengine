      inclisiran) multicenter study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      inclisiran in adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and elevated
      low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on stable standard of care background
      lipid-lowering therapy. The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of inclisiran
      compared to placebo in reducing LDL-C (percent change) at Day 330.
