      tolerability, dosing and efficacy of Wellbutrin XL in outpatients who meet Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual-IV criteria for early onset, primary type dysthymic disorder (low-grade
      chronic depression). It is hypothesized that patients taking Wellbutrin XL will show greater
      improvement in depression symptoms and psychosocial functioning than patients taking placebo.
