      effective treatments makes their diagnosis and management essential to the community. The
      2-4% annual incidence of such secondary ICH creates controversy regarding treatment for
      asymptomatic patients. Brain AVMs thus require multidisciplinary evaluation for optimal
      management especially for surgical grades III - V lesions that often require some combination
      of embolization, microsurgery, and/or radiosurgical treatment. Currently there is no
      designated medical therapy for bAVM, though there is growing animal and human evidence
      supporting a role for bevacizumab to reduce the size of AVMs in the brain and liver,
      respectively. This proposal is a pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab
      in humans with bAVMs.
