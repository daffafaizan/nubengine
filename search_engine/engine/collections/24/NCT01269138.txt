    
      To describe the treatment modalities and outcomes of: - bleeding episodes - surgery -
      prophylaxis in a well defined, international cohort of FVII deficient patients characterised
      following the methodology used by the International Factor VII deficiency Study Group
      (IF7SG).

      To evaluate the presence (in already treated patients) and/or the appearance of inhibiting
      antibodies to FVII and/or therapy-related thrombosis.

      Study Design:

      Prospective observational study on treatment of FVII deficiency patients. This is an outcome
      study conducted through the procedures set up by the IF7SG, in patients already enrolled or
      newly enrolled in the database.

      Study population and products:

      Patients with FVII deficiency (levels of FVII less than 50% of normal or a mutation known to
      be associated to a FVII deficiency) can be enrolled. All pharmaceutical products considered
      useful for treatment of FVII deficiency by the centres can be included in the study.

      Key assessments:

      The database is set up to capture the following assessments, if available:

      Bleeding episodes:

      • Recording of bleeding location, symptom onset and treatment onset & location • Recording of
      substitution therapy, concomitant medications and concomitant illness • Recording of 6 hour
      treatment evaluation for bleeding episodes • Recording of re-bleeding episodes

      Surgery/delivery:

      • Recording of surgery description , date of surgery and indication • Recording of
      substitution therapy, concomitant medications and concomitant illness during surgery •
      Recording of antifibrinolytic drugs used prior, during and/or after surgery •Recording of •
      Recording of overall treatment evaluation

      Prophylaxis:

      • Recording of prophylaxis type (primary/secondary), indication for prophylaxis and
      start/stop date •Recording of prophylaxis therapy, concomitant medications and concomitant
      illness • Recording of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis •Recording of clinical
      prophylaxis evaluation

      For all:

        -  Laboratory values (PT/INR, APTT, FVII:C, platelet count, fibrinogen, inhibitor samples)
           at time points specified in section 7.3.

        -  Adverse events (including thrombotic events, anaphylactic reactions, DIC reactions, Re-
           bleedings and mortality)

        -  Recording of 30 day treatment evaluation (excellent, effective, partly effective,
           ineffective or not evaluable)

        -  Duration of hospital stay (ward, ICU) within 30 days after first product treatment •
           Mortality within 30days after first product administration
