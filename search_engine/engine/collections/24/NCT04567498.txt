      Group 1 - presumptive TB patients. Group 2 - residents of area with high risk of TB.

      Study participants provide written informed consent. The participants are asked to breathe
      normally using a mask for 2 times then inhale and exhale in a forced expiratory volume to the
      air collecting bag until the collecting bag is full. The collecting bag is sealed and
      connected to the e-nose machine via a collecting hose and HEPA-filter protecting the e-nose
      from microbes. The breath pattern will be recorded in the e-nose device, which is connected
      to a laptop that will display the recorded breath pattern. Other data are collected: clinical
      symptoms, results of chest X-ray, smear microscopic, and Xpert MTB/Rif examinations.
