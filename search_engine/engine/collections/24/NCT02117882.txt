      lift procedure.

      Once a patient will be enrolled in the study impressions will be taken. After the wax-up, a
      radiographic stent will be prepared. Special attention will be given to position radio-opaque
      references in the positions where the implants will be inserted according to a prosthodontic
      guided insertion. Pre-surgical CT scan will be executed after placing the stent in its proper
      position in patient's mouth. After that, if no surgical contra-indications will be detected
      at CT evaluation, patients will be enrolled for surgical interventions.
