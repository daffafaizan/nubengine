      China in December 2019, and as a result of its rapid spreading nationwide, as of February 16,
      2020, a large number of people up to 68,500 totally in China were diagnosed with a new type
      of disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1665 peoples were died due to this
      disease in China. Based on the recent epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of
      this new coronavirus is 1-14 days and 3-7 days for most people before they show any symptom,
      such as fever, fatigue and dry cough that are the main clinical symptoms a few patients will
      also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea and other symptoms. Severe
      patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after onset of the disease, and the rapid
      progression for these patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock,
      refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction.

      According to the "Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease
      2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment)" recently issued by National Health
      Commission of the People's Republic of China, the general treatment will include close
      monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation at finger, additionally, monitoring routine
      blood test, routine urine test, coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis based on
      individual condition, and providing effective oxygen inhalation treatment (including nasal
      catheter, mask oxygen supply and transnasal high flow oxygen therapy) in time.

      T89 have the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, regulating Qi
      and relieving pain. Four clinical trials conducted in China and abroad have shown that T89
      can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of acute high altitude reaction, improve
      blood oxygen saturation, significantly increase the exercise time in treadmill and metabolic
      equivalents of task and enhance exercise tolerance under hypoxic environment. Modern
      pharmacological and gene network-based studies have shown that T89 can improve the oxygen
      carrying capacity of red blood cells, increase oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the
      injury of major organs such as heart, brain, lung and kidney caused by hypoxia, and prevent
      the decrease of oxygen saturation by improving the energy metabolism disorder caused by
      hypoxia. At the same time, T89 can inhibit the reduction of hematocrit, albumin leakage,
      neutrophil CD18 and adhesion factor of endothelial cells (ICAM-1), by which T89 has a good
      therapeutic effect on microcirculation disorders caused by many diseases.

      In conclusion, T89 can improve the ability of carrying oxygen of red blood cells, increase
      the oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of heart, brain, lung and kidney and
      other major organs caused by hypoxia, and it can significantly improve the microcirculation
      disorder. At the same time, in the "Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious
      Atypical Pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes, SARS) P (2003 edition)" has also
      recommended T89 can be used as a traditional Chinese patent medicine to treat patients of
      advanced stage and severe SARS lung asthma syndrome by its effect of promoting blood
      circulation and removing blood stasis. In conclusion, T89 can improve the oxygen saturation
      and the clinical symptoms of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result,
      there may be some benefits for these patients to use T89 in current clinical treatment.

      This exploratory treatment clinical study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving
      oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
      with the study design characterized by open-label, randomized and blank-control. In this
      study, an estimated total of 120-240 male and female patients aged 18-85 years old who have
      been diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), not including critical type in
      severity, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups, the T89
      treatment group and the blank control group, to receive T89 or nothing for up to 14 days on
      the base of a standard treatment recommended by the"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for
      Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment) .

      As planned, this study will be started before March 2020 in hospitals located in Wuhan of
      Hubei province in China and completed at the end of next June 2020.
