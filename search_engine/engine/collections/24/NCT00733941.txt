      healthy individuals. The subjects will be randomly assigned to carry out a total of 24
      exercise-sessions, either at 3 times per week or 8 times per week.

      The two groups will carry out 24 training sessions before 8 weeks of detraining will provide
      how rapidly aerobic capacity is lost due to inactivity. After the detraining period a
      retraining phase is introduced to detect if improvements in aerobic capacity occur more
      rapidly compared to before the first training period

      The subjects will be tested for oxygen uptake, pumping capacity of the heart, blood volume,
      skeletal muscle enzyme activity, endothelial function.
