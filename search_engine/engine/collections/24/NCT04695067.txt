      the effects of fatigue on baseball players' performance and movement control, which can help
      to improve muscle endurance and the quality of movement control. Moreover, fatigue that
      resulted from the prolonged practice can be reduced and recovered faster after exercise, as
      well as more understanding on the ideal pitching posture and compensatory action that caused
      by fatigue, providing a guideline for exercise training. This will not only help to prevent
      fatigue and reduce risk of injury, but also strengthen weak muscle groups and improve
      movement strategies before matches, as well as lengthen the time of being a baseball player.
