    
      A longitudinal observational study examining factors associated with Postoperative Cognitive
      Dysfunction (POCD) utilizing a computerized neurocognitive battery. In addition,
      investigators seek to assess the presence of pre-existing psychiatric disorders and chronic
      pain to determine their relationship with POCD. The study will seek to compare the rates of
      POCD in previously published literature with performance on a computerized neurocognitive
      battery. In addition, the study will seek to determine preoperative, intraoperative and
      postoperative factors associated with POCD by comparing these variables to performance on a
      computerized neurocognitive battery.
