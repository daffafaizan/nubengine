    
      During 60 minutes after routine anesthetic induction and intubation of the endotracheal
      tubes, intracuff pressures will be measured every 10 minutes with a manometer (VBM, Sulz,
      Germany).

      60% nitrous oxide will be added at time 0. For 60 minutes from the beginning of general
      anesthesia, intracuff pressures will be measured every 10 minutes.

      After 60 minutes, Intracuff pressures will be maintained around 20 cm H2O during the
      remaining period of the surgery.

      The questionnaire for a sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia will be questioned at about 1,
      6, and 24 hours after the surgery and the general anesthesia.
