    
      Background: The loss of depth perception due to working in a three-dimensional space based on
      two-dimensional images is one of the challenging aspects of laparoscopy compared to
      conventional open surgery.

      Objectives: To examine the effect of laser visual guidance on laparoscopic performance and
      cognitive load in a simulated setting for novices.

      Methods: Randomised Clinical Trial- Laser visual guidance vs. normal 2 D vision.

      Outcomes:

      Primary outcome: Motor skills performance parameters-movement-time:

      Cumulative instrument movement-time for both the right and left instrument for the test
      session,

      Secondary outcome: 2) The overall composite score.

      Exploratory outcomes: 3) The NASA Task Load index (NASA-TLX).
