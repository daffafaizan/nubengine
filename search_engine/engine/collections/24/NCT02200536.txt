      maternal and child health center in Sweida city-Syria, to receive their vaccination, into
      three groups: test, control 1 and control 2. The test group received an infant oral health
      promotion package including a child oral health pamphlet, a baby toothbrush, fluoride
      toothpaste (1000 ppm) and a trainer cup. Control 1 received only an infant pamphlet, whilst
      Control 2 received no intervention. A mother's self-completed structured questionnaire and an
      infant's clinical examination were completed and performed, at baseline and after one month,
      to assess tooth brushing and bottle-feeding practices as well as the presence of old plaque
      on infant's primary teeth, respectively.
