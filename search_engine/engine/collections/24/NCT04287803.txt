      evaluate the ability to perform a multicentred step wedge design trial. The feasibility
      outcomes will provide evidence for the development of the multicentred study and will capture
      clinical metrics to inform this larger study. A waver of consent will be sought from the
      ethics board with participation consent for paramedics understanding the risk of using a gas
      for analgesia. Patient >= 18 years of age with traumatic pain with a verbal score >= to 4
