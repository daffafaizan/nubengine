      safety of atypical antipsychotic medications that may be taken by women during pregnancy to
      treat a wide range of mood, anxiety, or psychiatric disorders. The primary goal of this
      Registry is to determine the frequency of major malformations, such as heart defects, cleft
      lip, or neural tube defects, in infants exposed to atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy.
      We are currently studying the following medications:

        -  Abilify (aripiprazole)

        -  Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil)

        -  Clozaril (clozapine)

        -  Fanapt (iloperidone)

        -  Geodon (ziprasidone)

        -  Invega (paliperidone)

        -  Latuda (lurasidone)

        -  Rexulti (brexpiprazole)

        -  Risperdal (risperidone)

        -  Saphris (asenapine)

        -  Seroquel (quetiapine)

        -  Zyprexa (olanzapine)

        -  Vraylar (cariprazine)
