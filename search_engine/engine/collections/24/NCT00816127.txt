      increased bleeding tendency in cirrhotic patients. The treatment approach to offset these
      abnormalities may involve transfusion with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets. Fluid
      overload may become a concern as the large amount of FFP (10-20mls/kg or >1,500ml) required
      to achieve the hemostatic effect could be contraindicated in some patients. Furthermore,
      repeated platelet transfusion induces alloimmunization and refractoriness to new transfusion,
      which is an important issue in patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation in
      which HLA-matched and cross-matched platelets may be required. Non-transfusional drugs that
      help to stop bleeding have been used in patients with congenital bleeding disorders.
      1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP, Desmopressin), a synthetic analogue of the
      antidiuretic hormone, L-arginine, has been used as a non-transfusional form of replacement
      therapy in a variety of congenital and acquired bleeding disorders. Through unknown
      mechanisms, DDAVP shortens the prolonged bleeding times of cirrhotic patients despite the
      high plasma concentrations of Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor sound in chronic liver
      disease, indicating that it might be useful as a prophylactic treatment in cirrhotic patients
      undergoing minimally invasive procedures, i.e. dental extraction.
