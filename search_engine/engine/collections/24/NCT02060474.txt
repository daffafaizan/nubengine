      Therapeutics) by individualized dose-escalation, following a pre-defined dose-escalation
      protocol. After the initial dose of Triac (350 microgram) was administered and no predefined
      dose-limiting toxicities were observed, the daily dose was increased progressively in 350
      microgram steps, with a goal of attaining serum total T3 concentrations within the target
      range of 1·4-2·5 nmol per liter. The maintenance Triac dose was continued throughout the rest
      of the study period, but could be further adjusted according to the dose-escalation protocol
      if T3 concentrations were outside the target range during control visits.

      Patients were assessed for study outcomes at baseline and 12 months after starting Triac
      administration. In the interval, patients were evaluated and screened for clinical and
      biochemical signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, adverse events were recorded and
      adherence to therapy was assessed. All study procedures were specified in standard operating
      procedures, and were performed by well-trained investigators. Neuropsychological tests were
      conducted according to their manual. All biochemical measurements were performed in a central
      laboratory (Erasmus Medical Centre). To account for any interference of Triac in the
      measurement of serum T3 concentrations, conventional methods were employed to correct for
      cross-reactivity.
