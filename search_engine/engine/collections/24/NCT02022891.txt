      systematic medical-psychological approach in place for the past 6 years at the Louis Mourier
      Hospital, as compared to the usual practice in 2 other pediatric hospitals for SCD which
      focus essentially on the medical issues associated with SCD. Two psychologists will interview
      80 children and their primary care-takers at Louis Mourier hospital, and 80 children and
      their care-takers of the other two centers, using a standard comprehensive care for SCD. For
      the parents, we propose to use a semi-structured interview including a prepared interview
      guide, the Loneliness Questionnaire, and the parents' version of KIDSCREEN (10 items). For
      the children, according to their age, The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF), the Draw
      a Person in the Rain Test (DPR), the KIDSCREEN questionnaire, and semi-directed interview
      will be used. Relevant information from the patients' medical record directly related to the
      symptomatic expression of the SCD will be noted on a data collection form. This phase is
      scheduled to last 12 months. A statistical and qualitative analysis of the results will be
      carried out at the end of the study.
