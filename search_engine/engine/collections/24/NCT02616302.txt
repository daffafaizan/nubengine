      tested to treat children aged 1 to 11 years who have nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD). This study will look at the effectiveness and side effects of three different
      doses of dexlansoprazole in children with GERD.

      The study will enroll approximately 80 patients. Participants weighing â‰¤30 kg will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive dexlansoprazole 15 or 30 mg,
      and participants who weigh >30 kg will be randomized to receive dexlansoprazole 30 or 60 mg.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study. Parents/caregivers for participants ages 1 to 8 and participants ages 9 to 11 will be
      asked to record any time they have heartburn symptoms in an electronic diary.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 16 weeks, which includes up to 4 weeks to screen for the study. Participants
      will make multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final phone call 5 to 10 days after last dose
      of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
