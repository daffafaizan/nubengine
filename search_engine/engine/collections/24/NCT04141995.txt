      IV over 2 hours, irinotecan 150 mg/m² given concurrently with folinic acid 400 mg/m² IV over
      90 min, followed by a 46-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m². Slow oral digitalization
      will be used starting with a daily dose of 0.125 (patients over age 65) or 0.25 mg (patients
      65 or younger) PO daily. A steady-state will be achieved after five half-lives, which is
      about 7 to 10 days in the average subject. The initial blood level will be obtained one week
      after starting digoxin. Assuming the digoxin level is at steady-state and the renal function
      is stable, there is a linear relationship between digoxin dose and serum concentration. The
      target digoxin level is between 0.8 to 1.2 ng/mL. Patients will receive IV chemotherapy at 2
      week intervals. Restaging imaging will be performed after 4 doses. If the patient has stable
      or responsive disease, an additional 4 doses will be given followed by restaging imaging. The
      patient will then undergo surgical exploration ~ 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy.

      Clinical Endpoints: Primary Endpoints: clinical toxicity. Other endpoints: status of
      pathologic margins, response rate, pathologic stage, progression-free survival, and overall
      survival.

      Correlative Endpoints: Baseline exome sequencing of circulating cell free tumor DNA.
      Measurement of quantity of circulating cell free tumor DNA at 4 week intervals while on
      chemotherapy and prior to surgery; resume at 3 month intervals after surgery. Genomic DNA
      will be collected at baseline for pharmacogenetic studies of polymorphisms that may be
      pertinent for the drugs used in the study. Blood will be collected for analysis of possible
      biomarkers of response to digoxin modulation.
