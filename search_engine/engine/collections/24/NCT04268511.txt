      following surgery related to the lumbosacral and midthoracic dermatomes. CEB can have serious
      undesirable complications such as intravascular and subarachnoid injection, urinary retention
      and motor block. Pudendal nerve block can be used as an alternative to both DPNB and CEB for
      penile surgery such as circumcision. The pudendal nerve is a peripheral nerve combining the
      anterior rami of the sacral plexus nerves (S2-S4) and provides motor and sensory innervation
      to the perineal region.
