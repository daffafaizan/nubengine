      despite the availability of highly effective antimalarial therapy. One of the key
      contributing factors is the delay in the initiation of treatment.

      ArTiMist is a sublingual formulation of the established antimalarial treatment, artemether.
      In previous studies good bioavailability has been demonstrated. In an exploratory study
      (ART003) ArTiMist demonstrated a non statistically significant improvement of 26% (when
      compared to intravenous quinine) in the numbers of patients experiencing a parasite reduction
      of >= 90% within 24 hours of the initiation of treatment.

      This Phase 3 study is being conducted to establish whether treatment with ArTiMist in
      children with severe falciparum malaria or uncomplicated falciparum malaria with
      gastrointestinal complications is at least 20% superior in providing parasitological success
      (defined as >= 90% reduction in parasite count at 24 hours after start of treatment) when
      compared to intravenous quinine.
