      maintain a low-fat diet and stably take the current anterior-lowering therapy for at least 4
      weeks. Randomly enter different dose groups at 1:1. 2: 1 randomized to receive subcutaneous
      injection of IBI306150 mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every two weeks: or subcutaneous injection
      of IBI306 450mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every four weeks , The treatment lasted 12 weeks.
      During randomization, the LDL-C level (<4.8mmol/L or â‰¥4.8mmol/L) observed during the
      screening period visit (VI), and whether ezetimibe was used for stratification. After 12
      weeks, each group entered the 12-week open-period treatment, in which subjects in the IBI306
      group continued to receive IBI306 treatment, and subjects in the placebo group stopped using
      placebo and received IBI306 treatment. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in
      LDL-C levels from baseline at 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints were the changes in blood
      lipid levels from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks, drug safety, and immunogenicity. The
      exploratory endpoint is the population pharmacokinetic characteristics of IBI306 in Chinese
      heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia population. If necessary, the dose of IBI306 will
      be adjusted according to the results of the ongoing multi-dose climbing study. After the open
      period, the subjects will undergo an 8-week safety visit.
