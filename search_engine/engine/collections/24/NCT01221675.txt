    
      The purpose of this open-label prospective optimization and phase I/II clinical trial is to
      examine the safety, optimal dose, targeting, dosimetry and efficacy of PRAIT using the
      humanized anti-CEA x anti-HSG bsMAb TF2 and the 177Lu-IMP-288 peptide pretargeted in patients
      with CEA-positive SCLC or CEA-expressing Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC)

      This study has 2 parts: Study plan I (Optimization study) and Study plan II (Escalating
      activity phase I/II study).

      The Study plan I is designed to optimize the pretargeting procedure using blood
      pharmacokinetics (Pk) and dosimetry in 9 patients receiving escalating doses of TF2 followed
      2 to 4 days later by 1.1 GBq/m2 of 177Lu-IMP-288.

      The study plan II is designed to determined MTD of 177Lu-IMP-288 using dosimetry and toxicity
      data in a phase I/II study performed in patients receiving optimal dose of TF2 bsMAb
      (determined in study plan I) followed 2 to 4 days by escalating activity of 177Lu-IMP-288.

      A pre-therapy imaging study (using TF2 followed 2 to 4 days later by 185 MBq of
      111In-IMP-288) is performed in the two study plans to qualify a patient for treatment with
      the subsequent therapy dose.
