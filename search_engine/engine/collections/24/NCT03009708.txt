      post-graft follow-up (day 30 to 90).

      The activation will be studied spontaneously and after simulation by a CMV (Cytomegalovirus)
      antigen.

      The study will also focus on inflammatory response variation, focusing on the cytokines
      release during the same post-graft follow-up (spontaneously and after CMV antigen
      stimulation).

      This preliminary study could lead to a better understanding of the immune-modulator role of
      inflammation, controlled by the platelets, particularly in the initiation of the
      Graft-versus-host disease in this kind of population.
