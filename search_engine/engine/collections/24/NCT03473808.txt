      a treatment to likely responders. The long-term goal is to determine whether acute changes in
      brain functional connectivity immediately after one treatment session can predict ultimate
      gains in motor function after completing multiple treatment sessions. The objective of this
      study is to determine feasibility and to examine association between change in brain
      functional connectivity after one session and motor gains after completion of all treatment
      sessions. This study is a prospective single-cohort longitudinal study. The treatment is
      task-practice therapy (3d/wk, 18-session) accompanied with concurrent imperceptible wrist
      vibration that is intended to prime the cortical sensorimotor network and enhance hand
      functional recovery in chronic stroke survivors. Hand function will be assessed before/after
      therapy and at 1-month follow-up. Connectivity will be assessed using fMRI and EEG before and
      after a treatment session.
