    
      80 patients will be divided in two equal groups (Group 1: to receive 20% mannitol 0.7 g/kg or
      Group 2: 1.4 g/kg).

      The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. The administration of mannitol
      will start following the induction of general anesthesia. The infusion will be given
      intravenously over 30 minutes.

      Brain relaxation will be assessed by a senior surgeon at the opening of the dura mater on a
      scale from 1 to 4 (1= perfectly relaxed, 2= satisfactorily relaxed, 3= firm brain, 4=bulging
      brain)

      If needed, in case of significant cerebral edema, a rescue dose of 20% mannitol 0.25 g/kg
      will be administered.

      Hemodynamic variables (MAP, heart rate), temperature, urine output, perioperative fluid
      balance, blood loss and laboratory values (blood gases, electrolytes, osmolality, hematocrit,
      glycemia, lactates) will be collected immediately prior to the infusion of mannitol and at
      30, 60, 180 minutes following the administration of mannitol.

      The type of cerebral lesion, its location and size (in 3 dimensions) will be noted. The
      presence of a median-line shift will also be assessed.
