      achieve optimal coverage and reduce burden of early carriage, neonatal pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine (PCV) immunization needs to be considered. This study in the PNG highlands will enrol
      312 infants at birth, who will be randomised to receive PCV either at 1-2-3 months (infant
      schedule according to PNG national EPI schedule) or 0-1-2 months of age (neonatal schedule)
      or receive only routine immunizations (controls). Blood samples will be taken at birth-2-3-4
      months of age, pre- and post-pneumococcal polysaccharide booster (23vPPV) at 9-10 months of
      age (to assess immune memory) and at 18 months at study completion. Carriage will be assessed
      weekly for the first month of life and at regular intervals thereafter. There will be ongoing
      surveillance for respiratory and other diseases throughout the study. In addition to
      serotype-specific IgG, we will examine IgG avidity, IgG subclasses, mucosal IgA and T-cell
      cytokine responses to PCV and pneumococcal protein antigens. To ensure immunological safety,
      particularly for neonatal PCV, immune responses to concomitant vaccines and viral and
      environmental antigens will also be examined as well as overall T-cell maturation.
