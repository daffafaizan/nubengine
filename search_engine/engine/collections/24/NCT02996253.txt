      good functional outcome with American Orthopaedic Foot ane Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot
      scores at 80-89. The extensive surgical field by either a two-incision approach or a single
      longitudinal posterior approach to the Achilles tendon may lead to an increased risk for soft
      tissue problems, both infections and wound healing problems. The endoscopic FHL transfer may
      reduce the risk for soft tissue problems while retaining a good functional outcome. Several
      functional outcome measures and scores are evaluated a year after surgery.

      Prospective study for evaluation of the surgical procedure.
