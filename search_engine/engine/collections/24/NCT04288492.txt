           Group A: Respiratory exercise using respiratory biofeedback device(ResCalm) is applied
           2-3 times / day for 3 minutes until discharge from hospital and once in the recovery
           room before surgery.

           Group B: General surgery schedule without control exercise.

           All patients measure STAI(state trait anxiety inventory) at the operating room entrance
           on the day of surgery.

        2. anesthesia methods Intravenous anesthesia is performed using the target injection
           concentration control method. As an anesthetic, propofol / remifentanil / rocuronium is
           used. The artificial ventilation method is a pressure-controlled ventilation method,
           which maintains an appropriate pressure and performs anesthesia.

        3. postoperative care After anesthesia, the patient wakes up and transfers to the recovery
           room to encourage self-breathing exercise. After entering the recovery room, the
           patient's vital signs (average blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation) and
           analgesic use are checked immediately before leaving.

      The investigators check for the presence of pulmonary complications, visual analog scale
      (VAS), analgesic use, and hospital patient satisfaction for 24 hours after surgery.
