      healthy young women before and after a pelvic floor muscle training. Methods: Thirty-one
      healthy young women were enrolled in an 8-week training program, consisting of bipedal
      exercises performed at home. The PERFECT and Peritron methods were used to estimate the
      efficacy of the intervention on pelvic muscles. Three questionnaires (FSFI, SQ-F and GRISS)
      were applied to assess sexual function. Both procedures were performed on three occasions:
      before, 4 and 8 weeks after the start of the training program. ANOVA for repeat measures and
      Tukey's post hoc were applied to analyze PERFECT and Peritron results, as well as individual
      domains and total scores of the questionnaires. The accuracy measured by the area under the
      ROC curve (AUC) for individual domains of each questionnaire and cross-validated pairwise
      comparison of the three instruments were also analyzed.
