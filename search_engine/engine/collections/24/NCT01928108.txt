      kidney stone disease has been reported as high as 50% at five years. Urine supersaturation is
      a predominant factor in the formation of crystallization and stone disease and is dependent
      on fluid volume. High fluid consumption that dilutes the urine has been shown both in vitro
      and in clinical studies to reduce the tendency for stone crystallization as well as
      effectively decrease stone recurrence. As a result, water intake greater than two liters per
      day is a common initial therapy for prevention of stone disease. However, studies have shown
      that despite physician counseling most patients are only able to modestly increase their
      urine volume through fluid intake. This finding may be due to a discrepancy in patient
      perception of their actual fluid intake and resulting urine volume. The purpose of this
      investigation is to prospectively evaluate the benefit of different methods of educating
      patient regarding their fluid intake through a readily available daily cellular phone
      application to improve overall urine output and reduce risk factors for stone recurrence.
