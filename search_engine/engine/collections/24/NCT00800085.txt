      accelerated progression towards type 1 diabetes. These criteria may help to determine the
      time point and type of prevention may contribute to the composition of homogeneous groups of
      study subjects (based on residual beta cell mass, homogeneous risk of beta cell destruction
      during intervention) and may lead to the identification of functional markers that could be
      used as surrogate endpoints. This may reduce the number of subjects needed to treat as well
      as the follow-up time necessary to study significant effects of the test substance.
