           multicentric database (secured internet link, via SecutrialÂ® software). for children
           with prenatal diagnosis of this kind of malformation. This study is conducted by a
           multidisciplinary team, involving obstetricians, neonatologists, pneumologists,
           pediatric surgeons, radiologists and anatomopathologists.

        2. To create a tissue biobank

      Outcomes:

        1. Contribute to the definition of a standardized procedure at the Swiss level for the
           treatment of patients suffering from these malformations,

        2. Improve the assessment of lesion evolution related to CLA, and

        3. Possibly validate some biomarkers, which could help to identify individuals at risk. On
           the long term, these results could also support the development of innovative therapies
           targeting the factors involved in lung development.
