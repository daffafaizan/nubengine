    
      This is a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated
      dose of DMF in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients with relapsed/refractory
      CLL not amenable to available therapies are eligible. This patient population is in need of
      novel therapies, particularly if progressing after, intolerant of, or unable to receive oral
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie ibrutinib, idelalisib).

      For Dose Level 1, DMF (Tecfidera formulation) will be administered at a dose of 120 mg PO BID
      (approximately 12 hours apart) for 2 x 28 day cycles.

      For Dose Level 2, DMF will be administered at the currently used dose for patients with
      multiple sclerosis: at the standard FDA approved dose of 120 mg PO BID (approximately 12
      hours apart) for 1 week, then escalating to the assigned dose of (240mg PO BID for the
      remainder of 2 x 28 day cycles. The 1 week lead-in at 120 mg is to assist in toleration and
      initial side effects and is as per the standard prescribing information.

      For Dose Level 3, DMF will be administered at the currently used dose for patients with
      multiple sclerosis: 120 mg PO BID for 1 week, then escalate to the dose of 360mg PO BID for
      the remainder of 2 x 28 day cycles.
