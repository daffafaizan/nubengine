      medical challenge. To date almost every second patient with heart failure has a preserved
      ejection fraction and recent data show that outcomes in these patients are as bad as in those
      with reduced ejection fraction. In clinical routine the diagnosis of HFpEF is complicated by
      indirect assessment of diastolic function. Mechanistically the diastolic dysfunction is among
      others believed to be caused by the development of diffuse myocardial fibrosis with an
      increase of extracellular matrix.

      Direct assessment of the intrinsic diastolic function and stiffness of the ventricle can be
      obtained by pressure-volume-curve tracings through a conductance catheter. Although this
      offers the benefit of assessing load-dependent and load-independent parameters of diastolic
      function as well as information on contractility and ventricular-arterial coupling, the use
      of this technique is limited by its invasiveness in daily care.

      Newer MRI techniques have made it possible to quantify not only local fibrosis but also
      diffuse fibrosis (i.e. T1-Mapping) and determine extracellular volumes.

      Moreover, the role of right ventricular function is in HFpEF is not well defined.

      Aim of the current study is therefore to evaluate the role of MRI in assessing cardiac
      fibrosis in the context of impaired LV diastolic function in HFpEF patients, as well as to
      evaluate the role of systolic and diastolic right ventricular functional impairment in this
      patient cohort.
