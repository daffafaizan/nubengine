    
      This is a 2-cohort, multicenter study in subjects with moderate to severe LI. Adults (Cohort
      A) and adults and adolescents (Cohort B) will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to 1 of
      2 doses of active or vehicle and treated twice weekly for 90 days. Subjects who complete the
      randomized, double-blind portion of the study will be eligible to enter a 90 day, open-label
      extension study.

      Approximately 15 adults (â‰¥18 years old) will be randomized into the first cohort of subjects
      (Cohort A) in a 1:1:1 ratio and treated twice weekly for up to 90 days. If no safety issues
      are identified, both adults and adolescents (ages 12-17 years, inclusive) will be allowed to
      enroll in Cohort B. Subjects in Cohort B will be randomized 1:1:1 and treated twice weekly
      for up to 90 days in the same manner as subjects in Cohort A.

      All subjects who complete 90 days of double-blind study treatment will be eligible to enroll
      in a 90 open-label extension. Subjects in the open-label extension will receive active twice
      weekly for up to 90 days.
