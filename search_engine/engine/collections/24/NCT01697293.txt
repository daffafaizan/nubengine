    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of PTX-200 (triciribine phosphate) given on
      days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days (maximum of 9 doses) when combined with weekly paclitaxel (80
      mg/m^2) for 12 weeks in patients with metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I and Expansion
      Cohort) II. To determine the pathologic response rate (Residual Cancer Burden [RCB] score
      0-1) after sequential weekly paclitaxel plus PTX 200 weekly, 3 weeks out of 4, followed by
      doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) (60 mg/m^2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m^2) every 2
      weeks x 4 cycles in patients with clinical stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer. (Phase II).

      III. To determine the feasibility and safety of the combination of sequential weekly
      paclitaxel plus PTX-200 (days 1, 8, and 15) followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide. (Phase
      II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate pre-treatment levels of erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB)1, 2, 3, 4 and
      zinc finger protein 217 (ZNF217), and phosphorylated levels of v-akt murine thymoma viral
      oncogene homolog 1 (Akt), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (acute-phase
      response factor) (STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) to
      pathologic (RCB score 0-1) response (Sebti laboratory [lab]). (Phase I or II) II. To
      correlate the percent decrease in the levels of phosphorylated (phospho-)Akt (S473),
      phospho-S6 (S235-236), phospho-proline-rich Akt substrate, 40 kDa (PRAS40) (threonine
      [Thr]246), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), Stathmin, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase,
      isozyme 1 (PDK1), cyclin D1, phospho-STAT3, ras homolog gene family, member C (Rho C), and
      phospho-Erk 1-2 with pathologic response rate (RCB score 0-1), percent inhibition of
      proliferation (Ki-67) and percent induction of apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase dUTP nick end labeling [Tunel]) (Sebti lab). (Phase I or II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of triciribine phosphate followed by an
      expansion cohort and a phase II study.

      COURSES A 1-12 (PHASE I & II): Patients receive triciribine phosphate intravenously (IV) over
      60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, 29, 36, 43, 57, 64, and 71 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 79. Treatment repeats every week for 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COURSES B 1-4 (PHASE II): Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY (PHASE II): Eligible patients undergo modified radical mastectomy, radical
      mastectomy, segmental mastectomy or lumpectomy with an axillary lymph node dissection or
      biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients with metastatic disease are followed up every 3
      months for 1 year and patients with locally advanced disease are followed up every 6 months
      for 2 years and then yearly for 3 years.
