      tools, and health counseling using tailored SMS and individual phone-calls to the patients,
      for self-management of T2DM. Maintaining daily symptom diaries (described below) by an easy
      way of self-monitoring appear to offer a valid and reliable way of assessing behaviours. In
      addition, the patients are able to view their own registrations on the Smartphone, i.e. a
      programmable mobile phone with a touch sensitive screen. The self-help system, called the
      "Few Touch application", recently tested on 12 people with T2DM at NST, University Hospital
      of North Norway (UNN), will form the basis for the patients' mobile interaction system.
