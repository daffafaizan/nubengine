      and tolerability of FMT in adults with BD depression.

      Objective 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of a currently accepted
      approved therapy for BD depression + FMT in individuals with BD depression. This will be
      assessed through a change in the Montgomery-Ãƒsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total
      score from baseline (pre-intervention) to the final visit (week 24). The investigators will
      also assess the proportion of patients withdrawing from study due to inadequate control of
      depressive symptoms.

      Secondary objective 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of FMT on anxiety symptoms and global
      function/overall improvement in participants with BD depression. Secondary objective 3: To
      determine the safety and tolerability of FMT in individuals with BD depression. Safety will
      be evaluated by solicited and unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events,
      throughout the study period. Tolerability will be assessed using the Toronto Side Effect
      Scale (TSES). This is a 32-item instrument that is designed to establish incidence,
      frequency, and severity of CNS, gastrointestinal, and sexual side effects.

      Secondary objective 4: To assess the effect of FMT on microbiome profile (community structure
      and functional metagenome) and fecal metabolome. Changes in fecal microbiome profile and
      fecal metabolome from baseline to the final visit will be assessed using next generation
      sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, respectively. Changes in mood
      rating scales will be correlated with a specific microbiome and metabolome signature.
      Intestinal microbiome and metabolome of healthy donors will also be assessed.
