      screening period, a 6 to 7 months treatment period, and a 30 day follow-up. All patients with
      stable disease or who have achieved partial or complete response and for whom dosing has been
      safe and reasonably well-tolerated may continue additional treatment cycles on the same
      regimen. Any patient whose imaging assessment shows disease progression after receiving at
      least two cycles of single agent weekly paclitaxel on ARM 1 may then be offered treatment
      with the combination of EP-100 plus paclitaxel in the same dose regimen as ARM 2.
