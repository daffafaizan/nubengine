      the left atrial appendage (LAA). Surgical closure of LAA can be performed using ligation,
      stapler or other devices designed for this purpose during cardiac surgery. However, current
      evidence for surgical closure of LAA is scarce and no large scale randomized prospective
      clinical trials addressing this issue have been published. American College of Cardiology
      (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines state that LAA exclusion should be
      considered in patients with recurrent and persistent AF who remain symptomatic with heart
      rate control and where antiarrhythmic medication is not tolerated or no longer effective.
      Current European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines conclude that there
      is no proven benefit of surgical LAA exclusion in terms of stroke reduction or mortality
      benefit (level of evidence 2a B), and if exclusion is contemplated, devices designed for
      appendage exclusion should be used rather than a cut-and-sew or stapling technique. These
      guidelines are based on small poorly designed descriptive trials and only one small
      randomized trial.

      LAA-CLOSURE trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of prophylactic surgical closure of LAA
      in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.
