    
      The purpose of this registry is to collect acute and follow-up (up to 12 months) safety and
      efficacy data on the ZENFlex™ Peripheral Stent System in the stent-assisted angioplasty
      treatment of patients with de novo or restenotic lesion(s) of the native superficial femoral
      artery (SFA) and/or proximal popliteal artery (PPA, P1 segment) when used according to IFU.
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled in this study at up to 5 sites in Germany.

      This study is a prospective, single-arm observational registry and does not include an active
      control arm. Therefore, no formal sample size calculation has been performed. All subjects
      will be evaluated at pre-discharge and during clinical follow-up visits 6 (182 ± 30 days) and
      12 (365 ± 30 days) months post-procedure.

      Primary endpoints are patency rate after one year and composite of freedom from device and
      procedure-related death through 12 months post procedure as well as freedom from both target
      limb major amputation and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization.
