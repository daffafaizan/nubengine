      exacerbation (6 weeks). And then we would like to correlate this improvement with the
      variations of oxidative stress, muscle strength, respiratory function and systemic
      inflammation.

      We also would like to find a relation between the new hospitalizations for respiratory
      exacerbation and the initial value of endothelial function.

      Then we would like to evaluate the relationship between the cardiovascular risk and the COPD
      severity.
