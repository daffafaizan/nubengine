      Continuous femoral nerve block combined with selective tibial nerve block provides optimal
      pain control in the anterior and posterior aspect of the knee respectively. However, in
      patients with pre-existing neuropathy of the sciatic nerve, the blockade of tibial nerve is
      contraindicated because of increased risk of nerve damage that may lead to exacerbation of
      neurologic symptoms. In such patients where selective tibial nerve block cannot be offered,
      ultrasound guided posterior knee capsular injection may be an alternative technique for
      controlling posterior knee pain after surgery. Posterior capsular injection by surgeons
      intraoperatively, when combined with femoral nerve block has been shown to provide pain
      control after total knee replacement. With posterior capsular injection, the main trunk of
      the tibial nerve is spared and only the terminal nerve endings innervating the posterior knee
      joint is blocked providing effective pain control. In this study, the efficacy of ultrasound
      guided posterior capsular injections performed pre-operatively will be compared to tibial
      nerve block in controlling knee pain after surgery.

      The results of this study may help establish the efficacy of ultrasound guided posterior
      capsular injection as an alternative to tibial nerve block in patients undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty.
