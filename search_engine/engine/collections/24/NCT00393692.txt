      industrialized world beyond 50 years of age. Ageing changes of the retinal pigment epithelium
      (RPE) play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In postmitotic RPE cells
      autofluorescent lipofuscin granules accumulate with age in the lysosomal compartment mainly
      as a byproduct of constant phagocytosis of membranous disks shed from photoreceptor outer
      segments. With the advent of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy fundus autofluorescence
      mediated by RPE-lipofuscin accumulation can be visualized in vivo: We plan to identify fundus
      autofluorescence changes as predictive factors for the development of late stage
      manifestations and their variation over time. Furthermore, we plan to determine the effect of
      increased focal accumulations of autofluorescent material on retinal sensitivity using fundus
      perimetry. Examination of human donor eyes with AMD will allow for correlation of fundus
      autofluorescence alterations in vivo and in vitro. These investigations will be performed not
      only to better understand the role of lipofuscin accumulation in AMD but also to manipulate
      these mechanisms for both experimental and therapeutic ends.
