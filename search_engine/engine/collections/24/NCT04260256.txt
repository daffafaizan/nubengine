      patient will be selected for radiomics and biopsy. Both lesions will be assessed for [18F]F
      AraG uptake before and after CkIT. Only one lesion will be biopsied twice (once before and
      once after CkIT treatment close to the time of imaging), and the other lesion will not be
      manipulated and used as a control.

      There will be a pre therapy scan [18F]F AraG which will be administered anytime within a 14
      day period prior to the initial Day 1 CkIT administration. There will also be a post therapy
      scan which will be performed within 3 to 6 weeks after the initial CkIT dose. The timing of
      the second [18F]F AraG scans may be altered based on preliminary results from the initial
      patient scan results, and could be obtained during the first 2 weeks after initiation of
      therapy.

      The investigators will compare the [18F]F AraG activity (based on development of tumoral
      volumes of interest (VOIs) pre and post CkIT in both lesions.
