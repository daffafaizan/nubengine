      children with special needs aged 6-18 years.

      The study has 3 stages: 1) Simulator validity study 2) Powered mobility outcome measures
      reliability and validity for children 6-18 years 3) Intervention study to compare simulator
      based practice and powered mobility practice.

        1. Simulator validity study included 30 children aged 6-18 years, proficient powered
           mobility drivers. All participants had physical disabilities- CP or Neuromuscular
           conditions.

        2. This stage included the first 30 children from the intervention study. Data for the
           study was based on the first evaluation out of the two evaluations in the study.

        3. This stage included 36 children aged 6-18 years in need of powered mobility practice to
           become a proficient driver. The particpants were divided into two groups- experimental
           (simulator based practice) and control group (standard powered wheelchair practice).
