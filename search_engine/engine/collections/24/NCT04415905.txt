      and S group are anesthetized with propofol and sevoflurane, respectively. Irrespective of
      assigned group, all participants receive caudal block with 1.5 ml/kg of 0.15% ropivacaine (up
      to 30 ml per individual participant). All anesthetic procedures except for main anesthetic
      agent are the same in all participants. ONSD is measured at the following time points: before
      (T0), immediately after (T1), and 10 min (T2) and 30 min(T3) after caudal block. Two
      measurements of each optic nerve sheath are acquired in each eye. The mean value of the four
      measurements is considered as the ONSD at each time point.
