    
      Aim 1: To determine levels of physical functioning, physical activity, incidence of frailty
      and inflammation status in prevalent home dialysis patients in the University of Utah Home
      Dialysis program and compare them to in-center hemodialysis patients who are matched for age,
      gender, comorbidities and dialysis vintage. Hypothesis 1: Patients on home therapies will
      have higher physical functioning, be more active and fewer will be frail compared to matched
      patients treated with in-center hemodialysis.

      Aim 2: To determine the patterns of change in physical functioning and physical activity over
      the first 18 months of initiating dialysis therapy. Hypothesis 2: Physical functioning and
      physical activity will be maintained in patients initiating home dialysis therapy, whereas,
      those initiating in-center dialysis will deteriorate in physical functioning and physical
      activity.

      Aim 3: To determine the effects of counseling and encouragement of physical activity in
      prevalent home dialysis patients on physical functioning, physical activity. Hypothesis 3:
      Compared to usual care, patients who are counseled and encouraged to participate in
      independent home walking exercise will improve physical functioning and health-related
      quality of life.

      Aim 4: To determine the association of inflammation with physical functioning in home
      dialysis patients and with changes in physical activity. Hypothesis 4: Lower physical
      functioning is associated with inflammation and increased physical activity will improve
      physical functioning and reduce the associated inflammation.
