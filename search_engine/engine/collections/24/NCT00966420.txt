      intestine by using a traction assisted technique.

      The traction will be performed by using a haemoclip connected to surgical suture materials.
      The haemoclip will be fixed to the intestinal mucosa next to the lesion and a loop will be
      mounted to perform an endoscopic mucosal resection.

      The aim of the study is to show the feasibility of this technique.
