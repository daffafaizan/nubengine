      residual/relapsed gastric cancer. For the former ones, 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) based concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy is a recommended treatment regimen. Concurrent capecitabine
      chemoradiotherapy showed similar results. So far, more and more studies have shown that drugs
      targeting at EGFRs play an important role in antitumor treatment. Nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR
      monoclonal antibody, has shown its safety and efficiency in many phase I/II studies. Because
      of poor survival of patients with inoperable locally advanced or residual/relapsed gastric
      cancer, the efficiency of nimotuzumab plus concurrent capecitabine chemoradiotherapy need to
      be further analyzed.
