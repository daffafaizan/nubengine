      enhance external validity and create a parsimonious intervention that can be integrated into
      busy clinical practices. This is a pilot study and is not designed to definitively provide
      evidence for a treatment effect, but rather to establish feasibility and to optimize the
      intervention and study procedures in preparation for a larger trial. We will conduct a pilot
      RCT comparing a remotely supervised exercise program (REM) to an unsupervised exercise
      program (UNSUP). Data will be collected upon enrollment (T0; at least 2 weeks prior to
      beginning chemoradiation), immediately prior to chemoradiation (T1), immediately
      post-chemoradiation (T2) and 1-month post-chemoradiation (T3).
