      severe functional impairment in one or more life roles. All study participants completed
      telephone interviews at three points in time: study entry (pre-intervention); 8-weeks later
      (immediate post-intervention); and 6-months after intervention (approximately 8 months after
      study entry). Blinded interviewers administered valid and reliable outcome assessments that
      measured changes in subjects' knowledge about mental illness; emotional well-being;
      empowerment; hopefulness; self-advocacy; and recovery. All study participants were
      compensated for their time at each interview. All BRIDGES instructors were people in recovery
      from serious mental illnesses who were certified and experienced BRIDGES teachers. Fidelity
      to the BRIDGES curriculum was assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the study.
