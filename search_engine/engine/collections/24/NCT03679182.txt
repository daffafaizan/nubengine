      tablet will be given to patients who fail two standard treatment medications for nausea and
      vomiting within 30 minutes after the first vomiting episode. Other doses of olanzapine will
      be given at 12, 24, and 36 hours following the first dose concurrently with standard regimen.

      Patients with emesis will be followed up after receiving olanzapine every 12 hour for 48
      hours. We will record the frequency of vomiting, nausea, and retching.
