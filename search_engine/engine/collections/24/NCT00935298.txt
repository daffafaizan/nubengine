    
      VISITS

      The participation of the patient in this study will be 3 months. For this period, 9 visits
      are planned

      •Before transplantation

      Visit 1: inclusion visit(in the 4-7 days before transplantation),A blood taking will be
      carried out on EDTA tube for CYP 3A5 genotyping in the 4-7 days before renal transplantation.

      • After transplantation

      Visit 2: D3

      Visit 3: D5

      Visit 4: D7

      Visit 5: D14

      Visit 6: D21

      Visit 7: M1 + - 3 days

      Visit 8: M2 + - 3 days

      Visit 9: M3 + - 3 days

      Treatment

      After transplantation, the patients will be treated by MMF, corticosteroids and tacrolimus at
      a dosage adapted to their genotype(CYP3A5*1/*1 type and CYP3A5*1/*3 type administer
      0.15mg/kg/d，CYP3A5*3/*3 type administer 0.08mg/kg/d).

      The MMF will be given according to weight in 3 months after transplantation as follows:

      below 50 kilogram(kg) 0.25g bid (0.5g pre day)

      50~70kg 0.50g bid (1.0g pre day)

      70~90kg 0.75g bid (1.5g pre day)

      Exceed 90kg 1.0g bid (2.0g pre day)

      Corticosteroid therapy in decreasing amount as follows:

      D0 - D15: 20 Mg

      D16 - D30: 15 Mg

      D30 - D45: 10 Mg

      D46 - M3 5 Mg

      The determination of tacrolimus blood concentration will be carried out on Day
      3,5,7,14,18,21,28,35,49,63,77,90. The daily amounts of Tacrolimus could be modified if
      necessary to reach the desired blood concentrations. The total duration of the study for a
      patient is 3 months after transplantation.

      If the present study is able to confirm an advantage for a genotype-driven algorithm, in
      terms of improved efficiency, therapeutic efficacy, especially, safety, a pharmacogenetics
      approach to dosing can be recommended as the basis wide quality improvement initiative that
      should improve patient outcomes, reduce resource use (costs of achieving safe and therapeutic
      immunosuppression), and reduce adverse clinical events.
