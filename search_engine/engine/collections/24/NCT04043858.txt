      such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and endocannabinoids, which cause splanchnic
      vasodilatation, increased blood flow through this area, and a decrease in peripheral vascular
      resistance and the effective arterial volume with resulting reduction in renal blood flow
      with subsequent activation of rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which in turn leads to
      renal vasoconstriction and salt and water retention. The retained water then accumulates in
      the peritoneal cavity under the effect of portal hypertension and low albumin.

      The International Ascites Club defines refractory ascites as ascites that cannot be mobilized
      or prevented from early recurrence after large-volume paracentesis despite medical therapy
      and dietary sodium restriction.

      There are two varieties of refractory ascites: diuretic-resistant ascites that is
      unresponsive to the maximal tolerable dose of diuretic therapy and diuretic-intractable
      ascites when complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, renal dysfunction, or electrolyte
      abnormalities limit the use of diuretics in the effective therapeutic dose (Cárdenas and
      Arroyo, 2005)

      The therapeutic options for refractory ascites are serial therapeutic paracentesis,
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, peritoneovenous shunt, and liver
      transplantation.

      Midodrine is transformed into the active metabolite desglymidodrine, which is an α1 receptor
      agonist causing an increase in vascular tone and increase in blood pressure without
      β-adrenergic receptors stimulation so, it can improve systemic and renal hemodynamics in
      non-azotemic cirrhotic patients by counteracting mesenteric vasodilatation, which is
      accentuated in cirrhosis. It diffuses poorly across the blood-brain barrier with no central
      effects.

      In a study included 600 adult patients with refractory ascites, midodrine was added to
      diuretic therapy and lead to enhancement of diuresis with the improvement of systemic, renal
      hemodynamics and short-term survival. Approximately, the only use of midodrine hydrochloride
      in children was in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) which showed a good
      efficacy and safety profile.
