    
      The aim of this study is to validate the diagnostic value of Real-time Tissue Elastography®
      by comparison with liver histology, serum marker or FibroScan® in chronic hepatitis B or C
      patients.Real-time Tissue Elastography®, biopsy and serum maker are performed.

      If in the hospital they can perform FibroScan®, FobroScan® also be performed. The subjects
      must be scheduled for liver biopsy either prior to treatment (treatment naïve) or, if
      previously treated, they must have been off treatment for at least six months. The time
      between the Real-time Tissue Elastography® , biopsy, blood sampling and FiroScan® must not
      exceed four weeks.
