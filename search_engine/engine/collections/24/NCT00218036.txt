    
      This is a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining two doses of
      modafinil (200 and 400 mg) and citalopram (20 and 40 mg) in the treatment of methadone
      maintained cocaine dependent individuals.

      Participants will first be given methadone to determine its tolerated and effective doses.
      Most participants will be able to reach a stable dose of methadone within 7 to 10 days of
      methadone initiation. When 80% of the projected dose of methadone has been achieved,
      participants will begin the medication regimen of modafinil or citalopram. Modafinil will be
      given over a 7-day period. Dosing of modafinil will begin at 200 mg and, depending on the
      individual, may increase to 400 mg. Citalopram will be given in increasing doses, starting at
      20 mg and increasing to 40mg.
