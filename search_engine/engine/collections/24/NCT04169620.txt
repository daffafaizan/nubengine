      stages 1 to 3 (Hoehn and Yahr Scale), older than 40 years, in the off phase (not medicated)
      and with a score greater or equal to 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination Scale, without
      any medical contraindications and who accepted the study norms (regular assistance and active
      participation). The exclusion criteria were: individuals who did not comply with the above
      mentioned criteria, and the presence of articular and/or muscular lesions in the lower limbs
      affecting independent gait.

      The procedure of randomization was performed for the overall sample using stratified
      randomization controlling for the Hoehn & Yahr stage employing Excell software (Microsoft
      Excell 2013: Microsoft Corp. Redmond WA).

      The participants received an initial assessment on dry land lasting 30-45 minutes, performed
      by a physiotherapist not involved in the study. Timetable norms were disclosed as well as
      recommendations regarding appropriate clothing for the activity. A baseline assessment was
      performed prior to commencing therapy. This was repeated upon completion of all sessions
      while a follow-up assessment took place one month later.
