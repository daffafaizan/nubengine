      continues to pose a challenge to practitioners. Opioids are recommended for the treatment of
      severe acute SCD pain, and have been used successfully within the hospital setting.
      Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for acute SCD pain, however
      there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of oral NSAIDs in combination with
      parenteral opioids in adults with SCD.Data from acute pain research suggests that oral
      ibuprofen is one of the best NSAIDs for combination treatment with morphine via PCA.

      This is a randomised controlled trail to evaluate the effectiveness of oral ibuprofen plus
      intravenous Diamorphine or morphine via PCA. The results will provide the evidence needed to
      recommend whether or not ibuprofen should be used in acute SCD pain.
