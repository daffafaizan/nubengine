      Metabolic Activity Profiles of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) analysis method in
      identifying lung cancer.

      The analysis method described in this protocol is a novel simple plausible immunological
      approach which is non-invasive, high throughput, real-time quantitative monitoring of
      metabolic activity (MA) profiles of fresh Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) in
      response to various reagents at different concentrations.

      Study Design Prospective, three groups, open, comparative, controlled study. No. of Sites One
      Study Population Man and Women aged 18 - 90 years old. No. of Subjects A total of 950
      completed, evaluated subjects will be enrolled in this study.

      The groups sample size is as follows:

      Group 1 - 75 subjects Group 2 - 75 subjects Group 3 - 150 subjects Group 4 - 650 subjects

      Primary End Point 1. Positive and negative diagnosis (scored 0/1 dichotomously) in accordance
      with clinical data collected

      Data Analysis and Statistics Multiple MA profiles including a huge number of MA rates values
      are obtained for each subject. In order to develop a dynamic clinical analysis that is
      updated with every new subject, and to extract patterns from this large data base, The
      research team designed computer programming using Data Mining tools, which combine methods
      from statistics and artificial intelligence with database management.

      Blood test will be perform from each subject. The blood sample in eah subject will be compare
      to his status : healthy non smoker, healthy smoker, COPD or diagnosed with lung cancer.
