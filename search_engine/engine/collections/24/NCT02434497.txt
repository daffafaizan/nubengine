      rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (QD) versus placebo QD in children and adolescents (aged from 6
      to <18 years) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) (Study D3561C00004).

      The study is designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of rosuvastatin 20 mg
      in pediatric patients with HoFH.

      In this study all patients will receive rosuvastatin 20 mg QD. Investigators will also be
      permitted to titrate the dose of rosuvastatin from 20 to 40 mg per day if they feel it is
      warranted to more aggressively treat patients' elevated LDL-C levels. This up-titration will
      not be permitted in Asian patients. Pharmacokinetic data of the trough plasma exposure of
      rosuvastatin will also be assessed for the pediatric patients with HoFH taking a daily dose
      of rosuvastatin 40 mg.

      The primary outcome measures to be assessed include 1) Adverse events, including:

        -  The frequency and severity of adverse events,

        -  Rate of discontinuations due to adverse events,

        -  Abnormal serum and urine laboratory values, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical
           examinations, and vital signs; and 2) Assessments of growth.
