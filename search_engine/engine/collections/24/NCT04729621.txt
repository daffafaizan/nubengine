    
      This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to demonstrate similar
      efficacy and safety of TVB-009 compared to Prolia® administered subcutaneously at doses of 60
      mg every 26 weeks. Approximately 326 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis will be
      randomized to receive either TVB-009 or Prolia®. At week 52, patients in the Prolia® arm will
      be re-randomized 1:1 to either continue with a third dose of Prolia® or transition to TVB-009
      and receive a single dose of TVB-009 in the transition period to assess immunogenicity and
      safety after a transition from Prolia® to TVB-009. The total treatment duration for each
      patient is 78 weeks.
