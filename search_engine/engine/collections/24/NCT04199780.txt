    
      The proposed study employs a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design to evaluate the
      effects of tDCS, brief Cognitive-Behavioral (CB) intervention and their combination on pain
      among veterans undergoing unilateral TKA or THA. 132 patients undergoing TKA/THA will be
      randomly assigned to one of four groups:

        1. Group1- real tDCS + real CB intervention

        2. Group2- real tDCS + education-only-control intervention

        3. Group3- sham tDCS + real CB intervention

        4. Group4- sham tDCS +education-only-control intervention

      Participants will receive 2 tDCS/CBI treatments on the day of their surgery, and 2 tDCS/CBI
      treatments the day after their surgery. Participants' perioperative medication usage and pain
      ratings will be tracked during postoperative hospital stay. Follow-up data regarding pain and
      opioid use will be collected at 1, 3 and 6-months.
