      the PPH is poorly understood, but involves an exaggerated insulin response to a meal and
      subsequent hypoglycemia. We have shown that children with PPH after Nissen fundoplication
      have abnormally exaggerated secretion of GLP-1, an incretin hormone with multiple glucose
      lowering effects including stimulation of insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon
      secretion. In this study we seek to examine the causal role of endogenous GLP-1 in PPH after
      fundoplication by evaluating the effects of antagonizing the GLP-1 receptor with
      exendin-(9-39) on key metabolic features of PPH.
