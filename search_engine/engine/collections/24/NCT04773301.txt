      control of pain in hip fracture surgery in the elderly. The optimum would be to use an
      anesthetic with the lowest possible latency, since this will favor the start of surgery. And,
      at the same time, with a more lasting analgesia with the least motor impairment. Therefore,
      it is essential to collect data on efficacy (effective block that allows us to mobilize the
      patient), latency, and analgesic scales appropriate to the cognitive state of the study
      sample.
