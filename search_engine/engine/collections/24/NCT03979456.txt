    
      This is a prospective randomized phase 3 study comparing two dosing regimens of Rituximab in
      long-term treatment of MS. Primary endpoint is no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) in a
      non-inferiority analysis between 12-months dosing interval of 500 mg rituximab with 6-months
      dosing interval. The endpoint is a compound of being free from release, new or enlarging MRI
      lesions and sustained progression of disability measured by EDSS.

      Each patient will have one treating physician responsible for all ongoing medical questions
      and decisions regarding continuation in the study and one examining physician performing the
      blinded Expanded Disability Status Scale examination and assessments of exacerbations. The
      coordinating nurse will administer the study-related tests and administer the rituximab
      infusions. MRI investigations will be performed blinded for the dosing arm allocation.

      Randomization will be performed via a randomization module in the national Swedish MS
      registry. The patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and receive their treatments in
      accordance with clinical practice. Thus, the study will mimic the real-life situation in
      which the treatments will be administered. This will lead to a high degree of validity in
      relation to expected outcome in clinical practice.
