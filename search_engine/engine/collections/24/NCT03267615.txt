    
      Patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) as evident by HVPG>5mmHg or liver biopsy
      showing F3/F4 fibrosis or as suggested by liver stiffness measurement (LSM) >15kPa can be
      included in the VICIS study. In fact most patients will be recruited on the day of HVPG
      measurement for screening for clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) or on the day
      of upper GI endoscopy for screening for the presence of varices. Next to the detailled
      characterization of patient characteristics by epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory
      parameters, the degree of portal hypertension will be assessed by HVPG, liver stiffness will
      be assessed by transient elastography, the presence of ascites, splenomegaly, portosystemic
      collaterals, PVT and liver lesions will be assessed by ultrasound. In addition, the included
      patients will be asked to participate in biobank sampling including serum/plasma, ascitic
      fluid, urine, GI tract mucosal biopsies, stool, liver biopsies and stool. All patients
      recruited in the VICIS study will be prospectively followed every 3 monhts (decompenated
      ACLD) or every 6 months (compensated ACLD) patients with clinical visits at the Cirrhosis
      Outpatient Clinic at the Vienna General Hospital. These assessments include the recording of
      decompensating events (such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding), screening
      for PVT and HCC, and recording of medications.
