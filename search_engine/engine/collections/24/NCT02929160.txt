      manipulation in the setting of active, untreated infection with concomitant urinary tract
      obstruction can lead to life-threatening sepsis. Therefore, urgent decompression of the
      collecting system is warranted.

      There are two options for urgent decompression of an obstructed collecting system:

        1. Image-guided percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement

        2. Cystoscopic retrograde placement of a ureteric stent

      This strategy allows drainage of infected urine and penetration of antibiotics to the
      affected renal unit. Definitive stone manipulation should be delayed until the infection is
      cleared following an appropriate course of antimicrobial therapy.

      Both the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA)
      provide guidelines for management of an obstructed kidney. Both organisations provide
      evidence-based statements of the highest recommendation that urgent decompression of the
      kidney is mandated in the setting of sepsis. However, neither organisation recommend one
      decompression modality over the other. There is a lack of high quality up-to-date evidence to
      support a consensus view that one method of decompression is superior to the other.

      This study aims to determine the most effective method of renal decompression in cases of
      obstruction and sepsis associated with ureteric calculi.
