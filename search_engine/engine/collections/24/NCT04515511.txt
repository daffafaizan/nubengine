      fluid strategy has been applied to shock resuscitation for fewer complications and shorter
      hospital stays compared with a liberal fluid strategy. Therefore, it is a reasonable step to
      assess the patient's response to fluid infusion to avoid excessive fluid
      administration.Mini-fluid challenge allows the selection of fluid responders by inducible
      changes of hemodynamic parameters after changing the preload gaining popularity. The mini
      fluid challenge was firstly described by Muller et al. in 2011. They found an infusion of 100
      mL colloid over 1 minute and the assessment by cardiac output using velocity time integral
      (VTi) at the aortic outflow tract could predict fluid responsiveness (FR). Since then, a
      total of seven investigations have been published. Although a mini-fluid challenge may help
      the decision-making process of fluid management, the investigation results differed from each
      other, especially in minimal volume and cut off value of hemodynamic parameters change.
      Meanwhile, we noticed that when measuring CO, the method of thermodilution by pulmonary
      artery catheter (PAC), which is the gold standard of CO measurement, was not used in these
      studies. Furthermore, the majority participants of the studies were perioperative patients in
      a stable hemodynamic state.Therefore, there are two question needed to be answered:what is
      the minimal infusion volume in effectively predicting fluid responsiveness, and whether
      mini-volume can perform a real change in septic shock patients. Thus, it is necessary to
      explore the minimal volume in fluid challenge by PAC and test its reliability in detecting
      responders (R) and nonresponders (NR).
