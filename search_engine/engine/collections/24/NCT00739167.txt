      Primary

        -  Assess the quality of life (QOL) as defined by the presence or absence of physical,
           social, emotional, and functional distress in patients with primary or metastatic liver
           cancer undergoing treatment with radioembolization or transcatheter arterial
           embolization.

        -  Compare the time course of QOL measures between treatment groups in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the time course of QOL measures between patient subgroups defined by
           pre-treatment quality of life or tumor burden.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete FACT-Hep version 4 surveys on quality of life prior to initiation
      of embolization, and at 2 weeks and 1 month after completion of embolization.
