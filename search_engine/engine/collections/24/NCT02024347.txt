      with various complications, namely esophageal and/or gastric varices, ascites, hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). It is well known that the risk of complications varies even among cirrhotic
      patients, as those with more advanced disease would have more complications and poorer
      survival rates. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with transient elastography is found useful
      to identify cirrhotic patients with higher risk of portal hypertension and presence of
      varices at cross-sectional basis. LSM cutoff values of 17.6 kPa and 21.0 kPa would have the
      sensitivity ≥ 90% in order to detect patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)
      above 10-12mmHg , while the presence of varices could be confidently excluded with a liver
      stiffness below 12.5-19.8 kPa. However, these suggested cutoff values overlap with those for
      detecting histologic cirrhosis in most chronic liver diseases. Hence there seems no
      significant additional information provided by LSM regarding screening endoscopy for varices
      among cirrhotic patients.

      Recently, spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) with the same machine was found accurate to
      predict portal hypertension and esophageal varices. An SSM cutoff value <41.3 kPa is
      sensitive and seems able to accurately rule out the presence of varices. This supports a
      possible screening strategy, reserving upper endoscopy only for patients with an SSM
      ≥41.3kPa.
