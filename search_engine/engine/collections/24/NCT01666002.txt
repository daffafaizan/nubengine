      method, pulsed laser, has been purported to have high rates of treatment in a much shorter
      time frame than other treatments. While the treatment method has become increasingly popular,
      studies of its efficacy are few. The investigators hope to learn the cure rate of a novel
      treatment that is being used by more and more patients. This knowledge will be essential to
      physicians as they consider employing this new technology in their treatment methods.
