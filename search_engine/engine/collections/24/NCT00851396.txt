      identified with vitamin D deficiency are notified and subsequently treated with standard
      therapy for vitamin D deficiency as part of their clinical care. Patients who self report
      that they have taken the treatment are enrolled in this study. Patients will be evaluated in
      this study with measurement of serum 25 OH D level, PTH and oral glucose tolerance test. The
      study will assess if there is improvement in glucose- insulin sensitivity dynamics once the
      serum 25OH D level is normalized
