      quality of life, and mobility in patients with chronic low back pain.

      Design: A single blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting: Clinical setting. Subjects:
      Sixty-four patients (42 females) with chronic low back pain. Interventions: Patients were
      randomly assigned to an experimental group (craniosacral therapy group) or a control group
      (classic massage group).

      Main measures: Self-reported disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire - primary
      outcome; and Oswestry Disability Index), pain intensity (a 10-point Numerical Pain Rating
      Scale), scale of kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), isometric endurance of trunk
      flexor muscles (McQuade Test), lumbar mobility in flexion, and oxygen saturation, blood
      pressure, cardiac index, and biochemical estimation of interstitial fluid.
