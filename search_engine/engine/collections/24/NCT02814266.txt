      first horizontal line (lower target line) was passing through the midpoint of the distance
      between stomion to mentum (mandible height) and the second horizontal line (upper target
      line) was passing through the midpoint of the distance from subnasal to stomion (upper lip
      height). The horizontal lines were drawn with an erasable marker pen on the each patient's
      face. In the sitting position, patients were asked to make maximal tongue protrusion upward
      (UMPT) and downward (DMPT) in anatomical neutral position. The inability of the tip of the
      tongue to reach to the target line was scored "1" and ability of the tongue tip to reach or
      pass the target line was scored "2
