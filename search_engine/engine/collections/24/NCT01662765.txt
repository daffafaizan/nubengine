      diagnosis, etiology, and the best treatment options.

      UPS is thought caused by hair penetrating the skin, leading to a foreign-body reaction and
      development of a sinus lined with granulation tissue. Most of the patients complain of pain,
      discharge or bleeding from the umbilicus when symptoms develop. It can be diagnosed with a
      careful examination, in which hairs can be seen deep in the umbilicus and usually protrude
      from a small sinus.

      Regarding the optimal treatment of the disease, a complete consensus has not yet been
      achieved. Some publications are recommended conservative treatment, while surgical treatment
      is recommended in others.

      A more meaningful comparison of the two modalities is that of a randomized controlled trial.
      We, therefore, present our data of prospective randomized controlled clinical trial comparing
      conservative versus surgical treatment of UPS.

      This was a multicenter, prospective balanced randomization, double blind, active-controlled,
      parallel-group, superiority study conducted in Turkey, under the direction of a principal
      investigator (MK). Eligible patients with UPS were randomized for either conservative
      treatment (CT) or surgical treatment (ST), and then the results of both groups were compared.
