      lymphoma. All patients will begin with 2 cycles of ABVD as standard of care treatment. A PET
      scan will be performed after 2 cycles of ABVD. Enrollment at MSK may occur at any point
      during the first two cycles of ABVD treatment. Enrollment at non-MSK locations will occur
      after the PET scan is performed. MSK patients with a PET-negative response (defined by
      Deauville 1, 2 or 3) will proceed with 4 additional cycles of ABVD or AVD (per treating
      physician preference) on-study. Non-MSK patients with a PET-negative response are not
      eligible for this study. Patients with a PET-positive response (Deauville 4 or 5) will
      proceed with 4 cycles of AVD plus nivolumab on-study. Non-MSK patients must have a
      PET-positive response to enroll on this study
