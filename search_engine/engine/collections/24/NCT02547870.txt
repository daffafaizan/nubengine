    
      This is a phase 1 randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), parallel-group, sequential study in healthy adult
      participants to investigate the effect of different storage conditions for RPV-LA on the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine (RPV) after intramuscular injection. A total of
      60 healthy adult participants will be enrolled in this study. The study will consist of 2
      treatment sessions in a fixed sequential order : session 1 of up to day 8, all participants
      will receive a single oral dose of rilpivirine 25 milligram (mg) tablet on day 1, session 2
      will consists of 2 treatment groups. The participants will be randomized in session 2 on Day
      1 in a 1:1 ratio to Treatments A and B. Each treatment group will receive one IM injection of
      RPV LA on Day 1 of session 2. Session 1 and 2 will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 14 days. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 6.5
      months. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
