    
      1. To estimate the major response rate (complete and partial responses by the International
           Working Group (IWG) response criteria) in patients with AML who are >= 60 years old and
           unable to tolerate or decline cytotoxic chemotherapy or patients who have relapsed
           despite one prior regimen and are treated with (a) 5AC 50mg/m2
           subcutaneously/intravenously for 10 days on days 1 - 10 of a 28 day cycle given in
           combination with entinostat 8 mg (flat dose) administered orally on days 3 and10 of each
           cycle or (b) the same regimen of 5AC with entinostat given on days 10 and 17.

        2. To estimate the overall response rate (complete, partial, and hematologic improvement-
           major by IWG criteria) following treatment with two different dose schedules of
           5-Azacytidine and entinostat in patients with AML >= 60 years old who are unable to
           tolerate or decline cytotoxic chemotherapy or those who have relapsed despite one prior
           regimen.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. To identify changes in gene promoter methylation and gene expression in response to
           combination therapy with 5AC and entinostat and compare the dynamics and kinetics of
           these alterations in promoter methylation and gene re-expression in the two different
           dosing schedules.

        2. To evaluate the effect of entinostat on the induction of hyperacetylation of histones
           from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples.

        3. To evaluate changes in DNA damage in response to combination therapy using gammaH2AX
           determination by western blotting.

        4. To evaluate immune parameters after exposure to 5AC and entinostat when given at either
           dosing schedule and to evaluate these in relation to clinical outcomes.

        5. To evaluate duration of response.
