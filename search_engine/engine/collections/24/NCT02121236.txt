    
      Jaw is a common anatomical site for development of odontogenic and nonodontogenic lesions,
      and because of the wide variation of these lesions, the diagnosis is complex. Many techniques
      have been used to arrive at the final diagnosis such as conventional radiographs, computed
      tomography (CT), low dose cone beam CT, MRI.The use of ultrasonography has been shown to be
      important in evaluating the solid and cystic components of jaw lesions. Although ultrasound
      imaging technology is a safe and a minimally invasive procedure, and has been in use in
      medicine for many years, its use in dental medicine has been limited and mainly restricted to
      soft tissue applications. Studies evaluating the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of
      bone lesions of the jaw are limited.
