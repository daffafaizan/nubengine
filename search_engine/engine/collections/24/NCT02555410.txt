    
      The Brain Sentinelâ„¢ Seizure Detection and Warning System is intended for monitoring children
      and adults with a history or significant risk of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the
      home or healthcare facilities, during the titration or withdrawal of anti-epileptic drugs,
      and for continuous monitoring (night time or any other time of day) of individuals due to
      their history or risk of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The device will withstand
      activities of daily living including showers and sleep.
