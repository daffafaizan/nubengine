      cause of respiratory impairment in HIV+ persons and will likely increase as the HIV+
      population continues to age. In the HIV-uninfected population, COPD frequently co-exists with
      cardiac disease including atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The investigators
      work has demonstrated that a syndrome of "cardiopulmonary dysfunction" exists even in
      non-smoking or antiretroviral-treated HIV+ individuals. The investigators have found that
      HIV+ individuals have a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, airflow obstruction, and
      diffusing capacity (DLco) abnormalities that occur concurrently with cardiac co-morbidities,
      including radiographic measures of atherosclerosis and elevated echocardiographic pulmonary
      artery pressures. This syndrome is marked by inflammation with elevated levels of cytokines
      and hsCRP, peripheral T-cell activation, and increased sputum neutrophils as well as
      elevation of NT-proBNP, a marker of heart strain. Importantly, the investigators have shown
      that DLco impairment and elevated NT-proBNP are significant independent predictors of
      mortality in HIV, indicating that cardiopulmonary dysfunction is likely highly clinically
      relevant and identifies a vulnerable population in whom the investigators lack effective
      interventions.

      Statins have anti-inflammatory effects in the lung and vasculature that might benefit
      cardiopulmonary dysfunction in HIV. These agents have a long history of clinical use in
      cardiovascular disease and are currently being investigated as disease-modifying drugs for
      HIV, COPD, and PH. In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that HIV+
      individuals who received statin therapy within the past year were significantly less likely
      to have impaired DLco and had lower pulmonary artery pressures, lower NT-proBNP, lower
      peripheral cytokines, and fewer sputum neutrophils despite being older and having a greater
      smoking history than those not using statins.
