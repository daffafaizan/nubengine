    
      The European NAFLD Registry is a major international collaboration between clinical academics
      at leading universities across Europe, initially established with funding from the European
      Association for the Study of the Liver and through the EU FP7, H2020 and IMI2 schemes to the
      projects FLIP (Fatty Liver Inhibition of Progression), EPoS (Elucidating Pathways of
      Steatohepatitis) and LITMUS (Liver Investigation: Testing marker Utility in Steatohepatitis).

      The Registry is a non-interventional, observational study collecting cross-sectional and
      longitudinal clinical data (including clinical biochemistry/haematology, liver histology,
      comorbidities, prescribed medication and imaging data) and linked biological samples (Blood
      [Serum, Plasma], Liver Tissue, Urine, Stool) from prospectively recruited patients with
      NAFLD. Its purpose is to support clinical and translational research into disease
      pathophysiology (through development of comprehensive genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic,
      metabolomic, proteomic and metagenomic datasets) and biomarker development/validation. It
      supports collaborative discovery science and serves as the basis for a broad international
      project to discover and validate biomarkers for NAFLD and associated medical conditions
      (LITMUS). Out-with the current study, following separate ethical approval and after separate
      consent, patients who have agreed to join the European NAFLD Registry may also agree to
      participate in a number of nested sub-studies with bi-directional sharing of data. These
      include the LITMUS Imaging Study, which will acquire additional imaging data across a range
      of modalities including, amongst others, MR-PDFF and MR-Elastography. The Registry population
      comprises adult patients (aged â‰¥18 years) with risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) prospectively recruited primarily in hepatology and diabetology clinics
      and/or bariatric surgery units at centres across Europe. After receiving informed consent,
      patients will be assigned a unique study identifier (which will be used to identify all data
      and samples collected) which will allow all information to be recorded in a link-anonymised
      form.
