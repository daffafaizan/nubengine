      Heterotopic Ossification in Traumatic Brain Injured (TBI) patients.

      The investigators primary objective is to determine whether Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy
      (ESWT) is effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with traumatic brain
      injury who have heterotopic ossification around the hip or knee.

      The investigators hypothesize that four applications of ESWT to the affected hip or knee
      joint in the patient group will demonstrate a positive physiological effect and this will
      lead to a reduction in pain and improved function.
