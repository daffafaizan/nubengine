    
      Multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded phase II trial to
      assess the efficacy and safety of an oral quizartinib vs. placebo containing front-line
      chemotherapy-based schedule in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications
      (FLT3-ITD) wild-type Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients.

      The trial will be conducted in two phases:

      An open-label safety run-in phase: Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 (days 1-7), Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 (days
      1-3) Quizartinib 60 mg/d x 14 days (30mg with strong Cytochrome P450 Family 3 Subfamily A
      (CYP3A) inhibitor) in a total of 9 patients, being observed during 1 cycle of induction to
      define the final dose for the randomized phase.

      A randomized double-blinded phase 2:1 quizartinib (at the established dose) vs. placebo.

      Experimental Arm: Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 (days 1-7), Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 (days 1-3) Quizartinib
      60 mg/d x 14 days (30mg with strong CYP3A inhibitor) Standard Arm: Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 (days
      1-7), Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 (days 1-3) Placebo 60 mg/d x 14 days (30mg with strong CYP3A
      inhibitor)

      272 patients will be included in this phase.
