      diagnosis for Autoimmune disease and Dry eye syndrome

      Method:

      This study wants to establish the objective measurement of Autoimmune disease (AID) as
      Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SJS), Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA),
      Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) for comparing with the Dry eye syndrome
      (DES) subjects. And the investigators want to use the objective measurement tools to explore
      the association of TCM pattern, heart rate variability (HRV), TCM tongue diagnosis and TCM
      pulse diagnosis among at least 50 each AID group subjects and at least 50 DES subjects.

      Expected Results:

        1. To evaluate the difference among TCM pattern, HRV, TCM tongue diagnosis, TCM pulse
           diagnosis for the each AID groups.

        2. To evaluate the difference among TCM pattern, HRV, TCM tongue diagnosis, TCM pulse
           diagnosis for the each DES groups.

        3. To evaluate the difference among TCM pattern, HRV, TCM tongue diagnosis, TCM pulse
           diagnosis among the AID groups and DES group.
