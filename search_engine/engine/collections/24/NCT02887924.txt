    
      Primary Outcome Measures:

      Surfactant need, intubation and mechanical ventilation needs within the first 72 hours of
      life in SLI (Sustained Lung Inflation) maneuver-applied preterm infants and non-SLI-applied
      preterm infants.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Heart rate, fractional inspiratory oxygen, CPAP pressure and oxygen saturation within
           the first 72 hours of life in preterm infants

        -  Total non-invasive, invasive respiratory support time

        -  The presence of and the degree of BPD (Bronchopulmonary dysplasia)

        -  Premature morbidities such as PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), IVH (intraventricular
           hemorrhage), NEC (necrotizing enterocolitis), ROP (retinopathy of prematurity)

        -  Feeding intolerance, reaching birth weight and transition to full oral feeding time

      Study Design Randomization Group 1: Group that received SLI maneuver immediately after birth
      followed by nCPAP.

      Group 2: Group that received nCPAP after birth. Following the oral and nasal aspirates, SLI
      at 25 cm H2O pressure will be applied for 15 seconds by using t-piece refreshing and binasal
      prongs and 5-cm nCPAP at H2O pressure will be applied.

      Patients will be observed for 5-10 seconds in terms of cardiorespiratory functions following
      SLI maneuver. If respiratory failure continues during nCPAP (such as apnea, gasping) and/or
      heart rate is > 60 / min but < 100 / min , SLI maneuver will be repeated at the same pressure
      for the same time period. If heart rate > 60 / min but <100 / min persists after the second
      SLI maneuver, resuscitation will be applied in line with the guidelines of American Academy
      of Pediatrics.

      The control group of infants will receive nCPAP support at 5 cm H2O pressure and be supported
      in line with the guidelines of American Academy of Pediatrics.
