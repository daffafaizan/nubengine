    
      Unique to the OneShot™ ablation system is the ability to deliver the desired helical
      treatment pattern for optimal Renal Denervation (RDN) with a single balloon based-treatment,
      eliminating user variance inherent in the currently available point-by-point approach. In
      addition, technological improvements have been incorporated. The OneShot™ RF generator has a
      touchscreen, user friendly interface; catheter advancement is made safer with the use of a
      guidewire; two radiopaque markers on the catheter enable more precise device positioning; and
      the irrigated catheter tip reduces the risk of overheating and clot formation during RF
      delivery. By offering a more reliable single treatment approach, coupled with enhanced
      ease-of use and reduced procedure times, this technology has the potential to significantly
      expand clinical adoption of catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation.
