      were enrolled in the HOPE-2 trial and completed 12 months of follow-up. The trial will
      explore the safety and efficacy of four intravenous administrations of CAP-1002, each
      separated by three months. Subjects will undergo a targeted screening during a 30-day
      screening period to determine eligibility based on protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Eligible subjects will undergo baseline safety and efficacy assessments on Day 1 prior to
      their first infusion of CAP-1002. Administration of CAP-1002 (Day 1) should occur within a
      maximum of 30 days following confirmation of eligibility.

      Subjects will complete trial assessments at Screening; Day 1; Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (Â±14
      days, each). Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted prior to CAP-1002
      administration at the Day 1, Months 3, 6 and 9 trial visits, unless otherwise indicated.

      All CAP-1002 infusions will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the investigative site
      on Day 1 and Months 3, 6 and 9. Prior to each CAP-1002 administration, medications will be
      administered to the subject as determined by the Investigator based on the pre-treatment
      guidelines as outlined in the protocol and/or institutional protocols to minimize the risk of
      potential severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Subjects will be observed in the
      outpatient setting for at least two hours post infusion and then discharged the same day if
      medically cleared by the site Investigator. If clinically indicated, an unscheduled in-person
      visit will be performed at the investigative site with targeted assessments based on
      presentation of signs and symptoms following any infusion.
