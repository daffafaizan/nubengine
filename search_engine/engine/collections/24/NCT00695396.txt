      (neither the patient or the physician know which treatment is being received by the patient),
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study of epoetin alfa in anemic patients who are diagnosed
      with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to protocol-specified criteria. Patients
      meeting entry criteria for the study will be randomly assigned to receive epoetin alfa 40,000
      IU or 80,000 IU or a matching volume of placebo administered by subcutaneous (under the skin)
      injection once every week. Doses of study drug will be withheld, decreased, or increased on
      the basis of weekly hemoglobin concentrations monitored in patients and predefined dose
      adjustment guidelines. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will periodically
      review study data and for the assessment of disease progression, an independent central
      reviewer will review bone marrow specimens and peripheral blood counts. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study at predetermined intervals and as clinically indicated by
      physical examination, laboratory tests and evaluation of adverse events. Patients in the
      Treatment Phase will be randomly assigned to receive once weekly epoetin alfa subcutaneously
      (SC) at a dose of 40,000 IU (1 mL) or 80,000 IU (2ML) or matching volume of placebo (1 mL or
      2 mL) once every week for 48 weeks. Patients may continue to receive double-blinded treatment
      after 48-weeks.
