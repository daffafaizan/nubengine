      which is safe and able to keep the leukemia from coming back. While vaccines have been used
      in infectious diseases like smallpox and measles,the idea about using vaccines in a cancer
      like AML/ALL is really a new use of the idea of vaccines.The WT-1 vaccine is made up of
      protein pieces that the immune system can recognize as abnormal. The doctor thinks that the
      WT-1 protein is important in AML/ALL and using some lab tests they are still able to find
      some of it in the bone marrow. By attacking this small amount of the protein they hope to get
      rid of any small amount of AML that is still in the body.
