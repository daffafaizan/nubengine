      can automatically measure how much energy is needed to pace the patient's heart. If the test
      is successful, the patient's device will be programmed to turn that feature on. 3 months
      after enrollment, the patient will return to the clinic to have their device re-tested using
      an automatic test method to measure the amount of energy needed to make the patient's heart
      beat. A manual test method will also be used to measure the amount of energy needed to make
      the patient's heart beat. The intent of the study is to show the automatic method works just
      as well as the manual method.
