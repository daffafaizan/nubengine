      delivered in a dose dense, metronomic manner (weekly or daily). It is our hypothesis that
      dose dense treatment will result in optimum delivered dose intensity while minimizing
      toxicity. We will test these hypotheses by comparing the delivered dose intensity of the
      drugs to the delivered dose intensity of standard regimens. We will also compare time to
      relapse, survival and toxicity of this treatment to historic, standard regimens.
