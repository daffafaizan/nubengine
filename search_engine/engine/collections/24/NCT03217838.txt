    
      This is a Phase I/II clinical study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      schedule, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AZD2811 monotherapy
      or with combination agent(s) in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients or
      treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive induction therapy. The study will
      also explore the potential clinical activity by assessing anti-tumour activity in patients.
      The study will be conducted in two parts, designated Part A, dose escalation, and Part B,
      dose expansion. Patients will be enrolled in either Part A or Part B according to the
      Investigator's judgment of the most appropriate treatment for the individual patient and slot
      availability.

      Part A - Dose Escalation

      Approximately 48 evaluable treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive induction
      therapy or relapsed/refractory AML patients will be enrolled in Arm 1 and Arm 2 of the
      monotherapy escalation in Part A of this study.

      The dose escalation and de-escalation plan for evaluating AZD2811 will follow the Bayesian
      Adaptive Design scheme which combines prior expectations about the dose toxicity relationship
      and applies the data at the end of each cohort to recommend a dose and schedule for the next
      cohort. The total number of patients will depend upon the number of dose escalations,
      de-escalations, and schedule changes necessary. At least 3 and up to 6 evaluable patients
      will be required for each dose cohort.

      Part A Group 1, Arm A - Day 1 and 4 Monotherapy Dose Escalation:

      Patients will receive a single 2- or 4- hour IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 4 of each 28-day
      cycle. Dosing frequency and schedule may be adjusted during the study on the basis of
      emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data. Approximately 22 patients will be enrolled.

      Part A Group 1, Arm B - Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 Monotherapy Dose Escalation:

      A Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 every 4 weeks or 28 days (Q4W) schedule will be investigated in
      addition to the Day 1 and 4 Q4W schedule. The proposed starting dose for this schedule is 300
      mg/infusion AZD2811 on Day 1, 4, 15 and 18 (i.e. cumulative dose 1200 mg/Q4W). This starting
      dose is less than daily doses shown to be tolerated in the AML setting, and the cumulative
      cycle dose/Q4W does not exceed the highest dose shown to be tolerated (600 mg/infusion Day 1,
      4 cumulative 1200 mg Q4W). Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled.

      Combination Escalation:

      AZD2811 can be escalated (in the combination setting) independent of the monotherapy dose
      explored, after thorough examination of the available safety data. The combination therapy
      exploration will not impact the dose to be further explored in the monotherapy setting nor
      will the monotherapy impact the dose in the combination setting. As such, the number of
      cohorts in the monotherapy setting can differ from the number of cohorts in the combination
      setting. The safety observations of the monotherapy will be considered by the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC) in the overall decision-making process for subsequent dose exploration
      decision.

      A rolling 6 design will be applied to both of the AZD2811 and combination arms. The rolling 6
      method allows accrual of 3 to 6 patients concurrently onto a dose level based on the numbers
      of patients who are currently enrolled and evaluable, who experience a DLT, and who remain at
      risk of developing a DLT.

      Part A Group 2 Arm A - Day 1 and 4 Azacitidine Combination Escalation:

      A starting dose of 400 mg of AZD2811 will be used for investigation in combination with the
      standard dose of the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine. In this dose escalation part,
      approximately 12-15 evaluable treatment-naïve AML patients not eligible for intensive
      induction therapy or relapsed/refractory AML will be enrolled and dosed in ascending doses of
      AZD2811 and standard dose of azacitidine at 75 mg/m² of body surface area subcutaneously (SC)
      in all territories or optionally/alternatively by IV in the United States (US) as per
      national prescribing information.

      Part A Group 2 Arm B - Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 Azacitidine Combination Dose Escalation

      In order to increase dose intensity during the 4 week cycle, and improve efficacy in the
      combination setting, AZD2811 will also be explored on the Days 1, 4, 15 and 18 schedule in
      the azacitidine combination and start at a lower daily dosage that has been shown to be safe
      while administered every 28 days. The proposed starting dose for this schedule is 300
      mg/infusion AZD2811 on Day 1, 4, 15 and 18 (i.e., cumulative dose per 28 days is 1200 mg/Q4W)
      and standard dose and use of azacitidine 75 mg/m² of body surface area subcutaneously (SC) in
      all territories or optionally/alternatively by IV in the United States (US) as per national
      prescribing information. Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled.

      Venetoclax Combination:

      Approximately 18-21 evaluable relapsed/refractory AML patients will be enrolled and dosed
      with AZD2811 and venetoclax. In cohort 1v, AZD2811 will be administered at 200 mg IV on Days
      1 and 4 every 28 days (Q4W) and venetoclax will be given 100 mg orally (PO) on Day 1 and 200
      mg (PO) with a meal and water on Days 2- 28 for the 1st cycle. The third patient in cohort 1
      (AZD2811 at 200 mg) will only be enrolled after the first 2 patients have received ≥ 2 weeks
      of treatment and have shown no evidence of toxicity observed to be compatible with a DLT, and
      further dose escalations of AZD2811 will occur at the discretion of the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC)

      The dose of AZD2811 can be escalated (in the combination setting) independent of the
      monotherapy dose explored, after thorough examination of the available safety data of the
      current and the previous cohorts. The combination therapy exploration will not impact the
      dose further explored in the monotherapy setting nor will the monotherapy impact the dose in
      the combination setting. As such, the number of cohorts in the monotherapy setting can differ
      from the number of cohorts in the combination setting. The safety observations of the
      monotherapy will be considered by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) in the overall
      decision-making process for subsequent dose exploration decision.

      Part A Group 3 Arm A - Day 1 and 4 Venetoclax Combination Dose Escalation

      In Group 3 Arm A, AZD2811 is planned to be administered at 200 mg IV on Day 1 and Day 4 every
      28 days (Q4W) and venetoclax is planned to be given (with a meal and water) at a dose of 100
      mg orally (PO) on Day 1 and ramping up to 200 mg (PO) on Days 2-28 for the 1st cycle. The
      third patient in cohort 1 (AZD2811 at 200 mg) will only be enrolled after the first 2
      patients have received ≥2 weeks of treatment and have shown no evidence of toxicity observed
      to be compatible with a DLT.

      Further dose escalations of AZD2811 in Group 3 Arm A will occur at the discretion of the
      Safety Review Committee (SRC).

      Part A Group 3 Arm B - Day 1, 4, 15, and 18 Venetoclax Combination Dose Escalation

      If data from Groups 1 and/or 2 suggest that patients could benefit from a more intense
      AZD2811 dosing regimen, a schedule of venetoclax with AZD2811 dosing on Days 1, 4, 15 and 18
      (see below) may be explored.

      Group 3 Arm B will not exceed the registered venetoclax dose when combined with a starting
      dose of AZD2811 that is considered safe based on Group 3 Arm A observations. Subsequent
      cohorts will explore how to escalate AZD2811 in a more intensified schedule towards a
      recommended Phase 2 dose.

      Part B - Dose Expansion

      In Part B approximately 18 AML patients (6 additional patients in each group [AZD2811
      monotherapy, Group 1], [AZD2811 in the azacitidine combination setting, Group 2], and
      [AZD2811 and venetoclax combination, Group 3]) will follow the affiliated dose/schedule from
      Part A that was found to be the most tolerable and/or efficacious.
