      The study uses the marker by treatment interaction design. In this design, we assume that the
      status of the marker splits the whole population into two distinct groups (p53 normal versus
      p53 mutant).

      Patients in each marker group are randomly assigned to two different treatments, and planned
      statistical analysis is to test whether one treatment is superior to the other within each
      marker group separately.

      The marker information but not the treatment is blinded to the patient and the investigators.
