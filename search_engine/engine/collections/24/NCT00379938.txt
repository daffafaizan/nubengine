    
      This study is a Phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the
      immunogenicity and safety of 2 dose levels of a recombinant human parvovirus B-19 vaccine
      (VAI-VP705). The vaccine is composed of viral capsids that incorporate 2 B-19 proteins (VP-1
      and VP-2). There will be 3 sites participating in this study: Cincinnati Children's Hospital
      Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Maryland School of
      Medicine. Eighty-nine parvovirus B-19 seronegative healthy adults 18-45 years old will be
      randomized to 1 of 4 groups: 2.5 mcg VAI-VP705 with the adjuvant MF59, 25 mcg with the
      adjuvant MF59, 25 mcg without the adjuvant MF59, or placebo (saline control). Each
      participant will receive 3 separate vaccinations (Months 0, 1, and 6) and will continue in
      the study for up to approximately 14 months. Study participants will be followed to evaluate
      safety and immune response. The primary study objective is to evaluate the safety of
      VAI-VP705 administered with and without MF59 adjuvant in healthy parvovirus B-19 seronegative
      adults. The secondary study objectives are to: evaluate the immunogenicity of primary and
      booster immunizations of 25 mcg of VAI VP705 with and without MF59 and 2.5 mcg with MF59;
      compare the antibody response of vaccine administered with MF59 at each of 2 doses, 2.5 and
      25 mcg versus 25 mcg of vaccine administered without MF59; and evaluate the duration of the
      immune response 12 months after primary immunization. The primary endpoint is the number and
      percentage of study participants who experience any vaccine-associated adverse events or
      serious adverse events. The secondary endpoints include: the percentage of study participants
      who develop neutralizing antibody responses against parvovirus B-19 28 days following the
      last dose of vaccine; the percentage of study participants who maintain a neutralizing
      antibody titer at 12 months after primary immunization; the geometric mean antibody titers
      (as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) by treatment group at 28 days and at 12
      months after primary immunization; and the geometric mean neutralizing titers per treatment
      group at 28 days and at 12 months after primary immunization.
