      tablets offer a completely new type of assistive technology for visually-impaired people
      (VIP). Research on these mobile electronic devices (MED) is relevant to rehabilitation and
      enablement of individuals with all types of visual impairment, with all degrees of severity.
      The majority of UK adults have a smartphone, but take-up is least amongst the over 75s who
      form the majority of the VI population. This is the population in whom MED have the greatest
      potential to reduce social isolation and increase independence, so it is important that the
      potential benefits are not restricted to those already comfortable with technology. Despite
      the great interest regarding what could be achieved with MED, evidence is currently lacking
      that they do provide significant improvements in quality of life, and that the specific
      training which is currently offered by many different organisations can help to facilitate
      effective use of MED.

      The study aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different models of training in giving
      the user on-going access and improved quality of life. The two models to be compared will be
      a "training course only", versus a scheme in which each participant is paired with a "buddy"
      (a local university student) who can provide continuing assistance by visiting the
      participant at home.

      VIP who are interested in purchasing a MED will be recruited and trained. The usage of
      devices will be assessed by questionnaire from completion of training to 6 months and through
      a tracking app. Validated questionnaires will be used to measure changes in quality of life,
      depression, adaptation to vision loss, and ability to carry out everyday tasks, before and
      after training, and 6 months later.
