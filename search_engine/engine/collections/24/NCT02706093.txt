      exercise training groups. Before training (and twice after 3 months of training) subjects
      will participate in a "clinical study" in which they will be required to stay overnight in
      the hospital. During the clinical study, the research team will perform a series of metabolic
      tests. Before and after the 3 months of training, the research team will assess subjects
      "free-living" 24h blood sugar control using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM). The research
      team will measure several other relevant clinical markers (e.g., whole body and regional body
      fat assessments [Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and Magnetic Resonance Imager
      (MRI)], hepatic lipid accumulation [MRI analysis], blood lipid profile, resting metabolic
      rate, glycated hemoglobin [hemoglobin A1c]). After the first 3 months of training, adherence
      to the subjects assigned training program will be tracked for the next 9 months (1 year of
      training in total). One year after initiating a training program, subjects will be asked to
      return to the clinic for a quick follow-up visit where the research team will complete some
      standard clinical assessments (e.g., body weight, body composition, blood pressure, and a
      blood sample).
