      performed to optimize delineation of the epileptogenic tissue in the operating room during
      epilepsy surgery. Similarly, extra-operative electrocorticography is often recorded over days
      to weeks with intracranial grids and depth electrodes, when the epileptogenic zone is not
      clearly localized with non-invasive studies and/or with intra-operative ECoG. Surgical
      resection following extra-operative ECoG is then "tailored' by the seizure onset zone as the
      gold standard.

      High frequency oscillations have been identified as a more precise biomarker for
      epileptogenic tissue. The aim of this double-blind randomized surgical trial is to determine
      if HFO- tailored surgery combining HFOs and current standard of care, compared to current
      standard of care alone, will lead to a better seizure outcome.
