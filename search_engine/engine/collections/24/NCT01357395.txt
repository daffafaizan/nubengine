      forms of c-Kit and PDGFR alpha. It also disrupts DNA repair likely through suppression of
      Homologous Recombination protein Rad51. In a Phase 1b clinical study in combination with
      VP-16 and carboplatin, responses in SCLC were observed. In vitro and in vivo data
      demonstrated amuvatinib synergy with VP-16 thereby further supporting this combination for
      continued evaluation in clinical trials. Pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 clinical trials
      suggest that co-administration of amuvatinib did not alter exposures of standard of care
      agents VP-16 or carboplatin as measured by overall exposure.
