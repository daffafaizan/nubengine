      be conducted in non-opioid tolerant patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA)
      pain. This patient population was chosen in anticipation that the patients are otherwise
      healthy adults being treated with NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) or
      acetaminophen or who have received intermittent opioid analgesic treatment.
