      micafungin versus caspofungin in the treatment of proven invasive candidiasis or candidemia.
      The maximum length of antifungal treatment is 4 weeks except in pre-defined patients where
      maximum length of therapy is 8 weeks. A post treatment assessment will be conducted at 2
      weeks and 6 weeks after the last dose of all antifungal treatments.
