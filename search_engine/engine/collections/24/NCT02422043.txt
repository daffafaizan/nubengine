      make the teenager to self manage their disease and their treatment. Based on Bandura's social
      cognitive theory, effects of educational activities for TPE should lead to the strengthening
      of self-efficacy, coupled with other socio-cognitive factors favoring adherence and a better
      quality of life for teenager. However, socio-cognitive determinants and mechanisms to achieve
      this, implemented by adolescents during and after the TPE program, are not sufficiently
      documented and French assessment tools are missing.

      Objectives: The main objective of the research is to validate self-efficacy and adherence
      tools in French for type 1 diabetic teenagers, and secondarily, to describe evolution of a
      3-month cohort of type 1 diabetes adolescents who took a TPE program on self-efficacy,
      quality of life, adherence, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and socio-cognitive factors as
      Bandura's social cognitive theory and the study of possible links between these endpoints.

      The participants of the prospective cohort of adolescents will be 12 to 17 years of age, type
      1 diabetics with insulin, included in TPE program in one of two study areas. The number of
      subjects required was estimated to 80 patients. The process of cross-cultural adaptation
      tools will be through a linguistic and metrological validation. An integrated mixed method
      was used, consisting of three components:

        -  A quantitative before-after study: Collection and analysis of changes over 3 months of
           self-efficacy, adherence, quality of life and HbA1c (Student t test);

        -  A longitudinal qualitative study: interviews with 24 participants M0, M1 and M3 on the
           socio-cognitive factors according to Bandura (analysis continues theming)

        -  An integrative component: exploratory data analysis methods in order to link the
           evolution of treatment adherence and quality of life, with the evolution of
           self-efficacy and additional socio-cognitive factors.

      Outcomes: This pilot research should validate the assessment tools and improve educational
      sessions for existing and future TPE programs, to type 1 diabetic teenagers to enhance their
      particular self-efficacy and to promote their independence and quality of life.
