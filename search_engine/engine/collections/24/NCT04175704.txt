    
      This is a phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single dose of UB-221 as an add-on therapy in chronic spontaneous
      urticaria (CSU) subjects who fail to respond to the first line H1-antihistamine treatment.
      Only the qualified subjects will be blinded to receive treatment. Each subject will receive
      only one dose of UB-221 or placebo.
