      participants will receive 2-3 months full mouth NSPT. Two LED light irradiation protocols
      will be randomly assigned to two quadrants with periodontitis-infected teeth of each
      participant. LED01 refers to LED light irradiation once per day from the day of initial
      clinical assessment (T0) until the completion of ScRP (T1, 4-6 weeks after the first visit).
      LED02 refers to LED light irradiation once per day from T1 until the day of re-evaluation
      (T2), and the interval of T1 to T2 was the same as that of T0 to T1. The control treatment
      refers to no LED light irradiation from T0 until T2. The quadrant without LED light
      irradiation will be served as control. Each participant will be assigned a cross-arch
      appliance equipped with the semi-conductors of LED bilaterally (Figure 1B), and the external
      surface will be covered with aluminum foils to prevent the penetration of the LED light.The
      irradiation will be controlled by an external controller which will be set to emit 660 nm
      light with an energy density of 10 J/cm2 or 5 J/cm2 unilaterally. The volunteer will be
      supervised to use the device every day from T0 to T2.

      The periodontal examination and the gingival crevicular fluid from the volunteers will be
      collected at T0, T1, and T2. The volunteers will be also requested to examine the visual
      analogue scale at these time points.

      Will evaluate the change of periodontal parameters, the visual analogue scale, and the
      inflammatory biomarkers (from gingival crevicular fluid), in order to confirm the adjunct
      therapeutic effect of the LED light device and figure out the most appropriate protocol for
      the clinical use.
