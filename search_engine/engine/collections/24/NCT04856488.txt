      treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATD) to all patients with Graves' disease and in cases of
      toxic nodular goiter with pronounced hyperthyroidism. Iodine solution is administered
      preoperatively in selected cases of Graves' disease where ATD is intolerable. In the cases
      where iodine is used it is in the form of extemporaneous prepared iodine potassium iodide
      solution (Lugol 5%). The dose varies in clinical studies. In American and Swedish guidelines
      the dose is 5-10 drops 3 times per day for 10 days prior to surgery. American guidelines
      recommend iodine as preoperative treatment i Graves' disease but this is based on sparse
      evidence. Iodine as preoperative treatment in toxic nodular goiter has yet not been studied.

      The purpose of this study is to assess if preoperative treatment with Lugol's solution prior
      to thyroidectomy due to hyperthyroidism reduce the surgical complications hypoparathyroidism
      and laryngeal nerve palsy.
