      after the pre-test and posttest simulations. The self-efficacy survey is an 7-item scale that
      involves participants rating their self-efficacy about providing care for multiple patients.
      Participants rate their self-efficacy on a 1 to 5 (not confident to very confident scale).
      The survey takes 5 minutes to complete. The self-efficacy survey has been used in many
      simulation research studies previously with novice nurses. Competence will be measured with a
      rater-observation measure which has previously been used in simulation research.
