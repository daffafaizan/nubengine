    
      Cushing's syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a variety of clinical signs and
      symptoms that reflect chronic exposure to hypercortisolism such as obesity, hypertension,
      glucose intolerance, infections, psychiatric disturbance, impaired cognition and
      hypercoagulability. Thus, it is important to screen for this treatable disorder so as to
      prevent its associated morbidity and mortality. Because many of the signs of Cushing's
      syndrome are common in the general population, information about the cost-effectiveness and
      diagnostic efficiency of various screening tests would be useful.

      This study will evaluate the diagnostic performance of various screening tests for Cushing's
      syndrome in overweight patients recruited from a weight loss center who have additional signs
      of the disorder. Patients with abnormal tests will be seen as outpatients at the NIH for
      further evaluation for up to two years to confirm or refute the possibility that they have
      Cushing's syndrome. Patients with the disorder will be treated.
