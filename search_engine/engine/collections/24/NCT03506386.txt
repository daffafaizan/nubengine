      collected for the study will include identification, demographic, baseline data on MM,
      additional baseline laboratory, initial treatment for MM, subsequent treatment for MM, and
      outcome.

      The study will enroll approximately 1000 participants.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in five geographic regions of Brazil. For each
      participant, data collection will comprise the longest possible period of time since the
      diagnosis of MM (within the eligibility window of time, between January 1, 2008 and December
      31, 2016) and the cut-off date for data collection (December 31, 2016), unless a participant
      has died or been lost to follow-up before that. The study is planned to last for
      approximately 24 months since its initiation (initiation defined as the initiation visit for
      the first site).
