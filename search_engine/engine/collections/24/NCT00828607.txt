      noninvasively focal liver masses. This is a multi-center prospective cohort study of 250
      subjects, which will be performed at four institutions in Canada. Subjects with a focal liver
      mass, measuring at least 2.5 centimeters in maximal diameter, will undergo a conventional
      baseline sonogram followed by a contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). CEUS will be performed
      on standard ultrasound scanners with contrast specific imaging capability. The contrast agent
      used is Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica,MA) All subjects will have either a
      dedicated hepatic contrast enhanced CT or MR scan within 60 days of the CEUS as per the
      standard of care in the institution. Anonymized image files from all imaging will be shown
      independently to two readers, blinded to all clinical and demographic data, who will predict
      malignancy and diagnosis.
