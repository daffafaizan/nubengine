      various volumes of crystalloid administered at an unspecified and uncontrolled rate (quite
      often off the pump) in order to restore uterine tone and minimize routine blood loss in the
      third stage of labor. Many practitioners question high dose oxytocin regimens, timing and
      duration of Oxytocin administration for postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis. Given the lack of
      a universally accepted, evidence based protocol, this study aims at comparing the efficacy of
      a traditional approach of administration of Oxytocin with an evidence-based designed
      algorithm.
