      their immune system from rejecting the donor stem cells and to kill any diseased cells that
      remain in the body. To try and improve on the results of transplants that use high dose
      chemotherapy alone, we are adding an agent called anti-CD45 to the treatment prior to the
      stem cell transplant. Anti-CD45 is an antibody that specifically finds and destroys leukemia
      cells.

      Patients will receive the anti-CD45 with high dose chemotherapy (including Ara-C and
      Cyclophosphamide) and radiotherapy. Patients will also receive Mesna which is a drug that
      helps prevent bladder damage which can be caused by the cyclophosphamide. High dose
      radiotherapy is also known as Total Body Irradiation or TBI.

      Patients will receive the anti-CD45, high dose chemotherapy, and high dose radiotherapy
      before the stem cell transplant. We expect participation in this study will last 2 years.

      A summary of the treatment follows:

        -  Day - 7: Ara-C, Cyclophosphamide, Mesna

        -  Day - 6: Ara-C, Cyclophosphamide, Mesna

        -  Day - 5: Ara-C, Anti-CD45

        -  Day - 4: Anti-CD45, TBI

        -  Day - 3: Anti-CD45, TBI

        -  Day - 2: Anti-CD45, TBI

        -  Day - 1: TBI

        -  Day 0: Stem Cell Infusion (transplant)
