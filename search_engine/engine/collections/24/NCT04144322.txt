      molar area with a bone crest height from 5 to 8 mm will be recruited for this trial. Patients
      will be randomized to either the test (5-mm implant) or control group (10-mm implant) using a
      computer-generated randomization list . 17 patients will receive a sinus lift procedure, bone
      graft, and 10 mm implant while the other 17 patients will receive a 5 mm short implant.
