        -  To compare the therapeutic efficacy of fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and
           rituximab vs bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab in patients with previously
           untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  To compare the incidence of major side effects (e.g., myelosuppression) associated with
           these regimens in these patients.

        -  To compare the rate of infections and secondary neoplasias in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to country and
      disease stage. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-3.
           Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 0 of course 1 and on day 1 of courses 2-6.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 2. Patients also
           receive rituximab as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires (EORTC-C30 and EURO-QOL) at baseline and
      then at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then once a year thereafter.
