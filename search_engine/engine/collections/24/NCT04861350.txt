      multidirectional sports, which leads to decreased hip muscle strength and range of motion.
      Injured athletes with adductor-related groin pain who trained with neuromuscular control
      strategy would return to sports activities earlier than those who only trained with muscle
      strengthening. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of imagery training (IT) on
      motor control and muscle strength in athletes, which also revealed that imagery training
      combined with physical training (IPT) can lead to faster recovery of neuromuscular control
      than physical training (PT) alone. Besides, monitoring the neurophysiological changes of
      brain plasticity and motor learning after training helps to understanding the mechanisms on
      the training effects.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare (1) the cortical control mechanisms between 3
      types of motor control training strategies; and (2) the effects of 3 types of motor control
      training on neuromuscular performance in athletes with long-standing adductor-related groin
      pain.

      The investigators will recruit 30 athletes with hip adductors-related groin pain, and compare
      the effect of three types of motor control training (movement training, imagery training,
      combined movement and imagery training) on Y balance test performance, cortico-muscular
      coherence, and event-related desynchronization (ERD, α band) and event-related
      synchronization (ERS, β band).

      Chi squared test is used to examine the group differences in motor imagery ability and
      severity of groin pain. The repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to
      compare the intervention effect between groups. The alpha level was set at 0.05.
