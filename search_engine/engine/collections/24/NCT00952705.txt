    
      The primary objective of this study was to determine the immunologic noninferiority of
      MEDI8662, a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV) (delivered intranasally
      using the blow-fill-seal [BFS] delivery system) (Q/LAIV-BFS) to two trivalent formulations of
      licensed FluMist (delivered intranasally using the Becton Dickinson [BD] Accusprayâ„¢ device)
      by comparing the strain-specific geometric mean titers (GMTs) post dosing.
