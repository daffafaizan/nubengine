      for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); cognitive training interventions aiming to
      modify cognitive and affective processing abnormalities underlying MDD represent a promising
      new strategy. This research project translates a well established cognitive bias in major
      MDD, working memory bias, into a novel intervention target. In a double-blind, randomized,
      controlled study, MDD participants undergo 6 weeks of cognitive training sessions, with three
      sessions per week.
