      Polysomnography (PSG) adaptation. After one week, a baseline cerebral SPECT was performed
      (1-3pm) and a baseline PSG was performed that night to evaluate the sleep pattern and the PLM
      index. Subsequently (after one week), each subject underwent a maximal exercise test (MET) in
      the morning (11am to 1pm) after which SPECT examination was performed in the afternoon (1-3
      pm). A PSG was then performed that night to evaluate the effect of acute exercise on DAT
      density and sleep pattern (Figure 1).
