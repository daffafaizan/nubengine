      with actionable genomic alterations and who have been previously been treated with 1 or more
      kinase inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy. The study will be divided into 3 periods:
      Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-up Period. The primary analysis of Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) by blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be conducted after all
      participants either have been followed for at least 9 months after the start of study
      treatment or have discontinued from the study, whichever occurs first.
