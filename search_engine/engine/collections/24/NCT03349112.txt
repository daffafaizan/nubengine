      the length of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter. Pressure measurements in the region
      of the velopharynx, tongue base, and upper esophageal sphincter are obtained by passing a
      catheter with pressure sensors through the patient's nose and past the upper esophageal
      sphincter. Patients are presented various volumes of liquid to swallow and potentially asked
      to perform postural strategies such as a head turn or chin tuck during swallowing while the
      catheter is in place. Clinically, approximately 90% of patients report various discomfort
      associated with the procedure. Discomfort can result in patient refusal to participate or an
      inaccurate picture of a patient's swallowing pressures. Conversely, use of anesthesia can
      potentially alter swallowing physiology.

      Recent studies have studied the effects of lidocaine on penetration/aspiration and subject
      discomfort during flexible endoscopic evaluations, yet findings are inconclusive or
      contradictive. Investigators aim to determine whether subjects report a difference in comfort
      with HRPM conducted following application of lidocaine as an anesthetic as compared to HRPM
      conducted without anesthetic.
