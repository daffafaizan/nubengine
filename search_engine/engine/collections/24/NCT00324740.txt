      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of isotretinoin when given in
      combination with vorinostat (SAHA) in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. (Phase I)
      II. Define dose-limiting and other toxicities in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase
      I) III. Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase
      II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Conduct a pharmacokinetic analysis of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I) II.
      Conduct gene profiling analysis of pre-study, paraffin-embedded tissues from patients treated
      with this regimen. (Phase I) III. Conduct correlative studies to identify the effect of SAHA
      and isotretinoin on RAR-B, LRAT, and STAT1-3 expression. (Phase I)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of isotretinoin, followed by a
      multicenter, phase II, prospective, non-randomized study.

      Phase I: Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily and oral isotretinoin twice
      daily on days 3-5, 10-12, 17-19, and 24-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of isotretinoin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients receive SAHA as in phase I and isotretinoin as in phase I at the MTD
      determined in phase I. Tissue and blood samples are obtained for biomarker/laboratory studies
      in weeks 1 and 4.

      Gene profile analysis is conducted on tumor tissue. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed for 12 weeks.
