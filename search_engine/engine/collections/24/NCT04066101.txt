      The major candidate gene categories to date include enamel formation genes, immune response
      genes, genes related to saliva, and genes related to taste and dietary habits.

      CA6 exists in the human saliva and has a critical role of buffering, immune response and
      taste.Toll-like receptors are expressed in the tongue gustatory papillae where they may
      initiate immune responses to pathogens.Genetic variations in the TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 for umami
      cause perception of these tastes differently.
