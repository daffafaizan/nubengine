      resistance. Metformin is a drug that has been used for several decades in the treatment of
      diabetes mellitus. Metformin is known to improve insulin sensitivity. Some authors have
      reported beneficial effects of metformin in NAFLD, others have not been able to reproduce
      these findings. Only a few randomized controlled studies have been published so far, and
      there is still need for controlled trials with sufficient power to assess the efficacy of
      metformin in this condition.

      The aim of this study is to see whether treatment with metformin for 26 weeks results in
      reduction of liver steatosis (primary endpoint) and reduction in grade of inflammation in
      those with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (secondary endpoint).
