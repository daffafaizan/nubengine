    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, phase I study of TEW-7197 in subjects
      with advanced solid tumors. The study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of TEW-7197, and will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TEW-7197
      using a 3 + 3 design. An expansion phase at the MTD will identify the recommended phase 2
      dose, with an emphasis on subjects with melanoma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma,
      and prostate cancer. TEW-7197 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits protein
      serine/threonine kinase of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and blocks intracellular
      signaling of TGF-Î² by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ALK5 substrates.
