    
      Noncardiac chest pain remains an important problem in clinical cardiology. Often, panic
      disorder and/or depression are the underlying cause. However, this is largely underdiagnosed.

      There are no clear existing treatment strategies/methods for this specific patient
      population.

      In our double blind, placebo controlled care as usual versus sertraline study, we want to
      investigate whether intervention is more effective as care as usual for diminishing chest
      pain, and also if sertraline is more effective in this specific population compared to
      placebo.
