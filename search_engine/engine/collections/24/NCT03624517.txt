      administration of octreotide infusion over 72-hours and endoscopic banding of esophageal
      varices.

      Octreotide acts to reduce the pressure in the blood vessels surrounding the liver, decreasing
      the propensity of bleeding from esophageal varices. The recommended duration of octreotide
      therapy is based largely on expert opinion, however a 72-hour duration of treatment is likely
      to be unnecessary and may inappropriately increase hospital and medical costs.

      This study aims to determine the safety of 24-hours of octreotide infusion in patients with
      bleeding esophageal varices.
