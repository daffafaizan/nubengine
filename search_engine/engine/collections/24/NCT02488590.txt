      used in daily practice to obtain a correct differential diagnosis and, hence, initiate an
      adequate therapy according to the current guidelines. The proposed algorithm will be used to
      categorize patients in 4 different diagnoses with specific treatment choices: asthma,
      obstructive asthma, overlap asthma with COPD, and COPD. The study will evaluate which tests
      and criteria contribute most to the diagnostic work-up and final diagnosis.

      Test battery for diagnosis

        -  spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility testing

        -  bodyplethysmography: spirometry, volumes, resistance, diffusing capacity

        -  exhaled NO

        -  blood sample

        -  CT scan of thorax (only when obstructive spirometry)

        -  histamine challenge (only when spirometry is not obstructive)

        -  induced sputum (not for protocol interpretation)

      Definition of endpoints

        1. Physician based diagnosis:

           diagnosis based on clinical exam and spirometry

        2. Algorithm based diagnosis:

           diagnosis based on clinical exam and test battery

        3. Final standard diagnosis diagnosis based on clinical exam, test battery and clinical
           evolution of 1 year.
