    
      This is a two-centre (Vancouver, Montreal) RCT involving a total of 235 volunteers. Eligible
      participants will be randomized to injectable heroin combined with oral methadone as desired
      (45%) versus oral methadone alone (45%). A subset of 10% will be randomized to injectable
      hydromorphone (Dilaudidâ„¢). Hydromorphone and heroin will be given in a double-blind fashion;
      the purpose is to permit validation of reported illicit use of heroin through urine testing
      in the hydromorphone group. Research visits will be conducted quarterly and will occur
      independently of treatment clinic visits. Incentives will be used to maintain research
      follow-up whether or not the subject is retained in treatment. The analysis will be under
      intent-to-treat. The primary outcomes of interest are 1) recruitment and retention in the
      study and 2) illicit drug use and criminal behavior (as determined by the Europ-ASI) at 12
      months. Secondary outcomes are measures of social function (e.g., social integration and
      functioning, quality of life) and cost-benefit/effectiveness of the interventions.
