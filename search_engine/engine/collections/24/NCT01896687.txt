      sufficient pilot data to estimate statistical power and sample size requirements. The study
      will include 30 individuals (15 per group) diagnosed with persistent low back pain who will
      receive a standard protocol of Scrambler therapy or sham treatment. Participant data will
      include subjective measures of low back pain, pain sensitivity using quantitative sensory
      testing, and mRNA expression levels of pain sensitivity candidate genes at baseline (prior to
      treatment) and 1 and 3 weeks post-treatment.
