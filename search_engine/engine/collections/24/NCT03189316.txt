      fluid and peripheral blood of patients will be collected during coelioscopy for exploration
      of ovarian cysts or dialysis for treatment of chronic renal insufficiency.

      Regulatory B cells (Breg cells) will be measured in peritoneal fluid and in peripheral blood
      after in vitro stimulation and assessment of intracellular interleukin-10 by flow cytometry.
      Proportion of Breg cells among B cells will be compared between peritoneal fluid and
      peripheral blood in both groups.

      Different protocols to induce differentiation of B cells into Breg cells will be tested and
      compared.
