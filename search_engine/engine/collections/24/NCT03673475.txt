      will be enrolled in the study. patients with right heart failure, arrythmia, severe valve
      stenosis or regurgitation will be excluded. After induction of general anesthesia, when the
      patients are hemodynamically stabilised, PVI and jugular vein distensibility will be
      calculated and recorded. after volume load with 500 ml gel infusion(in 15 min), measurements
      will be repeated within 10 minutes and recorded. Patients will be allocated to 2 groups
      according to the change in mean arterial pressure(MAP) after volume expansion: Responders
      will be defined as an increase in MAP by >%10; while nonresponders will be defined as an
      increase in MAP <%10 or decrease in MAP.
