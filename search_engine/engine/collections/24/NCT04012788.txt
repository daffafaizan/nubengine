      after antibiotic exposure. Some of the most effective probiotics tested Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus (LGG®), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5®), Lactobacillus paracasei (L. casei 431®)
      and Bifidobacterium lactis (BB-12®). However, most studies have focused on prevention of the
      first incidence of C. difficile infection rather than prevention of re-infection with C.
      difficile. Recurrence rates of C. difficile infection (CDI) among hospitalized patients are
      15-25% - either as relapses caused by the original organism or re-infection following
      treatment. The potential of probiotics in preventing re-infection is less studied in these
      patients. Further, prebiotics which are carbohydrates only metabolized by beneficial bacteria
      have gained much attention the recent years for their health benefits through stimulating
      growth of specific types of bacteria in the gut, and recent data from mouse studies show that
      the prebiotic inulin can eliminate C. difficile growth, but the use of prebiotics in relation
      to C. difficile elimination has yet to be proven in humans. The investigators hypothesize
      that treatment with a synbiotic mixture consisting of inulin Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG®),
      Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5®), Lactobacillus paracasei (L. casei 431®) and
      Bifidobacterium lactis (BB-12®) can reduce the number of C. difficile recurrences
      significantly.
