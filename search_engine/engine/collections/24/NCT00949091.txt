    
      TAK-875 is being developed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nonclinical data suggest that TAK-875 stimulates
      insulin secretion only at elevated blood glucose levels, with the potential for low
      hypoglycemic side effects.

      The purpose of this phase 1, multiple ascending-dose study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once daily oral doses of TAK-875 for
      14 days in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Participants will be housed for a total of 8 consecutive overnight stays in the clinic, and
      will undergo oral glucose tolerance tests and standardized meal tests with multiple blood
      sampling throughout their clinic stay.
