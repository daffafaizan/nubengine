    
      COHORT (Cooperative Huntington Observational Research Trial) is a coordinated research effort
      by Huntington Study Group research centers worldwide to prospectively collect data from
      consenting individuals who are affected by Huntington's disease (HD) and who are part of an
      HD family. The systematically accrued data from annual prospective assessments will relate
      clinical characteristics (phenotypes) between families with genetic and environmental
      factors. The knowledge from these relationships will better inform us about the onset and
      progression of HD, help identify potential interventions for HD, and aid in planning research
      studies of experimental treatments aimed at slowing or postponing the onset of HD. The
      consented collection of biological samples will further provide research material and
      correlative data for scientists to identify biomarkers that parallel the development and
      progression of HD. Identification of biomarkers will in turn contribute to our understanding
      of HD and enhance the efficiency and power of disease-modifying therapeutic trials.
