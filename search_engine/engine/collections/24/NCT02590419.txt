      eloquent tissues of the brain. One such eloquent area that is commonly aimed to be preserved
      are the white matter nerve fiber tracts which is critical of brain communication and
      function. This study aims to investigate whether the use of Synaptive Medical's
      BrightMatterTM technology can help neurosurgeons to better visualize and plan surgeries by
      considering the white matter tracts, and whether it results in improved clinical outcomes.
      This study will investigate the preservation of the optic radiations in anterior temporal
      lobectomy epilepsy surgeries.
