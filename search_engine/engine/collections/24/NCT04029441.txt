      susceptibility test. After the therapy, the subjects will be divided into two groups, the
      successful group and the failure group. The subjects who fail to eradicate the Hp after
      initial treatment and rescue treatment will go into the failure group. Otherwhile, they will
      go to the successful group.And then they wiil be followed up to observe the development of
      the gastric mucosa pathology. For mild atrophy gastritis, non- intestinal metaplasial
      gastritis, follow-up is performed every 2-3 years.For severe atrophy gastritis, intestinal
      metaplasial gastritis, follow-up is performed every 1-2 years. For patients wth high-grade
      intraepithelial neoplasia, they can be included 3 months after the endoscopic treatment, and
      the follow up will be performed at 6, 12 months after the treatment and then the follow up
      will be carried out every 1 year. For non-atrophic gastritis, no follow-up will be performed.
      All included patients will recieve a follow-up at the endpoint of 5 years. The follow-up
      includes endoscopy examination and serum test of PG I,PG II and gastrin 17.
