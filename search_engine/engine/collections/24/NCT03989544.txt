    
      This study will be a single center, randomized, open label, parallel group study designed to
      compare tezepelumab PK exposure in healthy subjects following single subcutaneous (SC)
      administration of a fixed dose of tezepelumab by using vial and syringe, APFS, or AI. A total
      of 315 subjects will be randomized to receive a single, fixed dose of tezepelumab
      administered SC using vial-and-syringe, APFS, or AI at 1 of 3 injection sites: abdomen, thigh
      or upper arm. Separate randomization lists will be produced for each weight group (50 to < 70
      kg, 70 to < 80 kg, 80 to 90 kg), and within each of the 3 weight groups, subjects will be
      randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 to 1 of the 9 combinations of treatment (vial-and-syringe, APFS,
      or AI) with injection site (abdomen, thigh, upper arm). Within each weight group, at least 36
      subjects will be randomized resulting in at least 12 subjects per treatment group (device)
      within each weight group.
