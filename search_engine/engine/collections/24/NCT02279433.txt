      determine the tentative RP2D. Plasma exposure of DS-6051a and the exposure - QT interval
      prolongation relationship will also be assessed. Approximately 30 subjects with advanced
      solid tumors harboring ROS1 or NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 rearrangement, neuroendocrine
      carcinoma, or with advanced solid tumors and tumor-induced pain will be enrolled.

      The Food Effect (FE) part of this study is to determine the effect of food on the PK of
      DS-6051a following administration of a single oral dose of DS-6051b. The safety and
      tolerability of DS-6051b administered with or without food will also be assessed.

      After the safety profile of DS-6051b is adequately evaluated, the Dose Expansion part (Part
      2) will be initiated to further assess the safety and tolerability, and preliminarily
      evaluate the efficacy of DS-6051b at the tentative RP2D. Approximately 40 cancer subjects
      carrying a ROS1 or NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 rearrangement will be enrolled.
