    
      In the proposed study, the investigators wish to prospectively collect blood samples from 25
      patients with localized soft tissue sarcomas and 25 patients with metastatic sarcoma (schema
      III) at various time points outlined. The presence/absence, as well as the change of ctDNA in
      circulation, will then be measured after the therapies administered and correlated with
      overall survival, progression-free survival and local control.

      The risks to the subjects enrolled on this study include the general risks of undergoing the
      standard procedures, such as blood draws, imaging, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and
      surgery, which will be discussed prior to the therapies and images each patient undergoes.
      The risks of the procedures are not risks of the study with exception to blood draws. There
      is also a risk of loss of confidentiality, but the data will be deidentified once acquired.
      Thus, this risk is minimal.
