      in a 1:1 ratio at each investigative site to receive either the AcrySof® IQ ReSTOR® +2.5 D
      Multifocal IOL Model SN6AD2 [SV25T0] or the AcrySof® IQ Monofocal IOL Model SN60WF in both
      eyes. Each participant completed a preoperative examination of both eyes, implantation of IOL
      at the operative visit for each eye, and up to 7 postoperative visits, with monocular testing
      at Day 1-2, Day 7-14, and Day 30-60, and monocular and binocular testing at Day 120-180
      following the second implantation. The first eye to be implanted was considered the primary
      eye. The second eye was implanted 7 and 30 days of the first. If the first eye was not
      implanted during surgery, the second eye was not eligible. If the second eye was not
      implanted during surgery, only the first eye was followed.
