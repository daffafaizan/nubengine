      C-arm cone beam CT perfusion (CBCTP) to determine its application in the prediction of
      symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (i.e. ischemia or stroke) in patients with aneurysmal
      subarachnoid hemorrhage. The initial plan is to obtain C-arm CBCTP pre- and post-intravenous
      infusion of 1g acetazolamide within 24 hours of symptom onset in aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage patients. The hypothesis is that some of these patients that will later develop
      clinical vasospasm of a degree sufficient to cause cerebral ischemia. These, we believe, will
      demonstrate altered cerebrovascular reactivity during the acetazolamide challenge at a time
      before there is either angiographic evidence of vasospasm or clinical evidence of abnormal
      perfusion. The pilot study will enroll 10 subjects. If analysis of this data demonstrates
      that C-arm CBCTP with an acetazolamide challenge yields reproducible data and can be obtained
      with clinical ease and safety then a proposal for further research in a larger cohort will be
      submitted. This will aim to assess the utility of the CBCT perfusion measurement with an
      acetazolamide challenge to serve as a screening diagnostic tool to predict the subsequent
      occurrence of delayed vasospasm in subjects with an acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
