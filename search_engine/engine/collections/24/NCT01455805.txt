    
      This is a prospective randomised study monitoring patients for up to 5 years post treatment.
      Only patients who have an appropriately diagnosed Lumbar Spinal Stenosis with intermittent
      claudication with/without low back pain, with no adequate symptomatic relief after at least 6
      months of conservative treatment will be asked to give consent to be involved. Potential
      participants will be approached for enrollment 17days before the planned baseline visit.
      Patients will be given oral and written information about the trial as well as the patient
      information leaflet for the study. If informed consent is given their participation in this
      study will be for a maximum of 5 years.
