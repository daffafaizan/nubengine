    
      HIV-RNA and CD4+ cell count to monitor virological and immunological response on switching to
      DRV/r.

      Routine safety bloods to include haematology and biochemistry (including U&E, fasted glucose
      and insulin, liver function test, fasting cholesterol and triglycerides and serum lactate
      measurements).

      Quality of life EuroQOL questionnaires at baseline, and throughout the study to evaluate
      quality of life in the continued treatment/ treatment switch arms.

      A sub group of 10 patients will undergo two euglycaemic clamp procedures in order to
      determine the extent of glucose disposal. The first clamp will be performed prior to the
      switching from a double boosted PI therapy to DRV/r and the second one following
      administration of DRV/r for 4 weeks.
