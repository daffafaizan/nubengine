      Before the tissue was excised from the patient,the pathologist assisted the operator (already
      at the operating room) responsible for the measurement.The measurement of malignant and
      corresponding normal tissues were both performed. The tissues for dielectric properties
      measurement were classified as normal or malignant by the pathologist based on his own
      expertise and decision criteria (visual inspection, anatomy) and the per-operative
      histological examination. The measurements were directly performed on the tissue before
      excision.The sites of the measured malignant tissues were marked,doubletracked according to
      the pathological report to make sure the marked sites are malignant. The patient age and
      tissue temperature at the time of measurement were recorded.
