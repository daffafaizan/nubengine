      affects ovarian response with different nature of the FSH used (human FSH and recombinant
      FSH) in patients undergoing two consecutive cycles of IVF/ICSI with controlled ovarian
      stimulation.

      All patients who agree to participate in the study will have a blood sample taken on the same
      day as a routine extraction performed for the 2nd cycle of the controlled ovarian stimulation
      in accordance with the standard clinical practice of each hospital. The sample will be sent
      to the central laboratory to determine the genotype of the afore mentioned polymorphism and
      correlate it with the clinical results obtained with the two cycles of controlled ovarian
      stimulation.

      In order to avoid any bias, the study population will follow a crossover design with respect
      to the type of FSH used in the first and second cycles of the COS (i.e., half of the
      recruited patients must have undergone a first cycle of COS with recombinant FSH and a second
      cycle with human FSH; and, conversely, the other half must have undergone a first cycle with
      human FSH and a second cycle with recombinant FSH). In order to avoid potential modifications
      to the inclusion criteria, the time elapsed between the two cycles should not exceed 6
      months.
