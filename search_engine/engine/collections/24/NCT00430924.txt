      the need for renal replacement therapy. It is accepted that proteinuria is a surrogate
      measurement for progression. If proteinuria can be lowered we hope to prolong patients
      pre-dialysis phase. Our theory is that aldosterone inhibition will lead to this.

      For a period of 8 weeks patients will be randomized to either aldosterone receptor inhibition
      with the drug eplerenone or control without. Blood pressures will be kept at the same level
      using other drugs.
