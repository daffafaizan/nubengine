      both alopecia areata and vitiligo primarily contain T cells in a TH1 response as opposed to a
      mixed cell infiltrate such as in psoriasis or lichen planus. Both alopecia areata and
      vitiligo are TH1 mediated diseases dependent on the production of IFN-gamma to drive the
      response. CD8+ T cells are both necessary and sufficient for melanocyte destruction in
      vitiligo (van den Boorn JG et al 2009) and CD8+NKG2D+ T cells are also necessary and
      sufficient for hair loss in alopecia areata (Gilhar A et al 2013).
