      in the bloodstream of babies with congenital heart disease, with a particular emphasis on
      whether these markers can predict low cardiac output syndrome in infants who undergo
      heart-lung bypass. Low cardiac output syndrome is a common postoperative complication marked
      by poor blood flow to the body affecting nearly 1/3 of infants post-bypass and is associated
      with significant morbidity and mortality.

      Babies not requiring surgery will serve as the control group. Infants in group 1 will have
      0.5 ml of blood drawn prior to discharge. This will be scavenged from the laboratory when
      possible. Infants in groups 2 and 3 will require serial blood draws over peri-operative time
      points each in the volume of 0.5 ml.

      Group 2:

      T0 = Before surgery (in the OR) T1 = After chest closure or end of case (in the OR) T2 = On
      admission to the pediatric intensive care unit T3 = Timed 4-6 hours after the time of
      admission T4 = Timed 12 hours (+/- 1 hour) after the time of admission T5 = Timed 24 hours
      (+/-1 hour) after the time of admission

      Group 3:

      T0 =Pre-cardiopulmonary bypass to be obtained in the operating room just prior to surgery T1
      = After going on bypass (but prior to modified ultrafiltration) T2 = After modified
      ultrafiltration T3 = On admission to the pediatric intensive care unit T4 = Timed 4-6 hours
      after the time of admission T5 = Timed 12 hours (+/- 1 hour) after the time of admission T6 =
      Timed 24 hours (+/-1 hour) after the time of admission
