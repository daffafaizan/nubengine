    
      It's a 12 week single center randomized controlled trial to evaluate three different
      lifestyle interventions on flow mediated vasodilatation, cardiometabolic profile and
      anthropometric parameters in non-diabetic persons with metabolic syndrome without coronary
      heart disease.

      After informed consent, they will be randomized to 3 different lifestyle interventions: 1.
      Hypocaloric tailored AHA type 1 diet plus standard exercise advice; 2. Pragmatic portion
      controlled healthy diet plus pedometers to perform 10.000 steps daily or 3. pragmatic portion
      controlled healthy diet plus fitness under direct supervision,using heart rate monitors to
      adjust workload to achieve the target heart rate (75% of the maximum attainable heart rate -
      HRpeak, as determined by their individual maximal treadmill exercise test).Main outcome is
      endothelium vasodilation accessed through brachial ultrasound, a surrogate marker of
      atherosclerosis. Secondary outcomes are anthropometric data: weight, waist circumference and
      fat proportion, cardiometabolic profile and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-R).
