      injuries to the face. One type of fracture is that involving the orbital floor, or an
      isolated blowout fracture. One common current practice is to use prophylactic antibiotics in
      these cases to prevent the theoretical occurrence of an orbital cellulitis originating from
      sinus flora, though there is no current standard of care regarding this practice. Many
      surgeons may elect to not use antibiotics for this very reason.

      The use of prophylactic antibiotics in isolated blowout fractures where there is no occlusion
      of the ostium is not defined, and no prospective controlled study has been undertaken to
      suggest the most appropriate course of action to take. Our goal in this study is to determine
      a correct course of action for these patients.
