        -  Determine the progression-free survival and response rate of patients with recurrent or
           progressive malignant glioma treated with temozolomide.

        -  Determine whether certain categories of malignant gliomas, such as oligodendroglioma,
           are more sensitive to temozolomide.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histologic categories (recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme [closed to accrual 11/30/01] vs recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma vs recurrent
      anaplastic oligodendroglioma).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide twice daily for 5 consecutive days. Courses repeat every
      28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
