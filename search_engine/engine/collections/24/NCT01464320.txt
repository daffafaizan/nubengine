    
      This Phase 1b, single-site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be
      conducted in three Periods; Baseline, Dosing and Outpatient. Eligible adult male and female
      subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD (chronic kidney disease) with albuminuria will be
      selected to participate.

      Eighteen subjects will be selected to participate in the Baseline Period to ensure that 16
      subjects are enrolled in the Dosing Period. Subjects who are eligible from Screening will be
      confined to the study site beginning on Day -2 (the day before the Baseline Period infusion).
      On Day -1, subjects will be administered an iothalamate infusion to measure baseline GFR
      (glomerular filtration rate). Subjects who continue to be eligible on Day 1 will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 10 mg dose of ABT-614 or matching placebo
      daily, for 15 days.

      On Day 15 subjects will be administered a second iothalamate infusion. Plasma and urine
      samples for ABT-614 and iothalamate will be collected. Subjects will be released from
      confinement on Day 20 after the completion of all study procedures including the 120-hour
      blood sample collection. Thereafter, subjects will return for outpatient visits on Days 25
      and 30 as well as 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A Â± 2 day window will be
      permitted on the 30-day Follow-up Visit to accommodate subject scheduling.
