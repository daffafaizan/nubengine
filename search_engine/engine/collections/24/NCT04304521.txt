        1. to assess the ability of a LRM with a stepwise increase of PEEP to predict fluid
           responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients,

        2. to identify the best criteria for fluid responsiveness prediction between variations of
           systolic aortic pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic aortic pressure
           (DAP), pulse pressure (PP) and central venous pressure (CVP),

        3. to compare the ability of these criteria with pulse pressure variation (PPV) to predict
           fluid responsiveness
