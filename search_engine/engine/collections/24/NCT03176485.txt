      PI3 /Akt/mTOR pathways in patients undergoing targeted therapy for metastatic disease.

      Changes in relevant proteins will be evaluated using a combined protein expression
      methodology that in includes immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse phase protein microarray
      (RPPA) technology.

      The primary endpoint of this study will be assessed in normal skin and skin acutely exposed
      to solar simulated light
