    
      This is a Phase I prospective, open label, non-randomized opportunistic study to evaluate the
      PK and safety of RDV when administered to pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing
      potential for treatment of COVID-19. RDV is not provided as part of this study; a requirement
      for entry is that participants receive RDV as part of their clinical care (i.e., outside of
      the study). A target of 20 PK evaluable pregnant women will be enrolled into Arm 1; a target
      of 20 PK evaluable non-pregnant women of childbearing potential will be enrolled into Arm 2.
      Study sites will be located in the United States.

      Participants will be pregnant and non-pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 and will
      receive daily RDV infusions, typically for 5 days but in some cases for up to 10 days, as
      part of their clinical care. RDV will be provided and managed by the participants' treating
      physician and will not be provided as a part of this study. Participants will undergo
      intensive PK sampling.

      For all women, clinical and laboratory evaluations will be abstracted from the medical
      record. Pregnancy, birth, and infant outcomes will be obtained from pregnant women enrolled
      in Arm 1. Women will be followed for safety through 4 weeks after the last infusion; Arm 1
      women who are still pregnant at that time will also be followed for safety at delivery.
