    
      This is a phase 4, 12-month, pragmatic trial designed to assess adherence in patients using
      ABILIFY MYCITE versus patients receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Both groups will complete
      surveys at baseline, 90, 180, and 360 days and will receive care at the discretion of their
      physician. The usual care group will not receive the ABILIFY MYCITE intervention. The primary
      outcome will assess refill rates at 6 months.

      Eligible patients will enroll at their screening/baseline visit and ABILIFY MYCITE onboarding
      will be provided in the clinic, with commercial informational materials and additional call
      center support. Patients will then initiate 3 months of treatment with ABILIFY MYCITE at the
      baseline visit. At the Day 90 visit, patients will have the opportunity to either stop or
      continue using ABILIFY MYCITE for the remainder of the study (9 months). This decision must
      be a joint decision with the patient and his or her treating physician. During this optional
      interventional phase, patients may start and stop ABILIFY MYCITE as clinically indicated.

      All enrolled patients will have required in-person visits at baseline, 90-days, and 180-days.
      The day 360 (final) visit can be in-person or via telephone.

      Medical and actual pharmacy dispensing data will be collected from day 1 through day 360
      using the VA's electronic medical record system.
