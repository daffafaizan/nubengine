    
      -  Inclusion visit with physical examination. A 2.9 ml blood sample will be necessary, if
           not done within the framework of care within 6 months for: CBC (Cell Blood Count),
           reticulocytes counts (1.2 ml of blood), liver enzymes, electrolytes, urea, creatininemia
           (1,2 ml of blood) and fetal hemoglobin (0.5 ml of blood). - A complete standardized
           examination including nasopharynx endoscopy, if not yet done in usual care, to
           identified upper airway obstruction

        -  A standardized pneumology evaluation to identified obstructive lung symptomatology

        -  An ambulatory polysomnography will be performed within days following inclusion, during
           sleep and will allow electroencephalogram recording, oculomotricity, muscles (mentalis
           muscles and tibialis anterior) movements, electrocardiogram and respiratory activity
           recording.

      The steering committee will classify the children in three populations based on their exam
      results:

        -  Group 1: no abnormality in polysomnography

        -  Group 2: obstructive sleep-related disorder

        -  Group 3: isolated sleep hypoxemia for group3, patients will have a new ambulatory
           polysomnography.
