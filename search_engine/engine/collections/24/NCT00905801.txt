      1) Contrast

      30 cc bolus of a low osmolar, iodinated CT contrast agent, which is FDA approved and used in
      the clinical CT Imaging procedure.

      2) Scanner

      The 64 row-multidetector row CT unit (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) is FDA
      approved for clinical CT imaging

      Research Design and Methods

      1) Primary Endpoint

      1. Diagnostic yield of tumor perfusion measurements using a contrast assisted computed
      tomography technique.

      2) Secondary Endpoints

        1. Reproducibility of tumor blood flow estimates derived by CT.

        2. Assessment of the association between tumor vascularity responses after two cycles of
           chemotherapy and subsequent best tumor response according to standard anatomic response
           evaluation criteria (RECIST).

        3. Predictive value of tumor blood flow for patient survival, compared to the predictive
           power of tumor size determinations.
