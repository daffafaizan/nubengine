      than in patients without HIV infection and that treatment failures occur due to and/or are
      displayed as central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Very little is known about the best
      treatment course for neurosyphilis in patients who are also infected with HIV.

      HIV infected patients who are presumed to have neurosyphilis or have definitive neurosyphilis
      are treated for the neurosyphilis with either penicillin G or ceftriaxone. Patients are
      treated for 10 days and followed for 50 weeks after treatment. Patients receiving penicillin
      G are hospitalized while receiving the penicillin. Patients receiving ceftriaxone are treated
      on an inpatient basis for at least the first three days and may then be discharged to receive
      outpatient treatment. During treatment, patients are permitted to take antiretroviral drugs
      or other drugs for opportunistic infections except for drugs that are antisyphilitic. Lumbar
      punctures will be performed.
