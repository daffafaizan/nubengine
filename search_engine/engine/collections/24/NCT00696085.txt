      obtaining blood from those women who screened positive and a subset of women who screened
      negative. Each woman who had blood drawn were informed of their results, educated about
      alcohol use in pregnancy and had a brief intervention about their alcohol use, if
      appropriate. They were monitored throughout the pregnancy with additional blood tests
      obtained, depending upon their stage in pregnancy. After birth the babies were examined for
      any signs of alcohol exposure.
