      groups. In the lowest dose group 6 subjects will be recruited, among whom 4 will receive
      SHR-1222 and the other 2 will receive placebo. In each of the other 4 groups, 11 subjects
      will be recruited, among whom 9 will be administered with SHR-1222 and the other 2 with
      placebo.

      Levels of nitric oxide (NO), Endothelin-1 (ET-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
      and hypersensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) will be detected in patients before and
      after the SHR-1222 injection.
