      mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in patients with chronic gastritis and gastric carcinoma. The
      experimental procedures mainly include sample collection, metabolite extraction, LC-MS/MS
      detection, data analysis, etc.The goal of this study is to identify and (relatively) quantify
      as many metabolites in biological systems as possible, so as to reveal the overall metabolite
      information to the maximum extent. Metabolomics aims to investigate the changes of
      metabolites in gastric tissues in patients with chronic gastritis and gastric carcinoma, and
      to study the biological processes in which these metabolites participate by screening the
      different metabolites in the different groups, and to reveal the mechanism of life activities
      in which they involved in.
