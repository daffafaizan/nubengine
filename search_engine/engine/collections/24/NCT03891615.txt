      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved niraparib for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The FDA has approved osimertinib as a treatment option for this disease.

      Niraparib is a type of drug called a "PARP inhibitor", which blocks DNA (the genetic material
      of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place.
      In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells through deadly DNA damage.
      PARP inhibition may be a treatment option for participants with this type of cancer due to
      altered repair and protection of tumor DNA.

      Osimertinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this type of
      cancer there is a mutation in the EGFR which is allowing the cancer to grow when it is not
      supposed to. Osimertinib blocks mutated EGFR, which may cause tumor regression (when the
      tumor starts to shrink) and prevent the spread of the cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether the combination of
      niraparib and osimertinib is safe and well tolerated and what the best dose of niraparib is
      in participants with EGFR-Mutated Advanced Lung Cancer. The investigators also hope that the
      combination of niraparib and osimertinib will stop the cancer from growing and spreading.
