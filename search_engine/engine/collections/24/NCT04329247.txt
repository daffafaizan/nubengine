    
      The present randomized clinical trial will perform a comparison of the pain reduction effect
      produced by the application of the median nerve neural mobilization technique (a non
      pharmaceutical physical therapy treatment), to the pain reduction effect produced by the
      total absence of treatment in subjects who suffer carpal tunnel syndrome. Functionality of
      the affected upper limb will be evaluated and compared. Subjects will be invited to
      participate and randomly allocated to 2 different groups.
