      can be very disabling and difficult to treat. Antihistamines are the only drugs licensed for
      treatment of urticaria, however there is a group of severely affected patients with chronic
      idiopathic urticaria who fail to respond. Previous trials have shown ciclosporin to be
      beneficial, and small studies support the use of intravenous immunoglobulins and
      plasmapheresis. However, not only are these options expensive, but since chronic idiopathic
      urticaria may persist for years, their prolonged use may be limited by adverse effects. We
      have previously published a report of 2 patients who responded to methotrexate, and wish to
      properly evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of CIU.

      In the first part of the study patients will be given either placebo or methotrexate for 8
      weeks and in the second part of the study, non-responders will be offered open labelled
      methotrexate for 8 weeks.
