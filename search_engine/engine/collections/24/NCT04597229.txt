      complement existing interventions are therefore of great interest, including dietary
      interventions for primary prevention or as a possible therapeutic option that may confer
      beneÔ¨Åts beyond currently recommended conventional therapies. Hence, the present work aims to
      evaluate the efficacy of instant multigrain supplementation on the glycemic status,
      cardiometabolic implications, oxidative stress and nutritional status in Type II DM patients,
      as compare to standardized medication regimen.
