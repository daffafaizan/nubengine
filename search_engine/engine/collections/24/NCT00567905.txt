      beneficial effects in prevention and treatment of many diseases, one of which is anti-obesity
      and anti-diabetes.

      The benefit effects of green tea are mainly attributed to its polyphenol content, especially
      the most abundant one-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which might inhibit adipocyte
      proliferation and differentiation in vitro studies

      We hypothesized that GTE would improve insulin resistance in type 2 overweight diabetes and
      related hormone peptides will be influenced. Thus, we conducted this randomized clinical
      trial to examine the effect of GTE on type 2 diabetes and to explore the relationship between
      GTE and related hormone peptides.
