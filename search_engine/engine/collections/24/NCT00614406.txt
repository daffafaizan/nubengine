      time period prior to the hormonal trigger for ovulation or the release of an egg. Women
      having unprotected sex outside this window receive no benefits from this emergency therapy.
      Prostaglandins are critical before, during, and after ovulation, thus their inhibition may
      cause an EC effect that works over a longer time period. We wanted to determine if celecoxib
      might work as an EC with a wider window of action.
