      severe AS. The data gathered in this study will be used to optimize the Avicena software
      algorithm used to make the diagnosis of AS.

      The Vivio device is an optical-type tonometer that operates based on capturing the vibrations
      of the skin due to the arterial pulse pressure wave as it propagates through the underlying
      carotid vessel. When applied to the neck over the subject's carotid pulse, an arterial
      waveform (pressure tracing) and heart sounds are sensed, and sent to an iPad using Bluetooth,
      then sent to Avicena for analysis.

      After informed consent subjects will undergo a brief cardiac-focused history and examination.
      All subjects will have bilateral exams with the Vivio (~5 minutes each) conducted by a study
      doctor or nurse, and a standard clinical resting TTE conducted by a certified technician. The
      entire study visit should take 1.5 hours, and there is no follow up.
