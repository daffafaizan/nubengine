      rational clinical management, since the demonstrated effectiveness of implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillators on the reduction of sudden cardiac death. Basing on the results
      of multiple clinical trials, left ventricular systolic function, measured as ejection
      fraction, is currently the only recommended tool to identify patients at higher risk of
      sudden death that would benefit from a prophylactic defibrillator. However, the systematic
      implementation of current recommendations results in a substantial number of inappropriate
      defibrillator implantations, while failing to prevent the majority of sudden deaths occurring
      in the general population. Unfortunately, at present time we have no other way to identify
      patients at higher risk of sudden cardiac death, since other proposed risk markers have not
      been consistently demonstrated of incremental value. Recent data suggest that several
      substrate markers, either assessed morphologically with magnetic resonance imaging, or
      electrophysiologically with invasive mapping procedures, may be helpful to identify subgroup
      of patients at higher arrhythmic risk. However, previous studies have been largely conducted
      on few patients, most were retrospective or with short follow-up.

      We will submit patients with dilated cardiomyopathy undergoing implant of an implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator to a morphologic and electrophysiologic substrate evaluation
      including cardiac magnetic resonance with gadolinium contrast-enhancement study, and
      electroanatomic mapping with bipolar electrogram voltage and morphological analysis. The
      electroanatomic mapping and cardiac magnetic resonance will be repeated at the time of the
      first arrhythmic event.

      We expect to define the role of anatomical and electrophysiological substrate abnormalities
      in determining malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy,
      thus allowing a better risk stratification and prevention of sudden death.
