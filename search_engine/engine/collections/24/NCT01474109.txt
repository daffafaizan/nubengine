      systemic sclerosis (SSc), are an important source of morbidity and lead to impaired function
      in these patients. In this study, we are investigating whether treatment with the endothelin
      receptor antagonist, macitentan, decreases the development of new digital ulcers in patients
      with SSc. Macitentan is a highly potent, tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor
      antagonist. Through complete blockade of endothelin action, macitentan is expected to protect
      tissue from the damaging effect of elevated endothelin. This therapy is not approved for the
      treatment of systemic sclerosis, but the use of an ERA is an attractive approach in combating
      the structural vascular damage observed in SSc leading to complications such as DUs.
