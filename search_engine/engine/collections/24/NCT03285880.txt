      multiple forms of learning in preschool-aged children (3-5 yrs). By probing recall prior to
      and following mid-day nap or wake intervals, we will examine immediate memory performance and
      how it is changed by an interval with a nap compared to if that interval was spent awake.
      There are three arm, separately assessing declarative (using a storybook learning task),
      procedural (using a mirror tracing task), and emotional (using an emotional storybook task).
      All children will participate in a nap and wake condition. On the experimental day, children
      will learn the task, then be nap or wake promoted (within subject, conditions counterbalanced
      and separated by 1 week). Subsequently, performance will be reassessed that day as well as
      the following day. Children will wear an actigraph watch for a 16-day interval surrounding
      the experimental days in order to access habitual sleep patterns (e.g., nap frequency). A
      subset of children will complete the experimental days in the sleep laboratory. For these
      children, sleep will be measured using polysomnography, a montage of electroencepholography,
      electromyography, and electrooculography electrodes.
