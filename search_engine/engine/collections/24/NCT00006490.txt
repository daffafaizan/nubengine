      antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients. Drug resistance can be detected by genotypic
      or phenotypic assays, both having distinct advantages and disadvantages. Results from
      genotypic and phenotypic testing are helpful in excluding from the subsequent regimen drugs
      to which the resistance is identified, and both tests predict virologic response to salvage
      therapy in patients who have failed a previous regimen. Resistance testing is likely to be
      beneficial as an aid in selecting a salvage regimen.

      At entry, patients are randomized to Arm A (sequencing) or Arm B (phenotyping) and have a
      resistance test drawn while still receiving the current regimen even though regimen failure
      is suspected. The test results are available between Weeks 1 and 4, inclusive. There are
      weekly visits for the first 4 weeks after entry to monitor viral load and maintenance of the
      current failing (prestudy) regimen. If virologic failure is confirmed, a new regimen is
      chosen and prescribed at the first visit after resistance test results are available. [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 12/6/00: If the resistance assay fails to yield results, another regimen is chosen
      and prescribed based on the patient's medical and medication history.] If virologic failure
      is not confirmed, the current drug regimen is not changed. Otherwise, on-site study visits
      occur every 4 weeks until Week 24 and then every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 48. [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 12/6/00: on-site study visits occur every 4 weeks until Week 24 and then every 8
      weeks thereafter]. Medical resource use is assessed at baseline and then every 8 weeks
      through Week 48. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 16 weeks through Week
      48.
