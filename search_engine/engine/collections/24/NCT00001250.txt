    
      A prospective randomized trial evaluating the effect of preoperative dose intense
      chemotherapy (FLAC/G-CSF) on axillary lymph node metastases in women with clinical stage II
      (T1N1, T2N0, T2N1) breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive 5 cycles of
      combination chemotherapy (5-FU, adriamycin, leucovorin, cytoxan, G-CSF) either as initial
      therapy (preoperative) or postoperatively after local therapy (modified radical mastectomy or
      lumpectomy/axillary lymph node dissection/whole breast radiotherapy). Each chemotherapy cycle
      will be 21 days. At the time of local therapy the incidence of axillary metastases in the
      axillary dissection specimen will be determined and compared in the preoperative chemotherapy
      vs. postoperative chemotherapy treatment groups.
