      majority of the stroke population have low aerobic capacity and many are inactive. This is
      negative for their health and well-being. Physical inactivity may increase their risk of
      having recurrent stroke.

      The optimal training mode and intensity to improve aerobic capacity after stroke are not
      clear. High intensity interval training (ie. 90-95% of peak heart rate) has been proven to be
      more beneficial than moderate and low intensity exercise in order to improve maximal oxygen
      uptake in patients with cardiac disease. The response from this training on aerobic capacity
      and physical function in the stroke population are not known.
