    
      This was a 26 week, double blind, randomized, active-controlled safety study of Foradil in
      free combination with inhaled corticosteroid versus an inhaled corticosteroid alone in adults
      and adolescent patients with persistent asthma. The primary objective of the study was to
      demonstrate that the addition of formoterol fumarate to fluticasone propionate is
      non-inferior to fluticasone propionate alone in terms of the risk of composite serious asthma
      related events (asthma-related hospitalization, asthma-related intubation, and asthma-related
      death). The individual components of the composite primary endpoint (i.e., asthma-related
      hospitalization, asthma-related intubation and asthma-related death) will be assessed as a
      secondary safety endpoints.

      The efficacy assessment is the secondary objective.
