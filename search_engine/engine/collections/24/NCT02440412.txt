      massage therapy is to reduce the level of cortisol, the "stress hormone". However it is not
      clear whether the effect is due to the manual action on the skin, or only by the relaxation
      induced rest. Therefore the variation of salivary cortisol in both conditions, and also in
      everyday working conditions was compared. Cortisol has a circadian cycle, with a maximum
      value upon awakening, which decreases during the morning; therefore a sample of saliva (in
      Salivette tube) it was collected in the three experimental conditions at the same hour time
      in the morning: 8:45(after intervention), and 9:30 and 10.30 (both, before).
