    
      This is a phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of
      axicabtagene ciloleucel versus standard of care therapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory
      DLBCL. Adult subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL after first-line rituximab and
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene
      ciloleucel or standard of care second-line therapy.

      Standard of care will consist of a protocol-defined, platinum-based salvage combination
      chemotherapy regimen followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant in
      those who respond to salvage chemotherapy.
