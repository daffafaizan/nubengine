    
      -  60 women, where 30 of them will receive low dose HCG with rFSH (group 1), while the
           other 30 women will receive rFSH (Recombinant Follicle stimulating Hormone) with a
           placebo (group 2) both using the antagonist protocol as a method of induction in ICSI.

        -  Women in both groups will be treated with a GnRH antagonist protocol with
           cetrotide(cetrorelix)

        -  In Group 1, low dose hCG (200 IU per day) with rFSH will be given daily when at least
           six follicles of 12 mm will be observed and E2 levels are higher than 600 ng/l, until
           the day of the hCG trigger administration.

        -  Group 2 patients received rFSH injections with a placebo starting on cycle day 3 of the
           stimulation cycle until the day of hCG trigger administration.

      In both groups Oocytes will be retrieved 36 h after the hCG trigger shot. All mature eggs
      retrieved will be fertilized with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Fertilization will
      be checked at 18 hours post insemination. Embryo quality will be assessed and embryo transfer
      will occur at day 3.
