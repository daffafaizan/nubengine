      airway during general anesthesia. Compared to the endotracheal tube, it has the advantages of
      easier and faster placing, reducing the proportion of a sore throat and other benefits. The
      i-gel速 is a second-generation of the laryngeal mask. Compared to the classic laryngeal mask,
      it provides higher sealing pressure and better airway protection to reduce respiratory
      complications.

      Choosing an appropriate size laryngeal mask is an important issue. Trauma during placing or
      positive ventilation failure may occur if the wrong size is selected. Currently, the main
      method for selecting an i-gel速 size is based on the body weight recommendation (30-60 kg for
      size 3 and 50-90 kg for size 4) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. However,
      there is an overlapping in size selection in people weighing between 50 and 60 kilograms.
      Laryngeal mask airways are widely used for breast surgery, and this patient cohort is often
      weighed between 50-60 kilograms in National Taiwan University Hospital. Therefore, in this
      randomized clinical trial, the investigators will compare the ventilation efficacy of size 3
      and size 4 i-gel速 in anesthetized, paralyzed female patients weighing 50 to 60 kilograms who
      undergo breast surgery. Also, the investigators will record any side effects of size 3 and
      size 4 i-gel速 in this cohort.
