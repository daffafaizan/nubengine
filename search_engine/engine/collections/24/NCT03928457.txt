      especially radiofrequencies, while hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units. Moreover,
      they may be particularly vulnerable due to increased penetration of radiofrequency waves into
      the brain during a crucial period of neurodevelopment. This study will aim at evaluating the
      influence of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields exposure on the neurophysiological
      development in preterm neonates.

      The first part of this study will be devoted to the measurement of environmental
      electromagnetic fields in order to map their distribution in the paediatric department. From
      birth and during 6 weeks, the investigators will perform, for each child, a continuous
      measurement of radiofrequencies at the incubator level. Infants' clinical data (medical
      history, nutrition, morphology...) and the evolution of the thermal environment in incubators
      (air and body temperatures) will also be continually monitored. At 3 and 6 weeks of life, the
      investigators will investigate sleep (EEG, EOG), cerebral hemodynamics (near-infrared
      spectroscopy), autonomic nervous system activity (ECG, heart rate variability) and various
      cardiorespiratory parameters (SpO2, apnoea, bradycardia) thanks to a night-time
      polysomnography.

      The impact of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields will be evaluated by analyses of the
      relationship between exposure levels and the various parameters extracted from the
      neurophysiological investigation phase.
