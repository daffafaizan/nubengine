      to prevent harms related to alcohol. Current prevention interventions have achieved some
      success, but rely on a single mechanism of change: correcting exaggerated drinking norms. The
      investigators propose to test a novel prevention strategy targeting another mechanism of
      change: creating attitude-behavior dissonance. To date, changing alcohol-related attitudes
      and the resulting attitude-behavior discrepancy has been underutilized as a behavior change
      strategy for alcohol abuse prevention. Informed by an extensive literature showing strong and
      consistent associations between alcohol attitudes and drinking behavior, the investigators
      adapted a brief counter-attitudinal advocacy (CAA) manipulation to the alcohol prevention
      context.
