    
      This clinical research is a retrospective, pivotal, multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) study
      with an enriched sample of 300 breast screening or diagnostic cases which were selected from
      the library of mammograms collected under Fujifilm protocol FMSU2013-004A (all subjects
      previously provided written informed consent agreeing their image data and supporting
      documentation could be used for future research and investigations). Approximately 18
      qualified radiologists will independently perform two reads on all (approximately 300) cases.
      Each reader will read each case both as a FFDM read, and a DBT plus S-View read on the ASPIRE
      Bellus II workstation.

      As its primary endpoint, this study is designed to evaluate whether the area under the
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) based on probability of malignancy (POM)
      scores and requiring correct lesion localization is statistically non-inferior for DBT plus
      S-View versus FFDM.
