      prevention of this disease is a major public health issue. The U.S. Preventive Services Task
      Force and other professional organizations recommend that clinicians discuss chemoprevention
      with high-risk women. Breast cancer chemoprevention with anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen,
      raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole, is under-utilized, despite several randomized
      controlled trials demonstrating a 40-65% decrease in breast cancer incidence among high-risk
      women. Compounding this underutilization is the fact that a large proportion of women may be
      unaware of their high-risk status due to the investigators' inability to adequately screen
      them in the primary care setting. Further research is needed to determine how knowledge about
      breast cancer, actual/perceived risk, and risks/benefits of chemoprevention are best
      communicated to women in order to promote breast cancer prevention strategies.

      The investigators hypothesize that combining a patient-centered decision aid with a
      physician-centered decision support tool integrated into clinic workflow will improve
      accuracy of breast cancer risk perception, facilitate referrals for specialized risk
      counseling, and increase chemoprevention uptake. We anticipate that the BNAV tool will
      facilitate referrals to the breast clinic by primary care providers (PCPs) and that the
      RealRisks decision aid will prime high-risk women to seek these referrals. The primary
      endpoint is uptake of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or Aromatase inhibitor
      (AI) for breast cancer chemoprevention at 6 months (after the next primary care appointment)
      in the active arm compared to usual care.
