      converted to an active drug in part through an enzyme encoded by the gene named CYP2C19.
      Individuals with genetically-impaired CYP2C19 metabolism have lower capacity to convert the
      prodrug to its active form. Consequently, these individuals have lower blood levels of the
      activated form of clopidogrel, diminished antiplatelet responses, and higher rates of
      cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis. Increasing doses of clopidogrel in such patients
      represents a possible approach to managing the gene-drug interaction.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether increasing the dose of clopidogrel increases
      antiplatelet responses and active metabolite exposure in individuals with genetically reduced
      CYP2C19 metabolism relative to those with normal CYP2C19 metabolism.

      The primary objective is to assess changes in clopidogrel response and exposure at three
      clopidogrel dose levels and with coadministration of omeprazole.
