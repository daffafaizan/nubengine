    
      D-dimer testing is performed in AF Patients receiving warfarin therapy (target INR:1.5-2.5)
      in Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital. Patients with elevated d-dimer levels (>0.5ug/ml FEU) were
      SCREENED AND RANDOMIZED to three groups at a ratio of 1:1:1. First, NOAC group,the
      anticoagulant was switched to Dabigatran (110mg,bid) when elevated d-dimer level was detected
      during warfarin therapy.Second,Higher-INR group, INR was adjusted to higher level
      (INR:2.0-3.0) when elevated d-dimer level was detected during warfarin therapy. Third,
      control group, patients with elevated d-dimer levels have no change in warfarin therapy.
      Warfarin is monitored once a month by INR ,and dabigatran dose not need monitor. All patients
      were followed up for 24 months until the occurrence of endpoints, including bleeding events,
      thrombotic events and all-cause deaths.
