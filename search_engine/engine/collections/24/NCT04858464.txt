    
      Primary Sjögren's Syndrome (PSS) is a chronic systemic disease characterized by lymphocytic
      infiltration of exocrine glands. Dryness, chronic pain, physical fatigue, glandular and
      extraglandular symptoms seen in PSS cause deterioration of the health-related quality of
      life.

      The Primary Sjögren's Syndrome Quality of Life (PSS-QoL) Questionnaire has recently developed
      as a patient-reported condition-specific outcome measurement tool to assess the quality of
      life associated with PSS. The PSS-QoL questionnaire consists of 25 questions with a physical
      and psychosocial dimension.The physical dimension consists of a numeric rating scale (NRS,
      ranging from 0 to 10) for pain and physical symptoms. The question related to vaginal dryness
      is intended to be answered by women only. Each "yes" answer about physical symptoms-related
      questions adds 1 point to the score. The psychosocial dimension can be scored on a 5-point
      Likert scale and contains 14 question with the following possible answers: never (0), rarely
      (1), sometimes (2), often (3), and always (4). The PSS-QoL score ranges from 0-96 (for women)
      and 0-92 (excluding the question of vaginal dryness for men). After questioning the
      sociodemographic characteristics of the individuals, PSS-QoL, EuroQuol-5D, the EULAR
      Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index and EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index
      will be used. Test-retest will be re-applied to those of the same individuals who can be
      reached after 1 week. The results will be analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0 computer
      package program.
