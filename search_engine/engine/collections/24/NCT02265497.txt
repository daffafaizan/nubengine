      For data collection will use a common system for all institutions participating.We developed
      a computerized tool that utilizes models of case report forms (CRF) and allows the inclusion
      and management of clinical, epidemiological, histopathological and molecular data. The
      clinical and laboratory data of patients included in RELINFO will be obtained from the
      hospital records. The integration of local databases allows constitute the RELINFO, conceived
      as a virtual database of patients with lymphoma. The INCA as Coordinating Center is committed
      to the security of this database.Standardization of diagnosisThis phase includes structuring
      a technological platform for the standardization of histopathologic diagnosis (establishing
      common routines in hematopathology) and the incorporation of molecular methods in the
      diagnosis of lymphoma.
