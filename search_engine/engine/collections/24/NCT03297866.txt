      who aged 15 years or above are daily smokers (Thematic Household Survey Report - Report No.
      59, 2016). The smoking prevalence was estimated from a thematic household survey that has
      been conducted every 2 or 3 years. Another population-based survey related to tobacco control
      is the Tobacco Control Policy-related Survey conducted by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking
      and Health and the University of Hong Kong. Both surveys were in a cross-sectional design and
      no follow-up was done. A cohort study with follow-up data could provide more insights for the
      causal relationship. However, most people are not willing to complete follow-up survey and
      the response rate is often low (Mellahi, 2016). The low survey response rate could lead to
      statistically bias in the research funding (Pit, 2014). Therefore, cohort surveys need to
      provide attractive monetary incentive to the interviewee to increase the response rate (Pit,
      2014).

      This study aims to assess and compare the 3-month response rate of a follow-up survey due to
      different financial incentive schemes. The findings will be used for a feasibility assessment
      of future cohort studies of evaluating tobacco control measures and public opinion, and
      exploration of appropriate incentive scheme.
