    
      1. To confirm HFNC used in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency oxygen therapy
           than the general nasal catheter oxygen and the difference between what better.

        2. We set up a point of research in the tertiary hospitals, secondary hospitals and primary
           hospitals to explore the different levels of HFNC in the application of the efficacy of
           the hospital there are differences and what is better. To further clarify the promotion
           of HFNC to secondary hospitals and primary hospitals have no meaning.

        3. Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency who required long-term oxygen therapy
           were randomized to a randomized, controlled, multicentre clinical trial of HFNC with
           nasal oxygen therapy. Analysis and comparison of HFNC and general nasal catheter oxygen
           in the treatment of chronic respiratory insufficiency there is no difference, HFNC in
           different grades of hospital use is consistent.

        4. Research methods:

      4.1 Subjects: Chronic respiratory insufficiency required long-term oxygen therapy to Shanghai
      Tenth People's Hospital and multi-center hospital patients.

      4.2 Study sample size: 100 samples were collected from each of the three test centers. Of
      which 150 cases of nasal oxygen therapy, HFNC 150 cases.
