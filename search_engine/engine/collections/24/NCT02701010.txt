      idiopathic overactive bladder (iOAB) syndrome. It requires education of the actively
      participated patient as well as time and effort from the clinician. However, the most
      effective method for patient education in BT remains unclear. Researchers designed a
      randomized controlled trial to compare effectiveness of 3 different methods of patient
      education in BT for women with overactive bladder.

      The sample of the study consisted of 60 iOAB female patients who applied to urogynecology
      clinic between November 2012 and April 2013. These patients were equally randomized into 4
      groups of teaching models for BT. Group I included the patients educated by a continence
      nurse's verbal instructions in the form of a structured training including bladder training,
      bladder control strategies, pelvic floor muscle training and lifestyle changes and a leaflet
      containing information stated in structured training, group II included the patients taught
      by a continence nurse as the only verbal structured training, group III included the patients
      who were given only the leaflet and group IV was the control group consisted of female iOAB
      patients who were given an unstructured training by a healthcare worker with no specific
      experience in continence care.
