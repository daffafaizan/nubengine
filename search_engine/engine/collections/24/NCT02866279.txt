      decrease rates of rapid, repeat pregnancies. Evidence supports that in healthy women with
      term infants initiation of the contraceptive implant 1-3 days postpartum does not appear to
      have any adverse effects on lactogenesis or breastfeeding continuation. However, no high
      quality study to date has examined the effects of progestin-only contraception in women known
      to be at risk for low milk supply, including women with a premature delivery, obesity,
      polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, or a prior history of low milk supply.

      The investigators goal is to measure the impact of timing of postpartum contraceptive implant
      insertion on breastfeeding success and duration. This will be a three-armed randomized
      non-inferiority study of women who plan to breastfeed, have known risk factors for low milk
      supply, and who intend to use the contraceptive implant postpartum. Women will be randomized
      to one of three groups for the timing of contraceptive implant placement: within 30 minutes
      of placental delivery, 24-72 hours postpartum, or 6 or more weeks postpartum. Women will be
      assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postpartum. Outcomes will include time to
      lactogenesis II, duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding, continuation of and satisfaction
      with the contraceptive implant, and side effects, including bleeding patterns, associated
      with the implant.

      Findings from this trial will be used by clinicians, hospital systems, and policy makers
      working to expand access to immediate postpartum implants while supporting women in meeting
      their breastfeeding goals.
