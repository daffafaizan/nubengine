      parts: first, rare tumor without standard recommended treatment such as atypical fibrous
      histiocytoma; second, common tumor after multiple line of therapy such as lung cancer,
      gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, etc. All patients have no any standard therapy based on
      NCCN guideline when recruiting. Next-generation sequence was used to detect druggable
      molecular event including gene mutation, gene fusion, amplification, etc. Then patients with
      molecular events were treated with corresponding targeted drug and followed-up, and not
      limited tumor type. The efficacy and safety of targeted drug were evaluated.
