      impacts on the health of vulnerable children. In safety-net settings, the prevalence of these
      adverse social circumstances are high. The investigators are proposing an RCT on an
      intervention based in a large urban pediatric urgent care setting that addresses patients'
      social circumstances. In an earlier RCT conducted in a similar setting, this intervention
      helped decrease total social needs and parent reported child health on a single item measure.
      In this study, the investigators will collect a more robust set of survey data including
      detailed measures of child health and non-invasive biological data from children and
      caregivers accompanying those children. Families will be randomized according to a
      pre-determined randomization schedule into the social needs-focused intervention. In one arm,
      the investigators will offer the intervention, which involves in-person navigation around
      available social and legal resources; in the other, the investigators will offer written
      information to participants on available community resources. All patients in both arms will
      be followed over a six month period to capture information about changes in participants'
      social needs, health and health care utilization.
