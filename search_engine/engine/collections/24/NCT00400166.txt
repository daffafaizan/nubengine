      to a recovery and community integration frame necessitates new models of "case management"
      practices. The Recovery Guide model is just such a model. Beyond theoretical frameworks, the
      effectiveness of Recovery Guides has not been well studied. It is the intent of this study to
      conduct a randomized trial examining the effects of Recovery Guides on community tenure and
      integration. Furthermore, it is the intent of this study to to establish fidelity criteria.

      Comparison(s): Recovery Guide services in addition to treatment as usual, compared to
      treatment as usual.
