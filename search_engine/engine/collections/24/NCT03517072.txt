      results of bariatric surgery on weight loss. Moreover, there is no consensus or criteria for
      choosing one surgical weight loss procedure over another. The best choice for one patient may
      not be the most appropriate for another.

      The results of this project will allow to better select obese patients likely to benefit from
      bariatric surgery, and to further personalise the management of severe obesity.
