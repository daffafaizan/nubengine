      disorders such as alzheimer's disease are a growing public-health concern with potentially
      devastating effects.

      Refering to animal data and empirical studies, a healthy diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids
      and low in calories should improve cognitive functions such as learning and memory. To test
      this hypothesis, we study general brain functions in healthy elderly subjects (50-80 years
      old) during a short term diet.
