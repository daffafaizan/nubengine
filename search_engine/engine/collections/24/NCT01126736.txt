    
      This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib portion: a safety
      run-in period with 3 ascending doses of eribulin; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 3-arm
      design. .

      Phase Ib-Patients will be recruited into cohorts, into one of two parallel arms evaluating
      different eribulin dosing schedules (Arm 1: eribulin on Day 1; Arm 2: eribulin on Days 1 and
      8), with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 patients per cohort. All patients will receive
      pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) in combination with eribulin. All patients in a cohort will receive
      the same dose level of eribulin and there will not be any intra-patient dose escalation.

      The dose level of eribulin will be escalated for additional cohorts in each of the two arms
      unless greater than or equal to 2 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are reported at the lower
      dose level(s) prior to enrollment of the next dose level.

      Phase II- Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either eribulin in
      combination with pemetrexed, in each of two dosing schedules (Arms 1 and 2), or pemetrexed
      alone (Arm 3). For both the Phase Ib and II portions, 1 cycle of therapy will last 21 days,
      with an estimated number of 6 cycles. Radiologic examinations including a computed tomography
      (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as appropriate (and CT or magnetic resonance
      imaging [MRI] as appropriate), will be performed during Screening and thereafter every 2
      cycles until disease progression.
