      dietician, which entails introducing food types and cooking skills, quantifying salt intake
      with a special spoon and recording detailed interactive food diary. Sodium excretion was
      measured using one 24-hour urine collection regularly to assess dietary compliance and enable
      feedback. The test persons with sodium excretion higher than 90mmol/24h will receive
      intensive education. Test persons in the control group receive standard care. After 2 weeks
      in study, all test persons visit the outpatient clinic for measurements and data collection.
      Within 3 months of total study duration, data collection and measurements take place at the
      end of every month.

      At each timepoint blood and 24-hourly urine is collected, test persons fill out
      questionnaires.
