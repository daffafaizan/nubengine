    
      Pediatric patients who are eligible for participation in this EAP will be treated with
      voxelotor, dispersible tablets or powder for oral suspension administered orally once daily
      (QD) at a weight-based dose, and followed by the treating physicians at the participating
      sites. Participants will receive standard of care treatment and procedures for management of
      SCD, including an initial visit and routine visits at least every 12 weeks for clinical and
      laboratory assessments per standard of care and re-supply of voxelotor. A safety follow-up
      visit will be conducted 28 days (Â± 7 days) after the last dose of investigational product.

      This EAP may continue until such time that voxelotor is commercially available for patients
      age 4 to 11 years, or the Sponsor discontinues the voxelotor EAP.
