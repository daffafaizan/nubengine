      I. Compare the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed and complete and partial) in patients
      with unresectable stage IV malignant melanoma treated with sorafenib in combination with
      either temsirolimus or tipifarnib.

      II. Compare the 4-month progression-free survival rate of patients treated with these
      regimens.

      III. Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens, with an emphasis on long-term
      side effects and toxic effects, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      metastatic (M) stage (M1a/b vs M1c). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (reopened to accrual as of 8/15/2009): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on
      days 1-28 and temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      ARM II (closed to accrual as of 8/15/2009): Patients receive oral sorafenib as in arm I and
      oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
