      improves the heart function of patients with a pacemaker and can even be life-saving.
      However, evidence is accumulating that ventricular pacing may also have undesired long-term
      cardiac effects. Therefore, it makes sense to limit ventricular pacing to the absolute
      required minimum. The functionality RVP (Refined Ventricular Pacing) in the C-series 2nd
      generation pacemakers of Vitatron B.V. Arnhem, the Netherlands is designed to reduce
      ventricular pacing.

      After implantation of the Vitatron C50 D model C50A2 (pacemaker) or Vitatron C60 DR model
      C60A2 (pacemaker) and a 4-6 weeks stabilization period, proper functioning of pacemaker and
      leads (stimulation- and sensing parameters) is checked. The pacemakers will be programmed
      according to predefined settings.

      In the following 4-weeks Baseline period diagnostic data (atrial fibrillation burden and
      percentage of ventricular pacing (% VP)) are collected in the pacemaker memory. Based on
      these data, patients will be excluded from further participation (patients with more than 15%
      atrial fibrillation) or subdivided into three groups: (a) < 30% VP (30- VP group), (b) >30%
      VP, Sick Sinus Syndrome and normal conductivity (SSS group), (c) >30% VP, 1st or 2nd degree
      AV block. Patients in these three groups will be treated for 4 weeks alternatively with the
      RVP functionality switched ON or OFF. The order will be determined by randomization. At the
      end of these two cross-over periods the % VP and the judgment of the patients of the last
      period will be assessed. Adverse events will be recorded from the moment of study enrolment.
