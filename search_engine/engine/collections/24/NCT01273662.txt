      Promising anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated in patients with renal cell carcinoma,
      thyroid cancer, and melanoma. The potent anti-angiogenic activity of axitinib makes it a
      promising agent for the treatment of HCC.

      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II trial. Eligible patients will receive axitinib,
      starting at 5 mg orally twice daily in the fasting status, until objective disease
      progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary discontinuation. Dose
      titration will be done according to the severity of adverse events.
