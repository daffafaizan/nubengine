      called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is thought to increase the
      brain's ability to change. Participants will be assigned to one of four groups by chance.
      Three groups will receive tDCS at a level expected to increase the brain's ability to change,
      and will vary by the areas of the brain that are stimulated. The fourth group will receive
      tDCS at a level not thought to affect the brain's ability to change. All participants will
      receive intensive therapy of their impaired arm and hand, focusing on exercises that will
      improve their ability to function in daily life.
