      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol when administered with ketoconazole
           and dexamethasone in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol and dexamethasone with or without
           ketoconazole in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamics of this regimen, in terms of CYP24 expression and
           activity and vitamin D receptor expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of calcitriol.

      Patients receive oral dexamethasone twice daily beginning on day 0 and oral ketoconazole 3
      times daily beginning on day 4. Patients also receive oral calcitriol once daily on days 1-3
      of each week. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
