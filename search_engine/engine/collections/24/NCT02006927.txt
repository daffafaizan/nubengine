      neurostimulation device/leads post radical robotic prostatectomy as a method for enhancing
      neural recovery/penile rehabilitation and/or erectile dysfunction treatment. This will be a
      single center pilot study of up to 10 patients. The leads will be placed and stimulated
      intraoperatively to assess proper placement and stimulation parameters needed to achieve
      change in penile length and/or circumference. One week post operatively, the leads will be
      connected to an external stimulator device and activated. Subjects will be instructed to
      stimulate each lead by turning on the device each day for up to six weeks. The leads will be
      removed at six weeks post operative and subjects will be followed for up to two years.
