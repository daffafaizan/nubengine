      hemorrhage (SAH). Its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear but a role for cerebral
      vasospasm and the presence of blood in the arachnoid space is likely. A wash out of blood and
      blood breakdown products in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could reduce the incidence of
      vasospasm and DCI.

      We aim to assess whether external lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is safe and reduces secondary
      ischemia and its sequelae.
