    
      This single-center, randomized, double-blind, within-subject placebo controlled study is
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various doses of STP705 administered as
      intradermal injection in subjects with linear hypertrophic scar.

      Twenty four subjects will be divided equally among 3 cohorts (20, 30 and 40 μg/cm2/day dose
      level) of 8 subjects each. Each subject will receive both active (STP705) and control
      (Placebo) treatment twice a week for a total of 4 weeks. The total length of linear
      hypertrophic scar will be divided equally for treatment with STP705 and placebo. STP705 and
      Placebo will be injected intradermal every 1 cm length on the hypertrophic scar.

      Subjects will be confined to clinic or research unit for 24 hours post-dosing after the first
      treatment administration for the serial PK assay and the blood sample will be collected at
      the following post-dosing times: 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3 hrs, 4 hrs, 5hrs, 6 hrs, 8 hrs, 12
      hrs, 16 hrs, 24 hrs, 32 hrs and 36 hrs. Post-dosing ECG will be performed 6 hours (±1 hr)
      after the first study drug administration and vital signs will be monitored every 2h till 12h
      post-administration. Adverse events and medications will be monitored throughout the study.
