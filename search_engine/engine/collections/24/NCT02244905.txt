    
      Objective: To evaluate whether positive deviance (PD) based horizontal infection prevention
      approach will result in a higher rate of decline in incidence density of patients with HAI
      (central line-associated bloodstream infection, healthcare-associated pneumonia,
      catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or Clostridium difficile infection) per 1000
      patient days per month in the intervention wards compared to control wards.

      Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted over a period of 24 months. Six
      medical wards were randomized and positive deviance intervention was randomly allocated to
      one of the two groups of three wards each. The baseline, intervention and follow-up periods
      were 6, 9 and 9 months respectively.

      Setting: A public safety-net major teaching hospital in United States.

      Participants: The ward staffs participated in the intervention.

      Intervention: Key components of the intervention were invitation to participate voluntarily,
      open-ended dialogues with staff members to discover barriers and seek solutions to prevent
      HAI, discussion of outcomes, and encouragement to prioritize and implement the solutions
      generated. Staffs of all six wards were asked to voluntarily participate in a modified
      hospital survey of patient safety climate (HSOPSC) and a social network survey at 6, 15, and
      24 months.

      Statistical analysis: Statistical methods used were time series modeling, summary of
      frequencies, Chi-square or Fisher's exact for testing difference in proportions and t-test.
