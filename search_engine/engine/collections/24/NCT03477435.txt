      population-based approaches for increasing use of specific evidence-based approaches for
      behavioral tobacco dependence treatment, Quitlines and text messaging, at the Manhattan and
      Brooklyn campuses of the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System (NYHHS). The project will test
      the default bias, examining whether an opt-out approach to referral is more effective than an
      opt-in approach. Researchers will randomly assign clinical care teams at each VA campus to
      either an opt-out or an opt-in approach to referring smokers to treatment. In the opt-out
      approach, the default is that everyone is referred to treatment unless they actively choose
      not to be. In the opt-in approach, people are offered treatment but must actively choose to
      enroll in it.
