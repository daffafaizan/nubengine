      emotional symptoms, physical activeness, social skills, well-beings in patients with physical
      and mental illness and the elderly.

      The study aims to assess the applications and outcomes of psychiatric symptoms, social
      skills, cognitive function, well-beings, emotional status and physical fitness of AAT program
      applied to middle-aged and older patients with chronic schizophrenia.

      The investigators will recruit 40 patients with chronic schizophrenia who were admitted to
      day care ward and rehabilitation ward, and conduct a randomized, controlled study. 40
      patients will be stratified by the ward into AAT group and control group. AAT group will
      complete the 12-week program. This study contains two assessment sessions completed within
      one week before and after 12-week program. Subjects will be evaluated by the PANSS, ACIS,
      MoCA-T, CHI, DASS-21, CST, TUG and 5MWT in both sessions. Statistical analysis is examined
      using paired t-test to see whether there is a significant difference (based on p-value)
      between the scores of two assessment sessions in the AAT and control group, and using
      independent t-test to see whether there is a significant difference in the change scores of
      two assessment sessions between the 2 groups.
