      improves obesity related diseases and lowers mortality. A loss of bone and muscle mass and an
      increase in bone fracture risk are however seen after surgery. In this study it is examined
      if treatment with zoledronic acid (a drug used to treat osteoporosis) can prevent the bone
      and muscle loss after bariatric surgery. A single infusion of zoledronic acid or placebo is
      given before surgery. The study is blinded and randomized for methodological reasons. Bone
      and muscle scans, tests of muscle strength and physical performance and blood samples (for
      analysis of markers related to bone and muscle metabolism) are performed at inclusion and 12
      and 24 months after surgery. A total of 50 adult individuals will participate. Results will
      be important for the evidence-based care of patients undergoing bariatric surgery and
      zoledronic acid.

      Study design This is a single center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of
      zoledronic acid for prevention of bone and muscle loss after bariatric surgery. Routine
      bariatric surgery (RYGB or gastric sleeve) will be performed. The end of study is 24 months
      after surgery.

      Study Population Patients referred for bariatric surgery at The Hospital South West Jutland,
      Esbjerg will be invited to participate.

      Randomization After inclusion and baseline assessment, patients will be randomly assigned to
      either zoledronic acid or placebo with a 1:1 allocation. A randomization code stratifying an
      equal number of participants having RYGB or SG into each study arm will be applied.
