      infarction undergoing the primary percutaneous coronary intervention(P-PCI),characterized by
      myocardial stunning, reperfusion-induced arrhythmia, microvascular dysfunction and injury of
      cardiac sympathetic nerve, etc.

      Nicorandil is an antianginal agent with a dual mechanism of action: nitrate and K+ATP channel
      opener. The nitrate action causes vasodilation of systemic veins and epicardial coronary
      arteries, while the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel opener action
      causes vasodilation of peripheral and coronary resistance arterioles. Nicorandil not only
      decreases preload and afterload but also increases coronary blood flow.

      The study will compare the effectiveness between nicorandil and placebo of preventing the
      reperfusion injury especially injury of cardiac sympathetic nerve in patients with acute ST
      segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing the P-PCI.It is intended that before
      reperfusion injury ,nicorandil which was early used by intracoronary injection could prevent
      and release the microcirculatory spasm, release the coronary microvascular endothelial
      swelling,decrease embolism of atherosclerotic debris and thrombus formation,moreover,it could
      reduces the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic endings of the heart directly.So,it
      could decrease the phenomenon of no-reflow/slow reflow,reperfusion-induced arrhythmia and
      injury of cardiac sympathetic nerve.
