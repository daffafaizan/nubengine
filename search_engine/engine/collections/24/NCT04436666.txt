      participant in a virtual world. Sensory cues of VR, especially the precise control of
      auditory, tactile and olfactory systems, enhances the reality of the virtual environment. As
      a result, users feel that they can look around and enter the simulated environment. The
      virtual environment provides sensory information such as visual, auditory, movement, virtual
      or artificial, and makes the individual feel similar to real life.

      Ice application has been used as a topical pain reliever for centuries. It works through a
      variety of mechanisms, such as slowing the transmission of peripheral nerve fibers, promoting
      sensory competition, and reducing the release of inflammatory and nociceptive mediators. Ice
      application is cheap, easily accessible and reaches its purpose relatively quickly to skin
      anesthesia. Apart from these effects, it also reduces pain by activating the Door-Control
      mechanism, stimulating the touch receptors and increasing the release of endogenous opioids.
