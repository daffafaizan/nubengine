      adverse events in the study subjects (n=8). While the adverse events reported were generally
      consistent with the known profile of gabapentin, it was decided that the study should
      continue at a different study site. The pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in the subjects with
      renal impairment will be evaluated in a separate study with a different study number at a
      different site. The study will be entitled: "The Pharmacokinetic Study of Gabapentin in
      Japanese Epileptic Subjects with Renal Impairment".
