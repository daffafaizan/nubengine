      dosing compared to daily dosing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on
      methotrexate.

      The study population is pediatric patients (ages 2-21) with inflammatory bowel disease on
      methotrexate who are receiving supplemental folic acid. The current standard of care is to
      administer folic acid supplements on a daily basis.

      This will be a prospective study involving pediatric IBD patients on methotrexate. Each
      patient's baseline folate levels and other routine labs at enrollment (time zero) will
      function as their control at the conclusion of the study.

      Doses will be standardized prior to study initiation. All patients will receive 800mcg of
      supplemental folic acid per week. IBD patients are typically evaluated and have lab draws
      every 6 months. For our study, labs will be obtained as routine labs (CBC, CMP) and a
      baseline folate level at the time of enrollment. Once these labs are obtained, patients with
      normal folate levels will qualify for inclusion in the study. They will be started on once
      weekly folate dosing. During the course of the study, if patients develop low folate levels,
      they will be removed from the study and placed back on daily doses of folate.
