    
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled clonal
      expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells (myeloid blasts) in the peripheral blood, bone
      marrow, and other tissues. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematologic malignancy
      propagated by impaired differentiation, proliferation, and accumulation of lymphoid
      progenitor cells in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary sites. JNJ-75276617 is an orally
      bioavailable, potent, and selective protein-protein interaction inhibitor of the binding
      between histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A ([KMT2A], also called mixed-lineage leukemia 1
      [MLL1]; wild-type and fusion) and menin, with activity in leukemic cell lines and primary
      leukemia patient or patient-derived samples with either KMT2A alterations including gene
      rearrangements (KMT2A-r), duplications, and amplification, or nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1)
      alterations. The primary goal of this FIH study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of JNJ-75276617 with an acceptable safety profile. The total duration of the study is
      up to 2 years and 7 months. Safety assessment will include adverse events (AEs), serious
      adverse events (SAEs), physical examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status, vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical safety laboratory assessment and
      pregnancy testing.
