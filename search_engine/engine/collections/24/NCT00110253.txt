      evaluated the duration of anesthetic effect produced by S-Caine Peel when applied for 30 or
      60 minutes in 40 adult volunteers. A pinprick test was used to determine duration of
      anesthetic effect.

      At the procedure visit, subjects were to be assigned the lowest available sequential subject
      number. Treatment was randomized according to a computer-generated randomization schedule
      provided by the sponsor. The randomization to application time of 30 or 60 minutes was to be
      1:1 and un-blinded. The randomization of study drug to treatment area (concurrent
      applications of either S Caine Peel applied to the anterior surface of the right thigh with
      placebo applied to the anterior surface of the left thigh, or placebo applied to the anterior
      surface of the right thigh and S-Caine Peel applied to the anterior surface of the left
      thigh) was 1:1 and double-blind. Instructions for implementing the randomization (ie, the
      correct application time and treatment area) appeared on the study drug labels assigned to
      each subject number.

      Subjects were administered both S-Caine Peel and placebo on separate thighs for either 30 or
      60 minutes. The study drugs were applied concurrently to the anterior surfaces of the right
      and left thigh (one application per thigh, with study drug applied to the right thigh first,
      followed immediately by application of the alternate study drug to the left thigh). Each
      study drug was dispensed to cover a 200 cmÂ² treatment area with a uniform thickness of
      approximately 1 mm
