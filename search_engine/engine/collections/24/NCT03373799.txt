      partial rotator cuff tear, is applied with two different methods; a video-based
      rehabilitation program and physiotherapist-supervised rehabilitation program. Video-based
      rehabilitation program was developed to investigate whether this program is effective on
      pain, functionality and quality of life and as successful as a physiotherapist-supervised
      rehabilitation program.
