    
      Prospective, randomized , multicenter study comparing cholecystectomy performed with da Vinci
      Single Site Instruments™ to multi-port (four ports) laparoscopy.

        -  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate cosmesis, patient satisfaction and
           quality of life after robotic- assisted single incision cholecystectomy procedure using
           da Vinci Single- Site Instruments™ in comparison to a multiport laparoscopic approach.

        -  The secondary objective of this study is to assess the peri-operative clinical outcomes
           of robotic- assisted single incision cholecystectomy with da Vinci Single - Site
           Instruments™ in comparison to a multiport laparoscopic approach.

        -  The third objective of this study is to evaluate hernia incidence at 1 year and 18
           months after surgery
