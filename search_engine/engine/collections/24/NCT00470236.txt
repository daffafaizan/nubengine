        1. To evaluate time to local recurrence in women with DCIS treated with breast conserving
           surgery followed by:

             -  whole breast RT alone versus whole breast RT plus tumour bed boost;

             -  RT using the standard fractionation schedule versus the shorter schedule.

        2. To evaluate time to disease recurrence and overall survival in women with DCIS treated
           with breast conserving surgery followed by:

             -  whole breast RT alone versus whole breast RT plus tumour bed boost;

             -  RT using the standard fractionation schedule versus the shorter schedule.

        3. To compare the toxicity of:

             -  whole breast RT alone versus whole breast RT plus tumour bed boost;

             -  RT using the standard fractionation schedule versus the shorter schedule.

        4. To compare the cosmetic outcome of:

             -  whole breast RT alone versus whole breast RT plus tumour bed boost;

             -  RT using the standard fractionation schedule versus the shorter schedule.

        5. To identify a molecular signature predictive of invasive recurrence of DCIS to
           facilitate therapy individualization.

        6. To assess inter-relationship of biomarkers and relationship between biomarker expression
           and specific histopathologic features of DCIS.

        7. To evaluate the quality of life of women treated with:

             -  whole breast RT alone versus whole breast RT plus tumour bed boost;

             -  RT using the standard fractionation schedule versus the shorter schedule.
