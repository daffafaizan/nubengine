      associated with significant patient distress. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is among the
      most prevalent causes of dry eye disease. This condition, which is often due to obstruction
      of the meibomian gland orifices, may result in significant ocular irritation. Traditionally,
      management of MGD includes warm compress, lid hygiene, and anti-inflammatory medications.
      This randomized clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effects of meibomian gland probing
      versus sham procedure in cases with refractory MGD that do not respond to traditional
      treatments. Moreover, the effects of postoperative regimen will also be investigated using
      two different regimens. In addition to symptoms, the changes will also be evaluated in terms
      of clinical signs as well as in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) which allows study at the
      cellular level.
