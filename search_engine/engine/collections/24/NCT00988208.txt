    
      In November 2011, the Data Monitoring Committee concluded it was unlikely that the study
      would meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) and recommended that the study be
      stopped. The study was terminated in accordance with this recommendation. All sites were
      instructed to immediately discontinue all patients from experimental lenalidomide/placebo
      treatment administered either in combination with chemotherapy or as a single agent following
      chemotherapy discontinuation. Subsequently, Protocol Amendment 3 was issued to provide for
      the following:

      To continue to collect information on Second Primary Malignancies (SPMs) and additional
      treatments for Prostate Cancer in all randomized subjects during survival follow-up.

      To continue to provide docetaxel and prednisone for up to 10 cycles to subjects randomized at
      non-US sites who were ongoing in the CC-5013-PC-002 protocol when the decision was made to
      discontinue lenalidomide/placebo and who were experiencing benefit as per investigator
      discretion. For subjects who had exceeded 10 cycles of docetaxel and prednisone at the time
      of Protocol Amendment 3 approval, an additional two cycles were provided.

      All references to dosing and study procedures pertaining to the safety, efficacy, and
      exploratory endpoints of lenalidomide/placebo were discontinued as part of Protocol Amendment
      3.
