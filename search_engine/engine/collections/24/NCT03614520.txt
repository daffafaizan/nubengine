    
      The study is divided in two sub-studies to explore each objective.

      One the one hand, a group of people will drink olive oil, or wine, or both. This is done to
      see if combining these two drinks will improve the absorption and bioavailibility of phenolic
      compounds that they contain, promoting by synergy their antioxidant activity at a
      postprandial level. The main compounds studied are the Resveratrol (RSVT), the Hydroxytyrosol
      (HT), tyrosol (TIR) and their metabolits.

      One the other hand, an group of people will drink 3 different beers ( with 3 different
      degrees of alcohol), or wine, in order to study the absorption of TIR in relation to the
      alcohol degree. It also aims at assessing if the gas contained in beer contributes to TIR
      absorption.

      At different times after the administration of drinks, urine and blood samples will be
      collected.
