      contraindications. These patients will have a pre-CRT MRI and another post-CRT MRI 6 months
      after the CRT procedure. Echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, symptom
      assessment, and laboratory testing are also performed before and after CRT. Modifications to
      the post-CRT MRI protocol include the use of gradient echo cine imaging rather than steady
      state free precession imaging, application of wideband imaging to the LGE acquisitions, and
      strain imaging with cine Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) tailored for
      device patients.
