      to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      repeat intravenous infusions (2 doses 4-weeks apart) of GSK1070806 in obese patients with
      T2DM. The primary objective of the study will be to assess improvements in fasting and
      postprandial glucose control. This will be a parallel-group study in 30 obese subjects with
      T2DM who are poorly controlled on metformin monotherapy (HbA1C>7% but <9.5%), and who have
      levels of microalbuminuria indicative of progressive kidney disease i.e. 30-300mg/L albumin
      in urine or ACR ≥3.5 mg/mmol (female) or ≥2.5 mg/mmol (male) and ≤30mg/mmol. There will be
      three treatment groups comprising two active and one placebo arm with 10 subjects per dose
      group. The study contains a broad range of biomarker assessments, the purpose of which is to
      evaluate the mechanistic basis by which GSK1070806 exerts its therapeutic benefit in subjects
      with T2DM.

      Subjects will be randomised into one of the three treatment groups where they will receive
      two intravenous infusions of GSK1070806 or placebo twenty-eight days apart. A MMT challenge
      will be conducted on Day 1, Day 29, Day 57 and Day 85 for evaluation of the primary
      endpoints.
