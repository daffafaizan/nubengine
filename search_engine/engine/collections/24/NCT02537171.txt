      treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach or
      gastroesophageal junction through progression-free survival(PFS). Apatinib will be given to
      patients who have received first-line chemotherapy with an efficacy assessment of stable
      disease(SD), complete response(CR), or partial response(PR) after 4 cycles. Patients were
      randomly assigned to 750mg group or 500mg group continually until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicity or patients withdrawal of consent, and the sample size is 40
      individuals.
