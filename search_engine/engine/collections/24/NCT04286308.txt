      ganglia, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia. The investigators will use a novel
      experimental approach and combination of analytic techniques to elucidate the contribution of
      neural activity in cortical-basal ganglia circuits to the hierarchical control of speech
      production, in subjects undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery.
