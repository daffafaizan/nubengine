      mass, decreased muscle mass, low bone density and adverse effects on quality of life and
      cardiovascular morbidity. These signs are nonspecific, and accurate diagnosis with laboratory
      tests in needed.

      The GHRH+arg test is used to diagnose AGHD, but the cut-off values vary based on controls
      used. At moment consensus cut-off criteria are BMI specific, but gender and age may also
      affect the GH response in the GHRH+arg.
