      undergo SECM probe imaging while using conscious sedation, pulse oximetry and blood pressure
      monitoring. The probe will be inserted the predetermined required distance in the esophagus
      using a guide wire.

      Once the SECM imaging probe is in place, spiral SECM image data will be continuously
      collected over a pre-determined length (approximately 5cm).
