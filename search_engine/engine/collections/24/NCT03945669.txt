      standard intramedullary nailing is compared with external ring fixator for patients with
      tibial shaft fractures.

      The primary aim of the project is to compare the one-year Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis
      Outcome Score - Sport (KOOS-Sport) after standard intramedullary nailing with external ring
      fixation for patients with tibial shaft fractures.

      The explorative aim is to report the effect of the two surgical procedures on the development
      of complications, time to bone union, pain reactions, muscle strength, activity of daily
      living and time to return to work.
