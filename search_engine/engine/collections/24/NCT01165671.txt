      The purpose of the trial is to compare a carbon ion boost to a proton boost delivered to the
      macroscopic tumor in combination with combined radiochemotherapy with TMZ in patients with
      primary GBM.

      The aim of the study is to compare overall survival as a primary endpoint, and progression
      free survival, toxicity and safety as secondary endpoints.

      Focus of the analysis is to evaluate the change in overall survival and local control by
      carbon ion radiotherapy. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to evaluate the improvement in
      outcome due to effect of the altered biology of carbon ions on GBM. Chemotherapy with TMZ is
      considered standard treatment and is administered continuously as it would be applied in
      standard patient care outside any trial.

      Trial Design The trial will be performed as a single-center two-armed randomized Phase II
      study.

      Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomized into two arms:

      Arm A - Experimental Arm Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy as a Boost to the macroscopic tumor
      Total Dose 18 Gy E, 6 fractions, 3 Gy E single dose

      Arm B - Standard Arm Proton Radiation Therapy as a Boost to the macroscopic tumor Total Dose
      10 Gy E, 5 fractions, 2 Gy E single dose

      Standard chemotherapy with TMZ will be continued during the experimental and standard arm in
      conventional dosing of 75 mg/m2 per day.
