      and has been linked to weight concerns, mental health concerns, and disordered eating
      behaviours. Effective interventions have been developed that address emotional eating, namely
      to improve weight loss. Such interventions are based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), which encourages tolerance of internal cues, such as emotions, and external cues, such
      as food.

      Previous studies have found that brief ACT interventions are effective for the reduction of
      emotional eating. Our laboratory has recently developed and pilot-tested a one-day ACT
      workshop intervention for emotional eating, which was found to be effective for reducing
      emotional eating and deemed feasible and acceptable by participants.

      The present study was developed with the aim to adapt the above mentioned workshop
      intervention to an online format in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The study aims to
      test the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a brief, online version of the above
      mentioned one-day ACT workshop for emotional eating. The workshops will be delivered through
      the Zoom online platform.
