      vulnerability for future depression. Importantly, experimental studies indicate that
      cognitive control training can be used to reduce rumination and depressive symptomatology in
      MDD samples. Furthermore, studies exploring the potential of cognitive control training in
      at-risk undergraduate students indicate that cognitive control training has beneficial
      effects on rumination, an important vulnerability factor for depression. Provided that
      remitted depressed patients form a high-risk group for developing future depressive episodes,
      the current study will explore whether internet-delivered cognitive control training can be
      used to reduce vulnerability for future depression in remitted depressed patients. The
      investigators will explore effects on depressive symptomatology, (mal-)adaptive emotion
      regulation (directly following training and at 3 months follow-up), and indices of
      functioning (at 3 months follow-up).
