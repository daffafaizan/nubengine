      cardiopulmonary exercise testing. They will also complete a heart failure questionnaire. In
      patients randomized to CMR guidance for the CRT procedure, LV lead placement will be guided
      by the MRI information related to scar, activation and anatomy. Patients will have follow-up
      assessments at 6 and 12 months. There will also be clinical follow-up for survival free of
      appropriate ICD therapies over 3 years.
