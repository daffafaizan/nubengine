      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol (alvocidib), irinotecan (irinotecan
      hydrochloride), and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. III.
      Determine, preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients are stratified according to the number of prior treatment regimens (0 or 1 vs more
      than 1). Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes
      followed immediately by cisplatin IV over 30 minutes followed 7 hours later by alvocidib IV
      over 1-4.5 hours weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin, alvocidib, and irinotecan
      hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional patients are treated at the
      recommended phase II dose.
