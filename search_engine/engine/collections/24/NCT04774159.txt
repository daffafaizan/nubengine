      active run-in period, comparing low dose colchicine 0.5 mg daily with placebo in patients
      with PAD to prevent vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular deaths,
      acute limb ischemia and vascular amputation) in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery
      disease. The sample size for the vanguard phase is 150 patients over 1-year accrual with a
      1-year follow-up.The primary outcome is the feasibility of recruitment. If feasibility is
      demonstrated, patients from the vanguard phase will be rolled over into the full multicenter
      trial if there are no major protocol modifications.
