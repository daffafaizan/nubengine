    
      Pseudophakic Bullous keratopathy is the second leading indication for endothelial
      keratoplasty. One of the main controversies in the management of PBK in the presence of an AC
      IOl is whether to retain the IOL or perform an IOL exchange with a PC IOL. The investigators
      believe that retention of an AC IOL can be hazardous to the DMEK graft due to reduced depth
      of the anterior chamber and traumatic touch between the graft and the IOL during graft
      unfolding and even postoperatively. On the other hand , performing an IOL exchange is
      relatively time consuming and requires excess manipulation of the iris tissue with the risk
      of intraoperative hyphema and postoperative inflammation which can affect the endothelial
      graft survival and cell count.

      Aim of the study : to compare the outcome and complications between performing intraocular
      lens (IOL) exchange and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) as single stage
      versus two stage procedure in the management of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy associated
      with anterior chamber IOL.

      Methods :

      The study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. Eligible subjects with
      pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and AC IOL will be assigned into two groups each comprising
      10 eyes. One group will undergo AC IOL exchange with posterior chamber (PC) IOL ( Poly methyl
      methacrylate (PMMA) lens or iris claw lens if there is no adequate capsular support) combined
      with DMEK in the same setting. The other group will undergo 2 stage procedure ; first one is
      IOL exchange , iridoplasty (if required) and inferior peripheral iridectomy and the second
      stage is DMEK one month later.
