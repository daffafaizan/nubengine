    
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established therapy for the treatment of chronic pain of
      the trunk and/or limbs. Standard practice includes a screening trial, typically lasting from
      3 days to 7 days or more, for both the physician and the patient to evaluate whether SCS
      therapy is appropriate for permanent implantation. Screening trial success (hereafter
      referred to as a trial) is often considered predictive of long-term success of the therapy,
      although that has never been definitively demonstrated.

      Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) developed the Observational Mechanical Gateway (OMG)
      connectors to allow patients who previously underwent an SCS trial using Medtronic or St Jude
      Medical leads, operating room cables (OR-cables), and external trial stimulators (ETSs), to
      be able to connect to BSC commercially approved Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) trial systems
      to evaluate the BSC SCS therapy in the physician office setting prior to removal of the
      non-BSC leads.
