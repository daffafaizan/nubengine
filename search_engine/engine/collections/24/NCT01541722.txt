      net gain in the fed state contributing to nitrogen balance. These physiologic processes are
      impacted during infection; whole-body protein catabolism exceeds protein synthesis, resulting
      in net loss of whole-body protein. Patients with urea cycle disorders suffer episodes of
      periodic hyperammonemic crisis, often in association with intercurrent infections. The
      immediate cause of this decompensation is the increase in endogenous protein catabolism that
      is the endpoint of a cascade triggered by intercurrent illness. This increase in protein
      catabolism leads to elevations of serum amino acids and ammonia production, which cannot be
      eliminated by a dysfunctional urea cycle.

      It is well known that infectious illnesses play a significant role in precipitating metabolic
      crises in urea cycle defects, presumably by triggering a cascade of events involving the
      release of inflammatory cytokines that lead to increased protein catabolism. Cytokines have
      also been implicated as distant mediators of oxidative stress. However, the correlation
      between oxidative stress, cytokine levels, and severity of a crisis is currently unclear.

      The primary purpose of the proposed study is to characterize the oxidative stress and
      inflammatory cytokine status in UCD during baseline and decompensated states. The
      investigators will undertake measurements of selected markers of oxidative stress and
      cytokines in serum and urine during baseline and decompensated states in subjects with UCD in
      order to establish their prognostic value as biomarkers for disease severity and/or
      predictors of metabolic decompensation.
