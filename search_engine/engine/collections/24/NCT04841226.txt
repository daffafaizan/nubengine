    
      A prospective, randomized, multi-center, post-market study in subjects that require a
      short-term indwelling Foley catheter.

      A randomly assigned catheter will be inserted using standard techniques. A urine sample will
      be collected immediately upon catheter insertion, in order to generate a baseline urinalysis
      and urine culture. Follow-up visits will be performed on Day 3, Day 5, Day 7, and Day 14, or
      until catheter removal at the clinic, and include obtaining urine samples for urinalysis and
      culture. When medically indicated, the catheter will be removed at the clinic. Prior to
      catheter removal, a urine sample will be obtained. Additionally, after catheter removal, a
      clean catch urine sample will be obtained, and the subject will exit the study. The explanted
      catheter is analyzed to determine the quantity of biofilm present on its surface.
