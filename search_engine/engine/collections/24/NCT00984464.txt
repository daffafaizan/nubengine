    
      Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the US and around the
      world with an increase in incidence of about 3-7% per year for fair-skinned Caucasian
      populations. An estimated 62,480 cases of invasive melanoma will be diagnosed in the US in
      2008 with an estimated 8,420 deaths. An additional 46,170 cases of melanoma in situ are
      predicted.

      Melanoma that has spread to distant sites (stage IV) is rarely curable.

      This Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN given
      intravenously in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks in patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      Response is a primary endpoint of this trial.

      Patients may continue to receive chemotherapy in combination with REOLYSIN for up to 8 cycles
      and may continue indefinitely on REOLYSIN monotherapy under this protocol, provided they have
      not experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug-related toxicity that does
      not respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.
