    
      The study consisted of a screening phase (maximum length of 21-day), a treatment phase with
      21-day treatment cycles and a 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.

      The cut-off date for study part 1 was when last participant completed the first treatment
      cycle and the subsequent 30 days follow-up.

      The cut off date for study part 2 was when all participants experienced disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or the last participant had completed 26 weeks or 6
      cycles on study treatment, whichever came first.

      Participants could continue to be treated on study as long as they were benefiting from study
      treatment and had not met study withdrawal criteria. After withdrawal from study treatment,
      further treatment, if any, was at the discretion of the Investigator.
