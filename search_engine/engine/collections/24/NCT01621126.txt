      the Latarjet procedure. By using neuromonitoring to determine exactly when there is a
      potential nerve injury during the procedure, the investigators will be able to modify what
      the investigators do at that step of the procedure, in order to decrease or possibly even
      eliminate the risk of neurologic injury. Modifications to our surgical technique in response
      to events observed on neuromonitoring would include repositioning the operative shoulder and
      upper extremity, and repositioning or removing retractors. The investigators believe this
      would lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of neurologic complications
      post-operatively. Since this operation is usually performed on young, active patients, the
      benefits of reducing or eliminating these complications would have a far-reaching impact both
      for the individual and for society. Above all, the investigators feel that this is an
      important patient safety initiative.
