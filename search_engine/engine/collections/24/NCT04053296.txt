      that leads to the loss of right heart function. Avoiding pregnancy is essential for PAH
      women. In recent years, maternal mortality in pregnant women with PAH has decreased mostly
      due to emerging advanced therapies for PAH and the progress in high-risk pregnancy
      management. Nevertheless, the maternal death rate in parturients with PAH remains high;
      therefore, contraception is still recommended for women diagnosed with PAH. However, some
      women develop this condition during pregnancy. With the two-child policy, families in China
      are allowed to have a second child. As a result, the number of PAH diagnoses during pregnancy
      may increase with the general increase in the number of pregnant women. Additionally, some
      patients develop PAH only during their second pregnancy. In order to investigate the
      incidence and clinical characteristics of pregnant women diagnosed with PAH during different
      pregnancies, this observational study aimed to analyze perinatal and pregnancy clinical data,
      to compare the perinatal status and maternal and infant outcomes of the first and second
      pregnancies complicated with PAH, establishing a clinical basis for the prenatal
      consultation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with PAH.
