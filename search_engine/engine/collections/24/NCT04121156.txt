      neuro-modulating technique, has been developed as a new therapeutic option for
      neuropsychiatric disorders. It encompasses the induction of a relatively weak constant
      current flow through the cerebral cortex via scalp electrodes. Dependent on stimulation
      polarity, this results in a modulation of cortical excitability and spontaneous neural
      activity. Compared with tDCS, high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation
      (HD-tDCS) is highly focal and can specifically modulate cortical activity within the region
      confined by its 4 x 1 ring of elctrodes, such that the targeted region becomes more amenable
      to neuroplastic change. Studies have suggested that tDCS improve cognition, including memory
      recall, verbal fluency and executive function. Yet, there is not HD-tDCS study on MCI. The
      purpose of this study is to examine whether HD-tDCS could benefit global cognitive function
      and sub-domains of cognition (visual/verbal/working memory, executive function, attention,
      processing speed, language, and frontal lobe function), mood (depression and anxiety), and
      subjective memory impairment in patients with mild cognitive impairment.
