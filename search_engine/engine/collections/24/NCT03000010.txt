      be randomized to a standard postoperative dressing versus an incisional VAC dressing. Both
      groups will have hematocrit, total lymphocyte count, and albumin checked preoperatively to
      assess nutritional status, drawn at the same time as standard preoperative labs during
      history and physical visit. Both groups will undergo standard wound closure and dressing
      application before breaking the sterile field. The incisional VAC group will undergo
      placement of an Adaptic dressing over the incision. A standard VAC sponge will be placed and
      secured with adhesive dressing, and a suction tube will be connected to a VAC machine set to
      75 mmHg of continuous suction. The incisional VAC will be left in place for 72 hours
      postoperatively. Remainder of postoperative care will follow our standard posterior spinal
      fusion protocol and will be identical in both groups. Patients will be followed for a minimum
      of 2 years postoperatively.
