      and age between 40-60 years. Initial screening of the subjects will be carried out by the
      referring consultant. Subjects who fulfilled the study criteria will be recruited using
      computer generated random sampling after explaining the study objective and taken written
      informed consent. All participants will be evaluated using visual analogue scale, Knee injury
      and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and 6-minute walk test for pain severity, functional
      limitation and submaximal exercise capacity at 1st, 3rd and 6th week. The subjects will be
      allocated into three groups through computer generated random allocation. Group 1 will
      receive mulligan mobilization with kinesiotaping and knee strengthening. Group 2 will receive
      trunk stabilization exercise, knee strengthening and Kinesiotaping. Group 3 will receive knee
      strengthening along with kinesiotaping. A drop-out rate of 9 will be taken. Recorded data
      will be entered and analysed using SPSS version 21. Mean and SD will be calculated of
      quantitative variables like age, pain, knee related function, submaximal exercise capacity
      and stair climb by using repeated measure ANOVA. For pair wise comparison, post hoc tukey
      will be applied. Value of equal to or less than 0.05 will be considered significant.
