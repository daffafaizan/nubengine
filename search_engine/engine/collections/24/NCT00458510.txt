      of most BTCP episodes, they continue to act longer than the episode of pain lasts and so can
      have unwanted side effects due to this 'over treatment' of the pain episode. In addition most
      cancer patients have oral problems which make taking pain relief medication by mouth
      uncomfortable for the patient. Nasalfent is administered via the nose as a simple spray and
      can be taken by patients or given by their carers. The nasal route is a common way to
      administer medication for example in the treatment of migraine or allergy. At any time during
      the study the patient may take their regular treatment for BTCP should they so wish.

      This study will examine the long-term safety of Nasalfent treatment for breakthrough cancer
      pain.

      After the study is completed, patients may continue to take medication if their doctor feels
      it is in the patient's best interest to do so. Safety information will continue to be
      collected during this period. Treatment may continue on study for as long as the patient
      requires treatment or until Nasalfent becomes commercially available.
