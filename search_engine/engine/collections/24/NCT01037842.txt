    
      This was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind study for comparing metformin plus mitiglinide
      (Met+Mit) versus metformin plus placebo (Met+Pcb). An 8-week metformin run-in phase (500 mg
      twice a day for the first 4 weeks and 500 mg three times a day for the following 4 weeks) was
      followed by a 16-week trial phase (mitiglinide 10 mg or placebo three times a day added to
      metformin 500 mg three times a day). The subjects with an HbA1c >7.0% at the end of the
      metformin run-in phase were randomized to a Met+Mit group or a Met+Pcb group of the trial
      phase.
