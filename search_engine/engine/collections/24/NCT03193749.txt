      Colombia. Such sample size will provide 82% of statistical power to detect at least a 30%
      relative reduction in the primary outcome. This is assuming that at least 75% of untreated
      participants will test positive at least once after three qualitative PCR assays for
      Trypanosoma cruzi during the 6th month after randomization (allowing for up to 10% losses to
      follow up and treatment adherence over 90%).

      ATTACH is currently seeking collaborating centers internationally. The current funding
      structure will allow to test study hypothesis on trypanocidal effect, whereas data on
      clinical effects will be exploratory. Investigators expect to increase the sample size to at
      least 600 participants in order to a) enhance geographical variability/generalizability for
      the primary results and b) to achieve enough statistical power to test the hypothesis on
      clinical impact.

      New centers are welcome to join this protocol, either as a placebo-controlled or as a
      pragmatic, open label trial. These centers will be working with the central coordination with
      their own funding/logistic capabilities. In the open label protocol, eligible, consenting
      participants will be randomly prescribed or not to Amiodarone. As assessing clinical impact
      will be the priority, new centers are not required to have on-site PCR capabilities. These
      centers are encouraged to store blood samples for PCR testing elsewhere later, if possible.
