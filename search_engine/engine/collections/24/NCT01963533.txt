      including hydrogen peroxide, UV, and x-irradiation, transforming growth factor-beta,
      overexpression of oncogenes such as Ha-Ras. The cellular stress induced telomere shortening
      and/or telomere dysfunction and promote accelerated senescence in normal and malignant cells.
      Oxidative stress, which presented in several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as
      atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive airway disease, was also
      found to be correlated with telomere shortening.
