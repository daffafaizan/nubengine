      including TUS. Investigators routinely observed increased blood creatinine and urea levels in
      some of patients who received TUS.

      Half of patients will receive TUS treatment for low back pain while the other half will not
      receive. The patients will be evaluated at baseline and the end of the treatment . The serum
      creatinine, serum cystatin C, 24-hour urine creatinine, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urine
      microalbumin and microprotein, urine volume, and GFR will be measured at each evaluation.
