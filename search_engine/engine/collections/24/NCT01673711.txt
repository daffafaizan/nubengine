      I. To determine the relationship between urinary deuterated ([D10]) phenanthrene tetraol
      (PheT) level, PheT:phenanthrols (HOPhe) ratio, and the presence of bronchoepithelial
      metaplasia and/or dysplasia in smokers who have undergone screening bronchoscopy at Roswell
      Park Cancer Institute (RPCI).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive deuterated phenanthrene tetraol orally (PO). Urine samples are collected for
      laboratory studies for 6 hours after dosing.
