      pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia and 105 with normal pregnancy.

      The investigators aim is to investigate the role of the placenta, umbilical cord and amniotic
      membrane aquaporin expression in etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia. The investigators will
      compare aquaporin levels in preeclamptic and normal placentas, umbilical cords and amniotic
      membranes , and investigate relation between aquaporin levels and perinatal ( maternal blood
      pressure, proteinuria, maternal-fetal doppler ultrasound, amniotic fluid index, fetal
      intrauterine growth) and neonatal ( Apgar score, biometry, complications) finding.
