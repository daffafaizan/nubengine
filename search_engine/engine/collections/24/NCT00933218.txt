      coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders.

      Aerobic exercise has anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the exertional exercise of
      marathon running causes an acute pro-inflammatory impulse. This may lead to myocardial injury
      and, in case of preexisting plaques, may result in plaque rupture and acute myocardial
      infarction.

      We aim to define the critical role of inflammatory markers and cardiovascular risc factors as
      a predictor of an increased risk for myocardial and endothelial dysfunction in marathon
      runners.

      Diagnostic tools include measurements of microvasculature, the large vessels and
      echocardiography. Inflammatory markers include high sensitive c-reactive protein (CRP) and
      interleukins.

      All variations are analysed on the basis of consumption of polyphenols as they are found in
      in hops (Humulus lupus L.) and beer.
