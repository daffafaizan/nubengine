      dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico (May 2009) presents a risk to the blood supply in Puerto Rico.
      Also, on July 13th 2010 federal officials reported an outbreak of dengue fever in Florida
      after a survey of Key West residents found that at least 5% had been infected or exposed to
      the virus. Therefore this IND study is being carried out to identify blood donors carrying
      the dengue virus using the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad, France). Prospective testing is
      being performed on blood donors who have read an information sheet regarding the use of
      donated blood samples in research. Testing will occur at the American Red Cross, Charlotte,
      NC NTL site.
