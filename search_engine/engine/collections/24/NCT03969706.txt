    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To determine the efficacy of abemaciclib for recurrent oligodendroglioma, as measured by
      the estimated proportion of patients alive without disease progression at 6 months from study
      enrollment (PFS-6)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in recurrent oligodendroglioma

        -  To estimate the objective radiographic response rate (ORR) associated with abemaciclib
           in recurrent oligodendroglioma

        -  To determine the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of
           patients with recurrent oligodendroglioma treated with abemaciclib

        -  To determine ORR, PFS, and OS in the subgroup of recurrent oligodendroglioma patients
           with tumor CIC gene mutations

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To measure pharmacodynamic markers of abemaciclib activity on oligodendroglial tumor
           cells

        -  To identify pre-treatment tumor characteristics that are associated with response to
           abemaciclib recurrent oligodendroglioma
