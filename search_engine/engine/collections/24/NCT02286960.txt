      undergoing voice therapy. Enrolled subjects will be randomized using a random numbers table
      to either receive oral steroids or no steroids prior to the initiation of voice therapy. The
      therapist and individuals involved in the collection and analysis of data will be blinded as
      to whether the subject received drug. Prior to initiation of therapy subjects will be asked
      to return for an interval evaluation during which they undergo videostroboscopy and voice
      evaluation. Subjects will enter then the voice therapy phase . After an initial evaluation to
      determine the best mode of therapy they will receive a behavioral voice therapy course, which
      includes a range of behavioral modifications and motor learning techniques, along with
      lifestyle measures. In all these phases acoustic and aerodynamic measurements will be
      collected as well as audio-visual material from the videostroboscopic exams. The measurements
      that will be collected in all these phases are the Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-10 , the noise
      to harmonic ratio H/N, the fundamental frequency Fo, The transglottic airflow and subglottic
      pressure. The investigators hypothesize that oral steroids will lead to a reduction in lesion
      size, which will substantially aid in the delivery and incorporation of voice therapy
      techniques, contributing to the improvement of overall laryngeal biomechanics and providing
      an ideal starting point for behavioral voice therapy.
