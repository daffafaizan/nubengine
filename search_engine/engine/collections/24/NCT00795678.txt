        -  To determine the concentration of capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin
           hydrochloride, gemcitabine hydrochloride, lapatinib ditosylate, paclitaxel, trastuzumab
           (Herceptin®), or vinorelbine ditartrate in brain metastases in women with breast cancer.

        -  To analyze drug penetrability by modeling the relationship between drug concentration in
           the tumor and drug concentration in blood samples.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to receive 1 of the 8 agents by the patient's treating
      oncologist.

      Patients receive a single dose of the following study drugs immediately preceding surgery:
      oral capecitabine; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15
      minutes; gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes; oral lapatinib ditosylate*; paclitaxel
      IV over 3 hours; trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes; or vinorelbine ditartrate IV
      over 10-30 minutes . Patients then undergo craniotomy for resection of the brain metastases.

      NOTE: *Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate at least 3 days prior to surgery and
      immediately before surgery.

      All patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, paclitaxel, or vinorelbine ditartrate also receive a single dose of
      pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) 24-48 hours after the study drug administration OR
      filgrastim (G-CSF) SC once daily for 10 days, beginning 24-48 hours after the study drug
      administration.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacological studies. Tissue samples obtained
      at surgical resection and blood samples are used to establish cell lines and analyzed for
      drug concentration by HPLC, LC-MS/MS or ELISA.
