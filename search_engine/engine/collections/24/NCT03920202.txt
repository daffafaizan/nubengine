      (LAR) with total mesorectal excision (TME). Unfortunately, up to 80 % of patients undergoing
      LAR will suffer of bowel dysfunction including faecal urgency, frequent bowel movements,
      tenesmus or so called Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS). Simply it has been defined as
      "disordered bowel function after rectal resection, leading to a detriment in quality of
      life". Same year LARS score was developed. This tool is easy to use and has been
      internationally and in Lithuania validated. Wexner score is another tool for evaluation of
      faecal continence.

      There are only five studies investigating long-term results after rectal surgery and
      influence it has on patients' daily life. In one study 47 of 51 patients experienced LARS
      following ultra-low anterior resection after average 6.5 years. Another study recently
      reported major LARS in 46% of the patients with the mean median follow-up of 14.6 years.
      Others showed that 47.5% of patients still experience LARS symptoms at a follow-up period of
      13.7 years. Just recently published study assessed bowel function 12 years in patients
      undergoing rectal resection with or without preventing ileostomy. Authors found that 63 (72%)
      patients of 87 experienced LARS symptoms with more than a half complaining of major LARS.
      Moreover, just last year a study published showing that 73% of patients had LARS at first
      follow up 5 years after the surgery. During the second visit (another 5 years later) same
      numbers were seen.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate late functional results of patients who underwent
      rectal resection for rectal cancer. This included calculating LARS and Wexner score and
      identifying possible risk factors of late postoperative bowel disorders.
