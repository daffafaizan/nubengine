      excess increases the relative risk of disease and mortality 1-4. A range of diseases, notably
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes and a number of cancers, are related to excess weight 5.
      Traditional low-calorie diets are frequently ineffective 6. Although a number of
      pharmacological approaches for treatment of obesity have been investigated, only few are safe
      and most of them have adverse effects 7,8. Thus, further studies are necessary in order to
      find natural antiobesity remedies. Gut microbiota composition is thought to influence body
      weight 9.

      As recently demonstrated in our previous study 10, "Acqua Santa di Chianciano"® helps to
      maintain the body weight and the values of serum lipids stable in subjects under a relatively
      high-calorie diet. Possible mechanisms may be a) changing the gut microbiota composition
      and/or b) increasing the concentration and/or the qualitative pattern of serum bile acids
      with a subsequent increase of the energy expenditure 11. This study wants to assess the
      effectiveness in losing weight of "Acqua Santa di Chianciano"® in addition to a low-calorie
      diet and its effects on gut microbiota composition.
