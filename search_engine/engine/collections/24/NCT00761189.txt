      (conducted in more than one center), prospective (study following participants forward in
      time), single arm, and non-comparative study of paliperidone Extended Release(ER) in
      participants with schizophrenia. The total study duration will be approximately of 104 weeks
      per participant. The study consists of following parts: Screening (that is, 14 days before
      study commences on Day 1); acute Treatment phase (single-oral dose of paliperidone for 12
      weeks, dose ranging from 3 to 12 milligram); Extension phase 1 (12 weeks) and Maintenance
      treatment which will be followed by additional Extension phase 2 and long-term maintenance
      treatment. Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated by Clinical Global
      Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
