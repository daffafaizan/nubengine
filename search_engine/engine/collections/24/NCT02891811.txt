      common hematologic malignancy and accounts for approximately 72,000 annual deaths worldwide.
      There are an estimated 11,000 deaths per year in the US and more than 19,000 deaths per year
      in Europe.

      This study examines the efficacy of carfilzomib (K) in combination with thalidomide, an old,
      well established first line immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiD) in newly diagnosed multiple
      myeloma versus K in combination with lenalidomide in 1st line. This trial will also evaluate
      the adherence to and the safety of a thalidomide containing triplet by using a non-neurotoxic
      proteasome inhibitor. Moreover, weekly dosing of carfilzomib addresses the need for a more
      convenient dosing schedule. Finally, yet importantly, this trial will assess the efficacy of
      a less cost intensive triplet and a strategy to keep lenalidomide as backup for later lines..
      The second part of the study - after completing 9 cycles induction therapy with KTd or KRd -
      patients of both arms will be pooled and again randomized 1:1 stratified by induction therapy
      into two arms (K-monotherapy versus observation-only).
