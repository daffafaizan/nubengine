      populations will further raise the burden and costs. Within the UK, falls have become a major
      government target, as they have been responsible for increased injuries and hospital
      admissions in elderly people.

      The fall rate amongst patients on haemodialysis (HD) is much greater than in the general
      population. There are many well established risk factors for falling, many of which are
      commonly present in patients on HD, including severe loss of muscle mass, high levels of
      inactivity, co-existing medical conditions and a high number of medications.

      Nonetheless, the main cause of health complications and death in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
      is due to cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease may result in suboptimal regulation
      of blood pressure and heart rate during exercise, dialysis therapy, body transfers, and
      general activities of daily living. Associated symptoms such as dizziness, generalised
      fatigue, and muscular weakness, are commonly reported and may further predispose patients on
      HD to balance deficits and falls.

      Despite the evidence of high falls rates in patients on HD and the growing number of elderly
      patients, falls and their associated risk factors have received little research attention.

      The aim of this study therefore is explore the relative importance of selected
      exercise-modifiable risk factors for falling amongst patients on HD.
