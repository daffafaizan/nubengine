      The routine use of banding ligation, vasoactive drugs, and antibiotics has had an impact on
      survival rates such that survival rates of patients with Childs-Pugh A and B class cirrhosis
      may be as high as 90% at 30 days. However, the successful outcome of variceal bleeding is
      compromised in some patients because of initial failure to control bleeding or early
      re-bleeding, both of which have a significant impact on mortality.

      The SX-Ella Danis stent (Ella-CS, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic) is a removable, covered,
      self-expanding mesh-metal stent (SEMS) that can be deployed in the lower oesophagus over an
      endoscopically placed guidewire without radiological screening. The stent controls bleeding
      by tamponade of varices in the lower oesophagus.

      The series reported to date suggest that the self-expandable covered stents can provide 100%
      haemostasis rates when applied for refractory oesophageal variceal bleeding. Given the
      potentially lower risks of re-bleeding and safe, easy insertion techniques the
      self-expandable covered stents may offer a superior alternative to standard endoscopic
      therapy.
