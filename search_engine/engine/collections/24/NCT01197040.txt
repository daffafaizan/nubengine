      steroid. However, the side effects in adult patients are often significant and induce a lot
      of complications. This prospective study aimed to compare low dose steroid combined with
      mycophenolic acid (MyforticR) versus high dose steroid in the treatment of the first episode
      of MCNS.

      Treatment Plan

      After baseline evaluation including clinical biological and histological analyses, all
      eligible patients will be an open label assigned to two groups:

      Group A: patients will receive prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Then, the dose will be
      progressively tapered if the remission will be achieved. For patients who exhibit incomplete
      remission at this time, high dose steroid will be continued for 4 weeks again before the
      tapering.

      Group B: patients will receive prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day combined with mycophenolic acid
      (MyforticR) 1440 mg/day. The management of steroid therapy will be identical in both groups,
      while MyforticR will be continued for six months.

      In both groups, patients who will not achieve remission after 8 weeks of steroid therapy at
      full dose will be excluded from the study.

      Statistical Analysis In this multicenter, randomized trial, the primary and secondary end
      points will be the rate of complete remission within 4 and 8 weeks of the start of induction
      therapy, respectively.
