      performance and may reduce falls, less is known about the responsiveness to specific
      interventions or the relation between response to intervention and the underlying problems or
      impairments. Therapeutic approaches for improving mobility and reducing fall risk are
      heterogeneous, but do not consistently focus on problem solving as a method of enhancing
      motor control or skill, an approach that has been found to be important for motor learning in
      animal models.

      This two-year pilot study will allows us to compare the clinical, psychological and
      laboratory outcomes after a motor-learning based and an impairment-targeted exercise
      intervention to improve walking in older adults. All subjects will participate in pre and
      post intervention testing and a 12 week exercise intervention for gait involving either a
      motor learning (skill enhancement) or impairment-targeted (lower extremity strengthening,
      flexibility and gait cues).
