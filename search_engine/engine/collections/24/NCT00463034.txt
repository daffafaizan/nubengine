      Primary

        -  Correlate inherited and acquired variations in candidate genes with breast cancer
           progression and survival in women with newly diagnosed or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Establish a repository of blood and tumor samples from these patients, linked to a
           database of clinical, pathological, and treatment outcome data for future research
           studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete epidemiological questionnaires and undergo blood sample
      collection. Tumor tissue specimens are requested from the pathology departments.

      Blood samples are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms and other polymorphic variants
      in candidate genes by polymerase chain reaction. Candidate genes include genes involved in
      the DNA damage response, programed cell death, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Tumor samples
      are analyzed by tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry, denaturing high-performance
      liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing to study genetic changes in the tumor.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,800 patients will be accrued for this study.
