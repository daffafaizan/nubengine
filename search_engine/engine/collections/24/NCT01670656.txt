      dysmenorrhea, and should identify at least one vaginal ring that shows clinically relevant
      treatment efficacy in relief of primary dysmenorrhea. The intake of ibuprofen rescue
      medication and the impact on daily life is investigated: change from baseline data of these
      two variables will be compared between each of the four active ring groups, separately, and
      the placebo ring group. Furthermore, the study assesses the measurement characteristics and
      psychometric properties of a newly developed Dysmenorrhea Daily Dairy. Vaginal bleeding
      pattern and general safety and tolerability will also be evaluated.
