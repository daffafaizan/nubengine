    
      Explore which clinical risk factors or patient characteristics in a general population that
      are associated with increased risk for heart failure events and combine these into a new
      population-based heart failure risk score ("The HUNT for heart failure risk score") for
      predicting heart failure risk

      Validate the newly developed heart failure risk score internally in the HUNT2 database

      Compare the predictive ability of the new heart failure risk score with established heart
      failure risk scores (the ABC Health HF risk score, the Framingham HF risk score) and an
      established Norwegian cardiovascular risk score (NORRISK 2)

      Estimate the prevalence of likely ("undiagnosed") heart failure , i.e., patients at high risk
      of HF, in a general population by using both the established heart failure risk scores and
      the newly developed heart failure risk score, and compare the heart failure event rate
      between those at high risk of heart failure and those with established heart failure.
