      tolerability of p-inulin (PrebiotinÂ®, provided by JGI Medical) in altering the composition
      and function of the human gut microbiome, thereby reducing the generation of gut-derived
      uremic toxins, improving gut barrier function and attenuating systemic inflammation in
      patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis. The study also aims to assess the feasibility
      of conducting a full-scale trial of p-inulin. The primary efficacy parameters of the trial
      will be intra- and inter-participant variability in gut metabolites and bacterial
      composition. Secondary parameters of interest include tolerability and safety of p-inulin,
      willingness of hemodialysis patients to enroll in a study requiring repeated collection of
      stool samples, and participant adherence to agent treatment and specimen collection
      schedules.
