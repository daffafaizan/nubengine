      the first year is to develop a safe and appropriate SEB program for the elderly residents in
      long term care facilities using Delphi survey with a panel of 12 experts and pilot-testing on
      a group of 15-20 elderly residents in long term care facilities. In the second year of the
      study, a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design will be used to evaluate the
      effects of the SEB exercise program on the physical functional fitness
      (cardiovascular-respiratory function, body flexibility, muscle power/muscle endurance, and
      balance) and sleep quality of elderly residents in long term care facilities. Through the
      convenience sampling strategy, a total of four long term care facilities with approximately
      120 elders in Kaohsiung will be recruited and randomly assigned based on the resided
      facilities to a SEB experimental group or a waiting-list control group. The subjects in the
      experimental group will receive the SEB interventions lead by the certified instructors,
      three times per week, 40 minutes per practice for six months; the subjects in the
      waiting-list control group will remain regular daily activities in the facilities. All
      subjects will receive one pre-test and two post-tests three months apart during the study. In
      the third year, the elderly participants will continue practicing the SEB guided by a VCD for
      another nine months, and the compliance of the participants toward regular SEB exercise and
      its long-term effects on the physical functional fitness and sleep quality outcomes will be
      tested with additional three post-tests, three months apart.
