      diagnoses scans using an AI cancer likelihood score; "classification plus detection", where
      the radiologist see detecting lung nodules in addition to the AI's probabilistic
      classification score before making her own examination of the CT-scan; and "classification
      with delayed detection", where the radiologist identifies regions of interest independently
      of the AI and then sees the AI's detected ROIs.
