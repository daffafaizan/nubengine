        -  Compare the efficacy of vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor
           and influenza antigen peptides with or without ex vivo CD40-ligand and denileukin
           diftitox, in terms of tumor-specific T-cell response, in patients with HLA-A1- and/or
           HLA-A2.1-positive stage III or IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of these vaccinations in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with these vaccinations.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Phase I (Administration of denileukin diftitox and vaccinations #1 to #4): Patients
           undergo leukapheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC). PBMC
           are processed for the generation of dendritic cells (DC) to be used for vaccinations. DC
           are pulsed with HLA-A1- and HLA-A2.1-restricted peptides derived from
           melanoma-associated tumor antigens. DC are pulsed with or without ex vivo treatment with
           CD40-ligand. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV for 3 consecutive days before the
           first vaccination. Patients receive 4 pulsed DC vaccinations subcutaneously (SC) on days
           1, 14, 42, and 70 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who show a tumor response (at least stable disease) may receive vaccination #5 and
      further booster vaccinations.

        -  Phase II: DC are generated and pulsed as in phase I. Patients receive up to 6 additional
           booster pulsed DC vaccinations SC on days 126, 184, 268, 356, 520, and 692 in the
           absence of disease progession or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
