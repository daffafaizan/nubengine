    
      The study is a 6-month large scale assessment of an information system consisting in a
      glucose meter with multiple alerts (Accu-Chek Inform) associated with a data base (Cobas IT
      1000) in order to share the results of glucose monitoring using the hospital information
      network.

      The appraisal of the glycemic control was based on the rate of capillary blood glucose
      measurements within a pre-defined target range (3.9-8.5 mMol/l) during each study period.

      Whether the system implementation can improve the outcome related to the management of
      in-patients with diabetes is assessed in 3 hospital departments (Diabetology, Cardiology and
      Pulmonary Care) as follows:

        -  principal objective, glycemic control of in-patients (Cardiology and Pulmonary Care) as
           the rate of capillary blood glucose (CBG) values within the pre-defined target range,
           and comparison of results observed during period I (meter warning not activated) and
           period II (warning of the meter on out-of-target glucose level activated).

        -  the impact on the performance of quality controls of CBG measurements with (period II)
           or without (period I) activation of a warning on the meter related to inappropriate
           quality control frequency (all departments).

        -  evaluate the traceability of CBG results and compare it with (period II) or without
           (period I) the activation of the automatic record of data ensured by the Accu-Chek
           Inform meter and Cobas IT 1000 data base (all departments).

        -  during a sub-period of period II, the impact on patient glycemic control of the
           intervention of a diabetologist, determined by the activation of a warning sent to the
           physician in case of out of target CBG results via the Cobas IT 1000 data base
           (Cardiology and Pulmonary Care).

        -  the impact of the above warning activation plus diabetologist intervention on the
           incidence of low CBG.
