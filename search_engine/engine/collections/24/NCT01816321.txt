      definition in order to select patients suitable for inclusion in future clinical trials as
      poor ovarian responders, the so-called "Bologna criteria". However, a limited number of
      studies has been published to date including patients with poor ovarian response according to
      the "Bologna criteria", whereas no randomized trial is published or ongoing for this
      population.

      Preliminary reports in "Bologna poor responders" highlight the limited prospects for these
      women. Natural cycle IVF has been shown to result in disappointingly low live birth rates,
      regardless of patients' age and ovarian stimulation with widely accepted treatment
      modalities, e.g. short agonist protocol, did not appear demonstrate substantial benefits.

      Nonetheless, despite the disappointing results from the vast majority of the preliminary
      studies in this population, a recent pilot study by our group has shown that a specific
      protocol may indeed be a promising option for women of younger age fulfilling the "Bologna
      criteria". Corifollitropin alfa followed by highly purified hMG in an antagonist protocol
      demonstrated an ongoing pregnancy rate of 28% in women <40years, strongly suggesting the
      conduction of a future randomized trial testing this novel treatment protocol
