      should evidence change on the benefits/harms of the interventions being trialed.

      Cohort 1. Currently index cases with mild COVID-19 or moderate pneumonia will be randomized
      to ivermectin 0.3-0.4mg/Kg daily for 3 days (arms 1 and 2) or non-identical placebo (arm 3).
      Index case randomization will also include HH members who will be treated with ivermectin
      0.3-0.4mg/Kg daily for 3 days (arm 1) or non-identical placebo (arms 2 and 3). All households
      will receive a preventative package (containing soap, bleach, cloth facemasks and
      instructions on their use).

      Cohort 2. Patients admitted to hospital meeting WHO criteria for severe COVID-19 pneumonia
      will be randomized to aspirin 150mg daily or non-identical placebo for 28 days or until
      hospital discharge (whichever is sooner). Other care will follow National guidelines.

      The study will be conducted at multiple sites in The Gambia, with the option to recruit from
      other West African countries should this be necessary (subject to further local ethical
      review/s).
