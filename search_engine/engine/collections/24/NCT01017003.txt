      pharmacokinetics of colchicine 0.6 mg given orally to colchicine pharmacokinetics after 10
      days of a standard prophylactic dose (0.6 mg every 12 hours) in healthy volunteers. After a
      fast of at least 10 hours, fourteen healthy non-smoking, non-obese, non-pregnant volunteers
      will receive a single oral dose of colchicine 0.6 mg. Fasting will continue for 4 hours after
      the dose, at which time a standard meal will be served. Blood will be drawn from all
      participants at times sufficient to adequately define the single dose pharmacokinetics of
      colchicine and its 3 major metabolites, 2, 3 and 10 demethylcolchicine. Following a 14 day
      washout period, all participants will begin a 10 day regimen of colchicine 0.6 mg orally
      every 12 hours. On the morning of day 25, after a fast of at least 10 hours, all participants
      will receive their final dose of colchicine 0.6 mg. Again blood will be drawn at times
      sufficient to determine the pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its 3 major metabolites after
      chronic dosing. The pharmacokinetic parameters for each dosing situation will be derived and
      compared for relevant differences. Though not a specific goal of this study, all participants
      will be monitored for adverse events by observation and query during periods of confinement
      on days 1, 15 and 25, as well as by complete blood count (CBC) with differential and clinical
      chemistry, sitting and standing blood pressures, and heart rate and 12-lead electrocardiogram
      (EKG) before and after dosing, on days 1 and 25.
