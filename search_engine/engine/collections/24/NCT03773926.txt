      areas (Weisz et al. (2005), Schlee et al. (2014)). Led by this finding, attempts to normalize
      such localized pathological activity by neuro-feedback techniques have been tested (Dohrmann
      et al. (2007), GÃ¼tenspenger et al. (2017)). These attempts highlighted interindividual
      variability that can be explained by lack of selection of the patient population and lack of
      guidance through the therapy. The present study is aimed at addressing these issues by
      choosing more selectively a patient subpopulation (tinnitus associated with moderate hearing
      loss) and by implementing a guidance interface during the treatment.

      The therapy will consist of 10 neuro-feedback training sessions of 29 minutes over 5 weeks.
      Each session will be composed of 6 blocks of 3 min in which the patient will be incited to
      practise a specific cognitive strategy (mental exercise such as "think to a music you like")
      and resting state measurements.

      Each patient who has been recruited to fit our inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will
      first go through a clinical assessment of his initial judgment criteria metrics. Then
      subjects will go through the 5-week training and then will be evaluated on the same criteria
      just after the end of the therapy and at 3 months after the end of it.
