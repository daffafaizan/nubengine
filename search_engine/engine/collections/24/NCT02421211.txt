      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance) study. The study will
      consist of 3 study phases: Screening Phase (5 weeks), an Open-label Treatment Phase (70 days
      for Panel 1 and 56 days for Panel 2), a Post-treatment Follow-up Phase (12 weeks after the
      actual end of treatment). Participants will receive a combination of the following
      treatments: Treatment A: SMV 150 milligram (mg) once daily; Treatment B: LDV 90 mg along with
      SOF 400 mg once daily; Treatment C: SOF 400 mg once daily. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to Panel 1 (Treatment AC followed by Treatment AB) and Panel 2 (Treatment B followed
      by Treatment AB). The total study duration will be approximately 27 weeks for participants in
      Panel 1 and 25 weeks for participants in Panel 2. Participants will be primarily accessed for
      pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
