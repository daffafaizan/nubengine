    
      Randomized, controlled, national, multicenter, prospective study to compare between
      azathioprine (conventional therapy) and rituximab in patients with systemic ANCA-associated
      vasculitis, in remission (achieved with an induction treatment combining corticosteroids and
      an immunosuppressant, mainly intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchanges
      and/or polyvalent immunoglobulins when indicated) after the first flare of the disease (new
      diagnosis) or after a relapse. It is planned to stratify patients by first flare (66% of the
      patients) or relapse (33% of the patients). Patients complying with the inclusion criteria
      may be included when they are in remission from their vasculitis. Patients who have already
      received biologics (antiCD20, antiTNFÎ±) will not be included. Patients will be included at
      the time of remission and then randomized. They will receive maintenance treatment by
      azathioprine for 18 months or a rituximab infusion every 6 months until month 18 (i.e. a
      total of 4 infusions), at the dose of 375 mg/m2 (maximum dosage, 500 mg). ANCA status and
      CD19+ lymphocyte count will be monitored but will not be used to adjust therapy. After the 18
      month length of maintenance phase, i.e. after stopping immunosuppressive maintenance therapy,
      patients will be followed for an additional 10 month period. Patients with Wegener's
      granulomatosis will be prescribed cotrimoxazole 160/800 tid (for 2 additional years).
