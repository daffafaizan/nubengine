      of interest for health systems across the country. Systematic approaches to collect patient
      QOL data are needed to properly understand and act on this information. At Allina Health, the
      process of systematically collecting this information began in July, 2012. The information is
      not only collected by providers, but used to enhance the patient experience and provide
      patients with an active voice in their care. By considering QOL as another vital sign, Allina
      caregivers have an instantaneous understanding of the patient's health status and can utilize
      the data in real time. Additionally, by collecting this information at each visit, providers
      also have a longitudinal perspective of the patient's QOL and the health of the population of
      individuals under their care. Consequently, they can provide patients with resources and
      support that can have a positive impact on their health and well-being.

      The purpose of this retrospective chart review pilot study is to research the results and
      scores of the QOL questionnaire implemented across Allina Health clinics. This study will
      investigate average QOL scores by clinical population and demographic group, the change in
      scores over time, and the effect of clinical interventions on QOL scores. The results will
      provide insight into QOL trends within different patient populations and provide guidance
      regarding optimal treatment plans so that Allina caregivers can positively impact patients'
      QOL.
