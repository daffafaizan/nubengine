    
      This is a Phase Ib, open label, non-randomized dose escalation study of EGF816 in combination
      with ribociclib, trametinib, or LXH254, followed by dose expansion of EGF816 in combination
      with ribociclib, trametinib, LXH254, INC280, or gefitinib in adult patients with advanced
      EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

      During the dose escalation part, patients will be assigned to the addition of trametinib,
      ribociclib, or LXH254 to EGF816.

      Following determination of the recommended dose for the combination of EGF816 + trametinib,
      EGF816 + ribociclib, and EGF816 + LXH254, patients may be enrolled to the dose expansion arms
      of each of these combinations. Patients may also be assigned to EGF816 + INC280 or EGF816 +
      gefitinib in dose expansion.

      Efficacy assessments will be performed at baseline and every 2 cycles during treatment.
