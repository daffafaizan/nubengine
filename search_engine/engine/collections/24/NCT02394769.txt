      to reduce risk of colorectal cancer. Within the gastroenterology practice of Massachusetts
      General Hospital (MGH), we will conduct a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial to measure the effects of daily low-dose (81 mg/day) and
      standard-dose (325 mg/day) aspirin on urine, plasma, stool, and tissue biomarkers associated
      with colorectal cancer.

      Aspirin is part of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) family, which are drugs
      routinely used for their pain-killing (analgesic), fever-reducing (antipyretic), or
      anti-inflammatory properties. Most NSAIDs are available as over-the-counter formulations.
      Substantial evidence has conclusively demonstrated that aspirin reduces the risk of
      colorectal neoplasia, yet there remains uncertainty surrounding its mode of action. Aspirin
      has already been established to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Prospective
      studies as well as randomized clinical trials demonstrate that aspirin reduces the risk of
      precancerous polyps and colorectal cancer.
