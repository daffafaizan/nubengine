    
      This is a prospective, randomized-controlled, multicenter study in which patients in need of
      dental implants in the posterior maxilla and mandible will be treated with either the T3
      short implant (test device) or the T3 standard length implant (control device). Qualified
      patients will have one or more edentulous areas in the posterior region to be restored using
      a single crown. All implants will be placed using a single-stage surgical protocol. A
      provisional or definitive (final) prosthesis will be placed (cemented or screw-retained)
      within 8 weeks of implant placement. All prosthetic work must be completed no later than 6
      months following implant placement surgery.

      Each site will be selected to place implants (both test and control) in either the DCD or the
      non-DCD configuration (a total of 30 implants per site). Among all study sites, a total of
      120 implants (60 test, 60 control) will be enrolled in this study (any geographic region).
      The patient will be randomized to receive either the T3 short (test device) or the T3
      standard length, â‰¥10mm, (control device) implant. Only patients meeting the inclusion /
      exclusion criteria and providing informed consent form will be enrolled into study. The
      duration of the study will be approximately 4 years from initiation to completion of data
      analysis and reporting.
