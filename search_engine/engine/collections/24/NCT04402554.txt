      rheumatism, rheumatology has known for several decades a growth in its therapeutic arsenal
      (csDMARDs, bDMARDs, tDMARDs). rheumatism control has thus been optimized.

      however, patients very often keep pain, anxiety, residual fatigue, poorly controlled by our
      conventional therapies. patients then turn to non-drug therapies, among which the use of
      cannabis.

      endocannabinoids have an analgesic and anti-inflammatory action recognized in pre-clinical
      trials. however, investigators currently lack the data to authorize its use in clinical
      rheumatology.

      the aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis users in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondyloarthritis or psoriatic arthritis in our unit. as a
      second intention, investigators will refine the consumption characteristics. Investigators
      will also look for possible risk factors for consumption (sensitivity to pain, catastrophism,
      standard of living, anxiety, depression, rheumatic activity and quality of life).
