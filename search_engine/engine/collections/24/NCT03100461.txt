      cancer death in the U.S. Minorities and those with low income have more CRC than middle and
      high income Whites.. They also get fewer CRC screening tests. Low knowledge of CRC screening
      may, in part, drive this lower test use. We need new ways to improve CRC screening in primary
      care clinics where many minority and uninsured patients receive health care.
