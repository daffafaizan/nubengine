      The primary outcome will be the changes in NAA levels over one year. Secondary outcomes will
      be changes in brain atrophy over one year. As an exploratory outcome we will correlate
      changes in NAA levels with free Plasma levels of EGCG 8 hours after the morning dose.

      Exploratory outcomes include disability progression by EDSS, MS functional composite
      components and a cognitive test battery.
