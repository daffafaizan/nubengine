      based on the theory that the amount of local anesthetic in the free-base un-ionized form will
      decrease to provide greater lipid penetration of the nerve and this could be cause of the
      failure of local anesthesia injected into the inflamed tissue with low PH and conflicting
      results were obtained. But, there are no study that evaluate effect of increasing PH in
      periradicular tissue on hindrance of resistance channels with supplementary infiltration
      injection of Sodium Bicarbonate
