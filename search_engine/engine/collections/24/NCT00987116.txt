      patient fulfils the criteria for improvement or minimal manifestation state, in order to
      discontinue it before twelve months. The starting dose is 0.75 mg/kg/day.

      Classical strategy consists of decreasing the prednisone dose if at each monthly consultation
      the patient fulfils the criteria for minimal manifestation state, in order to discontinue it
      before twelve months. The starting dose is 1.5 mg/kg/2days.

      Duration of follow-up is 15 months.

      In both arms, Myasthenia Muscular Score (MMS), activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), MGFA
      Clinical Classification and MGFA Post-Intervention Status as well as prednisone and
      azathioprine side effects will be monthly assessed by a senior neurologist who will be blind
      for treatment group. A second physician, who is aware of the patient's therapeutic group,
      will then prescribe prednisone dose and tapering for a month, according to MGFA
      Post-Intervention Status.

      In case of worsening, prednisone dose will be increased. In case of exacerbation, the
      patients will be hospitalised for eventually IvIg infusion or plasma exchange. In case of a
      severe side effect, prednisone will be reduced irrespectively of MGFA Post-Intervention
      Status. In case of side effect, azathioprine will be replaced by mycophenolate mofetil.
