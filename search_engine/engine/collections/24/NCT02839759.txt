      and maintenance. HTM will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to quantify the
      benefits of TELLYHealth to patients and audiologists including: reductions in hearing
      handicap, improved knowledge of hearing aid handling, use and communications strategies; and
      improved audiologist aftercare. The investigators will recruit 80 subjects (half in each
      group) and each subject will participate in the study for 8-12 weeks.
