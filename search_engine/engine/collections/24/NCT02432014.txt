      engagement in indicated prevention/early intervention programming for youth conduct problems.
      We will explore factors previously shown to influence engagement, including parent
      motivational cognitions, family context variables, and preferences for intervention type.
      Study aims are organized around a randomized preference trial with a parallel hybrid design
      structure (see Abikoff, 2001). Families with youth ages 5-12, referred to community mental
      health clinics in Michigan, will be invited to participate in a prevention study. Families
      who chose to participate were assigned at random to preference (i.e. choice) or no preference
      (i.e. no choice) conditions. Those randomly assigned to the preference condition were allowed
      to choose between four intervention options: clinic-based services-as-usual (youth
      intervention); individual, home-based Oregon Parent Management Training (PMTO; Patterson,
      2005), individual, clinic-based PMTO, and in-person group-based PMTO (Parenting Through
      Change; Forgatch & DeGarmo, 1999). Families in the no-choice condition were randomly assigned
      to one of the same four conditions.
