      groups, including hyaluronic acid combined corticosteroid group and hyaluronic acid combined

      downstairs, and 5 repeated chair-rising time, timed up and go test), functional performance
      and knee-related quality of life (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis

      will be re-evaluated at one week after injection, one month after injection, three months
