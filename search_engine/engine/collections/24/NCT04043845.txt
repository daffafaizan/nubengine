      combination of drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      drug to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved LY3214996 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ibrutinib as a treatment option for
      this disease.

      LY3214996 is an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor that is being developed
      as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. ERK inhibitors stop the signal that a
      cancer cell receives telling it to grow. In this research study, the investigators are
      testing to see if LY3214996 is safe when combined with ibrutinib in patients with specific
      gene mutations. Making treatment decisions based on genetic testing is investigational, and
      the FDA has not approved this genetic testing. Several doses of LY3214996 will be explored in
      this study.
