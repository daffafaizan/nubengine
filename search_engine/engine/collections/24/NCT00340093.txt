      activities, problem-solving, and decision-making. Even in the most supportive environment,
      adherence to the daily regimen is difficult. Adherence is typically lowest among adolescents,
      who are taking increasing amounts of responsibility for their diabetes management while still
      maturing cognitively and socially. This pilot study will investigate the feasibility and
      effectiveness of a personal diabetes trainer in promoting adherence among early adolescents.
      A sample of 120 youth ages 11 to 16 will be randomized to informational control or a diabetes
      personal trainer intervention. Measures of adherence, adjustment, conflict, attitudes, and
      parental involvement will be obtained at baseline, two months, six months, and one year
      following. Measures of glycemic control will be abstracted from the medical records.
