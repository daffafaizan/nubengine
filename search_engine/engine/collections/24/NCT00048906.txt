    
      The objectives of this clinical trial are to study the effects of a range of renal function
      on the safety and pharmacokinetics of Replagal enzyme replacement therapy in patients with
      Fabry Disease. Patients with clinical and genetic or biochemical evidence of Fabry Disease
      will be selected for this clinical trial. Sixty (60) patients will be enrolled in this
      clinical trial. Enrollment will be stratified based on baseline renal function as per FDA
      guidelines. This is an open label clinical study. Baseline evaluations will be conducted over
      an approximately 3 day period. Patients will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of Replagal
      at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/dose every 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed with the
      first administered dose. The safety evaluations for patients in this study will include vital
      signs, physical examinations, adverse event (AE) assessments, electrocardiograms (ECG), and a
      battery of laboratory tests including measurement of anti-Replagal antibodies. An overview of
      the study appears in Appendix A.
