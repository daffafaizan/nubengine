    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of a two-year course of low-dose carvedilol on surrogate
      echocardiographic indices of CHF risk, including: left ventricular (LV) posterior wall
      thickness-dimension ratio (LV T-D); LV systolic and diastolic function, and afterload;
      natriuretic peptides, troponins, and galactin-3.

      II. To establish safety and tolerability of this two-year course of low-dose carvedilol,
      assessing both objective measures (hepatic function) and patients reported outcomes.

      III. To examine the modifying effect of demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics
      on the risk: benefit ratio from this two-year carvedilol intervention.

      IV. As an exploratory goal, to examine the relationship between carvedilol and clinical
      measures of efficacy such as prevention of CHF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the long-term efficacy of carvedilol in preventing cardiomyopathy and/or heart
      failure in high-risk childhood cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive low-dose carvedilol orally (PO) once (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 24
      months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD or BID for 24 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
