      the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of VAY736 in the treatment of PV patients.

      A total of 13 patients were enrolled and randomized into the study. Of these 13
      patients,seven were randomized to the 3 mg/kg VAY736 group, two were randomized to the 10
      mg/kg VAY736 group and four were randomized to the placebo group.In the placebo group, three
      out of the four patients consented to open-label VAY736 treatment and received 10 mg/kg
      VAY736 after Week 24 onwards. Thus, a total of 12 patients received VAY736, 7 patients
      received 3 mg/kg and 5 patients 10 mg/kg.

      The Screening period consisted of a Screening Visit performed within 28 days prior to
      randomization to assess patient eligibility. Following Screening, patients underwent pre-dose
      procedures which included assessment of their PV by Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI),
      Autoimmune Bullous Skin disease Intensity Score (ABSIS) and Investigator Global Assessment
      (IGA), and blood sampling for PK endpoints. Patients then received the study drug, which was
      administered over approximately a 2 hour period. The patients remained in the study center
      overnight post-infusion for observation and for measurement of safety parameters and PK
      samples approximately 24 h post-infusion (start of infusion: Â±2 h). Patients were then
      discharged from the study site and returned as per the schedule. Patients were evaluated at
      Week 1, Week 2 and Week 3, then every 3 weeks through to Week 12, and every 4 weeks through
      to Week 24. At Week 24, the blind was broken to confirm treatment allocation. If a patient
      was on placebo, such patient completing the Week 24 visit and after unblinding had the option
      of receiving open label VAY736 10mg/kg.

      Recruitment was paused in Mar-2015 and at the time 13 patients were enrolled. The study
      recruitment was then terminated in Dec-2015 for strategic reasons related to the development
      of the compound.
