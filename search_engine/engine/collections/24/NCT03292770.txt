      the uterus via a catheter advanced through the cervical canal. Yet this is the final, and in
      some respects the most critical, process in the sequential events that encompass an ART
      cycle. If an embryo cannot be delivered to the uterine cavity atraumatically and in a
      location for optimal implantation, the steps of ovarian hyperstimulation, oocyte retrieval,
      embryo culture, and embryo selection will have no benefit. Contamination of the catheter with
      blood may be a marker for difficult ET and has also been linked to poor ET outcomes. When
      retrospectively assessing outcomes, Goudas et al. (1) demonstrated a clinical pregnancy rate
      of 50% with no blood, and this rate fell by half when a small amount of blood was noted on
      the catheter tip. Pregnancy rates fell even further, to 10%, when there was a significant
      amount of blood (1). Similarly, in a preliminary study, blood or mucus on the tip was
      associated with a significantly lower pregnancy outcome (2). Blood and mucus were associated
      with an increased risk for unsuccessful transfers with odds ratios of 1.9 and 1.8,
      respectively. Although all these data suggest a possible role of cervical mucus in embryo
      transfer, there is no clinical evidence on the effect of removal of cervical mucus on the
      outcome of IVF/ICSI. In view of this uncertainty, a study to prospectively evaluate the role
      of cervical mucus removal prior to embryo transfer on pregnancy rates in ART will be
      undertaken. It is hypothesized that removal of cervical mucus will achieve higher clinical
      pregnancy rates.
