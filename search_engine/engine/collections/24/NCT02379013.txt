      electrodes attached to the muscle of the left arm (flexor) to measure muscle activity. That
      will be performed with a handgrip (the subject press on the handgrip).The subject will
      receive two sessions. It will conduct a trial session in the laboratory to control his
      ability to imagine the task (imagination run) and perform the driving task correctly.

      Two saliva samples will be placed in tubes to be analysed to measure the concentration of
      cortisol before and after functional MRI. Then, psychological and satisfaction questionnaires
      will be completed by volunteers.

      This protocol will then be adapted and transferred to multiple sclerosis population (in a
      second study), for which fatigue is one of the symptoms most commonly reported.
