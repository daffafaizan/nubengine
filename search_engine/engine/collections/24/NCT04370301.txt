      CONDITIONING: Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day -5,
      fludarabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days -5 to -2, and undergo total-body irradiation (TBI)
      on day -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients receive peripheral blood stem cell infusion on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on days 3-4,
      tacrolimus IV beginning day 5 then orally (PO) for 6 months, mycophenolate mofetil PO twice
      daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) beginning day 5 for 6 weeks, and granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning day 7 until neutrophil
      recovery is > 1,500/mm^3.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up between day 80-100, at 1 year,
      and then up to 5 years.
