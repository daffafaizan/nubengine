    
      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of concentration controlled combination of once
      daily dosed low-dose sirolimus (trough levels: 3-5 ng/ml) and extended-release tacrolimus
      (trough levels:3-5 ng/ml), in order to provide superior renal function while maintaining
      comparable rates of patient and graft survival, compared to concentration controlled once -
      daily extended release tacrolimus (trough levels: 5-10 ng/ml) at 12, 24 and 36 months
      post-transplant. Moreover, to compare the incidence of de novo malignancy, the quality of
      life, fatigue and side effects between both treatment arms.

      2.1 Primary objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of concentration controlled
      combination of low-dose sirolimus (trough levels: 3-5 ng/ml) and extended-release tacrolimus
      (trough levels: 3-5 ng/ml), in order to provide superior renal function while maintaining
      comparable rates of patient and graft survival, compared to concentration controlled once -
      daily extended release tacrolimus (trough levels:-10 ng/ml) control at 12, 24 and 36 months
      post-transplant.

      2.2. Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the incidence of de novo and recurrence of cancer between study arm and
           control arm at 36 months.

        -  To compare the incidence and severity of biopsy proven acute rejection between study arm
           and control arm at 12, 24 and 36 months.

        -  To evaluate renal function at 12, 24 and 36 months (calculated GFR).

        -  To evaluate the development of new onset diabetes mellitus at 12, 24 and 36 months post
           transplant

        -  To evaluate the prevalence of CNI side effects at 12, 24 and 36 months

        -  To evaluate quality of life (Eq5D) and fatigue severity score at 12, 24 and 36 months

        -  To evaluate the percentage of patients on combination tacrolimus and sirolimus and
           converted back to tacrolimus mono-therapy.
