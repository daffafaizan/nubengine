        -  Compare relapse-free and overall survival of patients with previously untreated advanced
           Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with bleomycin, doxorubicin, etoposide, mechlorethamine,
           vinblastine, vincristine, and prednisone (Stanford V) vs doxorubicin, bleomycin,
           vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD).

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I (Stanford V): Patients receive mechlorethamine on weeks 1, 5, and 9; vinblastine
           and doxorubicin on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; etoposide IV over 30-45 minutes for 2
           consecutive days on weeks 3, 7, and 11; and vincristine and bleomycin on weeks 2, 4, 6,
           8, 10, and 12. Patients also receive oral prednisone every other day on days 1-63
           followed by a taper on days 64-84. Treatment continues for 12 weeks.

        -  Arm II (ABVD): Patients receive doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine on
           days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6-8 courses.

      All patients achieving a complete remission or partial remission after chemotherapy undergo
      involved field radiotherapy if they had initial bulky mediastinal disease, initial nodal
      masses at least 5 cm in diameter, or initial splenic disease.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
