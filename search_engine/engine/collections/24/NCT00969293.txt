      the second most common vision-impairing vascular disorder of the retina following diabetic
      retinopathy. Severe visual loss from CRVO is caused by a combination of retinal edema and
      neovascular proliferation and ischemia. Vascular endothelial factors as they stimulate
      angiogenesis and increase vascular permeability, are majors pathogenic factors in CRVO.
      Counteracting these neovascular effects provide significant therapeutic benefit to subjects
      suffering from this disorder. Macular edema in this condition results from a conjunction of
      several, as yet, partially unknown factors.

      Macular edema may occur in diseases causing cumulative injury over many years, such as
      diabetic retinopathy, or as a result of more acute events, such as branch retinal vein
      occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).
