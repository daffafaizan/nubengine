      and arousal at 12 weeks in peri or postmenopausal women aged between 40 and 60 years old with
      low sexual desire and arousal compared with active control.

      Despite current consensus in the literature that Female Sexual Dysfunction can manifest at
      any age in a woman´s life, researchers as Sarrel documented that during menopause, up to 40%
      of women are experiencing a decrease in their sexual libido. The common assumption is that
      the menopause contributes to a drop of the sexual desire probably as a result of low
      production of hormones from ovaries, at the same time will reduce the estrogen and
      testosterone. This reduction starts to be reduced in the thirties and continues to reduce
      progressively at a constant rate reaching of about 50% of their initial highest levels by the
      time they reach menopause. Other hormones could be involved as Sex hormone-binding globulin
      (SHBG) or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), both are related with testosterone levels.

      Libicare® is a dietary supplement whose ingredients could have positive effects on the
      improvement of sexual function in women with low desire and arousal levels.
