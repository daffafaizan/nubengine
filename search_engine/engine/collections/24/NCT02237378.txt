      Hg at rest and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of â‰¥15.The coexistence of mitral
      insufficiency is also a characteristic of PH-LHD. HFpEF is a condition caused by impaired
      relaxation of a stiffened myocardium as a consequence of an increased load to the left
      ventricle due to elevated systemic pressures.

      Pulmonary hemodynamics can be used to classify PH LHD as either passive or reactive,
      irrespective of LV function. It has been suggested that diastolic pressure gradient (DPG) may
      offer added prognostic value as a more accurate indicator of pulmonary vascular remodeling.
