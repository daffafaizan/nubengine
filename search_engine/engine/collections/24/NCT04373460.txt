    
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, controlled, phase 2 trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of treatment with HCIP in reducing hospitalization and death prior to
      hospitalization among outpatient adults who have RNA detection test-confirmed COVID-19 AND
      have developed any symptoms of COVID-19 including but not limited to fever, cough, or other
      COVID associated symptoms like anosmia. Ambulatory/outpatient adults subjects 18 years of age
      or older, regardless of risk factors for severe illness may participate. A total of
      approximately 1344 eligible subjects stratified 50:50 in the <65 vs â‰¥ 65 age range will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either HCIP or control plasma.
