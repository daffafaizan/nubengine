      curative therapy. Only 20% of patients may achieve long-term survival mostly due to relapse
      or nor-relapse mortality (NRM). In previous study, we demonstrated that intensive leukemia
      debulking chemotherapy FLAG-IDA sequential with Flu-BU conditioning is feasible with ~40%
      long-term survival. The most important cause of treatment failures were relapse and
      non-relpase mortality. The further analysis demonstrated that patients with higher bone
      marrow blast before allo-HSCT was associated with treatment failure and patients with poor
      perforce status or age over 45 had increased rate of NRM. To further optimization the
      protocol, we modified the chemotherapy with cladribine replacing fludarabine aiming a more
      potent anti-leukemia effect and replace idarubicin with VP-16. All patients will also receive
      post-transplantation maintenance therapy with low-dose decitabine (5mg/m2 daily for 5 days)
      to prevent the further reduce the relapse incidence. We anticipate LFS at 1 year should be
      above 50% and 1-year LFS of 20% is considered unacceptable.
