    
      Primary objective :

      evaluate the correlation between mRs score and the baseline characteristics Functional
      outcomes will be evaluated using the modified Rankin score (mRS) score, which is one of the
      most frequently used scores in acute neurological diseases [18]. A poor outcome will be
      defined by a mRS score > 2 (functional dependence or death). The investigator usually
      evaluates this score if the patient is still in the hospital 90 days after admission.
      Patients discharged from hospital within 90 days following ICU admission without major
      disability (mRS 0, 1 or 2) are considered to have a good outcome. Patients discharged within
      90 days with a disability will be classified for the study according to the latest available
      data. Patients will not be contacted directly by the investigator for the study purposes.

      Secondary objectives :

      To identify additional prognosis factors : the clinical, radiological, biological and
      neurophysiological factors associated with poor outcome for patients admitted to the ICU with
      AE

        -  Day 28 mortality, in-ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality

        -  Major systemic complications (septic shock, hyponatremia, nosocomial pneumonia,
           catheter-related BSI, overt gastroenteral bleeding, pulmonary embolism)

        -  Major intracranial complications during ICU stay

             -  Status epilepticus

             -  Brain death

             -  Empyema/cerebral abscess

             -  Cerebral ischemia

             -  Intracranial bleeding

        -  ICP monitoring

        -  Neurosurgery

      The cause of death will be categorized into 2 categories:

        -  Systemic causes (cardiovascular failure, MOF)

        -  Neurological cause (Diffuse neurologic injury or withdrawal of care)
