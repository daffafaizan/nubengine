    
      This is a Phase I/II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an HPV therapeutic vaccine
      called PepCan (HPV-16 E6 peptides) in adults over a two (2) year period. Each subject will be
      receiving a total of 7 injections of PepCan (50 Âµg per peptide dose) or placebo (saline) at a
      3:1 ratio in a randomized double-blinded design. Subjects will receive one injection every 3
      weeks until they receive 4 injections. Then, subjects will receive one injection every 3
      months until they receive a total of 7 injections. Subjects will have 2 more visits
      approximately 6 months apart after the last injection. Immunological assessment by
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay will be made at 4 time points (Visits 1, 5, 8, and
      9), and by fluorescent activated cell sorter analysis will be made at times points at Visits
      1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Oral wash samples and stool samples will be collected at the
      Screening Visit, Visit 5, Visit 7 and Visit 8 for microbiome diversity analysis.
