      will be a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design, with the between-subject factor of order and a
      within-subject factor of eating condition (meal or grazing). Depending upon the eating
      condition, participants will be provided with a morning meal and an afternoon meal (meal) or
      two small meals and three snacks to be consumed every 2-3 hours (grazing). The types of foods
      and amount of foods provided to participants will be identical in each condition; the only
      difference in the conditions is the time spacing during the day when the foods are consumed.
      The primary dependent variable will be amount, both grams and energy, of food consumed during
      an ad libitum meal consumed in the evening at the completion of the meal condition, overall
      daily energy intake, and ratio of daily energy intake to energy expenditure. It is
      hypothesized that the grazing condition will produce lower consumption during an evening ad
      libitum meal, lower daily energy intake, and a lower ratio of energy intake to energy
      expenditure than the meal condition.
