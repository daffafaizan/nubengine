    
      Patients:

      Patients with medication-refractory ET and PD were included. Baseline materials, clinical
      rating scale for tremor (CRST) ,Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), treatment
      parameters(energy, power, duration time, temperature, target location) , associated adverse
      effects were recorded.

      Imaging protocols:

      T2; T2 Flair; DWI; ESWAN; MRS; 3D ASL 2.0s; 3D-T1; DTI; rs-functional MRI

      Imaging evaluation:

        1. Lesion appearance and volume are measured by T2, T2 Flair, DWI, ESWAN, 3D-T1;

        2. ESWAN and MRS manifests the changes of iron deposition and metabolismï¼Œrespectively;

        3. ASL shows regional cerebral blood flow associated with the procedure;

        4. DTI demonstrates the destruction of white matter integrity.

        5. Rs-functional MRI reflects alterations of resting-state brain activity.

      Treatment:

      MRgFUS thalamotomy

      Follow-up:

      Baseline (MRI+clinical evaluation); 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months,1-year,
      2-years,3-years,4-years, 5-years (MRI+clinical evaluation)
