      non-diabetes patients who underwent the epidural steroid injection. However, there has been
      no reports of the effect of various kinds of steroid or various dose of steroid which are
      commonly used in the clinical setting. Previous studies have simply shown that the blood
      glucose level is elevated in diabetes patients and did not show or suggest the adequate
      strategy of epidural steroid injection in diabetes patients regarding steroid type, dosage or
      injection interval. Therefore, the investigators tried to evaluate the effect of different
      dosage of triamcinolone, which is a commonly used steroid in epidural steroid injection, on
      the blood glucose level.
