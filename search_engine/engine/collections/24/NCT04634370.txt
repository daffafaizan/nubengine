      infected individuals can develop effective immunity, the population at risk (elderly, obese
      and individual with comorbidities) develop a rapid and frequently fatal disease, with severe
      acute respiratory syndrome, cytokine storm and coagulopathies; for those who recover, severe
      pulmonary sequels are frequently observed. We propose a phase I clinical trial to test safety
      and feasibility of NK cells adoptive immunotherapy for COVID-19. Natural Killer cells are
      innate granular lymphocytes able to rapidly recognize and kill, without previous exposition,
      altered cells; it is widely recognized as immune effectors specialized in lysing virus
      infected cells releasing antigens and activating cytokines to antigen presenting cells and,
      by doing so, stimulating effective adaptive immunity. We hypothesize that the early infusion
      of highly activated NK cells will activate adaptive immune effectors preventing the severe
      clinical evolution of COVID-19 infection. Adoptive NK cell immunotherapy for severe virus
      infections is innovative. Our proposition is in line with the Brazilian Public Health system
      purposes, which is to offer secure and effective therapies for all COVID-19 infected
      individuals. Upon proving NK cell immunotherapy effectiveness for serious virus infections,
      we can evolve to test this strategy for common viruses that cause epidemics and endemics such
      as the ones caused by Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, C and B hepatitis and HIV.
