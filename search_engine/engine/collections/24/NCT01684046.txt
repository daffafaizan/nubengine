      PureMoist MPDS or RevitaLens MPDS in Period 1 for use with their habitual contact lenses,
      after which they switched to the alternate solution in Period 2. Each period was 30 days in
      length. A 2-day washout period during which participants refrained from using a multi-purpose
      contact lens solution preceded Period 1 and Period 2.
