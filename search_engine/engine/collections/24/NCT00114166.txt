      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of topotecan, in terms of frequency and duration of
           tumor response, in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial,
           fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the effects of prognostic variables (i.e., initial performance status, age,
           and mucinous or clear cell histology) in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 38-110 patients (19-55 per treatment arm) will be accrued
      for this study within 15-30 months.
