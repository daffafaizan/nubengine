      methods to (1) gain understanding of availability and cost of the local foods and the regular
      diet, (2) evaluate the level of food security among people living with HIV, including
      intra-household food distribution patterns, and assess the nutritional status of HIV affected
      individuals, and (3) examine the role that food security and nutrition play in HIV treatment
      access, utilization and adherence. Phase 2 consists of developing and pilot-testing a
      multi-component nutrition intervention through a randomized, controlled trial conducted at 4
      HIV clinics in Honduras, with two clinics randomly assigned to receive the intervention and
      two clinics to serve as the comparison group. Patients at each of the 4 sites will receive
      nutrition counseling, following the guidelines currently proposed by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) as the standard of care for HIV-infected individuals. In addition, clients
      at the intervention sites will receive food assistance in the form of a food-aid basket,
      designed ad hoc to address their macro and micronutrient needs.
