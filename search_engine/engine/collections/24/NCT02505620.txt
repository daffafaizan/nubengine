      obstruction while sleeping. The "Apnea-hypopnea index" (AHI) defined as events per hour,
      gives information about the severity of the disease. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine
      Task Force" defined that more than 5 episodes per hour is strongly suspect for an OSAS
      disease. Upper airway obstruction while sleeping leads to a dramatic decrease in oxygen
      saturation and to hypoxemia finally, in which consequence the patient rapidly awake. The
      prevalence rise with age and about 20% of the population is suspect to a sleep disorder.
      However about 1-5% of male and about 0,5-2% of female aged adults are affected. Main reason
      is obesity. Clinical signs are sleepiness and functional cognitive deficits. The Gold
      standard therapy is "continuous positive airway pressure" ventilation during sleep. However,
      the success depends strongly to the patientÂ´s compliance. Surgical treatment is an
      alternative option, which could be considered if clinical success failed. It is notable that
      the long-term mortality is comparable in both medical treatment options. However, a
      comparison of the cognitive function of both therapies is not yet analyzed. The study
      addresses the question which of this treatment options is favorable regarding cognitive
      function and outcome.
