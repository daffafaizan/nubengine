      satisfactory with recurrence in most cases.

      Tranexamic acid is is a relatively new drug for melasma . It is currently used via a spectrum
      of delivery routes including oral, topical, intradermal, and microneedling .

      Laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD) is a technique that facilitates the delivery of topical
      medications .

      On reviewing the previous literatures, few studies have focused on therapeutic effects of
      combined laser and TXA (topical and intradermal) in melasma, with variations in parameters of
      laser, in dose, concentration, form and routes of TXA application; and in follow up duration.
      These studies revealed variable unproven results, and since melasma is a challenging disease,
      additional studies are needed to determine the optimal laser parameters and the best
      absorbable topical TXA formula, ensuring the best efficacy and less complications.

      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will use topical TXA gel as an
      additive effect between sessions, and to confirm the effect of laser and TXA by
      histopathology and immunohistochemistry.
