      I. Perform molecular analysis of plasma samples from 25 patients with metastatic prostate
      cancer collected before and during treatment of the disease with abiraterone acetate (Zytiga)
      or enzalutamide (Xtandi).

      II. Perform molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and plasma collected
      from 75 patients with progressing advanced metastatic prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on the timing of specimen collection.

      GROUP I: Previously collected plasma samples are analyzed for ctDNA via polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing (NSG).

      GROUP II: Patients undergo collection of blood samples before and following systemic therapy
      for analysis of CTC enumeration, ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression, and ctDNA via PCR and
      NSG.
