      aging as one of the important risk factors in several epidemiological studies. Premature
      biological aging is distinct from chronological aging and may predispose the individual to
      myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis and CHD in particular. The mean telomere length and
      telomerase activity serve as markers for the biological age at the cellular level, with
      shorter telomeres and lower telomerase activity defining the increased biological age.
      Telomere length and telomerase activity, therefore, correlates with the risk of CHD and
      atherosclerosis. Statins serve as the drugs of obvious choice based on their well established
      efficacy and safety profiles for the treatment of CHD and associated atherosclerosis. A
      present clinical study states that the treatment with a statin is associated with a reduction
      in the number of clinical events but only in individuals with increased risk based on their
      telomere length. This suggests a positive relationship of telomere and telomerase system with
      the risk of CHD and, therefore, would help clinicians to categorise the patient populations
      based on their leucocyte telomere length for treatment with statins.
