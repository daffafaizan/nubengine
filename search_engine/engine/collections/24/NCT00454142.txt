      I. Determine the efficacy of pazopanib hydrochloride in patients with stage IV or recurrent
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      II. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug. III.
      Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of this drug
      on angiogenesis inhibition using dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan.

      V. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. VI. Correlate the
      effect of this drug on angiogenesis inhibition with the clinical benefit rate and
      pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 12
      months.
