      ibuprofen and TENS. The comparison group will receive ibuprofen and sham TENS. The study
      primary endpoint is change in pain level on Visual Analog Scale score at 45-60 minutes after
      TENS start.

      This is a two-arm, double blind, randomized control trial evaluating the patient perceived
      improvement in back pain. Patients will first fill out a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

      Patients will be randomized to one of two arms. Ibuprofen 800 mg, plus sham TENS for 45
      minutes Ibuprofen 800 mg, plus TENS for 45 minutes

      Patients will be given a 2nd VAS scale up to 15 minutes after the end of the TENS session.
      After the second VAS the patients will be finished with the study procedures and can be
      continued to be cared as per the discretion of their treating physician.

      Our intention is to detect a 20% reduction in pain by VAS with a common standard deviation
      equal to the difference at the p = 0.05 level with a power of 80% using an analysis of
      variance (ANOVA). The calculated sample size required 28 patients per group. Considering the
      uncertain dropout rate, the investigators decided to enroll at least 66 patients. Baseline
      characteristics will be calculated to determine if groups are equal. A two-way
      repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to test both a trial effect and a group effect (SPSS 20,
      SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data will be presented as means with standard deviations with 95%
      confidence intervals. A p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
