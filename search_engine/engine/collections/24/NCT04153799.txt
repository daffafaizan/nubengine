      recorded in detail according to the dosage of slope climbing and single infusion. The safety
      of chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells treatment was evaluated by observing the adverse
      events after cell therapy. The effectiveness of CAR-T treatment was initially assessed
      compared with the results of the patient's own previous standard treatment plan. Blood was
      collected before and within 12 months after infusion to detect the number and activity of
      CAR-T cells and evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CAR-T cells.
