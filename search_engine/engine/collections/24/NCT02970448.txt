    
      Primary Objective To determine the safety and feasibility of reducing the time interval
      between LITT and the start of chemoradiation to â‰¤ 7 days.

      The primary endpoint (binary) for safety/feasibility will be defined as the occurrence of one
      or more of the following within each patient during a window of observation from the
      completion LITT to the end of radiation:

        -  Wound dehiscence, grade 3 {CTCAE v4.0)

        -  Seizures, grade 3 (CTCAE v4.0) in patients without a prior history of seizures and on
           adequate anti-seizure medications

        -  Cerebral edema, grade 4 (CTCAE v4.0)

        -  Failure to complete of 60 Grays (Gy) of radiation

      Secondary Objective(s) To estimate the proportion of patients requiring adjustments in
      radiation plans post-LITT.

      Secondary Endpoint: Requirement of an adjustment in the radiation plan to account for
      post-LITT tissue distortion.

      Study design This study will be a 2-stage, single-institution safety and feasibility trial.
      Patients will be evaluated by a neuro-oncology team consisting of a neurosurgeon trained in
      LITT, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist prior to surgery. Evaluable patients will
      have a histologic diagnosis of high-grade glioma, complete LITT, and are candidates for
      standard concurrent radiation (60 Gy) and temozolomide as determined by the treating
      physician. Concurrent chemoradiation will begin within 7 days of the LITT procedure.
