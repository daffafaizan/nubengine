      people with serious mental illness (SMI) through its effects on other cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk factors and CVD. Behavioral interventions targeting changes in diet and exercise
      need to be tailored to the needs of people with SMI, such as memory impairment and limited
      executive function. The NIMH-funded Achieving Healthy Lifestyles in Psychiatric
      Rehabilitation (ACHIEVE) trial tested a behavioral weight-loss intervention for persons with
      SMI and demonstrated clinically significant weight loss. In light of the obesity epidemic in
      persons with SMI, there is an urgent need to scale-up interventions like ACHIEVE. To increase
      ease of adoption and sustained implementation of ACHIEVE in community mental health programs,
      the format needs to be adapted for delivery by community mental health staff. Based on the
      investigators' experience conducting the ACHIEVE trial, this study team had modified the
      ACHIEVE intervention into a new ACHIEVE curriculum appropriate for community mental health
      settings. Therefore, the investigators will pilot test 8 weeks of this curriculum in a
      community-based psychiatric rehabilitation program (PRP) to determine whether this format is
      acceptable to participating PRP consumers with SMI as well as PRP staff and peer leaders.
