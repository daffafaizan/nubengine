      criteria. After informed consent is given, potential subjects will be screened to ensure they
      meet eligibility criteria. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will complete baseline
      assessments and will then be randomized to receive 2 weeks of treatment (Treatment Period 1)
      with either suvorexant or matching placebo (1:1). The initial dose of suvorexant will be 10
      mg at bedtime, with optional titration to 20 mg after 5-7 days. Study drug will be dispensed
      by an independent research pharmacist, keeping both study staff and the subject blinded. All
      subjects, whether in placebo or active arm, will receive a wearable sleep monitor to be worn
      for 7 days at baseline, and during both treatment periods. All subjects will keep 7-day sleep
      diaries at baseline and during each study period. At the end of Treatment Period 1 (2 weeks),
      subjects will undergo efficacy assessments with repeated clinical scales. Subjects will then
      go through a 1-week open-label off-drug washout period. Subjects will then be crossed over
      into the alternate treatment group, which will once again be double-blinded; those on active
      treatment (suvorexant) in Treatment Period 1 will be switched to placebo, and those on
      placebo in Treatment Period 1 will be switched to active treatment. Treatment Period 2 will
      also be 2 weeks long, and at the end of this, subjects will undergo final assessment with
      clinical scales.
