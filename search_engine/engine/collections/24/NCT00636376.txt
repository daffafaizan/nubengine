      Management of children at risk for intracranial hypertension is both complex and increasingly
      controversial. Also, effect of head position on intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion
      pressure, adn cerebral venous outflow in the pediatric population has not been studied. We
      will examine the effect of head positioning on ICP, CPP, and cerebral venous outflow in
      pediatric patients at risk for intracranial hypertension. The hypothesis is that ICP will be
      reduced with improvement in cerebral venous outflow by each patient having their own optimal
      head position.
