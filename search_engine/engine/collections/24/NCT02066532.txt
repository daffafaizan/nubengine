      death in women. Approximately 1,150,000 cases and 410,000 deaths from breast cancer occur
      annually worldwide, and, in the U.S., there are an estimated 184,450 new cases and 40,480
      deaths from breast cancer every year. The vast majority of patients who die from breast
      cancer succumb to metastatic disease. The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 gene
      (HER2) is amplified in 20% to 30% of breast cancers.

      HER2+ breast cancers are associated with earlier recurrence and shorter overall survival and
      are associated with other adverse prognostic markers, such as high tumor grade, high rates of
      cell proliferation, increased nodal metastases, and relative resistance to certain types of
      chemotherapy. The HER family of receptors is a group of related transmembrane receptor
      tyrosine kinases that regulate normal cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and
      migration.
