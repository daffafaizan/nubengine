      fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is an important
      event of disease progression worsening in airway function and respiratory symptoms, bringing
      about respiratory failure, and increasing the rates of mortality. Despite valuable efforts,
      there is still no Individualized accurate diagnostic and prognostic tool for COPD. In this
      context, the investigators are to perform comprehensive transcriptomic, proteomic,
      metabonomic and exosome characterization of COPD patients and healthy controls. Biological
      samples of COPD participants, including blood, urine, stool, saliva, bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid and clinical characteristics are going to be collected from the remaining materials of
      the routine clinical examination. And samples of healthy controls will be collected from the
      rest of the healthy examination practice. By integrating the multi-dimensional data, the
      investigators aim to elucidate the impact of molecular alterations driving phenotypic
      variation and to delineate the mechanisms of AECOPD for prospective exploration of
      personalized, precision-based clinical care.
