      Sequencing and analysis of the DNA and/or RNA of the gut microbiome (metagenomics) allow the
      identification of the species present and assess the metabolic activities they carry out.
      Stools are largely microbial and the metagenomics of stool can provide insights into the
      functioning of the gut microbiome.

      Nutrient processing by the gut microbiome is fundamental to energy extraction and immune
      response. Until recently, investigation of nutritional approaches to treating Inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) has been largely limited to the use of enteral and total parenteral
      nutrition with the aim of providing bowel rest.

      The IBD Anti-inflammatory diet (IBD-AID) was developed to establish a dietary therapy to
      address nutritional adequacy and malabsorption issues, promote symptom relief, and assist
      with remission. The IBD-AID has been designed to favor colonic bacteria that degrade dietary
      fibers and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs regulate the production of
      cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10), eicosanoids, and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1 and
      CINC-2) by acting on macrophages and endothelial cells. High levels of SCFAs then promote a
      hyporesponsive immunological environment to commensal bacteria through the down-regulation of
      those pro-inflammatory effectors, aiding homeostasis maintenance.

      This diet utilizes foods that are available in most grocery stores and is intended to be a
      complete diet that provide balanced nutrition. As many of the available medical treatments
      for inflammatory bowel disease have risks, this diet may be a safer alternative to medical
      treatment in this population. The nutrition recommendations are safe. Diet modification poses
      minimal risk.
