    
      Primary endpoints:

        -  To assess the feasibility of recruitment

        -  Compare complication rates between the two study arms: CRS with HIPEC and CRS alone.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  To determine risk factors for morbidity and mortality

        -  Assess completion rate of 6 cycles of systemic chemotherapy

        -  To determine progression free survival at 24 months

        -  To determine overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years

        -  Evaluate health related quality of life

      Patients who meet study criteria will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: 1)
      cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with carboplatin-based hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      (HIPEC) followed by IV combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel or 2)
      cytoreductive surgery (CRS) alone followed by adjuvant intraperitoneal (IP) and IV
      chemotherapy with combination cisplatin and paclitaxel for newly diagnosed advanced stage
      (stage III/IV) ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Both study arms will
      receive 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Twenty-four patients will undergo CRS with HIPEC performed by surgical and gynecologic
      oncologic surgeons at Mercy Medical Center, followed by systemic IV chemotherapy with
      carboplatin (AUC=6) and paclitaxel (175mg/m2) for 6 cycles postoperatively.

      Twenty-four patients will undergo CRS only performed by surgical and gynecologic oncologic
      surgeons at Mercy Medical Center, followed by IV/IP chemotherapy with Day 1: IV paclitaxel
      (135 mg/m2), Day 2: IP cisplatin (75 mg/m2), and Day 8: IP paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) for 6 cycles
      postoperatively.
