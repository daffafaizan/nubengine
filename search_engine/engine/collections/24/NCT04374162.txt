      surgery and planned to be extubated in the operating room are randomly assigned to two
      groups: (1) PEEP = 5cmH2O; (2) driving pressure (DP)-guided PEEP. The ventilation protocol
      consists of volume-controlled mechanical ventilation (Datex Ohmeda S/5 Advance; General
      Electric Company Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) at a tidal volume (VT) of 8 ml/kg predicted
      body weight (PBW), fresh gas of 2 litre /min, inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:2, and a
      respiratory rate adjusted to normocapnia (arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure between 35
      and 45 mmHg). For group 2, trial for the lowest DP was started 10 min after pneumoperitoneum
      and position adjustment by increasing PEEP from 5 to 15 cm H2O incrementally. DP was
      calculated as "plateau pressure - PEEP". Each PEEP level was maintained for 10 respiratory
      cycles, with DP in the last cycle recorded. Then the PEEP level producing the lowest DP was
      identified and maintained intraoperatively. A plateau pressure of no more than 30 cmH2O is
      targeted in each group.

      Early postoperative distribution of regional ventilation as COV (center of ventilation) is
      the primary endpoint evaluated by EIT (electrical impedance tomography), which was performed
      by a trained technician who is blinded to randomization. Arterial blood gas is tested, with
      inflammatory and oxidative mediators from venous sample. Postoperative pulmonary
      complications within 3 days are also recorded.
