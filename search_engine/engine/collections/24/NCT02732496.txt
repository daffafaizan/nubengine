      functional impairments in youth with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders,
      strategies that target EFs are critical. Neuroplasticity-based cognitive training has been
      found to improve cognition in youth with ADHD and in adults with schizophrenia. In this
      trial, the investigators seek to extend the relevance of computerized cognitive training to
      youth with comorbid ADHD and Tourette Syndrome. Given the literature, the investigators
      hypothesize that computerized working memory training will produce gains in untrained
      cognitive tasks and behavioral ratings of executive functions in youth with ADHD+TS. The
      investigators will assess aspects of attention and executive functions in 30 affected youth
      and randomize them 1:1 to either neuroplasticity-based cognitive training or enjoyable
      age-appropriate computer games not intended to improve cognition. Cognition will be assessed
      again after 30 training sessions over 6 weeks and then again at a one-month follow-up.
