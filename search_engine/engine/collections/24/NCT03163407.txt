      under spinal anesthesia. All patients were ASA status I/II and patients with arrhythmia were
      excluded. Spinal anesthesia was performed in sitting position at L3-4 or L4-5. A 25 G spinal
      needle was used for intrathecal injection of 8 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine, 2.5 mcg
      sufentanil and 100 mcg morphine. All patients received 15 ml/kg of crystalloids intravenously
      during the spinal block. Patients were positioned in left lateral tilt position. Baseline
      hemodynamics; HR, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DPB) were recorded before
      spinal anesthesia and intraoperatively (every 2 min). Post anesthesia hypotension was defined
      as decrease of SBP>20% from the baseline value. If hypotension occurred, patients were
      randomized into 2 groups:

        -  GE group in which hypotension were managed using ephedrine increments of 6 mg Ephedrine
           every 3 min until correction of SBP

        -  GN group: patients of this group received 5mcg of Norepinephrine/3 min demographic and
           hemodynamic data of the two groups were compared.
