    
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a multifactorial inflammatory disorder that causes various
      symptoms including nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, olfactory dysfunction, facial pain, and
      headache . Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is usually recommended for patients who do not
      response well to conservative treatments. Although surgery is effective to alleviate symptoms
      and improve the quality of life of CRS patients, a followed long-term postoperative medical
      treatment is indispensable. Current European and American guidelines recommend
      glucocorticoids and antibiotics as the primary pharmacotherapeutic approaches for CRS before
      and after ESS. However, there are a number of CRS patients not responding well to
      glucocorticoid treatment and conflicting results exist regarding the efficacy of long-term,
      low-dose macrolide treatment. One potential reason is that CRS is a heterogeneous group of
      disorders unified by similar clinical presentations and its phenotypes and/or endotypes may
      be important factors determining the efficacy of treatments.
