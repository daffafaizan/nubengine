      polysomnography (PSG). A barrier of acceptance of Home Sleep Apnea Testing (HSAT) devices as
      a diagnostic test is their inability to accurately measure total sleep time (TST). A novel
      algorithm developed by ResMed, Ltd. allows the AL device to accurately calculate TST,
      however, this algorithm has not yet been validated.

      The ApneaLink Air (AL) device is a type III HSAT device. The device is capable of recording
      up to four channels of data including: flow and snore via a nasal cannula attached to a
      pressure transducer, a respiratory effort belt, a pulse oximeter to measure pulse and oxygen
      saturation, and an actigraphy monitor to measure TST along with flow. The AL device has been
      validated against PSG for AHI, and Cheyne-Stoke respiration detection . Further validation of
      the effort belt is necessary to determine the accuracy of the AL ability to differentiate
      between obstructive and central apneic events.
