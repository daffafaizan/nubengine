      Rehabilitation for the treatment of mood and behavior changes following traumatic brain
      injury. Clinical observation suggests that the use of amantadine improves caregiver report of
      "irritability" though there are no studies to validate this observation. This study
      investigates the efficacy and side effect profile of amantadine hydrochloride given in 2
      doses of 100 mgs each. Subjects are screened during regularly scheduled clinic appointments
      for the presence of irritability. If they are interested in possible participation in the
      study, they will be invited to meet with the research coordinator who will obtain informed
      consent. If the subject meets all the inclusion/exclusion requirements, they will leave
      clinic with study medication and begin taking the drug the next day. There will be a safety
      call between day 3 and 5 where the dose may be reduced to once per day. Follow-up assessment
      occurs at day 14 (by phone) and day 28 (in clinic). At study completion, the subject will
      have the opportunity to receive a prescription for amantadine as part of ongoing clinical
      care.
