        -  Compare the 1-year survival rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine with or without capecitabine.

        -  Compare the median and 2-year survival rates and the objective response rates of
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is an randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease stage (locally advanced vs metastatic) and performance status (0 and 1
      vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36,
           and 43 during the first course. After a 1-week rest period, patients receive gemcitabine
           IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Subsequent courses repeat every 28 days for 4
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 508 patients (254 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
