      of allogeneic γδ T cell therapy and three target dose levels between 2x10^6 - 5x10^7/kg per
      infusion will be tested. 4-6 doses will be given at an interval of 3-4 weeks into subjects
      with advanced solid cancers.Whether chemotherapy should be combined or not depends on the
      specific condition of the patient.

      The study is an adaptive design that has 2 stages: Stage 1 - dose escalation, Stage 2 -
      efficacy.A typical 3+3 design will be used to determine the safe regimen based on the
      incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Stage 1. The identified safe regimen will be
      used to further confirm safety and efficacy in Stage 2.
