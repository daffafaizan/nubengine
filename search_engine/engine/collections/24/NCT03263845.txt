      years of age. Urinary samples are therefore very common in pediatric emergencies. In children
      who have not acquired cleanliness, the most used method of collection is the placement of a
      sterile urine bag on the perineum. It allows a noninvasive urinary collection. However from a
      bacteriological point of view this method is debatable because the rate of contamination of
      the collections is important. This mode of collection is of interest only to exclude a
      urinary infection, by the realization of a urinary strip.

      Pocket-collected urine is not reliable for bacteriological analysis in culture. For example,
      if the urine strip is positive, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends urine sampling
      by urine sampling (or other invasive methods) for culture.

      The urine bag should be changed every 30 minutes to avoid the risk of contamination. The
      technique is wait-and-see, the installation of several pockets is often necessary before
      obtaining urine.

      A study carried out in 2014 shows that in 39.4% of the cases the withdrawal of the urinary
      pouch was as much more painful than the urinary sounding, in the same patient. To our
      knowledge there is no other study dealing with the difference in pain engendered by these two
      methods.

      Since the urinary catheterization is faster, bacteriologically justified and necessary if the
      pocket collection is positive, it seems legitimate to ask ourselves if we should not aim at a
      generalization of the urinary catheterization, as first intention, Having not acquired
      cleanliness, requiring a withdrawal of urine for suspicion of urinary infection.

      Many centers continue to use urinary pocket collection mainly, as the survey technique seems
      too invasive and painful.
