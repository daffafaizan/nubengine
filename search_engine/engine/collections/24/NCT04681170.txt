      and European Economic Area (EEA), United States of America (USA), Israel, Argentina, Canada,
      Colombia, and Japan. This study is designed to determine if lomitapide is effective and can
      be safely administered to paediatric patients with HoFH. If the efficacy and safety so far
      observed in adults is confirmed in paediatric patients, the potential exists to significantly
      lower LDL C levels in paediatric patients with HoFH. Furthermore, the lower LDL C levels may
      reduce atherosclerosis progression and would be expected to benefit these paediatric patients
      with HoFH.

      A single arm, non comparator design has been selected due to the rarity of the disease and
      because the evaluation of safety variables such as growth and sexual maturation requires
      longer term observation than would be feasible in the context of a placebo controlled study.

      To mitigate the disadvantages of a single arm design, the study includes a Run in Period of
      at least 6 weeks during which current LLT (including LA, when applicable) will be stabilised
      to establish baseline levels allowing each patient to serve as his/her own control. Patients
      will also remain on stable LLT (including LA, when applicable) during the Efficacy Phase of
      the study through Week 24Â±3 days.
