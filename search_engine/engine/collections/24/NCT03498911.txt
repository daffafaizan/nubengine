        1. mean mid-facial recession coverage (mRC) measured as a percentage

        2. the keratinized tissue (KT) gain measured in mm

        3. the keratinized tissue thickness (KTT) gain measured in mm.

      The secondary aims are to compare the two groups in terms of:

        1. Esthetic score, using numeric values from 0 to 10

        2. patient-reported esthetics, using numeric values from 1 to 5

        3. patient-reported post-operative pain, based on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scale, measured
           as numbers from 0 to 10.
