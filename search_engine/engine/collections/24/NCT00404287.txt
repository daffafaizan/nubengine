      study, to evaluate the efficacy of fluvastatin on inflammatory markers in the haemodynamic
      progression of degenerative aortic stenosis. We hypothesized that statins therapy would
      decrease inflammatory markers concentrations in patients with degenerative aortic stenosis
      and halt the haemodynamic progression of the disease. Eligible patients with degenerative
      aortic stenosis will be randomized 1:1 to fluvastatin 80 mg once daily or placebo. The
      treatment should be continued until the study end (12 months). Follow up investigations will
      be performed after 3 months and at the end of the study (12 months).
