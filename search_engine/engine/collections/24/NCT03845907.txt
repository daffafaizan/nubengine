    
      This study performs the first clinical evaluation of the Gen1B (OA-16-1S) duplex OA/US probe.
      This probe includes design changes to improve reliability and performance compared to the
      Gen1 (OA-16-1) duplex OA/US probe. The performance of the Gen1 duplex probe is functionally
      equivalent to the PIONEER duplex probe (OA-15-3), which was used in previous clinical studies
      for suspicious breast masses.
