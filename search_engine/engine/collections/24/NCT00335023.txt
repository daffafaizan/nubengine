      transfusion policy will be compared with a more liberal RBC transfusion policy. Primary
      outcome in this study is fatigue measured with the MFI questionnaire. Inclusion criteria are:
      1) 12-24 h after VD or CS; 2) 4.8 ≤Hb≤ 7.9 g/dL; 3) blood loss ≥ 1000mL or Hb decrease ≥ 1,9
      g/dL; 4) age≥ 18 years; 5) no anaemic symptoms. Patients will be randomised for a RBC
      transfusion or not. The total follow-up period is 6 weeks. HRQoL will be measured at T=0
      (12-24 hours postpartum) 3 days, 1, 3 and 6 weeks postpartum. At T=0 and 6 weeks postpartum
      Hb value will be measured. For the patients who receive a RBC transfusion, the effect of the
      RBC transfusion will be measured with the Hb value, Hct, platelet and leukocyte count, and
      the temperature of the patient before and after the RBC transfusion. The sample size is 500
      patients: 250 allocated to a RBC transfusion and 250 patients allocated to a restrictive
      policy.
