    
      Ganglion cell dysfunction in glaucomatous optic neuropathy has been ascribed to ganglion cell
      electrophysiological inactivation and to apoptotic cell death. Near-to-infrared light
      stimulation has been used to induce mitochondrial activation and to prevent apoptotic death
      through mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c stimulation. Near-to-infrared light stimulation
      might be useful to induce ganglion cell activation and inhibit apoptotic cell death.

      We propose that near-to-infrared light stimulation can be used as an adjuvant treatment
      combined with ocular hypotensive treatment in glaucomatous patients.
