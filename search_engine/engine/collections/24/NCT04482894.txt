      of care group. Participants in the intervention group will participate in regular visits with
      a palliative (or supportive) care specialist, while participants in the standard of care
      group will only see palliative care specialists if the clinician requests a referral. All
      participants will be asked to complete monthly questionnaires regarding their general
      well-being.

      Participants have a greater chance of being assigned to the intervention group than to the
      standard of care group. On average, in every 5 people randomized, 3 will be randomized to the
      intervention and 2 will be randomized to standard of care.
