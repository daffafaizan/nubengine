      postoperative or adjuvant human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-directed therapy with
      adjuvant ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in HER2-positive salivary gland carcinomas (SGC).

      This research study is:

        -  Studying the use of T-DM1 in combination with radiation and chemotherapy; and the use of
           maintenance T-DM1 alone for up to a year after surgery

        -  Evaluating the effectiveness, safety, and toxicity of T-DM1

      T-DM1 is a specialized antibody targeting HER-2 (a protein that is expressed in some breast
      and salivary gland cancers). The drug is a HER-2 antibody that is bound to a chemotherapy
      agent (DM1) and delivered intravenously. T-DM1 then binds cancer cells that express HER-2 and
      is taken up into the cell to allow DM1 to kill cancer cells in a more targeted way. This
      allows the use of a targeted treatment along with chemoradiation to treat HER-2 expressing
      salivary cancers.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved T-DM1 for HER2-positive salivary
      gland cancer but it has been approved for other uses (for breast cancers that express HER2
      protein).

      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      This research study involves radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy given after
      surgery for up to 1-year, and participants will be followed for 3 years.

      It is expected that about 55 people will take part in this research study.

      Genentech is supporting this research study by providing the research study drug, T-DM1.
