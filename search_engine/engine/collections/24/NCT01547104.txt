      to Glimepiride as add on therapy on several parameters characterizing postprandial metabolism
      and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients on stable control with metformin.

      This mechanistic phase IV study has a prospective, comparative, open, randomized, two arm and
      exploratory design. Overall 40 Patients will be randomized to two treatment arms both
      receiving Metformin at a maximally tolerated dose. In addition to that both treatment groups
      will receive either an individually titrated dose of Glimepiride or 5mg once daily of
      Linagliptin. Subsequent to a standardized meal, several parameters reflecting beta cell
      function, metabolism and oxidative stress will be evaluated.
