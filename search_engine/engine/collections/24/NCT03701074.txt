      extremely low birth infants, given concomitantly with intravenous ibuprofen and also to
      determine its efficacy in significantly increasing the rates of ductal closure when compared
      to only intravenous ibuprofen therapy. Hence primary outcome variable include patent ductus
      arteriosus closure success rate, based on the 2-D transthoracic echocardiographic evidence.

      This study is a single center, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial. Preterm
      infants with gestational age of with a gestational age ≤27 6/7 weeks by the best obstetric
      estimate are eligible for enrollment.

      For randomization, the study population will be stratified to two subgroups based on
      gestational age (GA ≤24 weeks and > 25 weeks). Randomization will occur by using computer
      generated random sequence, using a 4-block design, with 1:1 parallel allocation. Allocations
      include treatment and control arm. Treatment arm will receive combination of intravenous
      ibuprofen and oral acetaminophen, while control arm will receive intravenous Ibuprofen and
      oral placebo.
