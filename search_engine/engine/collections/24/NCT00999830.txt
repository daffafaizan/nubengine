      The research being conducted is on treatment called Anti-KIR, which activates the body's own
      cells to kill tumor cells. This is different from many other treatments where chemicals are
      given to kill tumor cells.The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical
      activity of two different dose regimens (0.2 mg/kg, leading to an intermittent saturation of
      NK receptors and 2mg/kg leading to a sustained saturation of NK receptors) of IPH2101
      administered as a single agent in multiple myeloma patients who achieved, after the
      completion of any first line treatment, including conventional or high dose chemotherapies, a
      stable partial or very good partial response (PR or VGPR).
