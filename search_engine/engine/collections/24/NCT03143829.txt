      nausea and vomiting (CINV) and reduce treatment-related negative outcomes in older adults
      with cancer. CINV is a common reason for unplanned emergency department and/or hospital
      admissions in older adults with cancer. Early reinforcement of standard education and
      reframing preconceived beliefs about the potential serious consequences of CINV and the
      symptoms ability to be successfully managed will increase effective self-management behaviors
      and improve patient outcomes
