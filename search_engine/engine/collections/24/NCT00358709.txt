      approach; to compare the effects of CBT to those of the symptom management module and to a
      control group on psychotic symptoms and subjective experiences (e.g., depression, anxiety,
      self-esteem, social support, insight, and coping); and to assess what the effects are related
      to, via measuring client variables, therapist variables, and intervention variables that
      might explain the results. This study follows a randomized controlled trial design where
      participants are randomly assigned to one of the three groups at each recruiting wave. Both
      treatment modalities hold the same number of group meetings as well as similar formats,
      lengths of treatment and operational structures, each operationalized in detailed manuals.
      Interviewers are blind to group allocation. Symptoms, both psychotic and otherwise,
      depression, self-esteem, social adaptation, anxiety, insight, social support, and coping are
      all measured before the beginning of treatment, three months follow-up, nine-months
      follow-up, and 15-months follow-up
