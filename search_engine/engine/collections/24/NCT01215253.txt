      events. Beta-blockers alone do not provide enough protection, sotalol has limited
      effectiveness, and amiodarone although effective in some groups of patients is used
      infrequently due to its side effects and limitations of a long-term use. Ischemia and
      cardiomyopathies are associated with a sodium overload of myocardial cells. Late sodium
      current plays a pivotal role in this process. Sodium overload leads to calcium overload of
      myocardial cells with consequent increased vulnerability of myocardium to ventricular
      tachyarrhythmias as well as increased impairment of diastolic relaxation of myocardium
      thereby augmenting the risk of ischemia and myocardial damage.

      Ranolazine is a novel drug with anti-ischemic and antiarrhythmic properties that uniquely
      blocks late sodium current, decreases intracellular calcium overload, and improves diastolic
      relaxation of the ventricles. The antiischemic and antiarrhythmic properties of ranolazine
      might decrease the likelihood of arrhythmic events and improve the clinical course of
      patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

      We designed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolling 1,440
      high-risk ICD patients who will be treated with ranolazine or placebo in addition to optimal
      medical therapy to test the hypothesis that late sodium current blockade contributes to
      significant reduction in the risk of arrhythmic events or death in high-risk ICD/cardiac
      resynchronization therapy-D patients.
