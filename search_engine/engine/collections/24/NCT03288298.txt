      effect on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line by inducing apoptosis, and to assess if
      nano-luteolin has more efficient apoptotic activity than luteolin on tongue squamous cell
      carcinoma cell line. The primary outcome is apoptosis, while the secondary outcome is cell
      viability.
