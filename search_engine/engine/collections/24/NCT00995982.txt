      This is a Phase I, open-label study in healthy adults. The study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of a prime-boost vaccination regimen against the seasonal
      influenza virus with one dose of an investigational plasmid DNA vaccine as a prime followed 3
      weeks later by the seasonal influenza trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) boost as compared
      to two injections with seasonal TIV. The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for
      administration and that the DNA vaccine prime - TIV boost schedule will elicit a greater
      frequency and/or magnitude of the antibody response than two injections with the seasonal
      TIV. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the prime boost
      vaccine regimens. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to evaluation of the major
      differences in quantity, quality and durability of humoral and cellular immune responses.

      Product Description:

      The VRC-FLUDNA056-00-VP vaccine was developed and manufactured by VRC, NIAID. It is composed
      of 3 closed-circular DNA plasmids, each with a CMV/R promoter, that encode for H1, H3, and
      influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from the same 2009-2010 influenza vaccine strains.
      DNA vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL with each dose administered in a 1 mL volume.
      The TIV is the subunit inactivated vaccine for the 2009-2010 season. Each dose is composed of
      45 microg hemagglutinin (HA) in 0.5 mL; with the recommended ratio of 15 microg HA of each of
      the following 3 strains: A/Brisbane/59/2007-like (H1N1); A/Brisbane/10/2007-like (H3N2); and
      B/Brisbane/60/2008-like. All injections will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the
      deltoid muscle. The DNA injections will be administered by Biojector[Registered Trademark]
      2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System and the TIV by needle and syringe.

      Subjects:

      60 healthy adults, 45-70 years old will be enrolled.

      Study Plan:

      There are two groups in the study randomized simultaneously at a ratio of 2:1 to the
      schedules shown in the schema. All subjects will receive the seasonal influenza TIV vaccine
      as the second injection.

      The protocol requires 6 clinic visits (Weeks 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 27) and 2 telephone follow-up
      contacts (within 2 days after each injection) for all groups.
