    
      Objective of the INFINITE MRI Study is to collect data on the ImageReady MR Conditional
      Pacing System in subjects undergoing a magnetic resonance scan (MRI).

      The ImageReady system has CE mark and enrolled patients will undergo MRI scan under the
      labeled Conditions of Use. Subjects considered eligible for this studty are already implanted
      with the system according to standard medical guidelines for PM implantation.

      The study is aimed at providing confirmatory data of no impact of MRI on device function,
      lead parameters and patient conditions. The study will collect standard device measurement
      through device interrogation pre- and post- MRI scan. MRI scan in this study is a
      non-clinically indicated procedure and is not planned for diagnostic purposes.

      Data from this study will be used to support the evidence of clinical performance of the
      ImageReadyâ„¢ MR Conditional Pacing System following a MRI scan when used under the labeled
      Conditions of Use, and may be used to support regulatory submissions for the approval of the
      system where requested.

      The study has no primary endpoint and is not hypothesis driven.
