      which the scar is frozen from inside. Published results are promising, however only Caucasian
      patient populations have been studied. This prospective evaluation studies the effectiveness
      of IL cryotherapy in treating keloids and hypertrophic scars in a large population of mixed
      Fitzpatrick skin types. All patients with keloid or hypertrophic scars meeting inclusion
      criteria were treated with a liquid nitrogen based device called Cryoshape Scar quality and
      possible recurrence are assessed pre- and postsurgery (3, 6 and 12 months) with objective
      devices determine scar color, scar elasticity, scar volume and patient's skin type. In
      addition, scars are evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.
