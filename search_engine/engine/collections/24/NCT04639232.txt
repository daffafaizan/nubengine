      However, to date no study has considered the evaluation of all three extracts. Additionally,
      certain probiotic strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium also appear to increase milk
      production in animal studies.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the consumption of a combination of
      probiotic strains (Prob-milk) and of a combination of plant extracts plus an inactivated
      probiotic strain (VoluntasProb) on the production volume and the nutritional composition and
      the microbiota. of breast milk in lactating women. This is a preliminary study whose purpose
      is to gather information for future studies.
