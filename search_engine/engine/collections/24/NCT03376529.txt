    
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, multi-arm, open-label, randomized, three-period crossover
      study to evaluate the drug-drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a
      single dose of SPR741 combined with each of 3 different partner antibiotics (ceftazidime,
      piperacillin/tazobactam, and aztreonam) in healthy volunteers. Participants will be
      administered a single dose of SPR741 alone, a single dose of SPR741 in combination with 1 of
      the 3 different partner antibiotics, and a single dose of the partner antibiotic alone in a
      randomized sequence. Twenty-seven (27) adult male and female normal healthy participants 18
      to 55 years of age are planned to participate in the study. Women of childbearing potential
      will not be eligible to participate. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a
      treatment phase, and a follow-up phase.

      The 3 treatment arms will be enrolled and dosed in parallel or in a staggered manner, as
      needed for scheduling.

      All participants in the study will be monitored for safety after administration of the last
      dose of investigational product.
