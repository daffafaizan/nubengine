        -  To identify potential improvements for a noninvasive method of diagnosing dysplasia and
           neoplasia in the cervix using fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy.

        -  To measure the reflection and fluorescence spectra in vivo of sites in the human cervix.

        -  To further refine fluorescence spectroscopy for detection of cervical lesions via better
           classification of normal columnar tissue and non-neoplastic tissue with inflammation,
           and low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.

        -  Evaluate and validate the wavelength selections for the spectroscopy device derived from
           in vitro measurements.

        -  Determine the sensitivity and specificity of this device for the diagnosis of cervical
           intraepithelial neoplasia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to menopausal status
      and current treatment (premenopausal not on oral contraceptive pills [OCP] vs premenopausal
      on OCP vs postmenopausal not on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] vs postmenopausal on HRT).

        -  Diagnostic study: As part of routine colposcopic evaluation, patients undergo placement
           of the probe on 1 to 4 sites in the cervix for 2-5 minutes. Up to two colposcopically
           abnormal sites and two normal sites are biopsied. Blood is drawn for hormone levels.
           Fluorescence excitation and emission matrix (EEM) data and reflectance spectroscopic
           information is acquired from patients with an abnormal Papanicolaou smear.

        -  Screening study: Fluorescence EEM and reflectance spectroscopic information is acquired
           from patients with a history of normal Papanicolaou smears.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients with abnormal Papanicolaou smears and 1000
      subjects with normal Papanicolaou smears are accrued for this study.
