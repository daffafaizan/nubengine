        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of second autologous stem cell
           transplantation in patients with persistent or recurrent AL amyloidosis.

        -  Determine the response rate and durability of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine immune reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Mobilization: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily
           beginning before the initiation of stem cell collection and continuing until the day
           before the completion of stem cell collection.

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 20 minutes on days -3
           and -2.

        -  Autologous stem cell transplantation: Autologous stem cells are reinfused on day 0.

      Patients are followed at 6 months, 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-6 years.
