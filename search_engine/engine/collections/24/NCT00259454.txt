    
      Implement a multi-component in-home intervention designed to prevent and ameliorate the
      troublesome behaviors that families typically confront and that often trigger nursing home
      placement. The intervention combines the most effective strategies that have been identified
      in previous caregiver research by the investigative team and best clinical practices to
      provide a comprehensive service approach to families and individuals with dementia including
      education, skills training, home safety, and stress management. To enhance its applicability
      to real-world practice within the aging service network, the intervention is designed to be
      reproducible and its components and treatment goals commensurate with the Medicaid Waiver
      Program. In the absence of evidence-based service protocols currently in place for this
      Waiver population, the intervention, if effective, would provide a systematic, evidence-based
      approach in the Medicaid Waiver program to help families and persons with dementia remain at
      home and in their communities.
