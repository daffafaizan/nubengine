      cycle. The follow-up time will start from the next day after the end of the second cycle of
      treatment, and last for 48 ±1 weeks (the follow-up time is 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36
      weeks, 48 weeks). During the treatment and follow-up period, if disease progression or
      intolerable side effects develop, the patient can voluntarily request to be withdrawn from
      the study, or the investigators can determine that the patient be removed from the study.

      DC and CTL are immune cells. PD-1 monoclonal antibody is an immune checkpoint inhibitor.
      According to the relevant experience of similar cells or drugs, some patients may have
      delayed or early pseudo-tumor progression after receiving immunotherapy, which needs to be
      judged by investigators.

      In this study, the screening period is no more than 14 days. After the screening examination
      and evaluation, the eligible patients will enter the treatment period. The treatment and
      follow-up are carried out according to the procedure. The follow-up period: tumor imaging
      evaluation and related clinical indicator evaluation are carried out at the 4th week (± 1
      week), the 12th week (± 1 week), the 24th week (± 1 week), the 36th week (± 1 week) and the
      48th week (± 1 week) after the treatment. The patients should also complete the corresponding
      safety inspection and evaluation before leaving the group. During the follow-up period, the
      patients who do not have disease progression but do leave the group should continue to be
      evaluated according to the original frequency until the end of the follow-up period or the
      start of other anti-tumor treatment.
