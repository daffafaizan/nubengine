      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of adjuvant vaccination
           comprising alpha fetoprotein (AFP) plasmid DNA and sargramostim (GM-CSF) plasmid DNA
           followed by AFP adenoviral vector boost in patients with HLA-A*0201-expressing stage
           II-IVA hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the optimal biological dose of this regimen, as defined by the generation of
           AFP-specific immunity, in these patients.

        -  Determine disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) adenoviral vector boost.

      Patients receive vaccination comprising AFP plasmid DNA and sargramostim (GM-CSF) plasmid DNA
      intramuscularly (IM) on days 1, 30, and 60 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then receive boost immunization comprising AFP adenoviral vector IM and intradermally on day
      90.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AFP adenoviral vector boost until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
