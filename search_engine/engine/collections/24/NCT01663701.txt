      severe sepsis in developed countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, simple therapies such as IV
      fluids and early antibiotics are frequently under-utilized. Studies of fluid interventions in
      the region, however, have demonstrated conflicting results. Outcomes in septic patients may
      be further affected by delays in the diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated severe sepsis.

      The aims of this study are (1) To assess the impact on survival of a simple evidence-based
      protocol for severe sepsis with hypotensionor septic shock, (2) To evaluate the cost of
      implementation for a simplified severe sepsis protocol, (3) To develop a clinical diagnostic
      score for identifying tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis, and (4) To
      assess the performance of the Xpert TB/RIF rapid PCR system and urine lipoarabinomannan assay
      for diagnosing tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis.
