    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, comparative and non-randomized study designed to
      investigate the medico-economic impact of adherence to INCa guidelines in ovarian cancer
      surgery by assessment of outcome in cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY).

      A cost-utility study will be performed. It will primarily aim to assess the Incremental
      Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) at 3 years of the two treatment strategies of ovarian cancer
      surgery: adherence to INCa quality indicators versus non-adherence to INCa quality
      indicators.

      Consecutive patients with stage IIIC and IV ovarian, tubal, and primary peritoneal
      malignancies will be recruited in different health care institutions, including comprehensive
      cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals.

      Evaluation of adherence to quality indicators will be assessed retrospectively (once patients
      have completed the treatment) by two independent experts.

      200 patients will be included over a period of 2 years and will be followed for a 3 years
      period after treatment (every 4 months the first two years and then every 6 months).
