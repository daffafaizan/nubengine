      rehabilitation and functional outcomes, and importantly, increased risk of
      institutionalization. However, nutrition and eating habits of chronic stroke rehabilitative
      care have received very little consideration, especially if the survivor is living in a free
      living environment. Studies have shown deficiencies in energy and protein intake versus
      recommendations in chronic stroke survivors. Perry et al. found ~7% of chronic stroke
      survivors were at moderate and ~5% at high nutritional risk. Although little is known
      regarding total daily energy expenditure and dietary intake in chronic stroke, energy and
      macronutrient imbalance may have a profound impact on stroke recovery and risk of development
      of chronic disease and recurrent stroke by altering substrate oxidation and result in
      systemic and tissue level oxidative stress. Conversely, cardiovascular disease risk increases
      with excess calorie and fat intake and two-thirds of stroke survivors are overweight or
      obese. In obese, non-stroke populations, energy dense, high fat meals are associated with
      increases in plasma oxidative stress markers. Oxidative stress can lead to mitochondrial
      damage and abnormal accumulation of metabolite intermediates and lipid accumulation in
      non-adipose tissues, which can impair heart function, increasing CVD and stroke recurrence
      risk.
