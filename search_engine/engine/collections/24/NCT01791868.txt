      (GCSE) will be randomized if they fulfil the inclusion criteria and after the written
      informed consent is obtained from the patient's next of kin. In clack of closed relatives,
      patients could be included according to the French Health Code for Case of medical emergency.

      randomization arm, patients will be treated either by intravenous sodium valproate (30 mg/kg
      during 15 min then 1 mg/kg/h during 12 h) or intravenous placebo. All included patients will
      benefit from first-line anti epileptic drugs and symptomatic medical care, in agreement with

      blinded from randomization.

      At Day 15 and Day 30, neurological status, cognitive functions (Mini Mental State
      Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery, Glasgow Outcome Scale), and quality of life (SF36)
