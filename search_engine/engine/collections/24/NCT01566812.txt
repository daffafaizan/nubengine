      that it might affect their future health, including the development of cardiovascular
      diseases. In Indonesia, breast feeding rates are very low, while there is a strong upsurge of
      cardiovascular disease. In this study, we propose to randomly allocate pregnant Indonesian
      women who plan to give breast feeding for no more than two months, to either care as usual or
      to a breast feeding empowerment program lasting to 6 months post partum. At the age of one
      year, all randomized offspring will undergo non-invasive echographic aortic vascular
      measurements and cardiovascular risk profiling. Measurements for assessing children's general
      health status will also be performed, including growth monitoring, repeated lung function
      test, and microbiomic sampling.
