    
      This study represents the first administration of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor
      GSK2256098 to humans to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),
      and preliminary food effect following single oral doses in adult healthy subjects before
      proceeding to studies in subjects with cancer that will be given at higher doses over an
      extended period of time. FAK is a protein in the body that is important in cancer
      development. Objectives of the study will be to characterize the safety of single doses of
      GSK2256098; to characterize the single dose PK of GSK2256098 in the presence and absence of
      food; to examine the dose proportionality of GSK2256098 PK parameters following single dose
      administration; and to characterize the effect of single doses of GSK2256098 on phospho-FAK
      (pFAK) tyrosine 397 (Y397) levels in skin and hair follicles. Dose- and concentration-effect
      relationships for various safety parameters will be explored as appropriate.
