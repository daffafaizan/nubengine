      2019. The sample of the study consisted of 70 2nd grade nursing students (34 people in the
      experimental group and 36 in the control group). The learning method based on transformative
      learning theory was applied to the experimental group. The data were collected using a
      demographic information form, the Empathic Tendency Scale, Attitudes Towards Disabled Person
      Scale, and Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The Mann-Whitney U Test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test,
      Paired Sample Test, and Pearson's Chi-Squared Test were used to determine the differences
      between the groups.
