      sample size (32 patients) was calculated to improve the perception of fatigue score from an
      anticipated initial 38 to a post-intervention 48.

      The control arm consist of supervised strength training in two sessions per week with
      non-supervised international recommendations for aerobic exercise. The experimental arm will
      consist of supervised strength + resistance training in two sessions per week.

      After evaluating the weekly physical activity through accelerometer, body composition through
      DEXA and the cardiorespiratory fitness through CPET, participants will initiate the training
      according to a randomized assignment.

      Secondary objectives include:

        1. cardiorespiratory fitness,

        2. quality of life;

        3. adherence to the training program;

        4. adherence to international recommendations,

        5. body composition,

        6. employment status
