    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of high dose simvastatin in patients with GI cancers. Three
      dose levels will be evaluated. Simvastatin will be given at escalating dose of 7.5mg/kg bid,
      10mg/kg bid and ( ) mg/kg bid for 7 days and off treatment for 14 days (Final dose will be
      determined based on PK data of cohort 1 and 2). The treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks.
      The cohort size of at least 3 and up to 6 patients ('rolling six design') will be employed to
      improve the rate of accrual of patients to cohorts close to the presumed therapeutic dose by
      reducing the need for late replacement of patients who become non-evaluable during the DLT
      assessment period, whilst not compromising collection of safety data. The total number of
      patients will depend upon the number of dose adjustments necessary. And intra-patient dose
      escalation is not allowed.
