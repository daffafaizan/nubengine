      allows the patient to breathe in and out adequately under general anesthesia (GA). The
      ProSeal™ laryngeal mask airway (PLMA™) is a specialized type of LMA with a design that
      permits the delivery of higher pressures to help the patient breathe in and out (ventilate)
      and also contains a channel to suction the stomach.

      Infants under GA may breathe through a PLMA in different ways. Spontaneous ventilation
      consists of the infants breathing on their own through a PLMA™. Pressure support ventilation
      allows the patient to breathe on their own with additional help from the anesthesia machine.
      Pressure control ventilation allows the patient to breathe with the help of an anesthesia
      machine.

      An infant undergoing surgery requires a deep level of general anesthesia which negatively
      affects their ability to ventilate. Thus, infants may not breathe in oxygen and carbon
      dioxide out adequately at this level of anesthesia and it may be beneficial to provide some
      level of support to enhance carbon dioxide exchange and to avoid hypoventilation.

      This study will attempt to determine whether pressure support ventilation improves
      ventilation in infants undergoing outpatient surgery.
