    
      Women presenting to the obstetric emergency room for follow-up for various obstetric/other
      medical conditions over 37 weeks' gestation that are candidates for labor induction will
      receive an explanation regarding the study and sign informed consent.

      The women will be divided randomly into 3 groups:

        1. Gynecological evaluation based on classic BISHOP score.

        2. Gynecological evaluation based on a modified BISHOP score.

        3. Gynecological evaluation based on cervical length as measured by transvaginal
           sonography.

      After gynecological evaluation, women will undergo induction of labor based on obstetric
      evaluation according to the group they were part of.
