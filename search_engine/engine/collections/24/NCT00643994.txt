      treating tumors anywhere in the body noninvasively and with sub-millimeter accuracy. The
      CyberKnife System delivers radiation using a precise targeting methodology allowing a focal
      treatment margin around the target, thus limiting the volume of adjacent tissue receiving
      high doses radiation. This in turn allows the delivery of high doses of radiation to the
      prostate over a short series of treatments.
