    
      This is a multi-site randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group prospective pilot study of
      the analgesic effectiveness of twice-daily PEMF therapy in the treatment of persistent
      post-operative pain following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). Following a run-in period of 10
      days to collect their baseline pain intensity scores, activity levels and opioid consumption,
      eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive therapy with an active PEMF
      device or an identical inactive Sham device. Subjects will self-treat twice daily for 60 days
      while at home. Subjects will collect electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data each
      morning through Day 75. Subjects will be evaluated at the research center for Interim Visits
      at Day 21, Day 41, Day 61 and Day 75 for assessment of safety, concomitant medications, range
      of motion, weight, peripheral edema, and quality of life outcomes. At Day 90, Day 150, and
      Day 240 assessment of pain intensity, opioid consumption, safety, review of concomitant
      medications and interval history will be performed, with data collected via telephone
      contact.
