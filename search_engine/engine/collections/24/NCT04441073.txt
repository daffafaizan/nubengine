      hypertensive pregnant patients that can lead to increased maternal intracranial pressure,
      cerebral haemorrhage, and cardiac failure with pulmonary oedema and may result in maternal
      mortality. The catecholamine release associated with laryngoscopy and intubation also causes
      uteroplacental vasoconstriction and adversely affect the neonate well-being.

      Therefore, the precise control of stress is necessary during general anesthesia in
      pre-eclamptic patients.Various drugs are used to suppress the pressor response including
      opioids, lidocaine, along with α and β adrenergic blockers.

      in this study the investigators will evaluate the effect of lignocaine nebulization on
      attenuation of the pressor response.
