        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced hepatobiliary carcinoma treated
           with rebeccamycin analogue.

        -  Assess the toxicity associated with this drug in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the survival of this patient population treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a partial dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to hepatic dysfunction. (Cohort I closed to
      accrual as of 11/1/03.)

        -  Cohort I (closed to accrual as of 11/1/03): Patients receive a fixed dose of
           rebeccamycin analogue.

        -  Cohort II: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rebeccamycin analogue
           until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
           preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-37
      months.
