    
      Laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the main emergency surgical procedures performed in
      children.

      The available local anesthesia techniques include wound infiltration or "wall" blocks such as
      the TAP (transversus abdominis plane) block.

      The greater evidence on the adult population suggests that both techniques are valid for pain
      control in the immediate postoperative period, although wall blocks can guarantee a more
      prolonged analgesic effect over time.

      The evidence on the pediatric population, on the other hand, is less strong and sometimes
      conflicting: therefore, the objective of our study is to verify the efficacy of TAP block
      compared to wound infiltration in the control of postoperative pain after appendectomy in
      pediatric patients.
