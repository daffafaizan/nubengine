      treatment regimen of azithromycin in combination with artesunate or quinine for uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria for future studies, to monitor for the tolerability and safety of these
      combination regimens and to compare tolerability, safety and efficacy of azithromycin when
      given in combination with artesunate as compared to quinine. This study is also aimed at
      comparing tolerability, safety and efficacy of the combination of artesunate and azithromycin
      when given as a single daily dose (200mg As+1000mg Az) for 3 days as compared to 2 doses of
      100mg As+750mg Az per day for 3 days and to compare the tolerability, safety and efficacy of
      the combination of quinine and azithromycin when given as 3 daily doses of quinine (10mg/kg)
      + Az 500mg vs. 2 daily doses of quinine (10mg/kg) + Az 750mg when given for 3 days.
