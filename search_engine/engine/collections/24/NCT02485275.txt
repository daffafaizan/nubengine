    
      1. Patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5-72h after onset were prospectively
           enrolled in our study and underwent standardized clinical and new imaging technique
           package assessment.

        2. New imaging technique package mainly includes conventional cranial MRI ï¼ˆT1,T2,T2
           FLAIR,DWI, and ADC), cranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and intracranial
           vessel wall imaging (High-Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging,HRMRI) as well as
           susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).

        3. The neurofunctional fluctuation during hospitalization as well as 90-day outcomes were
           carefully assessed. Patients were followed up for 90-days after stroke onset.

        4. Our study aims to explore the value of new imaging technique package in predicting early
           neurological deterioration (END) as well as 90-day unfavorable outcome in patients with
           acute ischaemic stroke.
