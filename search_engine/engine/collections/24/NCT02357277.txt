      commonly prescribed moderate and high doses of budesonide one of the most widely prescribed
      IGCs, and the preferred drug for Medicare and Medicaid. Sixty treatment na√Øve PM
      non-asthmatic women will be randomized to one of 3 groups (20/group): placebo, budesonide 360
      or 720 mcg/day. IGCs will be self-administered as 2 puffs twice daily. Budesonide will be
      provided as Pulmicort flexhaler. At the baseline visit, subjects will be taught proper
      technique for self-administration of the inhaled medications, including mouth rinsing after
      each dose. Since dry powder formulations will be used, spacer devices are not required. Women
      will be assessed at baseline, 1,2, and 4 weeks. This time period and schedule was chosen to
      ensure adequate time for IGCs to reach peak levels, and to assess the bone metabolic
      response. Given the 4-6 hr half-life of budesonide, steady state pharmacokinetics will be
      reached at one week. The investigators will monitor medication adherence using the inhaler's
      device counter. Visits will be conducted in the Metabolic Bone Diseases Unit. To measure
      systemic absorption, serum steroid levels will be directly measured.To assess the effects of
      IGC and dose on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, morning (AM) cortisol will be
      measured at each visit and urinary free cortisol at baseline and 4 weeks.
