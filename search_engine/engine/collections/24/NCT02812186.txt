      surgical conditions by relaxing the abdominal muscles and thus facilitating insufflation with
      carbon dioxide to optimize surgical view. Increased airway pressures can lead to an increase
      in alveolar and perivascular edema, a decline in dynamic lung compliance and hypoxemia.

      Several studies have investigated surgical view under deep vs. moderate neuromuscular
      blockade. Literature supports deep neuromuscular blockade providing better operating
      conditions/view by a surgeon and low airway pressures but, potentially, longer duration to
      extubation and worse respiratory mechanics at the end of anesthesia versus moderate
      neuromuscular blockade which shows worse operating conditions/view by a surgeon and worse
      airway pressures but possibly shorter duration to extubation and better respiratory mechanics
      at the end of anesthesia.

      Thus, there is clearly equipoise with regard to the comparative effectiveness of deep vs
      medium NMB. Therefore, this study is designed to ascertain if a deep neuromuscular block will
      decrease the airway pressures in patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures compared to
      those under a moderate block. A reduction in airway pressures may lead to a decrease in the
      complications associated with elevated airway pressures including hypoxemia, total static
      lung compliance, alveolar edema, and long term morbidity. Additionally, the study aims to
      determine if time from administration of sugammadex to reversal is different between patients
      that have a moderate NMB as compared to a deep NMB.
