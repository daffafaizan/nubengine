      American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision recently published an update on
      circumcision policy stating the benefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks. Given this
      update, the investigators anticipate a percentage of families who were previously undecided
      about circumcision will choose to have their newborn circumcised. A common concern for both
      parents and physicians is effective pain control. For intra-operative pain control, dorsal
      penile nerve block (DPNB) has been found to be the most effective when compared to EMLA
      (lidocaine-prilocaine) or placebo. Acetaminophen is a relatively safe, easy to administer
      analgesic. Prior studies have suggested that acetaminophen could be helpful in postoperative
      comfort. However, studies examining the effectiveness of acetaminophen for postoperative pain
      control in infants who received DPNB are lacking. In addition, prior studies have been
      incomplete in the assessment of neonatal pain.
