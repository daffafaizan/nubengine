           kits to measure human defensins, inflammatory cytokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines
           in vaginal fluid washings collected before and after use of NuvaRing.

        2. To complete specific aim #2, the investigators will collect biopsies of the uterine
           cervix before and after NuvaRing use. Specimens will undergo histopathological measures
           for overall appearance, epithelial integrity, epithelial thickness, leukocyte
           infiltration, congestion, and edema. The investigators will quantitate the number of
           CD45+ and NFkB+ cells using immunohistology in the cervical epithelium.
