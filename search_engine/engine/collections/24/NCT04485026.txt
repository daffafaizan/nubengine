    
      Primary Objective: To compare overall survival (OS) from the time of the time of
      randomization between the treatment and control groups.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To compare the extra-CNS PFS2 (EC-PFS2), defined as the time to extracranial disease
           progression on second line systemic therapy or death from the first day of local
           consolidative radiation therapy (treatment group) or from the start of second line
           therapy (control group).

        -  To evaluate time to initiation of second line systemic therapy or palliative care after
           completion of local consolidative therapy in the treatment group

        -  To compare the toxicities in the treatment and control groups;

        -  To compare overall progression free survival from the time of the first day of local
           consolidative radiation therapy for the treatment group and from the start of second
           line therapy for the control group

        -  To compare the pattern of next progression on second line therapy in the treatment group
           vs the control group.

        -  To evaluate local progression in lesions treated with local consolidative radiation
           therapy.
