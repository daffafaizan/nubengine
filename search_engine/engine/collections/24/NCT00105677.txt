      to consider joint replacement as a treatment option for osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.
      This line of research is informed by not only our prior work but also recent studies on
      health disparities and patient decision-making. Our long-term goal is the development and
      evaluation of interventions to target these determinants of willingness in order to eliminate
      ethnic disparities in joint replacement. The study findings will assist in laying the
      groundwork for the design of such interventions for patients with osteoarthritis.
