      and morbidity. It is prevalent in critically ill patients, especially those who need
      mechanical ventilation. The investigators therefore investigate the effect of adjusting the
      oral diet of our intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on flexible endoscopic evaluation
      of swallowing (FEES) findings, thereby assessing the impact of FEES on a neurological ICU.
      All patients treated on the investigators neurological ICU will be eligible for this study.

      The investigators will correlate findings with baseline data, disability status, pneumonia
      and duration of hospitalisation, as well as a need for mechanical ventilation or a
      tracheotomy.
