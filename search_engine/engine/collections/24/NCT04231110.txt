    
      This is a prospective pilot trial involving a single centre (McMaster University Medical
      Centre) recruiting patients from Hamilton, Ontario Canada and the surrounding regions, to
      evaluate efficacy and safety outcomes when using fecal microbiota transplantation once weekly
      for six weeks in UC patients who are initiated on vedolizumab.

      A lead in study will be conducted with the first five patients to ensure engraftment of FMT
      within the colon. Interim analysis will be conducted after these five patients to ensure
      engraftment within the colon. Data Safety and Monitoring Board will also be informed of the
      results after the first five patients, including any adverse events. Decision will be made
      based on these results whether to proceed with the prospective study using FMT weekly for six
      weeks, or whether to modify the dose/frequency of FMT treatment.

      As patients with previous biologic failure tend to have sub-optimal response to vedolizumab
      monotherapy, this pilot study will focus on recruitment of previous biologic failure
      patients.
