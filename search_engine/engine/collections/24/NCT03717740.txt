    
      This is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled intervention trial investigating
      preeclampsia, defined according to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). The
      population of interest involves women attending the study hospital for antenatal care and
      delivery with a risk for developing preeclampsia. The intervention involves randomization to
      oral esomeprazole tablets40 mg or identical placebo tablet from recruitment until delivery.
      Randomization is achieved using computational random allocation, and both participants and
      researchers will be blinded to the intervention given. Calculation of the sample size
      considers that the incidence of preeclampsia is 10% in the population of interest. To detect
      a 50% reduction in incidence (with 80% power, two-sided p < 0.05), 450 women are required in
      each group with a 1:1 ratio.
