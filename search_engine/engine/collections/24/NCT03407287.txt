      including heart rate and blood pressure, fails to detect intravascular volume depletion and
      volume overload. Likewise, invasive monitoring is fraught with risk including vascular injury
      and central line associated infections. As such, a minimally-invasive mechanism to overcome
      the barriers of standard monitoring to detect volume status derangement, would be highly
      valuable. The goal of the study is to perform a series of observational feasibility studies
      in healthy and hospitalized subjects to determine effects of fluid alternations, hemodynamic
      changes, mechanical ventilation, pharmacologic agents, positional changes, and comorbidities
      on the PIVA signal
