      of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Known benefits associated with EVAR, as described in
      scientific literature, include minimally invasive procedure, shorter ICU and hospital stay,
      reduced blood loss, more rapid recovery, and reduced need for general anesthesia. Potential
      benefits that may be associated with use of the Talent device include reduced occurrence of
      endoleaks, therefore reduced subsequent re-interventions. The risks/complications known to
      occur to all patients undergoing AAA repair may include anesthetic complications, (e.g.,
      aspiration), aneurysm enlargement, rupture, perforation or dissection, bleeding, arterial or
      venous thrombosis and/or pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, hematoma or coagulopathy,
      bowel complications, cardiac complications, (e.g., arrhythmia, myocardial infarction,
      congestive heart failure, hypotension, hypertension), embolization (micro and macro) with
      transient or permanent ischemia or infarction, genitourinary complications, infection,
      neurologic complications, occlusion of device or native vessel, pulmonary/respiratory
      complications and renal complications.
