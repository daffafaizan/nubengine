      The study medication will be administered orally twice a day. Subjects who are eligible to
      participate will have a 75% chance of receiving TRN-002 and a 25% chance of receiving placebo
      (a substance that looks similar to TRN 002 but has no activity). Subjects will not be able to
      remain on certain standard IBS medications (antidiarrheals) while participating in the study.
      The total duration is 16 weeks.

      The study requires five study visits that include physical exams, ECG and blood draws for
      laboratory studies. A colon procedure (such as a colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) may
      also be required if it has not been performed since your diagnosis and within the last 5
      years. Participants will be asked to make daily entries into a touch-tone telephone diary on
      a daily basis.
