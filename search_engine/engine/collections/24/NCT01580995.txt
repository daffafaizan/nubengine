    
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of
      500 mg valacyclovir twice daily on HCV viral load in HSV-1/HCV co-infected patients
      seronegative for HSV-2. Potential participants will be recruited from the Jackson VAMC viral
      hepatitis clinics. Eligible individuals will be invited to enroll in the study in a
      noncoercive manner. Study personnel will obtain full informed consent.

      Using a computer generation randomization scheme, patients will be randomized 1:1 in blocks
      of 4 to receive valacyclovir 500 mg po twice daily or matching placebo. Patients will be
      counseled on the signs and symptoms of herpes labialis and genital herpes and complete a
      questionnaire to document medical/social history. Venipuncture will be performed every four
      weeks (i.e., at every other follow-up visit) to monitor complete blood cell count, liver
      function tests, serum levels of hepatitis C RNA and Herpeselect IgG HSV-2 ELISA. A
      de-identified baseline serum sample will be collected and stored in VA approved research
      space for future testing. At each visit, pill-count and tolerability of medications will be
      assessed. Patients will be asked about signs or symptoms of genital herpes. Data will be kept
      in a study chart labeled with the participant's coded study number in a locked office.
      Information from each study visit will be recorded into the chart by the PI or RA and entered
      into an encrypted database on a secure VA server. Baseline characteristics of the placebo and
      intervention group will be compared using appropriate parametric tests. HCV viral loads will
      be log10 transformed and analyzed using an intention to treat model.
