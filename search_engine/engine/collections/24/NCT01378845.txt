      leading in course to considerable impairment in everyday and professional life. The aetiology
      of the emergence of DU in patients with systemic scleroses (SSc) is complex, whereas the
      disease itself is primarily characterized by a vasculopathy of the small arterial vessels. In
      the course of the disease this chronic infection leads to fibrotic intimal hyperplasia,
      adventitial fibrosis, and thus to a significant lumen narrowing. So far, a number of
      independent risk factors have been identified, such as male gender, chronic infections of the
      esophagus, pulmonary-arterial hypertension, evidence of specific antibodies (e.g. anti-Scl70)
      in the blood, or the a previous manifestation of a Raynoud Syndrom.
