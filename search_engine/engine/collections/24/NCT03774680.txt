      Cetuximab and decorated with somatostatin analogue in the form of oral polymeric
      nanoparticles, which can release at only above pH 6.8 using ethylcellulose polymer. The
      polymeric nanoparticles were prepared using the solvent evaporation method, further will be
      characterized for its drug content, size, encapsulation efficiency and drug-loading using UV
      spectroscopy. Moreover, the ethylcellulose nanoparticles loaded Cetuximab will release the
      Cetuximab at pH above 6.8, while can hold the Cetuximab at pH 1.5 which protecting the
      stomach from the toxicity Cetuximab. Then, the nanoparticles will target the colorectal
      cancer cells using octreotide, the somatostatin receptor agonist which will lead it to SSTRs
      overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells. The strategy of deposition of ligand will depend on
      using the advantage of the positive charge surface of nanoparticles which can absorb the
      negative charges of the targeting ligands. Final outcomes: this project will present a novel
      formulation for the treatment of colorectal cancer which can be delivered safely to the
      patients in a high dose to the affected tumor cells with reduced side effects on the other
      healthy cells.
