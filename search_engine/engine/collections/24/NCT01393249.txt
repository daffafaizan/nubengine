      incidence of appoximately 3,5 cases per 100.000 children 0-14,9 years.

      Although the rate of cure has increased significantly, treatment is still unsuccesfull in
      appoximately 20 % of the patients. There is great variation in the how the individual patient
      processes the different chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore there is a signifikant
      difference regarding the severity of sideeffects and toxicities. So far it has not been
      possible to predict which patients are at speciel risk of developing toxicities.

      Acute pancreatitis is a severe sideffect/toxicity when treating ALL. Patients are at risk of
      developing pancreatitis, because of the drug Asparaginase. The condition can not be prevented
      and in severe cases, e.g. hemorhaggic pancreatitis the only solution is to discontinue the
      drug, in spite of the fact that Asparaginase is on of the most important drugs when treating
      leukemia.

      In the current study we will map the occurence of pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity and
      hyperlipidemia among approximately 1000 children and adolescents with leukemia. This study is
      unique because it is the largest study of its kind regarding Asparaginase associated
      pancreatitis. Among other things it will involve extensive genetic analysis.

      We believe that this study will improve the possibilities, not only, for individualized
      treatmentVi mener at dette studie vil forbedre mulighederne for individ orienteret
      behandling, but also for other studies like this regarding other toxicities in patients with
      cancer.
