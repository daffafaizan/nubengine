      that supports this statement is lacking. The objective of the European Quality of Care
      Pathway (EQCP) study is therefore to study the impact of care pathways on interprofessional
      teamwork.

      Methods/design An international post-test-only cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (cRCT),
      combined with process evaluations, will be performed in Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Portugal.
      Teams caring for Proximale Femur Fracture (PFF) patients and patients hospitalized with an
      exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) will be randomized into an
      intervention and control group. The intervention group will implement a care pathway for PFF
      or COPD containing three active components: a formative evaluation of the actual teams'
      performance, a set of evidence based key interventions and a training in pathway-development.
      The control group will provide usual care. As effect measures a set of team input, process
      and output indicators will be used. Main outcome indicator is the team process indicator
      relational coordination. Next to these, process measures will be used to evaluate the
      implementation process. In total, 132 teams agreed to participate, of which 68 were randomly
      assigned to the intervention group and 64 to the control group. Based on power analysis, a
      sample of 475 team members per arm is required. To analyze results, multilevel analysis will
      be performed.

      Discussion The EQCP-study on teamwork is the first cluster-randomized controlled trial on the
      impact of care pathways on interprofessional teamwork. Results from our study will enhance
      understanding on the active components of care pathways. Through this, preferred
      implementation strategies can be defined.
