      In recent years, several innovative dental appliances have been developed on the concept to
      reduce the pain of needle injection by applying pressure, vibration, microoscillations or a
      combination of them.

      Ð¢he aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of DentalVibe (DV) in reducing
      injection pain and anxiety associated with local anaesthesia in paediatric patients.

      The clinical trial is a randomized split-mouth assignment. Included patients are healthy
      positive children 8-12 years old requiring local anesthetic infiltration for extraction of
      two primary maxillary molars bilaterally.

      Eligible patients undergo two single-visit treatments after CFSS-DS measurement of dental
      fear prior to each. Local anaethetic is delivered through buccal infiltration with
      conventional syringe, where as DentalVibe Comfort System Injection is allocated to either
      first or second local anaesthesia procedure. Primary outcome measure will be pain felt during
      injection, reported by patient on visual analogue scale. Secondary outcome measures:
      self-reported anxiety during injection on Facial Image Scale; pain-related behavior according
      to FLACC scale; heart-rate dynamics; patient preference to local anaesthesia method -
      traditional infiltration or DentalVibe-assisted injection.
