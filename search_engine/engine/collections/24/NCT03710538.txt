      beverage of carbohydrates and protein early in the morning, to stimulate and initiate
      secretion of Insulin to reduce PPG excursions of the following a lunch in adult patients with
      CF. Investigators will also study the impact of a post meal exercise on the PPG excursion.
      Fourteen participants will be included and will each perform a 4-hour intervention in cross
      over design according to those 4 following experimental conditions:

        1. Consumption of 200ml of water (flavored) + breakfast of 90g of carbohydrates (CHO) for
           men and 80g for women; Sedentary activities throughout the study [condition control]

        2. Consumption of 200ml of soy beverage + 90g of carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast for men and
           80g for women; Sedentary activities throughout the study [snack effect on PPG excursion]

        3. Consumption of 200ml of water (flavored) + breakfast of 90g of carbohydrates (CHO) for
           men and 80g for women + physical activity practice (3min walk at 60% VO2max every 30
           minutes, x5); [exercise effect on the PPG excursion]

        4. Consumption of 200ml of soy beverage + breakfast of 90g of carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast
           for men and 80g for women + physical activity practice (3min walk at 60% VO2max every 30
           minutes, x5). [Combined snack and exercise effect on the PPG excursion] Main result:
           plasma glucose area under the curve. The underlying mechanisms, insulin, incretin
           hormones (GLP-1 and GIP), acceptability and side effects (mealtime hyperglycaemia)
           should also be measured. At the end of this pilot project, the investigators will have
           established a pre-meal snack and/ or postprandial exercise have a positive impact on
           PPG.
