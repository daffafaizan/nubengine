      sufficient for the development of cervical cancer. Additional factors correlated with HPV
      persistence include immunodeficiency caused by HIV, smoking, use of oral contraceptives and,
      more recently reported, vaginal dysbiosis. In a state of dysbiosis, there is a marked
      reduction of Lactobacillus and a high diversity of bacteria, with increased abundance of
      anaerobic bacterial species. High-risk HPV cervical infections are common in young, sexually
      active women. Most of these infections are transient and do not cause clinical symptoms.
      After 12-30 months of HPV infection, 70-90% of patients can be cleared naturally, but there
      are still a small number of patients with high-risk HPV infection can not be eliminated by
      itself and continue to infect, and can develop into cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,
      eventually progressing to invasive cervical cancer. Persistent infection of high-risk HPV is
      a necessary condition for the occurrence of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. Early
      blocking of persistent infection of high-risk HPV and timely treatment of cervical
      precancerous lesions are of great significance in preventing the occurrence of cervical
      cancer. This project intends to study the relationship between vaginal microbial composition
      and persistent HPV infection, and determine the related strains and their molecular
      mechanisms, so as to provide new ideas and basis for its treatment.
