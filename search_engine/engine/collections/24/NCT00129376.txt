      intravenous infusion, every three weeks for four cycles (days 1, 22, 43 and 64). Three weeks
      later, docetaxel (36 mg/m2) was administered as a 30-min intravenous infusion, weekly for six
      weeks (days 85, 92, 99, 106, 113 and 120) followed by a 2-week resting period (8-week cycle).
      After that, patients received a second docetaxel cycle (infusions on days 141, 148, 155, 162,
      169 and 176). Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were delivered according to the protocol
      of each participating center. Hormonal treatment was started after the last chemotherapy
      infusion in all patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor tumors and was
      continued for five years.

      Semiquantitative determination of three molecular markers was carried out by
      immunocytochemical methods. Tissue samples were taken prior to initiation of chemotherapy
      from the core of the primary tumors. Specimens were sent to a central laboratory for analysis
      of Topo II, survivin and p27.
