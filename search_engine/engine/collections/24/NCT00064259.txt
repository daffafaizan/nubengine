      I. The escalation portion of the study will determine the MTD of G3139/Cisplatin and will
      help determine the toxicities of this combination.

      II. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled in order to obtain
      a set of tumor biopsies for microarray analysis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The collection of additional toxicity data for this combination

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter, dose-escalation study of oblimersen.

      Phase I: Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7, fluorouracil IV
      continuously on days 4-8, and cisplatin IV on day 4. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of oblimersen until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I with oblimersen at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 37-97 patients (3-36 for phase I and 34-67 for phase II)
      will be accrued for this study within 15-18 months.
