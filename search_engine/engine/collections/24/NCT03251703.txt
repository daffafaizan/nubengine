      applied to our pain polyclinics for shoulder pain lasting at least 3 months.

      The ultrasound-guided SSPRF was performed in those patients with a reduction of 50% or more
      VAS score and those that reported healing in the AROM in the diagnostic SNB.

      The resting, motion and sleeping shoulder pain assessments of the patients were done using a
      visual analog scale (VAS). The shoulder joint function was assessed using the Shoulder Pain
      and Disability Index (SPADI) questionnaire and the active range of motion (AROM) of the joint
      was measured using a goniometer In this study, investigators aimed to reveal the effects of
      ultrasound-guided suprascapular PRF (SSPRF) therapy applied to patients with chronic shoulder
      pain on both shoulder pain and function.
