      CT contrast agents to injure the kidneys, and those rare injuries that do occur are almost
      always temporary (a week or two) and heal. Indeed, significant injuries are so rare that the
      kidney function in patients is not routinely checked after they receive CT contrast agents.
      There are many brands of contrast media in common use across the United States, and it has
      been thought in the past that all are similarly low in risk. The purpose of this study is to
      examine whether two different contrast materials might differ in their risk to the kidneys.
      We will perform a direct comparison of Omnipaque-300 (iohexol, 300 mg I/ml) and Isovue-300
      (Iopamidol, 300 mg I/ml) low osmolality contrast agents to determine their relative CIN rates
      (as measured by serum creatinine concentration) in low-risk patients.
