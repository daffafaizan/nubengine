      medication adherence has been documented in these individuals and contributes to the high
      morbidity level. This study will compare a Problem Solving intervention with an Attention
      Control intervention to improve and sustain asthma self-management in a clinical setting.
      This study will include strategies to address contextual factors related to adherence.
      Participants will be recruited from clinics that serve minority and low-income individuals.
