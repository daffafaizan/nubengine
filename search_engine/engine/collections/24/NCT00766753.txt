    
      This is a single-institution Phase I/II study designed to evaluate the safety, the induction
      of an immune response, and the preliminary clinical response of vaccinations with Type-1 αDCs
      (αDC1) loaded with glioma-associated antigen (GAA) epitopes and administration of poly-ICLC
      in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. The hypothesis is that this form of vaccines in
      combination with poly-ICLC treatment will prove to be safe, and will induce potent
      anti-glioma immune responses.

      The primary objective is to establish the safety of the approach.

      The secondary objectives are to 1) assess the immunological response against GAAs in patients
      with recurrent malignant gliomas immunized with DCs loaded with GAA-derived peptides using
      enzyme-linked immuno-spot (ELISPOT), delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and tetramer assays
      and 2) assess the preliminary anti-tumor clinical activity of the vaccines as measured by
      radiological response (MRI), overall survival, and four- and six-month progression-free
      survival (PFS).
