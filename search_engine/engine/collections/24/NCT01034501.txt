      control of etiologic factors, reducing the microbial aggression. Some microorganisms persist
      in the root surface even after scraping. Thus, the conventional mechanical treatment may fail
      to reduce the number of periodontal pathogens to levels compatible with health. This study
      will verify the efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) as an adjunct to non-surgical
      treatment of chronic periodontitis.
