      motor impairments (Dijkerman et al., 1996) and limitations in activities of daily living
      (Wade & Langton Hewer, 1987) even after extensive neurological rehabilitation. They often
      result in long-term dependence at a considerable cost to the carers and the health service.
      It is therefore crucial to optimise motor recovery after stroke. This study investigates the
      therapeutic benefits of motor imagery training in stroke patients with a motor weakness.

      Evidence for the idea that motor imagery training could enhance the recovery of hand function
      comes from several separate bases of evidence: the sports literature; neurophysiological
      evidence; evidence from health psychology research; as well as preliminary findings using
      motor imagery techniques in stroke patients.

      There is evidence to suggest that mental rehearsal of movement can produce effects normally
      attributed to practising the actual movements. Imagining hand movements could stimulate the
      redistribution of brain activity, which accompanies recovery of hand function, thus resulting
      in a reduced motor deficit. Patients are assessed before and after a four-week evaluation
      period. In this randomised controlled trial 45 patients daily mentally rehearse movements
      with their affected hand under close supervision. Their recovery is compared to 45 patients
      who perform closely supervised non-motor mental rehearsal, and 45 patients who are not
      engaged in a training program.
