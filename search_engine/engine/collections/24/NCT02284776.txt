      hydrotherapeutic cure (of about 3 weeks). For the Action group, they also follow a course of
      therapeutic education where they are given advices on how they should eat and have a regular
      physical activity.

      This therapeutic education in addition of the hydrotherapeutic cure should help them lose
      weight and not gain in again.

      The participants are followed for 18 months (17 months after leaving the thermal baths).
