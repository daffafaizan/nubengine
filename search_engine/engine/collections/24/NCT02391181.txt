    
      A single dose 100mg Iron Sucrose Azad (5 mL single dose vial, each mL containing 20 mg/mL
      elemental iron as iron sucrose in water for injection) of Azad Pharma AG or a single dose
      100mg VenoferÂ® (5 mL single dose vial, iron sucrose injection, United States Pharmacopeia
      (USP), 20 mg/mL) will be administered to healthy adult volunteers in a crossover-design. The
      assignment to either test or reference product in the crossover design is based on a
      randomization schedule. A wash-out period of at least 5 half-lives of iron sucrose was
      calculated in this crossover design which accounts an overall study duration of at least 10
      days (max 19 days) for each volunteer. Overall the study participant has to attend the
      clinical site for 5 active study days.

      The study follows the recommended format outlined 2013 by the European Medicines Agency
      (EMA), i.e. single-dose with primary variables being AUC and Cmax of baseline corrected
      total- and transferrin-bound serum iron. In addition baseline non-corrected values will be
      analysed due to the known variability in baseline iron levels (both intra- and
      inter-individual).

      The assays for total- and transferrin-bound serum iron will be validated, in order to ensure
      dependable readouts as recommended by EMA.
