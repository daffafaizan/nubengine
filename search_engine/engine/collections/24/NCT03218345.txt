      current, generating local temperatures above 60Â°C and leading to coagulative necrosis. The
      technique has been widely used in many solid organ tumors and has been shown to result in
      5-year survival rates comparable to surgery. The technique is currently the standard therapy
      in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal pulmonary metastasis particular in patients that
      are not suitable for surgery.

      This study is a multi-center prospective study involving four high volume international
      institutions. Consecutive patients suffering from pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and
      pancreatic cancers would be recruited. EUS-guided RFA would be performed using a 19-gauge RFA
      electrode and a generator. The primary outcome would be the overall adverse events rate.
      Secondary outcomes include mortality, technical success rate, completion ablation rate, 1 & 3
      year overall and disease-free survival.
