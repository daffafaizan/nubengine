    
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study. After consent, the subject will
      complete a Depression Screening to establish a baseline score. Within 2 hours following
      completion of a cesarean section, the subject will be given the study drug (600mg Gabapentin)
      or placebo. She will be given this every 8 hours for 48 hours scheduled. She will also have
      the option to take routine opioid pain medication if her pain is uncontrolled. She will be
      asked to rate her postoperative pain on a Visual Analog Scale prior to receiving the study
      drug, 2-4 hours after each dose, and at 24, 36, and 48 hours postoperatively. For
      breastfeeding infants, data will be collected regarding overall feeding quality, somnolence
      levels, gestational age at birth, infant weight at birth and discharge, the highest bilirubin
      level while inpatient and any treatment for this as applicable. The subject will complete the
      Depression Scale again at 48 hours following delivery. At one week postpartum, they will
      receive a phone call and the following will be addressed: a final pain survey, a Depression
      survey, nausea level, number of pain pills left in their prescription, adverse events,
      whether or not they would take the study drug again if they should happen to have another
      cesarean section, and infant well-being if breastfeeding.
