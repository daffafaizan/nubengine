      hemodynamic monitoring and measures arterial blood oxygenation. To date, a non-invasive
      bedside monitor for measuring mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) has not been developed.
      The clinical applications of venous oximetry are numerous and include management of severe
      sepsis and septic shock, trauma and hemorrhagic shock, heart failure and cardiac arrest.

      The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive
      fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling through a central venous catheter
      Oximetry. However, SvO2 measurements using fiber optic catheters are very expensive, and all
      central line insertions include inherent risks. Also, insertion of a central line is in some
      circumstances not feasible (e.g. discomfort/limited experience in central line insertion,
      unavailability of specific monitoring systems etc.) resulting in inappropriate therapy
      usually guided by SvO2. Therefore, a non-invasive monitor to measure SvO2 at the bedside
      negating the requirement for a central line insertion would be of clinical benefit and allow
      appropriate therapy of many patients listed above at a time when therapy has the most
      benefit.

      The Mespere VA Oximeter is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring of venous blood
      oxygenation.

      Continuous measurement of venous oxygenation will be beneficial because it will help the
      physician better understand local ischemia as well as provide better guidance for the
      physician to be able to best treat the patient and decrease their burden of illness.
