      the patients, it causes that hemodialysis patients experience more disability, depression,
      irritability, and insomnia than other patients in adapting to stress. Experiencing continued
      pain can also affect the level of hemodialysis acceptance in patients and ultimately decrease
      quality of life. Therefore, pain control is an important priority in these patients. In this
      regard, in various studies, different pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches have
      been used to alleviate the pain.
