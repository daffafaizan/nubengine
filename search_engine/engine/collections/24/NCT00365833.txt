      known chronic renal insufficiency and those with end stage renal disease. Consequently, early
      detection with markers such as circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells
      has been studied in order to identify vascular function and assess overall cardiovascular
      risk. Based on current research, there exists a notable increase in Circulating Endothelial
      Cells (CEC) and a reduction of Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPC) with renal dysfunction due
      to endothelial damage. Therefore circulating endothelial cells are a marker for
      cardiovascular health.

      Renal transplant patients also possess a higher cardiovascular risk than the general
      population, but have known improvement in survival as compared to patients with ESRD (End
      Stage Renal Disease). In addition, because of the excellent outcomes, graft and patient
      survival and even acute rejection are no longer very useful endpoints for clinical studies.
      The tolerability of transplant drug regimens and the impact of these regimes on
      cardiovascular health in kidney transplantation has become, consequently, a new focus of
      research. Currently, no clear long-term analysis has been fulfilled analyzing CEC or EPC in
      this group of patients. We hypothesize that CEC can serve as biological markers for
      cardiovascular risk assessment in cadaveric and living renal transplant patients. We
      eventually hope measurement of these cells can serve as an endpoint in determining
      cardiovascular outcome in renal transplant patients. Our present study is aimed to get an
      initial assessment of the kinetics of CEC and EPC in renal transplant recipients just prior
      to transplant and for the first two years post transplant.
