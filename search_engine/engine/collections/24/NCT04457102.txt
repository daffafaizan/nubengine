    
      Radiotherapy of mobile tumors faces many challenges due to breathing-related geometrical
      uncertainties. Breathing amplitude and frequency may deeply and unexpectedly vary from cycle
      to cycle, during a treatment fraction (intra-fraction variation) or between fractions
      (inter-fraction variation) [1]. In Protontherapy (PT), these uncertainties are even worsened
      by the proton range variations within the traversed moving tissues and the interplay effect
      between the tumor and spot scanning beam motions. These effects can unpredictively and
      severely distort dose distribution, and still limit the current indications of PT for
      thoracic/upper-abdomen cancers [2, 3]. Therefore, several motion mitigation strategies have
      been developed:

        -  Margin Strategy: this approach consists in calculating safety margins that encompass
           motion-related uncertainties computed from a prior planning 4D-CT scan. Although simple
           to implement, it inevitably results in futile dose exposure to organs at risk [4].

        -  Gating Strategy: respiratory gating consists in delivering the beam within a time-window
           of the breathing cycle, at the end-expiratory or inspiratory plateau, when the tumor is
           in a predefined stable position. It prevents potentially harmful irradiation of healthy
           tissues by reducing safety margins [4]. During Deep Inspiration Breath Hold (DIBH), the
           patient is asked to hold apneas after deep inspirations to prolong the gating windows
           and the time efficiency of the gating procedure. DIBH has become a standard of care for
           left breast radiotherapy. Indeed, in addition of freezing the tumor motion, it moves
           away the heart from the breast and inflates the lungs, allowing thus to reduce the dose
           to these critical organs at risk [5]. However, for all tumor sites ( breast, lung,
           liver), current beam delivery times typically entail several successive spontaneous BH
           to complete treatment, hence require complex management with onboard imaging to monitor
           the target position [6]. Moreover, repeating spontaneous DIBH requires a good patient's
           compliance and comprehension, which may be a barrier for some patients, and may degrade
           the accuracy of the gating procedure. Various techniques have been investigated to
           improve the tumor position reproducibility over successive BH or to increase BH duration
           to facilitate dose delivery [7,8,9]. However, the patient invariably remains actor of
           his breathing with subsequent unpredictive tumor position variations from BH to BH. As a
           consequence, the accuracy could suffer from residual motion and unpredictable changes
           during spontaneous breath-holds.

        -  Tracking Strategy: this approach relies on motion prediction models derived patient's
           real-time breathing pattern, allowing for the synchronization of the tumor motion with
           the beam motion. Accuray Cyberknife® is a LINAC mounted on a robotic arm designed for
           real-time tumor tracking. A correlation model is built between external motion
           continuously tracked by LEDs placed on the patient and internal tumor position, tracked
           periodically by orthogonal x-rays imagers. The correlation model is updated whenever
           deviations occur due to changes of the breathing pattern [10]. Tracking allows thus to
           significantly reduce the safety margins and to adapt continuously the treatment delivery
           to the breathing pattern [4]. However, the long delivery time of a single fraction, from
           60 to 90 minutes [11], limits its current use in clinical practice. Again, erratic and
           non-reproducible breathing may degrade the accuracy of tracking and will require
           frequent updates of the motion correlation model, at the expense of even longer
           treatment time and discomfort for the patient.

      Until now, none of the current strategy provides an entirely satisfactory solution for motion
      management. The more accurate a technique is, the less efficient it is (treatment time,
      feasibility, ease of clinical implementation), and vice-versa. By taking control of the
      patient breathing, MANIV could solve this complex problem. Parkes et al. showed first that
      MANIV can safely impose a regular breathing pattern on conscious and unsedated patients [12],
      and could mitigate respiratory motion [13, 14]. Our group has further investigated these
      ventilation techniques on healthy volunteers [15] and patients [16] to broaden their
      applicability to radiotherapy of moving tumors. Two ventilation modes appear to be of
      particular interest for radiotherapy :

        -  The Slow Controlled ventilation mode (SL) is a bi-level pressure mode of the mechanical
           ventilator that induces reproducible and repeated DIBH without active patient
           participation. This ventilation mode therefore offers a way to improve the efficiency
           and accuracy of respiratory gating. Indeed, a good physical condition of the patient,
           his compliance or his understanding of the instructions would no longer be necessary
           prerequisites for the feasibility of the treatment. Thus, by relieving the patient of
           his breathing control, MANIV would overcome the limitations of spontaneous DIBH and
           would allow a larger number of patients to benefit from this technique. Moreover, the
           intra- and inter-fraction baseline shift (= mean position variation over time) are
           reduced with MANIV compared to voluntary DIBH [15] and should improve the accuracy of
           the gating procedure. MANIV will thus facilitate both onboard imaging procedure for
           patient positioning and the beam delivery accuracy. In the context of proton therapy,
           freezing the tumor motion thanks to SL mode would allow to treat thoracic and abdominal
           tumors by drastically reducing the motion-related geometrical uncertainties that have
           been prohibitive until now to ensure satisfactory robustness of the planned dose
           distribution.

        -  The Volume Controlled ventilation mode (VC) constraints both breathing rate and tidal
           volume measured from the patient's spontaneous breathing parameters, and imposes a
           completely regular breathing pattern without increasing the tumor baseline shift
           [15,16]. Stabilization of the respiratory pattern over time would be beneficial for
           tracking strategy. We can hypothesize that the regular breathing and tumor motions
           imposed by MANIV would reduce the number of model updates and the overall treatment
           duration, with a substantial gain in efficiency of the technique. To a lesser extent,
           the accuracy of the technique would also be improved [17].

      In summary, our group has already demonstrated that MANIV was feasible and safe on small
      cohorts of volunteers and patients, and significantly improved regularity of
      breathing-related motion or BH monitored by real-time dynamic MRI [15,16]. Based on these
      very encouraging pre-clinical results, MANIV might thus considerably simplify and improve all
      motion management strategies in both photon- and proton therapies. However, further clinical
      investigations are still required in real treatment conditions to validate its use for
      clinical routine. These include the clinical implementation of the ventilator in a LINAC
      environment, and the quantification of the added value of MANIV for the above-mentioned
      mitigation techniques.

      Research project We plan first to implement MANIV in the patient workflow and to validate and
      optimize our onboard imaging procedure to quantify residual motion or motion regularity.
      Then, we will conduct 4 clinical studies, each investigating the added value of MANIV for a
      specific motion management strategy.

      A) Preclinical phase :

      MANIV has been interfaced with the control room of our LINACs to monitor the MANIV breathing
      parameters. Intra-fraction motion will be monitored during gating treatments using Cone-Beam
      CT (CBCT). Computing motion from these devices will require the use of experimental
      mathematical models to infer the three-dimensional trajectory of a tumor from its
      two-dimensional X-rays projections. Five models have been reported in the literature
      [18,19,20,21,22]. The one of Poulsen et al [22] based on a probabilistic approach is the most
      accurate with a submillimetric residual error [23]. We have already validated this method in
      the environnement our treatment machines with a dynamic thorax phantom (model 008A CIRS®),
      and we are now able to analyze intra-fraction motion from imaging data of patients treated on
      our LINACs.

      B) Clinical phase:

      For all clinical studies, subjective and objective patient's tolerance will be monitored
      during MANIV with comfort questionnaires (Likert scales and visual analogue scale) and vital
      parameters (Heartbeat Rate, SpO2, etCO2). Statistical power analysis were performed using the
      PASS 14.0.7 statistical software.

        1. Improving respiratory gating with MANIV-induced DIBH for liver and lung cancers RT:

             -  Design: Non-comparative prospective interventional study.

             -  Population: Patients with primary or secondary hepatic or pulmonary neoplasia
                eligible for radiotherapy.

             -  Method: Irradiation will take place during DIBH induced by the MANIV (Bellavista
                1000, IMTMedical®) with SL mode. Oxygen will be added (FiO2 60%) to safely and
                easily prolong the DIBH duration up to 40-50 seconds to allow the complete delivery
                of a treatment beam [13]. Prior to treatment, a radio-opaque fiducial will be
                implanted in the tumor by an interventional radiologist, to facilitate the tumor
                position monitoring from onboard imaging. Residual tumor baseline shift and motion
                will thus be measured during beam delivery, and used to recompute the optimal
                safety margins that ensure an adequate dose coverage of at least 90% of tumors,
                according to literature recommendations [24]. We will also compare these safety
                margins computed under MANIV condition with those routinely applied in
                free-breathing condition (from a matched retrospective cohort) to estimate the gain
                in terms of margin reduction.

             -  Primary outcome: Feasibility of treatment completion with mechanical-ventilation.

             -  Secondary outcome: a) Proportion of tumors receiving the prescribed dose. b)
                Recalculation of safety margins adapted to the MANIV in SL mode and margin
                reduction compared to conventional free breathing RT.

             -  Statistical power analysis : Considering a good and poor feasibility tresholds of
                85 % and 50 % respectively and assuming at least 75 % of patients population would
                complete their treatment with the proposed technique, a total of 16 patients are
                needed ( alpha level of 0,05 and beta level of 0,9 ).

        2. Improving respiratory gating with MANIV-Induced DIBH for breast RT:

             -  Design: Randomized controlled trial with equiprobable randomization by block of 4
                in 2 arms: the interventional arm will be treated with MANIV-induced DIBH and the
                control arm treated in spontaneous DIBH

             -  Population: Patients with left breast neoplasia eligible for treatment by
                radiotherapy.

             -  Method: Patients in the interventional arm will be treated under the same
                conditions as described above. Optical surface imaging (VisionRT® - Identify®) will
                be used to monitor in real-time the breast position during beam delivery. Based on
                this information, the mean breast displacement will be compared between the two
                arms. The planned dose to the organs at risk (heart, lung) will also be computed
                and compared between both arms. The conversion ratio from the DIBH technique to a
                free breathing treatment will be analyzed in each arm as a surrogate of the DIBH
                strategy efficiency. The treatment will indeed be performed in free breathing when
                the patient will not be able to hold a DIBH for a long enough time for the delivery
                of the treatment.

             -  Primary outcome: mean displacements of the mammary gland during treatment.

             -  Secondary outcomes: a) Planned dose to organs at risk (especially heart and lung)
                b) Proportion of conversion to free-breath in each arm.

             -  Statistical power analysis : 27 patients should be included in each arm to rule an
                additional deviation of 1 mm of the mammary gland during treatment (non-inferiority
                margin of 1 mm) using an independent 2 samples proportion t-test (one-tailed) to
                reach a statistical power of 95 % (alpha error = 2,5 %).

        3. Improving respiratory real-time tracking by VC mode:

             -  Design: Non-comparative prospective interventional study.

             -  Population: Patients with primary or secondary hepatic neoplasia eligible for a
                radiotherapy treatment.

             -  Method: Patients will be ventilated by VC mode during their treatment. For each
                fraction, the treatment time, the number of reconstructions of the tracking model
                and the correlation errors of the model will be collected. The same information
                will be extracted from a matched retrospective cohort treated by tracking in
                spontaneous breathing.

             -  Primary outcome: Mean duration of a fraction.

             -  Secondary outcomes: a) Correlation errors of the model, b) accuracy of the tracking

             -  Statistical power analysis : 20 patients should be included in both cohorts (the
                prospective and retrospective one) to demonstrate a reduction of the mean treatment
                time (effect size = 0.6) with an independent 2 samples t-test (one tailed) to reach
                a statistical power of 80 % (apha error = 5%).

        4. Mechanically-induced breath-holds for gated PBS-PT:

             -  Design: Non-comparative observational prospective study.

             -  Population: Patients included in study n°1

             -  Method: data on tumor position and its residual motion from patients included in
                the study n°1 will be used to compute the planned and in silico delivered dose
                distribution with PBS PT. The MIRO lab (UCL-IREC ) has developed comprehensive
                tools for simulating treatment delivery on patients CT images using the Monte Carlo
                dose engine MCsquare [25], coupled with log-file acquisitions [26]. In this way, we
                will be able to validate our approach in silico in collaboration with IBA, as a
                first step before conducting prospective trials for the clinical validation of this
                approach.

             -  Primary outcome: dose delivered at 95, 98 and 100% of the volume of each tumor.

             -  Statistical power analysis : not applicable. Patients from study n°1 (Improving
                respiratory gating by SL mode) will be included.
