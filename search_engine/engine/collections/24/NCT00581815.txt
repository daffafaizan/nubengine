      obtain biochemical information about tumor metabolism in patients, both before and after
      antineoplastic therapy. In healthy volunteers, normal tissue metabolism will also be studied.
      It is hypothesized that metabolic information may be of prognostic significance, or may be
      useful for timing of therapy.
