      and the daily impacts on one's life Specific Aim: Using iterative, semi-structured interviews
      or focus groups to explore the lived experience with CC and usual customary care (UCC) of
      catheter users with NLUTD and their caretakers to generate user-defined themes regarding
      bladder function and catheter-related barriers and the daily impacts on one's life.
