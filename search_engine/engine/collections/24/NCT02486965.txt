    
      A specific training program under the guidance of a physiotherapist, a professor of Adapted
      Physical Activity (APA) and individualized whose objective is to strengthen the
      parasympathetic tone and modulate the reactivity of the sympathetic system and the report of
      the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis.This training program consists of three
      sessions of 45 minutes of physical activity per week for 2 years. The exercise intensity is
      initially very low and will be gradually increased according to your abilities and your
      tolerance to stress. A 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) will be carried out by the physiotherapist
      and by Professor APA, every 6 months to monitor the progression. For tracking the training
      program, a phone call is scheduled every week during the first 3 months, then a phone call
      every 15 days during the following months until the end of the study.Evaluation of
      neuromodulation of pain will be measured thanks to thermodeTest , experimental method
      implementing a tonic thermal pain using a "Peltier type Thermode" 3 cm2 model TSA II and
      immersion in a bath of cold water.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups, "Training" group or "Control" group.

      The control group is a training program supervised by physical therapists and teachers in
      Adapted Physical Activity, identical to the active program in its follow-up, but the
      intensity of the sessions is lower.

      Study schedule :

        -  1st visit : screening visit at D-30

        -  2nd visit : inclusion at D-7

        -  3rd visit at D0

        -  4st visit between M6 and M9

        -  5th visit at M24

      The patients included in the study will receive in addition to the training program, taking
      into bio-psycho-social multidisciplinary.
