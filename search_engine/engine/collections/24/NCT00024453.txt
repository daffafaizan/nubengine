        -  Compare the response and cure rate of coagulase-negative staphylococcal septicemia in
           patients receiving chemotherapy through a central venous catheter treated with 2
           different schedules of teicoplanin.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and number of central venous catheter lumens (1 vs 2). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive teicoplanin IV bolus every 12 hours for 3 doses and then once
           daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive teicoplanin IV over 2 hours and/or by antibiotic lock every 12
           hours for 3 doses and then once daily for 5 doses (total of 7 days).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 490-1,360 patients will be accrued for this study within
      2.2-6.2 years.
