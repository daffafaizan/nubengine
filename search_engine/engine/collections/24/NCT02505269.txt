    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet
      approved brentuximab vedotin (brentuximab) as part of the initial treatment of Hodgkin
      lymphoma. Currently, brentuximab is FDA-approved for treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  Brentuximab works by binding specifically to Hodgkin lymphoma cells, entering the cells,
           and then releasing the drug to destroy the cell.

        -  The chemotherapy drugs Adriamycin and Dacarbazine (AD) which which participants will
           receive in this research study are approved for use in people with Hodgkin Lymphoma.

        -  Patients will not receive planned radiation therapy, or the drugs bleomycin or
           vinblastine.
