      when compared to Moderate Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) in several types of patients
      and in healthy subjects. There are no data on HIIT in a general geriatric population. This
      study is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of using HIIT in geriatric hospitalized
      patients compared to the standard current rehabilitation practice without HIIT. It is our
      desire to perform a larger randomized comparative trial between HIIT and MICT if the pilot
      study proves its feasibility.
