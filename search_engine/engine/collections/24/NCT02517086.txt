      the effect of therapeutic resources in morbidity due to surgical treatment of breast cancer.
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of elastic compression, functional
      compressive bandaging (ECF) and active exercises in the bloodstream of the upper member
      ipsilateral to the surgical procedure for the treatment of breast cancer. The study will be
      conducted according to design random cross over and wash out period of 7 days. They will be
      evaluated 30 volunteers aged between 45 and 70 years, submitted to treatment of breast
      cancer. The volunteers will be submitted to three different therapeutic procedures applied
      randomly by lot: active exercises, functional compressive bandaging with active exercises and
      elastic compression with active exercises. The profile of blood flow, including speed and
      direction, will be assessed by Doppler ultrasound before and after, at 0, 15, 30 minutes.
      Normality will be verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the effect of behavior between pre-
      and post-intervention will be evaluated by ANOVA two-way followed by post-hoc test Friedman
      followed rank, p <0.05 . The data obtained in the study are intended to enhance the forms of
      physical therapy intervention in the face of circulatory morbidities resulting from breast
      cancer treatments.
