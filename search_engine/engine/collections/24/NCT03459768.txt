      Africa among which 12,1 % lived with HIV. Prevalences of HIV, chronic hepatitis C and B among
      people who inject drugs remain little documented in Sub-Saharan Africa. The transmission of
      HCV in Africa is mainly hospital-borne, bound to a precarious transfusional and therapeutic
      safety. However, the transmission by intravenous drug use emerges as a new stake in public
      health in urban areas. The report of a strong HIV prevalence in the population of PWID in the
      sub-region ( for example, In 2007, in the Cape Verde, prevalence of the HIV was 14 % in
      emprisoned PWID against 0,8 % in the general population) contributed to assert the reality of
      the use of intravenous drugs in the region and the vulnerability of this population. Senegal,
      a country with an concentrated HIV epidemic [0,5 % prevalence in 2012, WHO source] is the
      first country of western Africa to have measured prevalence of HIV (5,2 %), HBV (7,9 %) and
      HCV (23,3 %) in PWID (Study ANRS 12243). In view of these results, the Senegalese authorities
      introduced from October, 2011 in Dakar, activities of harm reduction by means of a mobile
      team of social workers and mediators allowing individual and collective activities of
      prevention, needle exchange program, references for care and follow-up, as well as a opioid
      substitution program in a methadone center (CEPIAD) located in Dakar, first of its kind in
      Western Africa. The objective of the present research project thus is to estimate the impact
      of a strategy of " test and treat " of HIV and harm reduction initiatives on the prevalence
      and incidence of HIV, HBV and HCV infections in an population of injectable drug consumers
      followed in the methadone center ( CEPIAD) of Dakar, Senegal
