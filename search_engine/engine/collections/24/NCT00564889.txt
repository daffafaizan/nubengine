      Primary

      * Assess the hematologic response rate in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis treated
      with lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the organ response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lenalidomide on days 1-21, oral cyclophosphamide* on days 1,
      8, and 15, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients may receive cyclophosphamide for up to 1 year. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years.
