    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study conducted to test intratumoral injections of
      TTI-621 in patients that have relapsed and refractory percutaneously accessible solid tumors
      or mycosis fungoides.

      TTI-621 (SIRPα-IgG1 Fc) is a soluble recombinant fusion protein created by directly linking
      the sequences encoding the N-terminal CD47 binding domain of human SIRPα with the Fc domain
      of human immunoglobulin (IgG1). TTI-621 acts by binding human CD47 and preventing it from
      delivering an inhibitory "do not eat" (antiphagocytic) signal to macrophages.

      The study will be performed in two different parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.

      During the escalation part of the study, TTI-621 was studied at 3 different dose levels and
      at different dosing frequencies to characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      During the expansion part of the study, TTI-621 will be studied in an expanded group of
      patients at the maximum feasible dosing regimen determined in the escalation phase. After
      completion of their initial assigned therapy, subjects may receive continuation with TTI-621.
      The expansion phase will further define safety and characterize efficacy of TTI-621 alone and
      in combination with other anti-cancer therapies.
