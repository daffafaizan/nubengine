      proof-of-concept study to determine the efficacy and safety of CC-292 (375 mg PO daily) on a
      stable background of MTX therapy in female subjects with active RA.

      Approximately 80 female subjects with active RA will be randomized 1:1 into two dose groups:
      active CC-292 (375 mg PO daily) or identically-appearing placebo capsules for 4 weeks
