      from heart disease, embolisms and microvascular complications such as blindness, kidney
      failure and peripheral neuropathies. In order to achieve an optimum level of independence in
      their self care, it is essential that type 2 DM patients take responsibility for the
      situation and be actively involved in the control of their health. Technology can solve some
      of the current challenges of chronic diseases such as type 2 DM, and in fact there are
      studies that suggest that chronic diseases can be more manageable with the support of
      mHealth. In this context, the Diacare platform has been designed with the idea of improving
      the self-management and self-care of patients with type 2 DM in a more personalized and
      individual way. The Diacare platform consists of an application, a fitbit wristband for
      activity monitoring and a web platform for professionals. This research project wants to
      evaluate the usability, utility and feasibility of the Diacare platform and the ability of
      users to use the platform and receive valuable information from it to help address the
      management of type 2 diabetes outside the healthcare environment. For this, a total of 35
      patients and their respective health professionals will be recruited for the study and will
      use the DIACARE platform for 3 months. The results of this pilot will be collected through
      qualitative and quantitative data through the DIACARE platform and from questionnaires that
      will be administered to patients and professionals and will allow the evaluation of the
      technology developed.
