    
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive bone
      marrow failure, variable congenital abnormalities and a predisposition to malignancy,
      particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Currently, the
      only curative treatment option for the hematological complications of FA include
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The investigators hypothesize that quercetin will
      prevent or delay the development of SCC and associated complications, there by ameliorating
      or delaying the need for potentially lethal treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation
      therapy for the same.

      This study is an open-label, single arm study. This study will enroll approximately 45
      post-HCT patients with FA, and approximately 10 patients with FA without history of HCT. In
      both groups, patients with or without existing pre-malignant lesions or history of SCC will
      be allowed to participate, if they wish so and at the discretion of the PI. All patients will
      be treated with oral quercetin.

      The investigators will determine the efficacy of Quercetin in reducing buccal micronuclei (a
      surrogate marker of DNA damage and susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma due to genomic
      instability) in post-HCT patients with fanconi anemia (FA).
