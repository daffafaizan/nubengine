      cause of dental diseases, it begins to adhere to the teeth after eruption. Therefore, regular
      dental care for children becomes essential. Children at preschool age lack the awareness of
      primary teeth importance, the knowledge in dental health care and the ability to maintain
      adequate oral health. Hence, it is the parents' responsibility to take care of their
      children's teeth in collaboration with dentists and their advices.

      A good understanding of the parental knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and awareness regarding
      oral health is essential for the effectiveness of oral health promotion efforts aim at
      improving the dental health of young children. It has been found that the more positive the
      attitude of parents is towards dentistry; the better their children's dental health status.

      Children from low-income and underprivileged families have been found to have high caries
      prevalence and poor oral health. Therefore, it is important to assess the knowledge and
      attitude of parents, as their behaviour towards their children oral health is of a huge
      impact. This may also have implications on early dental visits aimed for prevention rather
      than restorative treatment. So, parents' knowledge and attitude have a significant influence
      on the children's dental and gingival health. Lack of parental knowledge and positive
      attitudes regarding primary teeth create barriers to early preventive dental care.

      In addition, studying and understanding parental dental knowledge and attitude would be of a
      good help in effective planning for well-targeted dental health promotional campaigns by
      shedding the light on the knowledge gaps and negative attitudes of the parents regarding
      dental health
