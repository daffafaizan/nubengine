      population. The investigators want to evaluate another booster vaccination can improve the
      immune response in dialysis population. All enrolled participants will be divided into 3
      groups: participants refused to receive vaccination, those receive either one (week 0) or one
      more booster vaccination (week 0 and week 3). The investigators will collect serum of
      participants 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 18 weeks post vaccination and evaluate the
      difference of immune response in these 3 groups.
