      and anxiety. Computational models of reinforcement learning may expedite our ability to
      identify predictors of response, thereby improving efficacy rates. We will will, first,
      examine the neural substrates of reinforcement learning in depression and anxiety, and,
      second, test a computational model of reinforcement learning as a predictor of response to an
      adapted version of behavioral activation psychotherapy. Subjects (N=10) will be enrolled in a
      two week evaluation, followed with a nine week weekly intervention program. Assessments will
      be conducted at baseline, and during the intervention as the 3-, 6-, 9-week follow-ups.
      Reinforcement learning will be measured using 3T magnetic resonance imaging during a computer
      task. All other measures include structured clinical interviews, questionnaires, and computer
      tasks.
