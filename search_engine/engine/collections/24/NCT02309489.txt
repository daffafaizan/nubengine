      contraception and attendance at facility-based postpartum care in developing countries,
      including in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is also a need to test new solutions to improve
      adherence to recommended infant feeding practices in these settings. Partner opposition is a
      major barrier to women's uptake of contraceptive methods in the postpartum period in Burkina
      Faso, and research has shown the need to sensitise and inform men about a broad range of
      topics related to reproductive health. However, the effect of involving male partners on
      women's and newborns' health and wellbeing in low-resource settings is not well known, and
      there is particularly little evidence for outcomes related to the postpartum period.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether male partner involvement in maternity care has the
      potential to increase care-seeking and promote healthy behaviours among postpartum women in
      an urban West-African setting. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to
      promote the involvement in maternity care of the partners of pregnant women attending primary
      health care facilities will be conducted in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. The intervention
      consists of three extra components in addition to standard maternity care: one extra couple
      counselling session during pregnancy (A), partner participation in a group education session
      for men (B), and partner participation in the pre-discharge consultation after birth (C).
      Women in the control group will receive standard maternity care only, in which men do not
      participate.

      A qualitative component will be carried out alongside the RCT, in order to examine the
      factors that may have determined the success, or lack thereof, of the intervention by
      reflecting on the experience of participants (women, partners , and health workers), and to
      explore their attitudes, beliefs and concerns relative to partner involvement in maternity
      care, through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews.

      The policy implications of the study findings will be assessed and, if appropriate, a
      strategy will be developed for their dissemination among policymakers and other stakeholders.
