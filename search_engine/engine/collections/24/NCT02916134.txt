      fossa pain and a raised white cell count or C-reactive protein. Patients will be randomised
      electronically in a 1:1 ratio either to undergo emergency appendectomy or to receive
      intravenous antibiotics as an inpatient, until clinical and biochemical improvement is
      observed, followed by outpatient oral antibiotics. Those who have surgery will have 3
      post-operative doses of intravenous antibiotics, unless perforation was identified at the
      time of surgery, in which case, microbiology will be contacted to advise regarding antibiotic
      choice and duration. Follow-up by telephone interview will be at 1 week, 1, 3 and 12-month
      intervals.
