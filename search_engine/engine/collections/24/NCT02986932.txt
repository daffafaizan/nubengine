      evaluate the safety of focal BBB opening using the ExAblate® Transcranial (220 kHz) system
      and Definity® ultrasound contrast in 6 patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease. This phase I
      trial will be divided into two stages. In the first stage, patients will undergo small volume
      BBB opening, establishing the minimum required sonication parameters to open the BBB, as
      evidenced by gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted MRI. Stage I is defined as a discrete
      region of approximately 9 mm x 9 mm area in the right frontal lobe. Multiple sonications will
      be performed starting at low energy and ramping up until the BBB is observed to open. The
      subjects will then be removed from the ExAblate® Neuro device and followed for safety for 30
      days. If the subject experienced BBB opening without any serious adverse effects (such as
      brain edema), then the subject may proceed to Stage two where a larger volume (2.5-3.0 cm)
      will be targeted. Subjects will be followed for an additional 60 days for safety and
      preliminary effectiveness.
