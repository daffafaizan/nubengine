      safety of pazopanib eye drops for the treatment of neovascular age related macular
      degeneration (AMD) in subjects whose disease is currently managed with anti-VEGF (vascular
      endothelial growth factor) injection therapy. Eye drop regimens are double-masked with
      placebo eye drops and will have access to open-label ranibizumab intravitreal (IVT) injection
      if needed. The ranibizumab IVT injection every 4 weeks control arm is open-label.
