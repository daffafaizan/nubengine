      antiretroviral therapy, plasma HIV RNA levels generally remain below the pretherapy viral
      load "set-point". The virologic and immunologic determinants of this lower steady state level
      of viremia have not been defined. Preliminary data indicate that: 1) drug resistant variants
      have reduced replicative capacity and pathogenic potential; 2) drug resistant viremia is
      associated with reduced T cell activation and turnover compared to wild-type viremia; and 3)
      patients with low level drug resistant viremia often have HIV-specific CD4 cells that are
      absent in patients with higher levels of viremia. This study will investigate whether the
      emergence of a poorly fit, drug resistant variant results in the generation of an effective
      HIV-specific CD4 cell response and if this response contributes to the establishment of a
      lower steady state level of viremia.

      Participants in this study will be followed for 2 years or until antiretroviral therapy is
      modified or discontinued. Study visits will occur every 2 months, for a total of 14 visits.
      Study visits will include a patient interview and blood tests to measure the breadth and
      magnitude of the HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 cell responses as a function of viral load, viral
      replicative capacity, drug resistance phenotype, T cell turnover, and thymic function.
