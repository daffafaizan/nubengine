      to a hospital for Acute Ischemic Stroke. PP-007 is pegylated bovine carboxyhemoglobin and
      will be administered via IV infusion. The effects on collateral flow, infarct size and
      functional outcome will also be evaluated. Patients will be randomized to either standard of
      care excluding tPA, or PP-007. Patients may also receive thrombectomy. Other measures include
      assessment of plasma concentration of PP-007.
