    
      Patients under mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion
      criteria, who successfully tolerated an spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) were randomly
      allocated before extubation, either for (A) conventional extubation protocol (control group)
      or (B) MI-E extubation protocol (study group). Re-intubation rates, ICU length of stay and
      NIV failure rates were analyzed.

      Inclusion of MI-E in post-extubation failure may reduce re-intubation rates with consequent
      reduction in post-extubation ICU length of stay. This technique seems to be efficient in
      improving the efficacy of NIV in this patient population.
