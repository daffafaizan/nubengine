      parallel-group study. The study will consist of a 3-week, open-label IR CD-LD dose adjustment
      period; a 4-week, open-label period for conversion to IPX203; followed by a 13-week
      double-blind treatment period with subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by center,
      to receive either IPX203 (with matching IR CD-LD placebo) or IR CD-LD (with matching IPX203
      placebo). Approximately 510 subjects will be enrolled to randomize 420 subjects.
