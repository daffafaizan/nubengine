      pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF). Studies have established that BNP mediates
      natriuresis, renin and aldosterone (RAAS) inhibition, vasodilation and lusitropism. Acute
      cardiac hormone replacement with intravenous infusion of BNP has been shown to possess potent
      vasodilating actions in humans with acute decompensated CHF resulting in improvement of
      clinical symptoms. Natrecor (nesiritide) a sterile, purified preparation of human BNP is
      approved by the FDA for intravenous administration in the treatment of patients with acute
      decompensated congestive heart failure. However, chronic cardiac hormone replacement with BNP
      as therapeutic strategy in CHF has been limited by the need to administer BNP intravenously.
      The objective of this study is to define the cardiorenal and humoral actions of short term
      (eight weeks) chronic cardiac hormone replacement with subcutaneous (SQ) BNP in human NYHA
      class II-III CHF. Systolic and diastolic function, left ventricular remodeling as assessed by
      its volume, renal function, neurohumoral profiling and exercise capacity will be assessed
      prior to and after eight weeks of treatment.
