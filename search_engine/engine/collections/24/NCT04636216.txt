      feasibility. Approximately sixty parents will complete prepost ratings of parenting behaviors
      and measures of child functioning. They will also complete post treatment measures of
      satisfaction and open-ended questions about feasibility and suggestions for future iterations
      of the approach. Process measures will include data collection related to attendance and
      engagement in the activities. Risks include breach of confidentiality and a lack of
      effectiveness of the intervention for the child's presenting problems. Benefits include the
      parent receiving an effective intervention.
