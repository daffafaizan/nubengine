    
      Primary objectives of this study is to determine the efficacy profiles of rAd-p53 intra-tumor
      injection alone, with with concurrent radioactive iodine, or combination with surgery for
      treatment of advanced malignant thyroid tumors(stage III or IV) including target lesion
      complete response rate (LCR) and overall target lesion response rate (OLR), response duration
      (RD), and progress-free survival (PFS).

      The secondary objectives of this study is to investigate overall response rate (OPCR) and
      overall complete response rate (OCR), overall survival (OS), ECOG, and safety of rAd-p53
      monotherapy and combined with radioactive iodine,or surgery.
