        1. To define the demographic and risk factor profile of patients acquiring CRGNB infection.

        2. To define the characteristics of CRGNB infection.

        3. To report the different treatments employed for CRGNB infection.

        4. To report the microbiological and clinical outcomes of different treatment options

             -  a. Microbiological outcomes: frequency of microbiological success. Microbiological
                success will be defined as two successive negative cultures from the same site as
                from where the CRGNB was originally isolated.

             -  b. Clinical outcomes: clinical success (clinical cure), adverse effects of
                treatment especially the nephrotoxicity in relation to the use of polymyxin, ICU
                length of stay (if applicable), hospital length of stay, ICU mortality (if
                applicable), hospital mortality and in-hospital recurrence of infection. Clinical
                success will be defined as resolution or improvement of clinical symptoms and signs
                of infection and discontinuation of the antibiotics.

      Study duration:

      We plan to collect the data for a one year period. Based on the current prevalence rate at
      our institution, we anticipate having data for 300 patients.
