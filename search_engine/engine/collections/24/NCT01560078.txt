      Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) strategy, began as a pilot project in 1993 and was launched as
      a national program in 1997. Three categories of treatment were recommended based on disease
      characteristics. Category III regimen comprised of thrice-weekly isoniazid, rifampicin and
      pyrazinamide in the intensive phase; with isoniazid and rifampicin in the continuation phase.
      This regimen was recommended for sputum smear negative and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB)
      patients who were not seriously ill. The omission of ethambutol in non-cavitary,
      smear-negative pulmonary TB patients who were known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      negative was endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. However, in view of
      high level of initial resistance to isoniazid in many areas, recent guidelines recommend
      adding ethambutol in the intensive phase, effectively eliminating category III.

      This study was designed as a multicentre, longitudinal observational study and was carried
      out between 2006 and 2011. Three hundred and sixty patients were planned to be enrolled
      across 4 centres, namely AIIMS (New Delhi), SMS Medical College (Jaipur), SVIMS (Tirupati)
      and BJ Medical College (Ahmedabad); i.e. 90 patients at each centre. Lost to
      follow-up/default rate of 12% was expected in the study. Recruitment was done from the study
      sites directly as well as from referrals via nearby DOTS centres, hospitals and chest
      clinics.
