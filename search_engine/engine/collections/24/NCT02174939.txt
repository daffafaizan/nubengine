    
      1. titration of drugs

             1. run-in period: eligible subjects are screened and baseline blood samples are
                obtained

             2. study period: 12 weeks

                  -  subjects with cilostazol and subjects with dummy placebo

                  -  On the first day after the end of the study period, the follow-up data are
                     obtained by the same procedure

             3. blood sampling and measurement of serum biomarkers

                  -  obtained from peripheral veins in all study subjects at the run-in period and
                     the end of the treatment period of the study

                  -  sent for isolation, cell culture, and assays of human EPCs

                  -  also stored for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Stromal cell derived
                     factor-alfa1, adiponectin, soluble thrombomodulin, vascular endothelial growth
                     factor)

        2. assays of human EPCs

             1. colony formation by EPCs

             2. quantification of EPCs and apoptotic endothelial cells

             3. chemotactic motility, proliferation/viability and apoptosis assays

        3. measurement of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of left brachial artery by sonography

        4. assessment of long-term cardiovascular outcomes
