      which adult participants with PK deficiency will receive multiple doses of AG-348 for up to
      24 weeks (Core Period); eligible participants may enter an Extension Period to receive AG-348
      for up to 8 additional years. Data will be reviewed on a regular basis and study design, dose
      and schedule will be adapted based on these reviews. The study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of multiple doses of AG-348, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of
      AG-348 and early indicators of clinical efficacy.
