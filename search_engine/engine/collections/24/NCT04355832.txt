      sugar) in non-diabetic individuals can reduce the deleterious effects of hypoglycemia on the
      vasculature. We have shown that IV infusion of GLP-1 during a single moderate episode of
      hypoglycemia can preserve endothelial function and protect the vasculature from pro-coagulant
      and pro-inflammatory effects in healthy individuals.

      It is unknown whether GLP-1 could protect the vasculature during episodes of repeated
      hypoglycemia and whether GLP-1 would have protective effects in T1DM individuals.
