      as patients suffering from AIDS, oncohematological diseases or solid organ transplanted
      patients. The disease is characterized by an important inflammation in the infected lungs
      which is mainly responsible for lungs lesions. Despite an adequate treatment introduction,
      mortality is still around 20% which can not be explained by a treatment resistance.
      Specialized proresolving mediators (SPM), including lipoxins, maresins, protectins and
      resolvins, are newly described molecules implicated in the active process of inflammation
      resolution. The investigators hypothesis in this study is that high levels of SPM could be
      predictive of a good resolution of the harmful inflammation, thus a good evolution of the
      disease, in adequate pneumocystosis therapy conditions. On the contrary, low levels of SPM
      could be predictive of an unfavourable outcome despite a treatment targeting Pneumocystis
