        -  Determine whether endogenous cellular immunity to a tumor-specific mutated ras protein
           is present in cancer patients.

        -  Determine whether vaccination with synthetic peptides corresponding to the tumor's ras
           mutation with DetoxPC adjuvant, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and/or sargramostim (GM-CSF) can
           induce or boost a patient's cellular immunity to that particular mutation.

        -  Determine the type and characteristics of the cellular immune response generated.

        -  Determine the tolerance to and toxicity spectrum of such peptides given with DetoxPC
           adjuvant along with IL-2 and/or GM-CSF.

        -  Correlate immune response with tumor response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of three treatment groups.

        -  Group I (closed to accrual 6/4/01): Patients receive tumor-specific ras peptide vaccine
           with DetoxPC subcutaneously (SC) once every 5 weeks for 3 courses. Beginning 4 days
           after vaccination, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC 5 days a week for 2 weeks.

        -  Group II (closed to accrual 6/4/01): Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily
           beginning 1 day prior to the vaccination and continuing for 4 days. Patients receive the
           vaccination as in group I immediately followed by GM-CSF on day 2. Patients are
           vaccinated once every 4 weeks for 3 courses.

        -  Group III: Patients receive the vaccination and IL-2 as in group I and GM-CSF as in
           group II.

      In all groups, patients receive up to 15 vaccinations in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (20 per treatment group) will be accrued for this
      study within 2-4 years.
