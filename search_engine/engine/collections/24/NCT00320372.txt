    
      Enrollment of TRD patients treated with VNS Therapy will consist of patients originally
      enrolled in the registry as well as patients who have completed the D-21 Dosing Study and are
      enrolled in the Registry for Long-Term Follow-up. Sites will maintain a screening log of all
      patients who have been screened for original TRD Registry patients.

      Please note that because this is a post-approval registry, Cyberonics does not cover the cost
      of VNS Therapy implantation.
