    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved Pembrolizumab for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. Pembrolizumab is being studied in several
      other clinical trials to see if it has an effect in helping the immune system to recognize
      and eliminate abnormal cells in the body. The antibody blocks a receptor expressed on immune
      cells, called T cells, and by blocking this receptor it has the potential to activate the T
      cells to kill abnormal cells, such as virally infected cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at whether Pembrolizumab can restore
      the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate Human papillomavirus
      (HPV)-infected cells from the body.
