      surgery and 2) diabetic macular edema (DME) will be enrolled in the study. Subjects with high
      risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy and any other retinal vascular disease or retinal
      pathology that may limit vision will be excluded. Baseline photography will be done to
      quantify the amount of DME and to exclude the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy
      or other retinal vascular or general retinal pathology. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive either an intravitreal injection of Ozurdex or Avastin at the time of cataract
      surgery. Subjects will be monitored the day after surgery, one to two weeks after cataract
      surgery and again monthly thereafter for a total of six visits from the time of cataract
      surgery with standardized visual acuity measurement, ophthalmologic examination and retinal
      photography performed at each visit. For the first two months after cataract surgery,
      subjects receiving Ozurdex will receive an injection of Avastin if the degree of swelling
      worsens by more than 10% on photography or the vision decreases. For the first two months
      after cataract surgery, subjects receiving Avastin will receive repeat injections of Avastin
      on a monthly basis. For each monthly visit thereafter, both groups will receive an
      intravitreal injection of Avastin if clinically significant DME is present or if vision
      declines.
