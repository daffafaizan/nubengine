      randomly assigned to treatment with nebulized epinephrine (1 mg diluted with 3 ml of 0.9%
      saline) or nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg diluted with 3.5 ml of 0.9% saline). Both solutions
      will be provided in identical containers.

      Clinical assessment and clinical score will be done before treatment, 10 and 30 minutes after
      treatment. The following parameters were recorded at each time point, wheezing, respiratory
      distress, O2 saturation, respiratory rate and heart rate. Computerized lung sounds as well,
      will be recorded before treatment, 10 and 30 minutes after treatment via 4 contact sensors
      attached to the chest.
