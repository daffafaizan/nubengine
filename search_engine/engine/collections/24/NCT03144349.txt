      renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with fluid removal can predict a decrease of 15 % of cardiac
      index in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Blood protein concentration, clinical data
      describing hemodynamic status (providing data from Pulsion medical system PiCCO2 Â®
      monitoring), including preload dependency evaluation with passive leg raising, are collected
      at different times: before initiation of fluid removal, and after the first episode of
      hypotension or one hour after initiation of fluid removal.
