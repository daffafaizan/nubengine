      q.d., metformin 1000 mg twice a day or gemigliptin 50 mg q.d. plus metformin 1000 mg twice a
      day during 3 consecutive 7 day treatment periods separated by two 5-day washout intervals, in
      accordance with a randomly assigned treatment sequence. Starting on the sixth treatment
      period day, participating subjects underwent safety assessments and repeated (24 hour) blood
      and urine sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis. All subjects attended to a post-study visit
      for final safety assessments within 8 days of study completion or early withdrawal.

      Urine and plasma samples where processed to determine gemigliptin and metformin
      concentrations using validated analytical methods and pharmacokinetic profiles of both
      gemigliptin and metformin were obtained using a non-compartmental method; both the rate and
      degree of gemigliptin and metformin absorption resulting from their concomitant
      administration relative to the administration of each drug alone were assessed in search of
      potential pharmacokinetic interactions, Finally, a post hoc assessment of the degree and rate
      of the absorption of gemigliptin in the study population relative to those of a group of
      Korean subjects participating in phase I, repeated dose gemigliptin studies was conducted.
