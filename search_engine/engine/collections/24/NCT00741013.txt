      but can potentially contribute significantly to the development of therapies to treat lung
      inflammation. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that positron emission tomographic
      (PET) imaging with [18F}fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) can be used to quantify the change in
      lung inflammation in healthy volunteers.
