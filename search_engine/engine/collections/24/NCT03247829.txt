      intervention. The study plans to enroll up to 100 patients at 25 US sites. All patients will
      have a HeartMate Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) and a CardioMEMS device implanted as
      standard of care. After enrollment into the study, the patient will be followed until six
      month follow up completion. The objective of this clinical investigation is to understand the
      role of hemodynamic monitoring in LVAD patients and:

        -  Characterize PA pressure measurements with the CardioMEMS HF System in LVAD patients
           under different clinical and physiologic conditions

        -  Characterize the effects of PA pressure on functional status, quality of life, and
           hospital readmissions of LVAD patients

        -  Evaluate target ranges for PA pressure and assess the impact of medication and pump
           speed changes on PA pressures
