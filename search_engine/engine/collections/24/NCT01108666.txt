        1. Determine MTD of proton beam radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide for
           stage III NSCLC.

        2. Determine MTD of proton beam radiotherapy with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel for
           stage III NSCLC in non-cisplatin candidates.

        3. Determine MTD of Nelfinavir with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC at
           RPTD of proton beam radiotherapy.

        4. Develop biomarker for clinical outcome with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III
           NSCLC.

        5. To determine clinical efficacy, as defined by metabolic response, sites of recurrence
           (e.g., local, regional, distant) and progression-free and overall survival.
