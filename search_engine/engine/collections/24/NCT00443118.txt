    
      Design: A multicenter cross-over cluster randomized controlled trial. Our hypothesis is based
      on the assumption that ventilating depressed newborns with a T-piece resuscitator will be
      more effective than SIB by increasing the proportion of resuscitated newborns with heart rate
      (HR) ≥ 100 beats per minute (bpm) at two minutes of life as a proxy for successful
      resuscitation.

      Population: Newborn infants ≥ 26 weeks gestational age requiring assisted ventilation (PPV)
      for resuscitation in the delivery room.

      (need for assisted ventilation at positive pressure: Heart Rate [HR] < 100 beats per minute
      [bpm], apnea, gasping, cyanosis and/or hypotonia)

      Intervention: PPV will be performed with a T-piece resuscitator (Neopuff® group) with
      positive end expiratory pressure.

      Control: PPV will be performed with a self inflating bag (SIB group) with and without PEEP.

      Both devices will be used with face masks, and a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cm H2O
      will be used to begin ventilation with PEEP of 0 cm H2O in the subgroup without PEEP valve, 5
      cm H2O in the subgroup with PEEP valve in the SIB group, and 5 cm H2O in the Neopuff® group.

      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of both instruments in reaching a heart rate of ≥ 100
      bpm in depressed newborns of ≥ 26 weeks' gestational age (GA) after the initiation of
      positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with face mask.

      Primary Outcome: Proportion of newborns with HR ≥ 100 bpm at 2 minutes of life.

      Type of Comparison: Which of the two devices Neopuff TM or Self Inflating Bag (NP/SIB)will be
      more effective for ventilation of the newborn, by increasing the proportion of resuscitated
      newborns with heart rate (HR) ≥ 100 beats per minute (bpm) at two minutes of life as a proxy
      for successful resuscitation.
