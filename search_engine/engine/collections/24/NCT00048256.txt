      of patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants (BMT). There have been studies that
      focused on the coping styles and levels of psychological distress in patients immediately
      after transplantation. Studies have been done based on a specific point during the process or
      at multiple points throughout the course of the procedure and still other studies have
      focused on assessment points several months post transplant. However, very little attention
      has been focused on patients' psychological functioning prior to transplantation. The purpose
      of the present study is to examine the relationship between personality traits and coping
      styles among patients awaiting BMT.
