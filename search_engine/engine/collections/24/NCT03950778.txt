      conditions, but recent studies have shown that serum albumin concentrations, disease
      severity, and mortality rates have been linked. Although the exact mechanism is unclear,
      serum albumin levels may have a protective effect on the potential antioxidant effect of
      maintaining physiological homeostasis and its anti-inflammatory effects. The indication and
      efficacy of parenteral albumin therapy in the care of patients in critical condition has long
      been a hot topic. Although previous mortality endpoint studies were negative, it is not
      certain that they can be used clearly in intensive care. According to earlier research,
      albumin is a very important circulating antioxidant. It is believed that early
      suplementattion of albumin may have a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and inflammation
      in septic patients.

      The aim of our study is to investigate changes in parameters (inflammation, oxidative stress)
      that can be directly influenced by the administration of albumin in septic cases in need of
      intensive care. Also in our earlier, relatively small number of studies, chemiluminescence
      analysis of non-enzymatic total antioxidant capacity showed an increase in total antioxidant
      capacity in septic patients. The proposed study may also clarify the background of
      pathophysiological changes behind this phenomenon.
