      saline solution to prevent shock (20 ml/kg), and then the administration of maintenance
      fluids and insulin therapy according to hourly plasmatic glucose levels controls. Finally,
      after patients stabilization, controls becomes less frequents (each 4 hours).

      During the stabilization period infusion of glucose is calculated hourly according to
      plasmatic glucose levels. These modifications in IV infusion can be very frequent, sometimes
      by the hour, requiring preparation of a new solution for hydration (in a new bag).

      This procedure takes time, during which the patient continues receiving the previous IV
      infusion until the changes are effectively made. Therefore, usually changes are not strictly
      hourly, interfering with the adjustment of the organism to the above mentioned changes.

      The 2 bag system consists in using 2 bags with different solutions with the same electrolyte
      content but different dextrose concentration (0% and 10%), administered simultaneously
      through the same intravenous line. Using this system allows that changes needed in the
      administration of fluids and/or dextrose, may be easily and instantly managed by delivering
      different amounts from each bag to achieve the desired infusion rate without having to
      replace the bag.
