      (NSAIDs) or biologics, will be randomly allocated to receive electroacupuncture or manual
      acupuncture on a 1:1 basis via random permuted block randomization. All patients will receive
      their standard of care (drug therapy and physiotherapy) as background therapy. This study
      will not be investigating any therapeutic or medicinal products (drugs).

      Primary outcome would be the mean difference in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity
      Index (BASDAI) score between the 2 groups over 12 weeks (as assessed at weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12)
      adjusted for baseline covariate and other potential confounders. Patients will be followed up
      for BASDAI, other clinical, quality of life (QoL), economic outcomes as well as Traditional
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome scores over time for secondary and exploratory outcomes. A
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. Adverse events will be recorded.

      The primary hypothesis is that electroacupuncture may result in better disease activity
      control in patients with AxSpA as compared to manual acupuncture over 12 weeks, while
      secondary hypothesis is that electroacupuncture may result in greater improvements in other
      clinical and quality of life outcomes as compared to those receiving manual acupuncture over
      24 weeks. The investigators also hypothesize that there is no difference in safety between
      both arms.
