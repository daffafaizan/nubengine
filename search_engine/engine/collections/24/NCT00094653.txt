      accounts for about 75% of all skin cancer deaths. In 2004, the expected prevalence of
      melanoma is 627,252, with about 119,178 of these cases being Stage III or IV (metastatic
      melanoma). First line treatments for metastatic melanoma, usually IL-2, dacarbazine and/or
      temozolomide, are associated with significant toxicities. MDX-010 (anti-CTLA4) antibodies are
      designed to keep the immune system running by blocking CTLA-4 from down-regulating T cell
      activation. MDX-1379 is made up of two peptides that are pieces of a bigger melanoma protein
      (gp100). These peptides bind to HLA-A2 which is then recognized by T cells.
