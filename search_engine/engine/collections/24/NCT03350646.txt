      to affect the IVF outcome. It is known that ultra high volume (>100 μl) of medium during
      embryo transfer may result in embryo expulsion out of the uterus or ectopic pregnancy.
      Similarly, some authors advocate that ultra low volume of transferring medium (<10 μl) may
      negatively affect pregnancy and implantation rates.

      However small differences in the volume of the culture medium may favor the outcome of the
      embryo transfer. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the use higher volume (40-45μl VS
      20-25 μl) of media used for embryo transfer affects the clinical outcomes in fresh IVF
      cycles.
