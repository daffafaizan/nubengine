      chemical structure, has a therapeutic effect on BPH-related LUTS, so as to reduce symptoms,
      prostate volume, improve the patient's quality of life and eventually to limit number of
      patients who require surgery or endoscopy after medical treatment. To this aim, patients who
      seek specialist advice for LUTS with no previous surgical treatment for BPH have been
      selected for treatment with Odyliresin in addition to an alpha-antagonist, in order determine
      whether at 12 months a clinical result is obtained, if after 6 and 12 months BPH symptoms are
      significantly improved, and a reduction of prostatic volume can be observed, thus changing
      the usual course of the disease. All patients with BPH-related LUTS received both alphalitic
      and Odyliresin treatment, clinical parameters and uroflowmetry parameters significantly
      improved, adenoma volume and post-void residual volume were significantly reduced at 12
      month. This is the first clinical experience with Iresine Celosia in BPH.
