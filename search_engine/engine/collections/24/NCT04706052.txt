      incidence of facial nerve injury in partcipants undergoing superficial parotidectomy in the
      absence of nerve conductor. The institutional Research Ethics Committee has approved the
      study. Data to be collected retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database, at the
      Department of Surgery, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro, Pakistan.
      The data period to be over a period of nine years that is from 1st January 2012 till August
      2020. The sample size was calculated using the WHO sample size calculator and taking disease
      prevalence as 7.1 with CI 95%, which turned out to be 101. All the patients with pleomorphic
      adenoma irrespective of age and gender were included. To control any chance of bias, one of
      the members of researchers as part of the team who operated upon these patients. The primary
      outcome was the incidence of temporary or permanent facial nerve injury, while secondary
      outcomes were wound infection, seroma, hematoma, Frey's syndrome, salivary fistula and
      disfigured scar. Temporary facial nerve injury was defined as a feature of facial nerve palsy
      with full recovery to regular activity within six months. Permanent facial nerve injury was
      defined as any facial nerve dysfunction lasting beyond six months of operation. The data was
      recorded on a predesigned Performa, and patients' confidentiality was maintained assigning
      codes to each case known only to researchers. The data was calculated using SPSS version 23.
      Values of mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables, whereas
      frequencies were calculated for categorical data.
