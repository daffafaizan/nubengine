    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-ras mutations
           in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated on CALGB 30106.

        -  Correlate presence or absence of EGFR and/or K-ras mutations with radiographic response
           to treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Tissue samples are analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor and K-ras
      mutations.
