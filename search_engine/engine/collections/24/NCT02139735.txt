    
      This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic response of ultrasound (US) and ultrasound
      associated with stretching of the masticatory muscles on the pressure pain threshold and the
      electrical activity of masseter and anterior temporal muscles in Temporomandibular Disorder
      (TMD) patients . The study included 18 women with TMD diagnosed by the instrument Research
      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC / TMD). The pressure pain threshold,
      evaluated through algometry, and the electrical activity of the masticatory muscles were
      evaluated, by means of surface electromyography, before and immediately after the therapeutic
      procedures. The volunteers underwent three different interventions: ultrasound, ultrasound
      associated with stretching and ultrasound placebo, with a 1-week of minimum interval between
      them.
