      with placebo in subjects that have symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our subjects
      will be those with diagnosed with IBD and are symptomatic, defined by an inflammatory bowel
      disease questionnaire (IBDQ) score < 170. The subjects will be randomly assigned either
      placebo or LDN. They will take the IBDQ prior to starting the trial, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6
      months after starting the medication. Participants have to remain on their current IBD
      regimen throughout the trial and cannot make any changes within 4 weeks of starting the
      trial. The investigators will have a safety phone call at 6 weeks and a follow up letter at
      12 weeks after starting the trial. The participants will be given a card to keep with them
      with a phone number and email address if any adverse effects arise.
