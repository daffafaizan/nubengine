      disease control after first-line standard chemotherapy regimens with oral or intravenous
      fluoropyrimidines/leucovorin and irinotecan or oxaliplatin combined with a standard dose of
      bevacizumab lasted between 4.5 and 6 months, whereas the treatment duration with irinotecan
      or oxaliplatin should not be less than 3 months. Studies confirmed that completely
      chemotherapy-free intervals can be applicable in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma
      who achieved disease control after initial first-line chemotherapy. Those therapy holidays
      minimize toxicity and unnecessary treatment load, reduce intensity of treatment, allow
      patients to stay longer on therapy, prevent therapy discontinuations due to toxicity,
      preserve the ability to re-administer chemotherapy later, and increase quality of life of the
      patients. The therapy-free interval represents a possibility to evaluate the efficacy of the
      study drug, MGN1703.
