      selected, who will be irradiated with red (630 nm) and infrared (940 nm) LEDs at 4J / cm2
      fluency, in the donor area of until complete reepithelialization. Patients included will be
      the donor scalp area, with withdrawal of 0.2 mm. For application of the LEDs, the device will
      be calibrated for wavelength parameters, beam divergence, nominal power and fluency in the
      photobiophysical laboratory of the University of Ribeir√£o Preto - SP. Three groups will be
      divided: GS = Sham group (will not receive LED irradiation), will only receive routine
      hospital care, GT-V = treatment group with red led, and GT-IV = treatment group with infrared
      led. Patients will be randomized for group distribution. The donor areas will be evaluated by
      infrared thermography, computerized bioimpedance, infrared plethysmography, and Vancouver
      healing scale at two times, the first within a period of up to 24 hours after graft surgery,
      and the second after release of the primary dressing. The evaluations will be carried out by
      an expert evaluator, blind to the groups. For the analysis of the results will be applied
      statistical tests intra and intergroup (p <0.05). This research aims to contribute with a new
      therapeutic method in the control of infections commonly found in cutaneous lesions, as well
      as in the healing process of the skin.
