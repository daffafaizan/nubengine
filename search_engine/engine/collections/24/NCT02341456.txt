      monotherapy and in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in Asian patients with
      advanced solid tumours. The study design allows escalation or de-escalation of AZD1775 in
      combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the patients. Approximately 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the
      dose-finding portion of this study. The total number of patients will depend upon the number
      of combination dose level evaluations necessary to define the recommended dose for further
      clinical evaluation. The proposed combination doses are : Dose level-1; Dose level 1; Dose
      level 2 (if Dose Level 1 tolerated). All combination doses other than Combination Dose level
      1 may be subject to change by the SRC in light of emerging data. At least 3 and up to 6
      evaluable patients will be required for each dose finding cohort. Once the recommended dose
      for further clinical evaluation is established, additional 3 to 6 patients may be enrolled to
      the cohort where the recommended dose has been defined to further characterise the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy profiles of AZD1775 in combination with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin. If this dose is subsequently found to be non-tolerated,
      alternative doses and/or schedules may be explored. This will be determined by the SRC.
