        -  Determine the transportability of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to a
           multi-institutional setting in patients with resected endometrial or cervical cancer.

        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of reducing short-term bowel injury, of IMRT versus
           standard treatments.

        -  Assess adverse events related to this regimen.

        -  Estimate the rates of local-regional control, distant metastasis, and disease-free and
           overall survival.

        -  Evaluate chemotherapy compliance with this regimen for patients with cervical carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis
      (cervical vs endometrial cancer).

      All patients undergo intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once a day, 5 days a week, for
      5.5 weeks. Patients with cervical cancer also receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day
      1 or 2. Treatment with cisplatin repeats every 7 days for 5 courses (during radiotherapy) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks post-IMRT and then
      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5, and then annually for at least 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients will be accrued for this study.
