      placebo-controlled crossover trial analyzing the beneficial effect of the influenza vaccine
      in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This study assesses the impact of the influenza
      vaccination on the overall systemic inflammatory response and investigates the functional and
      clinical outcome in vaccinated patients after cardiac surgery. The study sample will consist
      of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Health Sciences North randomized into 2 groups: 1)
      those who receive the vaccine or placebo preoperatively, or: 2) those who receive the vaccine
      or placebo 4-6 weeks postoperatively. Subjects in both groups will be compared using standard
      laboratory tools to assess the level of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6,
      IL-8,TNF-alpha, IL-10) as well as other cardiac and inflammatory markers (troponins, CRP), at
      different time intervals intra- and post-operatively. Other clinical outcomes will also be
      collected prospectively and compared between the 2 groups. These include hemodynamic
      parameters as well as major postoperative events. Further assessments will include the
      Frailty Index and Scale (in patients 65+) and length of stay after surgery
