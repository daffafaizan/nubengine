      single dose of either MenACYW Conjugate vaccine from 1 of the 3 lots (Lot 1, Lot 2, or Lot 3)
      or Menactra®. They were assessed for immunogenicity at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at 30
      to 44 days post-vaccination. Safety information were collected post-vaccination and
      throughout the entire study.
