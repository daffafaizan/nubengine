      healthy patients after taking into account some inclusion and exclusion criteria. The control

      and the experimental group were received the mixture of fentanyl and 2% lidocaine with
      1:200,000 epinephrine. The depth and duration of pulpal anesthesia were evaluated with an
      electric pulp testing in 5-minute intervals during a period of 60 minutes and the pain
      intensity recorded in five times, before injection, after injection, during access cavity
