      (SC) use must initiate treatment with TM buprenorphine for a minimum of 7 days before
      receiving their first injection. This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      starting SUBLOCADE treatment following a shorter period.

      Adults with moderate to severe opioid use disorder (OUD) not currently receiving medication
      assisted treatment will be recruited to participate. Prior to receiving TM buprenorphine,
      subjects will report their last opioid use and be experiencing at least mild withdrawal.
      Subjects will receive at least one dose of TM buprenorphine to ensure tolerability and that
      they show no evidence of precipitated withdrawal. If no evidence of intolerability or no
      precipitated withdrawal occurs, subjects will receive a single injection of SUBLOCADE and
      remain in the clinic for approximately 48 hours after the injection to assess for safety and
      tolerability.
