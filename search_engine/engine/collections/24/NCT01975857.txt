      that exerts effects at multiple levels of human health. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is
      a multi-factorial illness that is an increasingly serious public health issue for military
      and civilian personnel. The assessment of neurocognitive deficits in mTBI has been suggested
      to be less conclusive, presumably because of the predominating influence of PTSD and other
      co-morbid factors. Recent research suggests that psychological factors play a substantial
      role in TBI-related impairments in self-reported health and cognition function. Furthermore,
      research has shown that TBI is rarely an isolated finding in military combat settings and
      that persistent post-concussive symptoms are commonly associated with post-traumatic stress
      disorder and chronic pain, a constellation of findings that has been termed the "polytrauma
      clinical triad". Indeed, significant numbers of returning Veterans of Operation Enduring
      Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) display the polytrauma clinical triad (PCT) of
      pain, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and traumatic brain injury. The proposed project
      will: 1) elucidate best practices for treating mTBI with co-occurring symptoms (pain, sleep
      disturbance, PTSD) encompassing cognitive, emotional, and psychological functioning; and 2)
      address psychosocial aspects of managing pain and co-morbidities associated with mTBI through
      integrative and complementary and alternative approaches.
