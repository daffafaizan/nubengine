      people with type 2 diabetes. Exenatide (trade name, BYETTA®) is an injectable medication used
      by people with type 2 diabetes to control blood sugar. Peripheral neuropathy is a
      complication of diabetes that can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling or burning
      sensations in the feet and hands. Controlling blood sugars levels in type 2 diabetes is
      thought to prevent, delay or improve the damage to the nerve fibers that causes peripheral
      neuropathy. There is also some evidence that exenatide may have additional beneficial effects
      on the peripheral nerves, beyond the benefits of blood sugar control alone. In this study,
      about half of the participants will take exenatide by injection twice daily and the other
      half will take insulin glargine (Lantus®) by injection once daily. Both groups are expected
      to have similar improvement in blood sugar control. This study will show whether exenatide
      has beneficial effects on neuropathy beyond the benefits of better blood sugar control alone.
