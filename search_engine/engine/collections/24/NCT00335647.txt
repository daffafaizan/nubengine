        -  Determine the safety of high-dose fluphenazine hydrochloride in patients with refractory
           advanced multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the pharmacological properties of this drug.

        -  Determine the effectiveness of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive high-dose fluphenazine hydrochloride IV 3 times on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of fluphenazine hydrochloride until the maximum
      tolerated dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
