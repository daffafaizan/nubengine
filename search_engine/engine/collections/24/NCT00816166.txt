      neurovasculature using the PHAROS Vitesse Stent System plus medical therapy will provide
      additional clinical benefit over medical therapy alone.

      1.2 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint

      The primary effectiveness endpoint consists of a composite of the two following outcomes:

        -  Stroke in the same territory (distal to the target lesion) as the presenting event
           within 12 months of randomization

        -  Hard TIA in the same territory (distal to the target lesion) as the presenting event
           from day 2 through month 12 post-randomization

      1.3 Safety Outcomes

      Safety outcomes to be collected and reported as part of the overall risk-to-benefit profile
      for this device are:

        -  Stroke in any territory within 30 days of randomization

        -  Death from any cause within 30 days of randomization

        -  Hard TIA in any territory occurring after a 24 hour post-procedure stabilization period
           (days 2-30) since the recovery from anesthesia can mask accurate assessment of possible
           TIA symptoms.

        -  Intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days of randomization

      1.4 Other Outcomes

        -  Stent Success - PHAROS Vitesse stent deployed across target lesion with residual
           stenosis 0-20%

        -  Percentage of Stent Group Subjects with any (symptomatic or asymptomatic) in-stent
           restenosis ≥ 70% confirmed by angiogram at 12 months

        -  Percentage of Stent Group Subjects with symptomatic in-stent restenosis ≥ 70% confirmed
           by angiogram at 12 months

        -  Percentage of Medical Therapy Group Subjects with interventional procedure (e.g.,
           angioplasty or stent) at 12 months

        -  Comparison of NIHSS scores between treatment arms

        -  Comparison of mRS scores between treatment arms
