      the veteran population ages. According to the American Heart Association, the prevalence of
      stroke is expected to double by 2020 with the increased proportion of older adults
      nationwide. Our preliminary Quality Enhancement Research Initiative work indicates that
      stroke risk factors are often undermanaged in the Veterans Health Administration.

      This proposed study of a stroke risk factor management program may benefit the Veteran Health
      System in several ways. First, it offers a systematic program for reduction in stroke risk
      factors leading to better health for our veterans and a reduction in inpatient and outpatient
      rehabilitation and home health services for these events. Second, the Veteran Stroke
      Prevention Program takes into account the varied resources and services offered in VAMCs
      across the nation, allowing the program to be tailored both to a given facility and to the
      individual veteran's needs and readiness to change. Importantly, the program could allow all
      VA facilities to offer guideline-concurrent stroke risk reduction programs and therefore
      increase compliance with VA/Department of Defense, American Heart Association, and the Joint
      Commission stroke care guidelines and improve their quality of stroke care.

      Comparison(s): We will compare two regionally matched facilities on rates of secondary stroke
      prevention guideline care during the course of the study at the intervention sites.
