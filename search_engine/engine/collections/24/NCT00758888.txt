      reflexive connections to motor neurons. Stimulation of muscle and joint afferents are known
      to produce reflexive muscle changes. Orthopedic blocking applies a gentle compression to the
      sacroiliac joints. The current study seeks to determine if orthopedic blocking of the
      sacroiliac joint can affect cervical spine function thereby serving as a useful adjunctive
      procedure in the treatment of cervical spine joint dysfunction. The current study will
      compare pre & post treatment cervical isometric strength readings from an orthopedic blocking
      group, a trochanter belt group (another type of compression), and a sham group.
