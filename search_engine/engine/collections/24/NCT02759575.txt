      advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Positive tumor PDL1 expression by IHC will
      not be required for enrollment.

      All patients with receive Pembrolizumab and cisplatin in combination with radiation.
      Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose given Q21 days will begin 3 weeks prior to initiation of
      chemoradiation and continued through the 21-day cycle until completion of chemoradiation.
      Cisplatin will be given 100 mg/m2 every 21 days during radiation as per standard of care.

      Pembrolizumab has well defined toxicities as single agent and has non-overlapping mechanisms
      of action with cisplatin and radiation. The safety of these agents used in combination has
      not been previously described, therefore the study will begin with a safety run-in phase 1
      followed by the phase II design. See statistical section for details.
