      trabeculectomy mainly for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.It has been proved to be
      as effective as trabeculectomy in a series of researches. However the early postoperative
      complication of Ex-PRESS implantation is less frequent compared with trabeculectomy. Ex-PRESS
      was designed initially for open angle glaucoma, gradually some scholars used it in refractory
      postpenetrating keratoplasty glaucoma and in vitrectomized glaucoma,which showed that
      Ex-PRESS shunt implantation was an effective procedure too. We analyzed the clinical efficacy
      and safety of combined phacoemulsification and Ex-PRESS implantation for PACG patients with
      cataract. Data was recorded before surgery and postoperatively at 1 week and 1, 3, 6,
      12,18,24,30,36 monthsï¼Œwhich included intraocular pressure (IOP), best corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA), number of medications, complications, corneal endothelial cell density and anterior
      segment optical coherence tomography(AS-OCT). Efficacy was assessed by IOP values and success
      rates. Complete success was determined by IOP between 5 and 21mmHg without medications.
