      milk that was pumped at 03:00 AM. The samples will be collected at the NICU department of
      Carmel Medical Center and will be stored at deep freeze (-20Â°C). The samples will be
      numerically coded and will be kept anonimously. After defrosting the samples, melatonin
      concentration will be checked in the hospital laboratory every hour, for 4 hours. If meltonin
      levels will be detectable after 4 hours, continous measurements will be done at 8 hours and
      at 12 hours after defrosting. The samples will be tested with IBL Melatonin ELISA kit. For
      control we will use breast milk that was pumped at 10:00 am (when melatonin excretion is
      minimal). At the end of the analysis the samples will be thrown away.
