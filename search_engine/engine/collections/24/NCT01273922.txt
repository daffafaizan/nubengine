      proteins induce a protective immune response in mice and allow high survival rates following
      challenge with highly virulent doses of either Candida or S. aureus. Als3 (the antigen in the
      NDV-3 investigational vaccine) is the most effective member of the Als protein family in
      protecting mice from challenge with either Candida or S. aureus. This Phase I study will
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a two doses administered 6 months apart of NDV-3
      vaccine at two dose levels. At least 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study in two groups
      of approximately 20 subjects each. Each group will be randomized so that 15 will receive
      NDV-3 vaccine and 5 will receive placebo. All injections will be administered
      intramuscularly. One group will receive a low dose of NDV-3 and the other a ten-fold higher
      dose. Subjects will have follow-up visits to assess the safety, tolerability and immune
      responses at days 3, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180 after the first vaccination to compare to baseline
      levels and at days 7, 14 and 90 after the second vaccination.
