    
      Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is one of the most common pathologies seen in emergency gynaecology
      practice. Early diagnostic of this situation is a clinical objective because it remains an
      important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, transvaginal
      ultrasound scan (TVS) allow ascertain the location of the pregnancy. However, the diagnosis
      of EP is complicated by a nonspecific clinical presentation and the inconclusive results in
      some cases of transvaginal ultrasound at first presentation. For this reason several
      biomarkers have been investigated to accurately detect the establishment of pregnancy and
      predict its outcome as early as possible.

      These biomarkers include: markers of abnormal embryo/trophoblast growth (β-subunit of HCG,
      Activin A, etc), markers of abnormal corpus luteum function (progesterone, inhibin A, etc),
      markers of a growing pregnancy in the Fallopian tube (creatine kinase, vascular endothelial
      growth factor, etc), markers of inflammation and peritoneal irritation (cancer antigen 125,
      interleukin-6, etc), and uterine markers of normal implantation (leukaemia inhibitory factor
      and glycodelin). Β-HCG and progesterone are usually used in clinical practice and activin A
      and inhibin A have recently shown promising results.
