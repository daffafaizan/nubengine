    
      This is a Phase 1/2a multicenter, controlled, open label, and randomized, study.

      Part 1 of the study is a single dose escalation period to determine the MTD of EG-1962.
      During this period, a maximum of 6 dose level cohorts with up to 12 patients per cohort will
      be enrolled. In each cohort, patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 3:1 to receive
      either intraventricular EG 1962 or enteral nimodipine, respectively. The first cohort will
      receive 100 mg EG 1962. Upon completion of the dose escalation period, a safe and tolerable
      dose will be selected for further study.

      Part 2 of the study is a treatment period to assess the safety and tolerability of the
      selected dose of EG-1962.

      The safety and tolerability of a single intraventricular dose of EG 1962 will be compared to
      enteral nimodipine (60 mg given every 4 hours orally or via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube)
      for 21 days.
