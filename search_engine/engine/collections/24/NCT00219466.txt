      of the diaper zone at every diaper change and following bathing of the child during a 24 hour
      period.

      Efficacy was assessed during this study through the documentation of the severity of diaper
      rash. Results of five anatomic areas and overall severity score by the evaluator's
      assessments, and parent/guardian's assessments all indicated that both products were
      significantly effective (P<0.05 in relieving diaper dermatitis (rash) after 12 and 24 hours
      of treatment.

      Safety was assessed through the reporting of adverse events during the course of the study.
      Overall, the reporting of no adverse events under the conditions of the protocol indicate
      that the investigational products would appear to be safe for their intended use.
