    
      A randomized, prospective study utilizing 2% Chlorhexidine cloths to evaluate the product's
      effectiveness in reducing surgical site infections in elective cardiothoracic surgery
      patients. Sage 2% chlorhexidine cloths are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for preparation of skin prior to surgery.

      The study hypothesis is that the preoperative surgical preparation with 2% chlorhexidine
      cloths, which leaves chlorhexidine on the skin, will reduce surgical site infections by 50%
      as compared to current standard procedure.
