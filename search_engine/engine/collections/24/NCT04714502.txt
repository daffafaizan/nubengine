      AAMBI1(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03354208): The aim of the study is to verify the application
      of combinations of several laboratory parameters in early postnatal blood samples, for
      identification of infants, who will suffer from early abnormal neonatal neurological outcome,
      in a population at risk. The population at risk is defined as term and late preterm (>36
      weeks of gestation) human infants following perinatal hypoxia-ischemia with or without
      postnatal resuscitation.
