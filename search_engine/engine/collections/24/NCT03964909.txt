      I. To develop a reliable platform for preoperative mapping of language networks using
      resting-state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs)-fMRI in glioma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the reorganizations of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and their
      relation to neuropsychological outcomes in glioma patients after surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care functional (f)MRI, CVR MRI over 3 minutes, and rs-fMRI over
      6 minutes 1 month before and within 6 weeks after standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks.
