      efficacy to eliminate head louse infestation. This study has been designed to test those data
      using a new formulation of 10% cocamide DEA in an aqueous basis in comparison with the
      standard of care product 1% permethrin creme rinse. It is believed that surfactants like
      cocamide DEA are capable of eliminating lice resistant to conventional insecticides.

      A planned total of 120 patients who, following examination, are found to suffer from active
      head lice infestation will be recruited to the trial. The patient will be treated with the
      appropriate product according to the randomization code from a pre-prepared listing in
      balanced blocks of 12.

      10% Cocamide DEA is applied directly to dry hair and is washed off with shampoo after 60
      minutes. Permethrin 1% creme rinse is applied to shampooed and towel dried hair and left in
      situ for 10 minutes, then rinsed off with clean water. Treatments will be applied by
      experienced investigators throughout the study. Assessments will be made by other
      investigators unaware of the treatment regimen used.

      After treatment (day 0), follow up assessments will be performed on days 4, 7,10 then again
      at day 14 after which they will leave the study. Any adverse events or side effects from the
      treatments will be monitored during the study.
