      only upon symptoms recurrence (on-demand), following a loading regimen of infusions at weeks
      0, 2, and 6. Patients in the latter group were randomly assigned to receive MTX or not,
      starting 4 weeks prior to infliximab. Monitoring was performed over one year. The primary end
      point was the proportion of patients with a 20% improvement response according to the
      ASsessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) criteria, at week 54.
