    
      Primary: To compare the gastroprotective effects of a once-daily dose of PA 325 combination
      tablet combining 325 mg pH sensitive aspirin and 20 mg immediate release omeprazole versus a
      once-daily dose of 81 mg enteric coated (EC) aspirin utilizing Lanza scores from endoscopy
      findings in normal healthy volunteers.

      Secondary: To evaluate the safety and gastrointestinal tolerability, including ulcerogenic
      potential, and the effect on gastric pH of PA 325.
