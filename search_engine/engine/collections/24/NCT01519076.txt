      magnetically enhanced diffusion therapy. It will be conducted on a maximum of ten adult male
      or female patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and informed consent has
      been obtained. Subjects presenting in the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke and
      are eligible for tPA therapy may be considered for inclusion in the study.

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with Magnetically Enhanced
      Diffusion (MED) concurrently with tPA infusion. Perfusion will be assessed using CTA/CTP at
      2-4 hours upon completion of tPA infusion and using MRI at 24 hours upon completion of tPA
      infusion. Subjects are followed at 14 days, 30 days and 90 days post-treatment.
