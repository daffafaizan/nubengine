      the Human Subjects Protection Committee of the University of California, Los Angeles. All
      subjects will give written informed consent before the study begins. There will be two groups
      of participants (normal and overweight/obese). Each participant will consume oatmeal prepared
      with 1 cup of 2% milk served with or without 6 g of ground cinnamon in random sequence. At
      each meal consumption blood will be collected to measure postprandial glucose and insulin at
      0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes.
