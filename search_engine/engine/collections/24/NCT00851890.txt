      virus (HCV)-infected adults with 2 planned sequential evaluations, Part 1 and Part 2. The
      study evaluated the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-333
      or placebo monotherapy, followed by 26 days of ABT-333 or placebo with pegylated interferon
      a-2a (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. Review of safety and efficacy in Part
      1 of the study showed similar response rates across ABT-333 doses so Part 2 of the study was
      not performed. The study also assessed emergence of resistant HCV in conjunction with
      kinetics of viral load decay and rebound in treatment-na√Øve, HCV-infected participants.
