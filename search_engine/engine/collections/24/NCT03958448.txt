      group, one 4 mm long and 4.1 mm in diameter implant (extra-short implant) will be installed
      in each side of the posterior region of the maxilla. In the Standard group, bilateral sinus
      floor elevations will be performed. After 4 months of healing, one 10 mm long and 4.1 mm in
      diameter implant (standard implant) will be installed into each augmented sinus. In the
      frontal region, four 10 mm long implants will be installed in both groups. Clinical
      assessments and x-rays will be taken at prosthesis delivering (6-8 weeks after implant
      installation), and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
