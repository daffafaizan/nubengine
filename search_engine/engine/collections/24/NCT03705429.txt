    
      Multi-center, open-label, randomized trial of patients with low-risk, HER2+ disease, who will
      receive adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy (i.e. docetaxel and cyclophosphamide with
      trastuzumab [TC-H] or weekly paclitaxel with trastuzumab [P-H]) at the standard approved
      doses. The primary objective is to estimate the feasibility of opening a pragmatic clinical
      trial with an Integrated Consent Model Secondary objectives are: Compare adverse events/
      toxicity profile between the two different approaches (i.e. neutropenia, peripheral
      neuropathy, treatment-related hospitalizations, proportion of patients completing the
      chemotherapy component of their treatment); Estimate the cost of each chemotherapy regimen
      and potential cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of Canada's health care
      system; Evaluate the impact on activities of daily living as reflected by self-reported
      fatigue and pain using the FACT-Taxane and FACIT-Fatigue scores. In this study, the
      investigator will obtain oral consent using the prepared REB approved Consent Script. If the
      patient agrees to participate, the physician will dictate in the progress note they have had
      the above conversation with the patient. There will be no need for the patient to sign an
      informed consent form.
