      examine the effect of lateral tilting (routinely used in critical care) on the lung
      inhomogeneity that will be analyzed by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in the
      unconscious patients with acute primary brain disease and artificial pulmonary ventilation.
      Two types of lateral tilting will be compared: manual positioning of body by nurse versus the
      bed tilting (15Â° lateral tilt, original company (LINET) and product brand name (Eleganza 5).
