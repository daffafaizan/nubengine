      resource-poor countries, especially those coping with ongoing war-like conditions. There is a
      lack of intervention research in these population. The purpose of this assessment was to
      examine whether the type of psychosocial counseling developed by our group is effective in
      reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety and significantly increasing the quality of life
      of help-seeking Afghans.
