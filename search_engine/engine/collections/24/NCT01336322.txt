    
      A randomized, double blinded study, on 45 women with previous gestational diabetes and
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to assess the effects of a
      4-month treatment with metformin and/or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) on
      beta-cell function and insulin resistance.

      At baseline, all women will have a standardized medical history, physical, and laboratory
      examination. Plasma glucose, insulin, pro-insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, adipokines,
      pro-inflammatory molecules, and lipid profile will be determined in fasting condition. A 75g
      OGTT will be performed after an overnight fasting and sample will be drawn at 15, 30, 60, 90
      and 120 minutes for plasma glucose, C-peptide, glucagon and GLP-1 determinations. Women with
      IFG or IGT will be recruited and undergo to a hyperglycemic clamp with arginin bolus at the
      end of the test. Then the women will be randomized in 3 treatment groups: metformin (850 mg
      bid), sitagliptin (100 mg qd)or metformin (850 mg bid) + sitagliptin (100 mg qd). After
      4-month treatment, the baseline evaluation will be repeated.
