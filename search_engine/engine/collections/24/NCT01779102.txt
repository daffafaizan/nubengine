      investigating if concomitant injections of the diagnostic agents C-Tb and 2 T.U Tuberculin
      PPD RT 23 SSI affect the induration responses in combination with a safety assessment of
      C-Tb. TESEC-07 is a multi-centre trial and will be conducted in South Africa in patients
      recently diagnosed with TB comprising 360 HIV negative and 90 HIV positive adults allocated
      to 3 trial groups.

        -  A within group paired comparison of 0.1 Î¼g/0.1 mL C-Tb and PPD RT 23 in 150 TB patients.
           The C-Tb and PPD RT 23 agents are given concomitantly to each volunteer in the RIGHT AND
           LEFT forearms according to a randomisation scheme.

        -  A group of 150 TB patients will only receive the C-Tb agent randomised to either RIGHT
           or LEFT forearm.

        -  A group of 150 TB patients will only receive the reference agent PPD RT 23 randomised to
           either RIGHT or LEFT forearm.
