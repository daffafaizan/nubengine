      emergency medicine (EM). Visual examination of the tube (fogging), auscultation, chest x-ray,
      capnography, capnometry and fiberoptic bronchoscopy are the main tools used for confirmation
      with increasing diagnostic utilities. Recently, tracheal ultrasonography (US) was introduced
      as a reliable, cheap and readily available method of confirmation of ETT placement.
