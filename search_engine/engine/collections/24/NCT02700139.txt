      eye growth and myopia development in children with up to 11% to 21% efficacy compared to
      single vision lenses. However, the treatment effect of PALs is statistically significant but
      clinically insufficient. The current study aims at investigating the use of spectacle lenses
      with a unique novel design for myopia control in children. This prospective one-year
      randomized clinical study will evaluate axial elongation and myopia progression in eyes using
      the novel lens design compared to those using the conventional single-vision design. It is a
      double-masked, cross-over study. One eye will be fitted with the study lens and the other eye
      will be fitted with the single-vision lens. Subjects will be asked to wear the spectacles for
      6 months and the two lens designs will be swapped in the next 6 months after a wash-out
      period of 2 weeks. Both the subjects and examiners will not aware the lens design being used
      by the subjects in each phase.
