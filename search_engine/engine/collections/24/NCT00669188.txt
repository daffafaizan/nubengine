      communication. Participants will interact with a virtual patient in a virtual clinical
      setting.

      Third- or fourth-year medical students may be eligible for this study. Participants are
      recruited from the Washington, D.C. area.

      Study participants will perform one task and complete one set of questions at the study
      appointment. The task involves viewing a virtual patient s health information and interacting
      with the virtual patient in a virtual environment clinical scenario. While in the virtual
      environment, the subject wears a head-mounted video unit that allows him or her to see
      elements of the environment. The activities in the virtual environment take about 15 minutes.
      The total time for the study is about 60 minutes.
