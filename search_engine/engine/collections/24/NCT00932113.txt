      severe psoriasis. The two treatments, methotrexate and adalimumab, both show efficacy for
      psoriasis, however their profiles differ. In the CHAMPION Study, more adalimumab-treated,
      moderate to severe psoriasis patients achieved a PASI 75 after 16 weeks compared to those
      treated with methotrexate (80% vs. 36%). The reason for this difference is poorly understood.
      No direct comparative mechanism of action studies in psoriasis patients between methotrexate
      and adalimumab (or any tumor necrosis factor blocker) has been reported.

      With etanercept, another tumor necrosis factor blocker, the in vivo mechanism has been
      studied with some scientific rigor. These studies demonstrate that etanercept down regulates
      multiple pro-inflammatory pathways (as shown in Table 1 of the protocol).

      To date, there are no similar studies with adalimumab or methotrexate.

      In order to understand the molecular and cellular basis for the differential clinical
      efficacy of adalimumab and methotrexate, it is essential to compare their mechanisms of
      action in psoriatic plaques. Biopsies will be performed, and we will study biomarkers in this
      proposal with immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and gene arrays.
