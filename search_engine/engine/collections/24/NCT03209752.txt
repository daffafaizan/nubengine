      software will not be used to influence the medical decision or the manufacture of the brace.
      In parallel with conventional production, anatomical transfer will be used in the deformed
      digital model of the trunk to simulate the effect of conventional brace on the spine. This
      modeling will be used to compare the correction of the conventional brace observed on the
      spine with EOS imaging system, with that simulated by the software.

      EOS Tranfert study is a observationnal, prospective, monocentric, unrandomized and controlled
      study. This research doesn't modify care of the patient
