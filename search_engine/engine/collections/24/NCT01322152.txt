      colorectal cancer patients. However, the combination of these two drugs are not regularly
      recommended due to the severe diarrhea as the most common adverse event.This study was
      designed to explore whether the single-week regimen of irinotecan plus capecitabine improves
      efficacy and does not increase the toxicity in advanced colorectal cancer patients in China.
