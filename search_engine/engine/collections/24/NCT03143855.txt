      treatment of obesity. The study teams's preclinical research collaborators and others have
      shown that lorcaserin and other 5-HT2CR agonists have been shown to reduce drugs of abuse
      self-administration and cue reactivity in rodents including cocaine and nicotine. Recently,
      this data has been expanded to opioids. Rats trained to self-administer oxycodone showed a
      significant reduction in self-administration and oxycodone cue induced lever presses after
      lorcaserin administration.

      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 1b/2a study. 18
      subjects are planned. The following treatment regimens will be used:

      Lorcaserin will be administered at a dose of 10mg twice daily. Placebo or Comparator -
      identical placebo capsules administered at the same time as lorcaserin.
