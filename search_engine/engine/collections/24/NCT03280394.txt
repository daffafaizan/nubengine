    
      Clinical data and peripheral blood samples (20 ml in EDTA tubes and 20 ml in Cell-Free DNA
      BCT tubes) will be collected during the clinico/laboratory visits that are planned as per
      clinical routine at the time of mature B-cell tumor diagnosis, before treatment, at the time
      of interim PET/CT, at the time of end of treatment PET/CT and at the time of disease relapse.

      Clinical variables, international prognostic index, results of plasma cell free DNA
      genotyping and of PET-CT will be analyzed descriptively.

      The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and
      accuracy of the compiled results of plasma cell free DNA genotyping and interim PET-CT (for
      cHL and DLBCL), or plasma cell free DNA genotyping and baseline international prognostic
      index (for FL and MCL) in identifying patients that are progression free for >24 months after
      first line therapy will be calculated and compared with those obtained by the sole interim
      PET-CT (cHL and DLBCL) or the sole international prognostic index (FL, MCL).
