      bioengineered living allogeneic cellular vaccine (AlloStim) derived from healthy blood
      donors. The vaccine is designed to create high titers of memory immune cells that are
      specific to the foreign antigens in the living cell vaccine. Upon encounter with any type of
      virus, these memory immune cells are activated and release cytokines including an immediate
      release of IFN-Ï’. This non-specific activation causes immune conditions similar to the
      conditions that occur in healthy younger patients that leads to rapid viral clearance and
      viral-specific memory immune response to clear infection and protect against recurrence.
