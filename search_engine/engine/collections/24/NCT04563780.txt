      Although mortality from thyroid cancer has remained relatively low and stable or has steadily
      declined in these and other countries (2).

      Therefore, it is still important to identify markers for prognosis prediction and
      decision-making before radioactive iodine therapy (RIT). Various factors have been reported
      to be associated with the clinical outcome of RIT. These include preablative stimulated
      thyroglobulin (ps- Tg), tumor size, extrathyroidal invasiveness, cervical lymph node
      metastasis and TSH [3,4].

      99mTc pertechnetate is a radiopharmaceutical used for thyroid scintigraphy. The photon energy
      of 140kev is ideally suited for use with gamma camera. It has short half life of about
      6-hoursand no particulate emissions. 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy is a simple, economic
      and RIT non-interfering technique to evaluate the volume of residual thyroid tissue(RTT). The
      99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake of the thyroid bed can be used as a marker of RTT. Although
      negative uptake doesn't indicate the absence of RTT, it could suggest a small volume. On the
      other hand, positive uptake can be considered as a large volume of RTT. Several studies have
      reported that patients with negative 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake have a much higher chance of
      successful ablation[5, 6].

      We hypothesized that negative 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy is a significant predictor for
      excellent response (ER) to RIT in American Thyroid Association 2015(ATA) low- and
      intermediate risk DTC patient according to .
