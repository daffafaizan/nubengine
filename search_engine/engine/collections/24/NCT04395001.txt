      combination treatment consisting of duloxetine and web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) optimize treatment outcomes? (2) Would adherence-focused guidance delivered by nurse
      clinician using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques enhance treatment effectiveness?
      This study is significant because the study team aims to optimize pain-related treatment
      outcomes at the primary care level where most patients with pain are managed. Importantly,
      the use of nurse clinician providing adherence-focused guidance (as opposed to
      content-focused guidance) on the continued practice (or use) of pain coping skills increases
      the likelihood that the study's intervention is scalable in the future. Effective, accessible
      and scalable psychoeducational treatments are needed to manage CMP in real world clinic
      settings.
