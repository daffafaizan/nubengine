    
      This study will include the following phases: Screening Phase, Run-In Phase, Double-Blind
      Treatment Phase and Open-Label Treatment Phase.

      Screening: Eligibility of subjects will be evaluated following informed consent signature.
      Screening procedures/evaluations (physical exam, concomitant medications, clinical laboratory
      tests) and confirmation of eligibility following Rome III Diagnostic questionnaire will be
      performed.

      Run-In: Subjects will enter a 2-week Run-In Phase during which IBS Symptoms and Stool
      Characteristics will be recorded. At the end of the Run-In Phase, data collected over the
      last week will be reviewed. Upon confirmation of IBS-D severity status, subjects may be
      randomized.

      Double-Blind Treatment: Subjects will take study medication (either LACTEOL® 340 mg or
      Placebo) for 28 days. During this time, IBS Symptoms and Stool Characteristics and global
      assessment of relief will be recorded, and clinical laboratory tests will be performed. HAD
      score will be assessed at the end of the double blind treatment.

      Open-Label Treatment: All study completers will be eligible for a second 28 day Open-Label
      Treatment in the event that IBS-D symptoms remain or recur within the month following the end
      of Double-Blind Treatment. Subjects will take the study medication (LACTEOL® 340 mg) for 28
      days. During this time, IBS Symptoms and Stool Characteristics and global assessment of
      relief will be recorded, and clinical laboratory tests will be performed.
