      isolation (PVI) for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), an arrhythmia-free surveillance has
      not raised beyond 80%. This prospective, randomized study investigates the efficacy of two
      different procedural endpoints in terms of single-procedure arrhythmia-free outcome.

      A total number of 152 patients undergoing de-novo catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF will be
      randomized to two different treatment arms. In group-A patients, PVI will be performed with
      the patient either in spontaneous or induced AF. If AF will not terminate with PVI, ablation
      will be continued by targeting extra-PV AF sources with the desired endpoint of termination
      to sinus rhythm (SR). The ablation procedure in group-B patients consists of PVI exclusively,
      regardless to the underlying rhythm. In this group, all isolated PVs will be challenged to
      adenosine administration in the attempt to reveal and ablate dormant conduction. The primary
      endpoint is arrhythmia-free survival during a follow-up of 1 year.
