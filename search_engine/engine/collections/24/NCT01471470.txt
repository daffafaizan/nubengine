      chemotherapy, patients with unresectable gastric cancer because of invasion to adjacent
      organs or metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes received benefit from neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. Based on these results and reports that bevacizumab enhances response rate, we
      planned docetaxel, capecitabine, cisplatin, and bevacizumab as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for
      patients with local invasion or para-aortic node metastasis alone.
