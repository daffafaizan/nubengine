    
      Endometriosis is a common disease with endometriotic lesions being found in the ovaries,
      peritoneum, or as deep endometriosis (DE) involving different pelvic organs and structures.
      In order to describe DE lesions, the Enzian classification was developed. In the last
      revision of this Enzian classification, the so-called #Enzian, presence and severity grades
      of ovarian and peritoneal endometriosis as well as adhesions involving tubes and ovaries are
      also described in addition to DE lesions.

      The Enzian classification is determined intraoperatively by the surgeon. Transvaginal
      ultrasound (TVS) examination is considered to be the first-line imaging technique for this
      disease. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the assessment of presence and
      severity grade of endometriotic lesions in different #Enzian compartments by a preoperative
      ultrasound examination (in the form of an US-#Enzian classification) to the definitive
      intraoperative Enzian classification (OP-#Enzian) using the latest revision of the Enzian
      classification (#Enzian).
