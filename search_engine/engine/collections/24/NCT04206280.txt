    
      This is a randomized controlled prospective study looking at the effect of using a pedometer
      with graduated step-count goals following radical prostatectomy on return of bowel function
      and post-operative narcotic use. Subjects will be randomized into a control group or study
      group. The control group will receive standard of care, with information provided regarding
      the importance of ambulation following surgery. The study group will receive a pedometer with
      graduated step-count goals from post-operative day 0 to post-operative day 14. Both groups
      will be given a standardized post-operative narcotic regimen, and will be asked to record
      initial passage of flatus and first bowel movement. Subjects will remain on the study until
      initial post-operative visit.
