      participate in this study. Upon consent, a blood sample will be obtained in 2 EDTA containing
      lavender topped tubes before, during or within 3 months after their IVF cycle. Genomic DNA
      will be extracted and saved for genotyping.

      The Investigators will collect data on each individual's age, ethnic background, and
      estradiol levels on the day of hCG administration, total gonadotropin amount, clinical
      pregnancy rates, basal FSH levels, and occurrence of OHSS. The Investigators will then
      analyze all samples from all patients for their FSH receptor genotypes.

      Patients will be compensated $75 via a check within 6-8 weeks of their blood drawn.
