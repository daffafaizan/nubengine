    
      PDE Max is a newly-developed product designed specifically to meet the nutritional
      requirements of patients following a lysine-restricted diet for PDE.

      This is a feasibility study to evaluate PDE MAX, a food for special medical purposes (FSMP)
      for use in the dietary management of Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy (PDE) with regards to
      acceptability, tolerability, adherence and effect on metabolic control.

      Participants will be given an eight-week supply of PDE MAX and they will be asked to complete
      a daily diary and short questionnaire to record information on: adherence, gastrointestinal
      tolerance, palatability and how the product is used.

      Blood and urine samples will be taken at the beginning and end of the study to measure
      several biochemical parameters.

      Physical and neurological assessments will be carried out by the local Metabolic Consultant
      at the beginning and end of the study.

      Routine monitoring of lysine levels will continue.
