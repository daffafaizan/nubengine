      from observational studies and small randomised trials suggests that reports of dreaming are
      more commonly made after anaesthesia maintained with propofol than anaesthesia maintained
      with inhaled anaesthetic agents. We propose to randomise 300 healthy patients to receive a
      standardised general anaesthetic for surgery that includes either propofol or desflurane for
      maintenance. We will measure the raw and processed electroencephalogram during and after
      anaesthesia and interview patients about dreaming as soon as they emerge from anaesthesia.
