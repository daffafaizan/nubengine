      during cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR). However, ETI during CPR requires high skill and
      experience. Therefore ETI during CPR should be performed by expert in ETI. But the definition
      of experts in ETI during CPR has not been done yet.

      This study tried to estimate the appropriate number of ETI experience for successful ETI at
      first attempt during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. So the investigators analyze the success
      rate, speed, trial number, incidence of complications, and hands-off time of ETI using direct
      laryngoscopy (DL) which is standard device, in real clinical setting. In addition, this study
      analyze the residency training term, total number of ETI experience using DL at that time.
