      screened positive for at least 1 SNAP factor and undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before
      radical cystectomy.

      Patients allocated to the intervention group will receive five counselling sessions in 6
      weeks including an integrated prehabilitation program covering the time period until surgery
      tailored to meet the individual patient's need for risk reduction. Patients are ensured that
      they are free to access support to lifestyle changes in the community.
