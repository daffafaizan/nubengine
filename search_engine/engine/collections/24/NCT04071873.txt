      Specific Aim 1:

      Tailor a point of care HIV testing intervention for delivery in northwestern Tanzania, using
      data from 1) qualitative interviews and 2) community engagement strategies. Interviews with
      traditional healers, traditional and biomedical clients, and HIV clinic staff will illustrate
      local variables impacting HIV testing engagement. A community advisory board with stakeholder
      members will guide program implementation, tailoring protocols to maximize uptake.

      Specific Aim 2:

      Conduct a cluster-randomized pilot of the HIV testing intervention. This pilot will offer HIV
      testing at five traditional healer practice sites, compared with a control group of five
      healers providing education on community HIV resources..
