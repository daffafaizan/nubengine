      registry; a collection of patient information and medical data, over time, about people who
      have a particular disease or condition, or who receive a particular treatment.

      The LLS National Research Registry Protocol will:

        1. Answer research questions using data collected from people with blood cancers. Such
           research involves analyses of subject profile information completed by subjects and
           medical records data.

        2. Obtain permission from LLS National Research Registry research subjects to have
           Ciitizen, a third-party engaged by LLS, act as their proxy to retrieve full medical
           record data including images at no cost to research subjects. Note: Patient can choose
           to upload their medical records into their account, directly.

        3. Obtain permission from LLS National Research Registry research subjects to share summary
           data with research partners (like academic researchers, advocacy groups, and
           pharmaceutical companies) that are advancing treatments for blood cancer. "Summary data"
           represents the important elements of medical record data, coded for research use, with
           personal identifiers like name, address, and phone number removed.

        4. Obtain permission from LLS National Research Registry research subjects to be contacted
           from time to time, for them to provide updated medical information.
