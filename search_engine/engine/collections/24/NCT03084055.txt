      experiencing depressive symptoms (>10 on the PHQ-8) over the age of 18 will be recruited from
      the community. Participants will be eligible to participate if the over 18, score over 10 on
      the PHQ-8 and, are able to walk unaided for at least 5 minutes and have access to the
      internet. Following baseline measures, participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the
      intervention or waiting list control arm and be followed up at 2 and 5 months. Those
      randomised to the intervention arm will receive eMotion which is comprised of a series of
      weekly audio visual modules designed to increase exposure to positive activities and physical
      activity. Main outcomes of interest include recruitment, retention, fidelity and
      acceptability. Baseline and follow up measures will also include the PHQ-8, and objective
      (GENEActvie accelerometers) and subjective (IPAQ) measures of physical activity. A parallel
      process evaluation will run alongside the RCT.

      If effective, this intervention has the potential to improve depressive symptoms in a wide
      range of hard to reach people in the community and increase their physical activity. Further
      evaluation in a full scale RCT is planned pending results of this trial.
