    
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, objective performance criteria design. Patients are
      clinically symptomatic patients with chronic moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) organic
      mitral regurgitation (DMR) who were assessed as high risk for surgical procedures by the
      cardiac team at the local clinical trial site. After signing an informed consent form,
      subjects are enrolled and treated with the DragonFly Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair
      System. All subjects receive clinical follow-up immediately after the procedure, before
      discharge, and 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after the procedure.

      Treatment success at 12 months is used as the primary endpoint, with the definition as
      freedom from death, valve dysfunction surgery, and moderately severe or severe mitral
      regurgitation (MR >2+) at 12 months.

      The secondary endpoints include acute procedural success, acute device success, and surgery
      for valve dysfunction, NYHA class I or II at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months, and the
      improvement in the quality of life change from baseline as assessed by the Kansas City
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score at 12 months after the procedure. The safety
      endpoints include major adverse events (MAEs), all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality at
      30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after the procedure.

      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Valgen Medtech DragonFly Transcatheter Mitral
      Valve Repair System in the treatment of patients with clinically significant chronic moderate
      (3+) or severe (4+) degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) who have been evaluated by the
      local heart team as being at high surgical risk, and to evaluate the product performance.
