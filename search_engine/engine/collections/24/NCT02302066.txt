      was administered in 3 different dosing schedules to participants aged from 2 to 17 years
      resident in dengue endemic countries. This study looked at the titers of antibodies to dengue
      fever elicited in people who received TDV.

      The study randomized 1800 healthy participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of
      the four treatment groups in a 1:2:5:1 ratio-which remained undisclosed to the participant
      and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Group 1 - TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection Days 1 and 91

        -  Group 2 - TDV 0.5 mL SC injection Day 1

        -  Group 3 - TDV 0.5 mL SC injection Days 1 and 365

        -  Group 4 - Placebo (dummy SC) - this is a liquid that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      A total of 600 participants were planned to be randomly included in immunogenicity analyses
      (approximately 100 participants planned in each of Group 1 and Group 4, and 200 participants
      planned in each of Group 2 and Group 3).

      In order to keep the treatment arms undisclosed to the participant and the doctor,
      participants received a placebo injection at any study visit where TDV was not being
      administered (Days 1 and/or 91 and/or 365).

      Participants were asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the
      injection site in a diary card for 28 days after each vaccination.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Asia and Latin America. Participants were followed
      for 48 months with 10 protocol-scheduled visits for participants included in the planned
      immunogenicity subset of approximately 600 subjects and 7 protocol-scheduled visits for
      subjects not included in the immunogenicity subset.
