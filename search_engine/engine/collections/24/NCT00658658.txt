      will be administered by intravenous infusion to 4-6 patients per cohort. Three planned
      cohorts, stratified by age, will be studied at 100% of the recommended panitumumab dose for
      each treatment schedule as defined in adults. Enrollment will start with a 2.5 mg/kg once
      weekly administration to the 12 to < 18 year old patients. Upon demonstration of sufficient
      safety additional cohorts will open; a 2.5 mg/kg once weekly administration to the 1 to < 12
      year old patients and a 6.0 mg/kg once every two weeks to the 12 to < 18 year old patients.
      The decision to advance to the next cohort will be based on observance of â‰¤ 33% incidence of
      a dose limiting toxicity during the evaluation period. Subsequent cohorts of 6.0 mg/kg once
      every two weeks to the 1 to < 12 year old patients and 9.0 mg/kg once every three weeks to
      both age groups will open once sufficient safety in each cohort is determined. Participants
      may stay on study treatment until disease progression.
