      beneficial effect on the elaboration of memories. Indeed, narrating is a way to order
      thoughts and moods, which are connected to particular episodes of one's life, in order to
      rework and relive them. Since the diagnosis, a relationship and an open and sincere dialogue
      between the various parts of the pediatric triangle can promote a process of adaptation to
      the experience of illness and an integrated biopsychosocial healing. The first aim of this
      study is to explore and analyze autobiographical memories of pediatric patients, parents and
      healthcare staff. Also, it aims to investigate possible common and discordant element between
