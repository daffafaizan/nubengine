      chronic recurrent hypoglycemia in congenital HI, the most common cause of persistent
      hypoglycemia in children. RZ358 is a human mAb that allosterically attenuates excessive
      insulin action on target cells. Therefore, RZ358 is ideally suited as a potential therapy for
      hyperinsulinism, and it is being developed to treat the hypoglycemia associated with diseases
      such as congenital HI. This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label clinical study designed to
      assess the safety and efficacy of four progressively higher doses of RZ358 in separate groups
      of patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to Congenital HI, not adequately
      controlled with or without current standard of care. A screening period of up to 4 weeks will
      evaluate eligibility. Once enrolled, RZ358 will be administered weekly for the first month
      and then bi-weekly for the second month for a total treatment period of 8 weeks and a
      post-treatment follow-up period of 15 weeks.
