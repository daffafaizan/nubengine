    
      Recruit 45 patients with TMD determined by questionnaire. Measure pre and post mandibular
      active range of motion and VAS pain scale. Treatment will include 4 visits over a two week
      span measuring before first treatment and after last treatment. There will be 3 treatment
      groups; active release technique, post isometric relaxation and a no treatment control group.
      We will analyze data for any change in mandibular range of motion and VAS pain scale.
