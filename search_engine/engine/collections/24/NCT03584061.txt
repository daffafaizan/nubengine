      caused by reactivation of a latent VZV-infection in the sensory ganglia.

      Clinically the condition is characterized by a painful, unilateral, vesicular rash. Pain is
      the most prominent symptom in around 90% of patients. In 10% of patients this pain remains
      and becomes chronic.

      Post-herpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain syndrome that occurs after the dermal
      manifestations disappears.

      Treatment is complex and mainly topical or systemic. For many patients this is not sufficient
      and they live with constant pain.

      Fat grafting has shown promise in treating several different painful conditions such as post
      mastectomy pain syndrome, painful scars etc.

      This study investigates is PHN can be treated by fat grafting.
