      (MPA), acts as an immune suppressant by inhibiting de novo guanosine synthesis. CellCept is
      FDA approved to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. It is well tolerated, orally dosed,
      and has some known antitumor effects. It has never been studied in pancreatic cancer and the
      maximum tolerated dose is not known. In vitro studies in our lab with human pancreatic cancer
      lines found that MPA was a potent inhibitor of pancreatic cancer cell growth and induced
      apoptosis. The objectives of this study are to identify the maximum tolerated dose of
      CellCept in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that have failed at least two prior
      chemotherapy regimens and assess its pharmacokinetics.
