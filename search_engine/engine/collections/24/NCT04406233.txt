      will be assessed upon admission, medical discharge and 180 days after medical discharge. The
      time until medical discharge and any medical complications will be recorded. Throughout the
      hospitalization period, the mortality rate will also be assessed. One hundred and eighty days
      after medical discharge, the number of hospital readmissions, mortality rate and the use of
      public health services will be evaluated, to estimate the cost of each patient to the health
      service. Patients will be stratified according to muscle mass and strength assessed at
      admission. Data will be analysed using a mixed model with repeated measures assuming group
      (percentiles) and time (admission, medical discharge, and 180 days after medical discharge)
      for each dependent variable. In the event of a significant F-value, Tukey-Kramer post hoc
      adjustments will be used for multiple purposes. Survival rate will be examined using the
      Kaplan-Meier curve and analyzed using the Log-rank test (Mantel-Cox). The level of
      significance will be set apriori at Pâ‰¤0.05.
