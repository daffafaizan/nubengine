      and may result in thrombus formation in the left atrium and thromboembolic events, such as
      stroke. Ablation to eliminate the causes of this arrhythmia is increasingly performed since
      pharmacological therapy is suboptimal. Ablation currently targets triggers, by ablating left
      atrial areas outside the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein isolation, PVI) in subjects with
      symptomatic AF who have failed drugs. Unfortunately, this has mixed success with the best
      outcomes being 50-70% freedom from AF at 1 year post ablation.

      A major issue with AF therapy is the lack of knowledge about critical regions of the heart
      that cause and sustain AF. A recent trial (STAR-AF2) showed that ablating regions empirically
      - i.e. without defining their role in AF(lines or fractionated electrograms) - did not
      improve patient outcomes compared to PVI alone (Verma et al, NEJM 2015). However, this leaves
      us with PVI that had a 50% success rate in that trial and in several other trials even for
      paroxysmal AF.

      We hypothesize that guiding ablation to critical arrhythmia-targeting zones will improve
      success over PVI alone. Specifically, we hypothesize that computational mapping of AF will
      find small regions called rotors and focal sources and ablate them, called Focal Impulse and
      Rotor Modulation (FIRM) ablation, shows promise at eliminating AF substrates. In many single
      center trials, FIRM improves results from PVI alone. This will be among the first randomized
      comparisons of FIRM ablation compared to PVI alone, and addresses an important question in
      the field.
