    
      First-line venetoclax and CD20 antibody containing regimens that are currently being tested
      are based on either a fixed duration schedule or on an MRD-based time-limited schedule. The
      assumption of these regimens is that, aside from the deep (often uMRD) and often longstanding
      remissions, relapsed disease can be retreated with a venetoclax-based regimen. This, however,
      has not been formally proven.

      In this study, patients who received a first line regimen with either venetoclax and
      rituximab (GAIA/CLL13/HOVON 140 trial, [NCT02950051] ) or venetoclax and the second
      generation anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab (GAIA/CLL13/HOVON 140 trial, and the HOVON139
      trial [Netherlands Trial Registry ID number #NTR6043]) and have relapsed with the need for a
      subsequent treatment are eligible to enter the study and to receive a combination of
      venetoclax with the highly selective BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib. Combination of venetoclax
      with acalabrutinib is expected to lead to uMRD, making discontinuation of therapy possible.
