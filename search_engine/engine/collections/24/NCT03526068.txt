      resistant pathogens, it is clear that a new means of countering the infectious threat is
      needed - even the US, EU, and Korean hospitals with the latest facilities has failed to stop
      the spread of these pathogens inside their wards.

      This novel "Harmless UV Light," operating within the "Safe Zone Wave Length," will be a
      disruptive technology to counter the growing threats of infectious diseases, such as
      multi-drug-resistant bacteria and also viruses such as Ebola, MERS and new type Influenza. It
      will be a disruptive device in that it aims to be applied to fast, effective and labor-free
      disinfection of living environments, such as hospital wards, airports, and other public
      spaces to stop the spread of pathogens. This research is the first human clinical trial using
      this device that will spearhead the development of this technology, providing the key
      starting clinical data which would be the lead to development for a wider range of
      indications and markets. Successful proof of concept will lead to the next stage
      collaboration of larger scale clinical trials, and trials targeting wider range of
      indications and markets, at NUHS.
