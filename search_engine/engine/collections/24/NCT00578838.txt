      chemotherapy regimen, one after 6 weeks of chemotherapy, a third after completion of
      chemotherapy (between 12 and 24 weeks post-initiation of chemotherapy) and a long term
      followup study at least 4 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Normal volunteers will
      be recruited and studied by MR for comparison to patient data.
