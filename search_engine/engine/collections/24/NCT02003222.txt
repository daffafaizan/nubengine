    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the overall survival (OS) of blinatumomab in conjunction with chemotherapy to
      chemotherapy alone in patients with BCR-ABL-negative B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) who are minimal residual disease (MRD) negative after induction and
      intensification chemotherapy, based on multiparameter flow cytometric (MFC) assessment of
      residual blasts.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the relapse-free survival (RFS) of blinatumomab in conjunction with
      chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in MRD negative patients after induction and
      intensification chemotherapy.

      II. To compare the OS and RFS of those patients who are MRD positive (+) at step 3
      randomization/registration and then convert to MRD negative (-) after 2 cycles of
      blinatumomab or consolidation chemotherapy.

      III. To assess the toxicities of blinatumomab in this patient population. IV. To assess the
      toxicities of the modified E2993 chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.

      V. To describe the outcome of patients who proceed to allogeneic blood or marrow transplant
      after treatment with or without blinatumomab.

      LABORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine differences in MRD kinetics among patients with the BCR/ABL1-like B-lineage
      ALL, and to compare the OS (and RFS) of patients with BCR-ABL-like phenotype with those
      without BCR-ABL-like phenotype.

      II. To evaluate the incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; daunorubicin
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; vincristine
      sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) daily on days 1-7 (and 15-21
      for patients age < 55 years only); methotrexate IT on day 14; pegaspargase intramuscularly
      (IM) or IV on day 18 (patients age < 55 years); and CD20 positive patients may optionally
      receive rituximab IV on day 8 and 15. Beginning on day 29, patients with absolute neutrophil
      count (ANC) >= 0.75 x 10^9/L and platelets > 75 x 10^9/L (patients with delayed hematologic
      recovery) (patients with residual disease that is delaying count begin treatment immediately)
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 29, cytarabine IV over 30 minutes
      or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, and 36-39, mercaptopurine PO on days 1-14,
      29-42, pegaspargase IM or IV on day 15 (patients age < 55 years), patients receiving
      treatment for central nervous system (CNS) 2 or 3 leukemia in cycle 1 receive methotrexate IT
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and CD20 positive patients may optionally receive rituximab IV on
      days 8 and 15.

      INTENSIFICATION THERAPY: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of cycle 2 of induction
      therapy, patients receive intensification therapy comprising high-dose methotrexate IV over 2
      hours on days 1 and 8, and pegaspargase IM or IV on day 9.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Patients randomized to the blinatumomab group receive blinatumomab IV continuously on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) or
      proceed to consolidation therapy per investigator discretion.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning after the second cycle of blinatumomab (patients randomized
      to the blinatumomab group) or after intensification therapy (patients not randomized to
      blinatumomab), patients receive cytarabine IV over 30 minutes or SC on days 1-5, etoposide IV
      over 1 hour on days 1-5, methotrexate IT on day 1, and pegaspargase IM or IV on day 5, and
      CD20 positive patients may optionally receive rituximab IV on day 5. Beginning 4 weeks from
      day 1 of cycle 1, patients receive cytarabine, etoposide, methotrexate, and CD20 positive
      patients may receive rituximab as in cycle 1. Beginning 4 weeks from day 1 of cycle 2,
      patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10-15 minutes on day 1, 8, 15, and 22;
      vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone PO daily on days 1-7 (and
      15-21 for patients age < 55 years); methotrexate IT on day 2; cyclophosphamide IV over 30
      minutes on day 29; cytarabine IV over 30 minutes or SC on days 30-33 and 37-40;
      mercaptopurine PO on days 29-42 and CD20 positive patients may receive rituximab on day 8.
      Beginning 8 weeks from day 1 of cycle 3, patients receive cytarabine, etoposide,
      methotrexate, and CD20 positive patients may optionally receive rituximab as in cycle 1.
      Patients randomized to blinatumomab repeat cycle 4 and then receive blinatumomab IV
      continuously on days 1-28.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Within 6 weeks after beginning last cycle of consolidation therapy,
      patients receive mercaptopurine PO daily, methotrexate PO or IV over 2 hours once weekly for
      2.5 years, vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 every 3 months, prednisone PO on days 1-5 every 3
      months, and methotrexate IT on day 1 every 3 months. Treatment continues for up to 2.5 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 5 years.
