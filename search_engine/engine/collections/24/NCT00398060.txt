      prevent type 2 diabetes was set to examine and enhance the effectiveness of life-style change
      counselling in the primary health care. In the intervention, specific nutritional, physical
      activity and weight loss objectives shown effective in diabetes prevention in an earlier
      randomised controlled trial are used as a benchmark, embedded in a structured group
      counselling model with an empowerment-oriented approach and adapted into the primary health
      care setting. In the trial, effectiveness and process are evaluated, the analyses including
      gender and socio-economic differences. Participants were 361 middle-aged (50-65 yrs) adults
      at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, recruited in 16 primary health care centres in
      Paijat-Hame, Finland. Intervention and data collection took place in year 2003.
