      I. To complete a randomized pilot trial of a cognitive-behavioral anxiety-insomnia
      intervention to determine the impact of this intervention on patient worry, intolerance of
      uncertainty, and sleep efficiency.

      II. Explore the underlying endocrine and immune mechanisms responsible for a specific symptom
      cluster (anxiety-insomnia-depression-pain-fatigue) observed among advanced cancer patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients wear a wrist actigraph, collect saliva samples, and complete a sleep diary
      and worry record daily in weeks 1 and 5. Patients also receive education on the components of
      anxiety (physical cognitive, and behavioral) and practice relaxation techniques and
      behavioral sleep strategies in weeks 2-5. Blood draw is optional.

      ARM II: Patients wear a wrist actigraph, collect saliva samples, and complete a sleep diary
      and worry record daily in weeks 1 and 5. Blood draw is also optional. This is a wait-list
      control arm, so patients in this arm, after a six-week period of treatment as usual with
      their oncologist, then receive the intervention.
