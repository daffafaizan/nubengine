      were tested to detect the Levator Veli Palatini (mLVP) and the tensor Veli Palatini (mTVP)
      electromyographic (EMG) activities corresponding to eustachian tube (ET) opening at rest. The
      subjects were mixed some with and some without ET dysfunction (ETD). Tests were conducted at
      an audiology unit at a tertiary care center located near at sea level, constant atmospheric
      pressure and temperature. Subjects are to be selected randomly with and without eustachian
      tube dysfunction (ETD) by using a questionnaire and evaluated with tympanometry and tympanic
      air exchange testing of the external ear canal for testing the ET openings. Monopolar and
      reference needle electrodes for each muscle were inserted transpalatally on the test side
      without topical anesthetics. Tympanic air exchange test is done by placing a pressure sensor
      into the external ear canal of the patient as well as a nasal pressure sensor for detecting
      ET openings during EMG recording. Information received from ear pressure and nasal pressure
      sensor of tympanic air exchange sensor (TAS) equipment was used for assessing the swallowing
      efficacy of the healthy subjects. Simultaneous correspondent recordings of the ET openings
      during the test as well as the electromyographic activity for the mLVP, mTVP were recorded.
