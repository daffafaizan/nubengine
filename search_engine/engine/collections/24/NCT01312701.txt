    
      CD247 Known also as the zeta chain is important for relaying T-cell induced signal
      transduction.

      Interestingly studies by Baniash and others have demonstrated that this chain is down
      regulated in states of chronic inflammation and cancer in peripheral blood T cells and also
      in NK cells However there has not been a prospective study of this marker in cancer and
      control patients such a study will reveal not only the levels of CD247 in immune cells of
      cancer patients compared to controls but may reveal the effect of anticancer therapies on
      CD247 in cancer patients such a study may contribute significantly to our ability to monitor
      systemic immune system characteristics in cancer patients and help in any further studies of
      immunomodulation such as vaccination schemes in such patients
