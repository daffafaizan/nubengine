    
      To assess the following: 1) if these differences are driven purely by recurrent hypoglycemia
      or by other closely linked factors (e.g. glycemic variability); 2) the molecular and
      metabolic mechanisms by which unawareness leads to the suppression of central nervous system
      (CNS) activity in the context of hypoglycemia; and 3) whether hypoglycemia avoidance using
      continuous glucose monitor restores central nervous system (CNS) activation and metabolism
      toward normal levels and offers a therapeutic approach to more effectively combat
      neurocognitive dysfunction associated with intensive treatment of T1DM patients.
