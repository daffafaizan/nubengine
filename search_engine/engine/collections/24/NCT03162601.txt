      neurovascular conditions with the goal to compare the image quality of new types of head
      C-arm computed tomography (CACT) image scans with standard CACT scans, and also to compare
      these novel scans with standard CT scan image quality. These new scans use novel acquisition,
      filtration and reconstruction techniques compared to the standard-of-care CACT scans being
      used in the neuroangiography suite at the present time. Patient selection will be based on a
      suitability of patients for neuro-endovascular interventions in the neuroangiography suite.
      All research related activities will be done by study team members. The study patients are
      expected to follow their routine treatment schedule with the exception of 1 extra CACT scan
      while patient is receiving their standard treatment.
