    
      Patients with a diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis are referred to the 5-day exercise and
      education programme by consultant rheumatologists at the Mater Misericordiae University
      Hospital. All patients referred to the programmes beginning 06/24/2008 and 08/25/2008 will be
      invited to participate.

      Participants scoring 0-6 on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index are classified as
      low disease severity level and are allocated to Group 1; participants with a score of 6.1-10
      are classified as higher disease severity and allocated to Group 2. Group 1 has two
      hydrotherapy classes, a gym-based exercise class and an education session daily. Group 2 has
      one hydrotherapy class, a gym-based exercise class and an education session daily. Exercise
      sessions are 1 hour in duration and are given by staff physiotherapists. Education sessions
      are 1 hour in duration and are given by senior members of the rheumatology multi-disciplinary
      team at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.

      Outcome will be assessed upon entry to the study (pre-intervention), at 5 days
      (post-intervention) and at 4 weeks (follow-up). A semi structured interview will be carried
      out with each participant immediately post-intervention to explore the overall value of the
      group programme for participants.
