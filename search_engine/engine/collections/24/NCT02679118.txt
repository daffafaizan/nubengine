      the injury is not detected and treated at the time of the surgical procedure, the patient can
      suffer sever complications including septic shock and eventually death. Our goal is to test a
      novel device that can detect bowel gas leakage from a perforation and alert the surgeon
      during the operation by evaluating the gases present in the insufflated abdomen during
      surgery. During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide in inserted in the abdominal cavity in
      order to perform the operation. This is dynamic process as insufflation is a constant during
      the entire procedure to maintain a constant pressure and compensate small leaks due to the
      insertion and retrieval of instruments.

      This study will determine the ability of device to be attached to a standard Veress needle or
      trocar during the operation and periodically draw a small amount of gas from the abdomen to
      evaluate the gas and accurately detect gaseous content from the bowel. Before the device can
      be used to detect bowel perforations, first we must ensure that it can accurately detect
      bowel gas in an insufflated abdomen.
