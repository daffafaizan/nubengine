      system, and the major cause of disability in the youngsters all over the world, still with no
      definitely known etiology and treatment. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by pineal gland
      famous for its role in circadian rhythm regulation, and with known antioxidant effects. It
      was shown that melatonin is lower in multiple sclerosis patients in the relapse phase in
      comparison to other diseases and is correlated with the Multiple Sclerosis Functional
      Composite score of the patients. Melatonin is also suggested to have an immunomodulatory
      role. Therefore, we hypothesize that melatonin can be effective in the treatment of
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.
