      placebo following catheter ablation of AF on the burden of AF during 12 months of follow-up.
      This prospective, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial aims to enroll 100
      subjects with AF (paroxysmal or persistent) who are scheduled to undergo catheter ablation of
      patients. All enrolled subjects will be required to have a cardiac implantable electronic
      device (CIED) capable of assessing the burden of AF. Following catheter ablation for AF and
      functional CIED subjects will be randomized to treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily
      versus placebo. The primary endpoint for the trial will be AF burden assessed at 12 months
      following catheter ablation of AF. We expect that each participating site will enroll a 12-14
      patients during a 24-month period. The Investigational Drug Services at the University of
      Rochester will be in charge of dispensing all study related drugs to subject.
