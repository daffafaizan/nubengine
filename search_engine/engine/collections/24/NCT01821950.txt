      behaviors especially substance use in normal adolescent psychological development. The
      overall goal of this proposal is to pilot test a novel, preventive intervention for
      adolescent substance use. More specifically, it will evaluate the efficacy of yoga taught
      during school to positively influence risk and protective factors of substance use and the
      initiation and severity of substance use.

      This study involves a group randomized, controlled trial of yoga compared to physical
      education-as-usual for one school year, with a 6-month and 1-year follow-up, in order to
      accomplish the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate the efficacy of a school-based yoga program for reducing
      negative internalizing behaviors (negative mood, perceived stress, impulsivity) which are
      risk factors for adolescent substance use.

      Specific Aim 2 - To evaluate the efficacy of this yoga program for promoting self-regulatory
      skills as protective factors against substance use in adolescence.

      Specific Aim 3 - To conduct a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of this yoga program for
      reducing substance use initiation and severity of use.
