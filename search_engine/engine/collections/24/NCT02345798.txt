      I. To pilot test a video-assisted intervention designed to enhance post-operative recovery by
      preparing patients and informal caregivers for lung surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe preliminary effect of the video-assisted intervention on patient-reported
      outcomes (PROs), informal caregiver-reported outcomes, and clinical/system outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their caregivers are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients and caregivers receive standard care during routine clinic visits.

      ARM II: Patients view Parts 1 and 2 of the video program, which focus on what to expect
      before surgery and after surgery in the hospital, on a tablet over approximately 8 minutes at
      a scheduled pre-operative visit. Patients then receive an educational handbook and discuss
      the video with a nurse. After surgery and before hospital discharge, patients view Part 3 of
      the video over approximately 6 minutes, which focuses on what to expect after going home.

      After completion of study, patients and caregivers are followed up at approximately 2-4 weeks
      and 2 months.
