      weight loss treatment for obesity. During the 12-week active intervention phase, participants
      will be randomized to one of two first-line treatments: 1) mobile app alone (APP) or 2) app
      plus weekly telephone coaching sessions (APP+C). Beginning at week 2, those who are
      identified as treatment non-responders (did not lose an average of 0.5 lbs/week) will be
      re-randomized to one of two augmentation tactics: 1) Modest Step-up, operationalized as the
      addition of an additional mHealth component, or 2) Vigorous Step-up, operationalized as the
      addition of an additional mHealth component plus a traditional weight loss intervention
      component. Treatment responders will continue with the same first-line treatment. Treatment
      response be re-assessed at weeks 4 and 8. Those identified as treatment non-responders will
      be re-randomized at that time.
