    
      Randomized Controlled Trial. Study population: elective laparoscopic colorectal resections
      with an Enhanced Recovery Program (ERP) Sample size: 128 patients (140 accounting for drops
      out)

      Two arms:

      GDFT: patients will receive GDFT esophageal doppler guided; SFT: patients will receive SFT
      based on standard anesthesia formula and international guidelines to calculate fluid
      requirements.

      Study Hypothesis: the incidence of primary POI will be reduced in patients receiving
      intraoperative GDFT compared to patients receiving SFT after elective laparoscopic colorectal
      surgeries with an ERP program.

      ERP: all patients will receive the same perioperative care according to the Enhanced Recovery
      After Surgery ERASÂ® program guidelines. Intravenous fluid will be stopped the first day after
      surgery. Patients will be allowed to have clear fluids the same day of surgery and diet, as
      tolerated, the first day after surgery.
