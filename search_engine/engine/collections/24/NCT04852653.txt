      standard for locally advanced carcinoma of the low and middle rectum. When good clinical
      response to NT is obtain, strategies with organ preservation, including close surveillance
      without immediate surgery or transanal local excision, can spare patients with the highly
      morbid and functional cost of TME. Current assessment of good responders relies on the
      downstaging and/or downsizing of the tumor as evaluated by MRI imaging and clinical exam.
      This strategy is prone to errors in more than 1/3 cases. Better assessment of tumor response
      to NT would better select patients eligible for organ preservation strategies. This study
      will use the detection of tumor extracellular vesicles (EVs) in liquid biopsy to identify
      good response of rectum cancer to neoadjuvant treatment. Tumor EVs will be detected in the
      blood of the patients at different times of their regular management (before, during and
      after NT). Protein content or tumor DNA in EVs will be detected after tumor DNA sequencing in
      the primary biopsies. Response will be assessed according to tumor EV presence or absence in
      the blood. As EV quantification is possible, kinetics of their detection will help response
      assessment and patient follow-up.
