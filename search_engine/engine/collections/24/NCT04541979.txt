      to that of placebo (NaCl, 0.9%) on time to cessation of oxygen therapy or discharge from
      hospital in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and respiratory dysfunction.

      Secondary objectives: To compare the treatment effect of aerosolized DNase I to that of
      placebo (NaCl, 0.9%) on 28-day mortality, days alive and without ventilator treatment, days
      alive and without high flow nasal oxygen treatment (Optiflow), length of stay in the ICU,
      days alive and outside hospital, relapse of hypoxia, days alive and without need for
      supplemental oxygen, adverse reactions.

      Exploratory objectives: To compare the treatment effect of aerosolized DNase I to that of
      placebo (NaCl, 9%) on quantification of NETs in respiratory secretions and on the incidence
      of clinical thromboembolic events.

      Study design: Phase 2 open-label randomized controlled multicentre trial. The study period is
      28 days from randomization. A long term follow-up on mortality and readmission will also be
      collected via patient medical records/registries at day 90, day 180, and day 360 after
      randomization.
