      NAC, a strong antioxidant that increases brain glutathione. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative
      of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement
      that is also available as an injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of
      acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory studies have displayed some benefits to use of NAC. It has
      the potential to reduce markers of oxidative damage, protect against cell death, and to
      increase glutathione in blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in MS
      patients. The second arm will be a waitlist control receiving standard MS care. It should be
      noted that both arms will receive standard of care treatment for MS while enrolled in the
      study.
