      from the bulbar conjunctiva, crossing the limbus, and onto the cornea. It is a common ocular
      surface disease in Malaysia.

      Pterygium can cause chronic ocular irritation, redness, tearing, visual impairment and poor
      cosmesis. Treatment of symptomatic pterygium remains surgical. Surgery should achieve low
      recurrence rate and acceptable cosmesis. Various surgical techniques had been described with
      variable success.

      In this study, we compared the efficacy of Rotational Narrow Strip Conjunctival Graft with
      the conventional full conjunctival graft in pterygium excision. Patient will be follow up for
      a year after pterygium surgery. Outcome will be recurrence rate between the two groups at one
      year. Risk analysis of certain factors that affects the recurrence rate will be discussed.
