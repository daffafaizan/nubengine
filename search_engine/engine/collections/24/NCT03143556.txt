      patient's quality of life, a newly developed ureteral stent with a small magnet at its distal
      end and a customized magnetic retrieval catheter is recently used in Europe. The product is
      Black-Star® with a retrieval device by Urotech (Achenmühle, Germany). The magnetic Blackstar
      stent is a ureteral stent with a small magnet fixed with a string at the distal loop. The
      placement of stent is similar as routinely done on a guidewire, the only difference is to
      include the magnetic piece over the guidewire. To remove the stent a customized catheter with
      a magnetic Tiemann tip is used. The catheter is inserted after urethral application of a
      standard lubricant and removed with the stent after coming in contact with the stent's
      magnet.

      The stent comes in various sizes and is currently being used in Europe. The studies have
      concluded fast and easy retrieval of stent without requirement of cystoscopy and decreased
      patient discomfort.
