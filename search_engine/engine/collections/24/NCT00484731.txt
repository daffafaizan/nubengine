    
      264 patients scheduled for an inguinal hernia repair using one of three procedures
      (Lichtenstein, Barwell and TEP = total extraperitoneal hernioplasty) are being randomly
      allocated intra-operatively into two groups. Group I patients receive a local injection of
      20ml Carbostesin® 0.25% at the end of the operation according to a standardised procedure.
      Group II patients get a 20 ml placebo (0.9% Saline) injection. We use pre-filled identically
      looking syringes for blinded injection, i.e. the patient, the surgeon and the examinator who
      performs the postoperative clinical follow-ups remain unaware of group allocation. The
      primary outcome of the study is the occurrence of developing chronic pain (defined as
      persistent pain at 3 months FU) measured by VAS and Pain Matcher® device (Cefar Medical AB,
      Lund, Sweden).

      In addition to a sample size re-evaluation three interim analyses are planned after 120, 180
      and 240 patients had finished their 3-months follow-up to allow for early study termination.
