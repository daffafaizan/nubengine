      area. Subjects undergoing thyroid surgery for thyroid disease including thyroid nodules,
      thyroid cancer and thyroid goiter with nodules will be eligible to participate. After the
      removal of the thyroid gland, optical readings will be taken from the ex vivo thyroid gland
      and these same areas will then be analyzed in the usual standard fashion. The reading will
      then be correlated with the histological results. In addition, if lymph nodes are removed as
      part of the surgery they will also be tested prior to histological standard processing. All
      specimens and data will be de-identified.
