      randomized to one intervention arm or a control arm on a class-wise level in a 1:1 ratio.
      Participants will be invited by the Department of Education in Tyrol and schools will be
      contacted directly. At the baseline examination cardiovascular risk profiles (including
      laboratory analysis; anthropometry; a standardized medical interview; and blood pressure,
      bioelectrical impedance and pulse-wave velocity measurements) are determined and results are
      communicated in an individual discussion of results.

      Afterwards, participants of both groups receive a fitness tracker to count the amount of
      their steps taken. The participants of the intervention arm will commit themselves to a
      personal goal of steps taken by means of a commitment contract. Achievement of the goal will
      be rewarded with financial incentives to fulfill the requirements of proper reward medium,
      according to the Induced Value Theory (Smith, 1976) and nudges (reminders) will be provided
      to increase motivation.

      The duration of the intervention will be 1 year; incentives are provided for 6 months, the
      remaining 6 months are the follow-up period. After 1 year a follow-up examination will be
      conducted. Economic experiments on time and risk preferences are furthermore carried out at
      baseline.

      The hypothesis is that intensified motivational strategies like the provision of commitment
      contracts and nudges are effective in increasing the number of steps taken per month compared
      to a control group.
