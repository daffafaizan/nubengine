      reconstruction nowadays. In cases with inadequate abdominal soft-tissue volume or abdominal
      midline scar, the bilateral DIEP flap is needed.However, it need two groups of recipient
      vessels. So it is unavailable in cases short of two groups of recipient vessels after
      radiotherapy. This study is aimed to solve the problems by interconnecting one of the
      branches of DIEA each side. The MDCT will be used to predict the branches and perforators of
      DIEA both sides. According to the branches of DIEAs, one branch will be anastomosed with that
      on contralateral side with only one vessel pedicle preserved on one side. We believe that the
      whole flap can be completely nourished with only one vessel pedicle by means of vessel
      interconnection.
