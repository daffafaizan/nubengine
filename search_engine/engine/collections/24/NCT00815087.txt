      chemoradiotherapy(CRT). There were some complications caused by RT, like dysphagia.

      In recent studies, functional electrical stimulation (FES) was be used in neurologically
      dysphagia patients, and there were some positive effects with these studies. Hence, we
      decided applied FES to these NPC patients with dysphagia.
