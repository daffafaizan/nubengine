      different scientific societies to consider effective measures to control the increasing
      spread of the disease. This disease is presumed to follow a virologic pattern similar to
      SARS-CoV-1 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1) . The disease spectrum includes
      asymptomatic stage and pre-symptomatic , mild infection uncomplicated, mild and severe
      pneumonia and the acute Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) constituting the point of no
      return characterized by ventilatory mechanics preserved with severe refractory hypoxemia. The
      pulmonary involvement of patients with COVID-19 causes an endothelial injury, which can be
      associated with changes in vascular permeability, manifesting as thrombotic, venous and
      arterial disease in patients with COVID-19. Alprostadil, a prostaglandin E1 analog that has a
      vasodilator mechanism, inhibitory property of platelet aggregation and inducer of
      bronchodilation, promises to prevent complications of SARS-CoV2. In addition to that
      Alprostadil has been used in other clinical trials as treatment for the acute respiratory
      distress syndrome caused by Influenza, in which it showed no harm or benefit, nonetheless the
      pathophysiology of the acute distress respiratory syndrome caused by Influenza and COVID-19
      are similar in macroscopic changes but very different in microscopic changes which is why it
      is important to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the administration of intravenous
      prostaglandin E1 analog in the reduction of mortality and complications of patients with
      COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore the investigators propose an open randomized clinical trial,
      where patients in the intensive care unit of the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá are randomized
      into two groups, where one is going to be treated with standardized treatment after the
      guidelines recommendations of the Colombian Infectology Society and the other one is going to
      receive the same standardized treatment and Alprostadil infusion for a maximum of 7 days.
      During the infusion of the Alprostadil the patient will be carefully monitored by the
      intensive care unit team. After the Infusion the patient will be followed up for 30 days in
      which the mortality and hypoxemia resolution will be monitored.
