      analgesic techniques have an impact on immunity and inflammation.

      However, none of these studies have been performed with modern techniques, much more reliable
      evaluation of immune activity, such as the assessment of monocytic degranulation by flow
      cytometry.

      It is therefore important to document immune activity using these new techniques, our
      patients, perioperative. This will be analyzed, so observational, the potential impact of
      different therapeutic interventions the patient receives.

      This study consists of evaluations, using blood tests, various immune, inflammatory and
      coagulation parameters in the perioperative settings (different substudies), without changing
      anything to what is expected.

      This will allow us to clarify the possible impact of surgery and analgesia on perioperative
      activation of these pathways.
