      concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA). Baseline
      characteristics collected included BMI and cystic fibrosis related diabetes.

      Observation Period (Day -14 to Day -8): Subjects followed their usual enteral nutrition
      regimen with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT).

      Run-in Period (Day -7 to Day -1): Subjects used Peptamen 1.5 enteral formula at their normal
      volume of administration from 500 mL to 1,000 mL per feeding with usual PERT regimen.

      Treatment Period (Day 0 to Day 90): Subjects used Impact Peptide 1.5 up to a maximum volume
      of 1,000 mL per feeding with RELiZORB for the 90 day treatment period. Blood screening
      measurements were repeated at start of treatment period (Day 0), Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90.
      PERT use with enteral feedings was prohibited. Safety and tolerability were assessed with GI
      symptom diaries and systematic assessments of adverse events and unanticipated adverse device
      effects.
