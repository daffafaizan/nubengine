      failure and cardiovascular events. It has recently been shown, that psychosocial stress is an
      additional major risk factor contributing to the increased risk of cardiac events. However,
      it is not clear, whether a structured stress-relief training of patients reduces the risk of
      micro- and macrovascular damage in type 2 diabetes.

      Comparisons: Conventional treatment of diabetes according to national guidelines is compared
      to conventional treatment plus structured stress relief management training.
