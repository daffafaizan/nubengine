      differentiate between "hard" breast cancer masses and "soft" normal tissue. Unlike strain
      elastography, shear wave elastography applies a non-compressive longitudinal acoustic
      radiation force to underlying tissues, inducing transverse shear waves. Studies in Thiel
      embalmed human cadavers have shown significant differences in Young's modulus between
      intraneural and extraneural tissue, and ready colour differentiation between tissues.

      Therefore, before clinical application, we wish to measure the repeatability and
      reproducibility of Young's modulus of intraneural and extraneural tissue in volunteers. For
      measurement, a region of interest (ROI) will be selected over the appropriate nerve and
      adjacent tissue. The ROI results will be regarded as paired data. Paired data will be
      measured over and adjacent to the interscalene C5 nerve root, infraclavicular lateral cord,
      musculocutaneous, median, femoral, saphenous and sciatic nerves.
