      extremity. Perineural interscalene catheters offer the advantage of extended pain relief up
      to 48 hours after shoulder surgery. This is a prospective, randomized trial designed to
      compare two approaches (posterior and anterolateral) to interscalene continuous nerve
      catheter placement for analgesia after open shoulder surgery (open rotator cuff repair, total
      shoulder arthroplasty or revision, hemi-arthroplasty, or proximal humerus open reduction
      internal fixation). Specifically, the objectives of this study are to compare measured pain
      scores, opioid consumption, and catheter dislodgements. We hypothesize that the anterolateral
      approach will produce lower pain scores, less opioid consumption, and fewer catheter
      dislodgements.

      All patients undergoing open shoulder surgery will be recruited and enrollment in the study
      will not deviate from the current standard of care at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.
      All nerve blocks will be placed by a regional anesthesiologist or a fellow in regional
      anesthesia. Patient medical history will be obtained and blocks will be placed per usual
      protocol. Block efficacy will be assessed by physical exam immediately after placement by the
      anesthesiologist and another member of the research team. Operative details, including
      medications given, will be recorded.

      Patient pain scores and medications given in the PACU will be recorded. Supplementary
      analgesics will be available. Pain scores, medications given, and sensory examinations will
      be recorded for 48 hours postoperatively. Data will be analyzed both at the conclusion of the
      study and at several interims before that.
