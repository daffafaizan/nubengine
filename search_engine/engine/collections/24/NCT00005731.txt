      Asthma is a serious chronic disease affecting about 12 million Americans; about 3 million are
      children. The study was part of an initiative, "Developing and Implementing at the State and
      Local Level Educational Strategies and Interventions for Controlling Asthma in Inner City and
      High Risk Populations", released in February 1993 by the National Asthma Education Program of
      the Office of Prevention, Education and Control.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A computer-assisted multimedia instructional and feedback system, "Asthma Patient/Provider
      Partnership System" (APPPS), was developed for African American and Hispanic school-age
      children that was suited for adoption and implementation in clinical and other settings based
      on the National Asthma Education Program's Expert Panel Guidelines on the Diagnosis and
      Management of Asthma. A formative evaluation of the educational intervention was conducted.
      Also, an efficacy study of the intervention in three clinical settings was conducted and the
      findings of this study were incorporated into the APPPS. Finally, a recommended dissemination
      strategy was prepared for diffusion of the system to other settings.
