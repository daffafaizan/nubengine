      measures are urgently needed to address these issues. For many women, pregnancy is a time of
      excessive weight gain and decreases in physical fitness, both of which may be followed by
      postpartum weight retention. Women who develop hypertension or diabetes mellitus during
      pregnancy are at higher risk for development of these disorders in the future. Because of the
      implications of pregnancy-related weight gain and the metabolic changes during pregnancy for
      future maternal health, interventions to maintain or improve fitness during pregnancy may
      have important downstream health effects. In addition, maternal metabolic parameters and the
      intra-uterine environment have important implications for neonatal outcomes and subsequent
      child health. This study will provide data about the effects of an intervention to increase
      vigorous physical activity during pregnancy on short-term maternal and fetal outcomes.
