      have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune system (the body's natural
      defense system against illness) from rejecting their new kidney. Most patients who undergo a
      kidney transplant must take these anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives.
      Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects,
      including kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection medications
      that work just as well, but don't damage the kidney.
