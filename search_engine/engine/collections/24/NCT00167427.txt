      (dicentrics), micronucleated lymphocytes (MN-lymph), and micronucleated reticulocytes
      (MN-RET) using peripheral blood of patients receiving radiation.

      i) document the kinetics by which radiation-induced MN-RET enter the peripheral blood stream.

      ii) benchmark the MN-RET endpoint against current gold-standard biodosimetry
      endpoints-dicentrics and MN-lymphocytes.

      iii) measure inter-individual variation in baseline and radiation-induced MN-RET frequencies.

      iv) in collaboration with several FCM-equipped laboratories, evaluate the transferability of
      the human MN-RET scoring assay.
