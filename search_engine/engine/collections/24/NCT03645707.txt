      factor leading to the nursing shortage is high turnover, particularly among critical care
      nurses due to their experiences with stressful work environments, ethical dilemmas, and high
      rates of patient morbidity and mortality. There is also a high prevalence of psychological
      disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among
      critical care nurses. Consequences of turnover and low nurse staffing include lower quality
      of care, lower patient satisfaction, increased medical errors, increased rates of health care
      associated infections, and higher 30-day mortality rates.

      Resilience is defined as "the ability to adapt to life's ever-changing landscape and recover
      quickly from the stressors and potential stressors". It is a learned psychological
      characteristic that can be used to bounce back after disruption and successfully adapt to
      stressful work experiences in a positive manner.

      uses a holistic approach that focuses on moving between stress and strategic recovery to help
