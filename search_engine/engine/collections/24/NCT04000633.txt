      cough and sore throat after extubation after surgeries requiring endotracheal intubation.

      This randomized controlled study will compare the effect of Lidocaine and placebo
      nebulization in the immediate pre operative period in order to evaluate the effectiveness in
      reducing post extubation cough and sore throat.
