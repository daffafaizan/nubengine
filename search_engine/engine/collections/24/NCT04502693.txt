      this post-marketing commitment study has been extended to demonstrate the effectiveness,
      immunogenicity and safety of GSK's investigational combined meningococcal ABCWY vaccine along
      with the rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine. Note that the rMenB+OMV and MenACWY vaccines provided to
      MenB_0_2_6, MenB_0_6 group and MenACWY group respectively at day 211 are only as part of
      standard care of treatment and to maintain blinding. These vaccination schedules are not
      considered for any endpoint evaluations.
