      birth to 6 weeks of age. HIV infected and HIV uninfected participants will be enrolled into
      two groups at Day 0. Some infants detected HIV-exposed infected outside of the hospital
      center facilities and the trial screening procedure may also be enrolled. All participants
      will receive primary vaccinations with Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine at
