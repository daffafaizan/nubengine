      Accordingly, prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer amongst men in the western world
      and worldwide. PC ranks second in cancer incidence and sixth in cancer mortality in men. The
      current standard of care for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) and disease progression is either treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone
      in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients without visceral metastases, or treatment with
      docetaxel in more symptomatic patients and in the presence of visceral metastases.

      Rothemundt et al. previously demonstrated favorable effects of metformin in a phase II trial:
      it yields objective Prostate specific antigen PSA responses and may induce disease
      stabilization and improve metabolic endpoints in patients with CRPC. Therefore addition of
      metformin to enzalutamide might have positive impact on tumor progression, on body
      composition, and insulin sensitivity.
