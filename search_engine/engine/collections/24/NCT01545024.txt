      electrocardiographic beat-to-beat intervals (C.V. R-R). Maximal change of the C,V. R-R with
      from usual breathing to deep breathing at the resting was used for the evaluation of AND.
      Less than 2.0 % of the maximal value is estimated to have a positive to AND.

      Glycemic control is estimated to measure change of HbA1c value once three months per year.
