    
      Design:

      This first-in-human, open-label study will evaluate CAP256V2LS (VRC-HIVMAB0102-00-AB) in
      healthy adults. The primary hypothesis is that subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV)
      administrations of CAP256V2LS will be safe and well-tolerated in healthy adults. A secondary
      hypothesis is that CAP256V2LS will be detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.

      Study Product:

      The CAP256V2LS broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (bNAb) targets the V1V2 region of the
      HIV-1 envelope, is human in origin, and contains two amino acid modifications within the
      C-terminus of the heavy chain constant region designed to improve antibody half-life in vivo.
      This bNAb was developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH in collaboration with The Centre for the AIDS
      Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) and is manufactured under cGMP regulations at
      the VRC Pilot Plant operated under contract by the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP),
      Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick. MD. The CAP256V2LS drug product is supplied at a
      concentration of 100 mg/mL in a sterile, aqueous, buffered solution of 6.25 mL in single-use
      10 mL glass vials. R-Gene 10 will be added as a stabilizing agent to IV doses of CAP256V2LS.
      R-Gene10 (Arginine Hydrochloride Injection, USP) for intravenous infusion contains L-Arginine
      Hydrochloride, USP in Water for Injection (equivalent to a 10% solution).

      Subjects:

      Healthy subjects, 18-60 years of age

      Study Plan:

      This open-label study will include 2 dosing regimens with CAP256V2LS administered at 5 mg/kg
      IV and 5 mg/kg SC. A single dose of the study product will be administered on Day 0 as shown
      below.
