      in early Parkinson's disease (PD) by demonstrating that when used as initial levodopa therapy
      in early PD, carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone provides significantly greater symptomatic benefit
      than immediate release carbidopa/levodopa administered at the same levodopa dosage level 100
      mg t.i.d.
