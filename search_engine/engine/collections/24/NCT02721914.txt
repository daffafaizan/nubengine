      Back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in the industrialized society.
      It is estimated to affect between 70 to 85% of the adult population over their live. The
      impact of low back pain is widespread in developed countries, and accounts the major spending
      in economic and health resources, as well as being associated with the leading causes of
      absenteeism and disability. Diagnosis, in most cases, nonspecific low back pain, the symptoms
      have no clear cause, so that the source of pain is unknown. In general, a significant
      percentage progresses to chronic back pain and is accompanied by a limitation of physical
      activity influenced by improper posture or movement patterns.

      Objectives:

      To assess the effectiveness of massage therapy and hypopressive abdominal gymnastics, and the
      combination of both therapeutic modalities, to decrease pain and lumbar disability; and
      increasing joint mobility and quality of life in patients with chronic nonspecific low back
      pain.
