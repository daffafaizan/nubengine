      saline) and 100 subjects in a treatment arm (3% sodium chloride), for a total of 200
      patients. This study will be conducted on healthy subjects with normal renal function
      undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for degenerative indications only.
      Subjects will be randomized to the treatment or placebo arm (which will be double blinded).
      Subjects in the treatment arm will begin to receive intravenous 3% sodium chloride before the
      incision is made. The solution will be given at a rate of 10 cc/hour over a period of 24
      hours. Baseline, post-operative, and delayed post-operative dysphagia surveys will be
      administered either in person or by telephone. The investigators hope to decrease the
      incidence and severity of post-operative dysphagia.
