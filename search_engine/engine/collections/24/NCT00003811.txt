      etoposide, bleomycin, and amifostine in children with newly diagnosed, high-risk malignant,
      extragonadal germ cell tumors. II. Determine whether the use of amifostine can reduce the
      hematologic and nonhematologic toxic effects of this combination chemotherapy in these
      patients when compared to similar patients treated on POG-9049/CCG-8881 with the same
      combination chemotherapy. III. Determine the response rate of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgical biopsy or resection. Patients then receive bleomycin IV
      over 10 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour, amifostine IV over 15 minutes, and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for 4 courses in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients who have no disease after 4
      courses of chemotherapy receive no further treatment. Patients who have residual disease
      undergo second-look surgery. After surgery, patients who still have active tumor receive 2
      additional courses of chemotherapy. Those patients who still have tumor after the 2
      additional courses may have a third surgery. Patients are followed every month for 6 months,
      every 2 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.39 years.
