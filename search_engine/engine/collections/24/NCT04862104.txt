      daily life, health and well-being after surgery" and delay in surgical recovery "increasing
      the number of days after surgery required to start activities aimed at maintaining daily
      life, health and well-being after surgery". Problems such as fatigue, pain, incisional
      surgical site infection, loss of appetite, which are common in patients in the postoperative
      period, are symptoms associated with delayed surgical recovery. In addition to these
      symptoms, the presence of conditions such as delayed return to home / work activities need
      for self-care, nausea, anorexia, pain, and difficulty in moving indicate that surgical
      recovery is interrupted. It has been reported that delay in surgical recovery is common after
      surgeries such as gastrostomy, colectomy, and exploratory laparotomy.

      Patients who have undergone gastric or colorectal cancer surgery should receive discharge
      training before returning to social life and business life. Nurses should determine the
      problems they may experience at home in patients who have undergone surgeries such as
      gastrostomy, colectomy, and exploratory laparotomy, where delay in surgical recovery is
      frequently reported, plan and apply discharge training for these problems, and monitor
      patients in terms of surgical recovery processes at home. It has been reported that this way,
      the surgical recovery process can be supported and delays in surgical recovery can be
      prevented.

      This study was conducted to determine the effect of a discharge training developed using the
      Nursing Interventions Classification on surgical recovery in patients undergoing oncologic
      surgery.

      It was tested the hypotheses that there was no difference between the post-intervention
      intervention and control groups in terms of the surgical recovery score averages in patients
      who had undergone oncologic surgery were tested.
