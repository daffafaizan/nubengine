      requires creating a whole new social network. There is something that can help migrants to do
      it-their beliefs. Social self-efficacy is confidence in ability to engage in social
      interactional tasks necessary to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. These
      beliefs are positively related to social adjustment and negatively related to acculturative
      stress, depression, and loneliness. Therefore, social self-efficacy may be potentially
      beneficial for the psychological adjustment of migrants helping them establish new
      connections in the social environment. Based on this observation the investigators have
      created New in Town, an internet intervention. Exercises in the intervention are based on the
      principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to four sources of self-efficacy
      beliefs-mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and
      physiological states.

      The effectiveness of New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial with waitlist control group. Primary outcome is social self-efficacy, and
      secondary outcomes include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life.
      Other measure of interest is system usability. Participants will be assessed at pre-test
      (T1), 3-week post-tests (T2), as well as 8-week follow-up (T3). The investigators aim to
      analyze the effect size of the intervention and between-groups comparisons at post-test and
      follow-up.

      This study will provide insights into the effectiveness of an internet intervention in
      increasing social self-efficacy, perceived social support and satisfaction with life, and
      reducing loneliness.
