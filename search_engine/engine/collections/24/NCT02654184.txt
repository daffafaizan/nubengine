    
      100 pediatric patients (age range, 1 to 8 years) scheduled for lower abdominal surgery under
      anesthesia will be included. All children in both groups will be premedicated with midazolam,
      0.5 mg/kg orally, about 30 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. A parent or guardian
      accompanied the child into the operating room to allow the child to remain calm and
      cooperative for inhalation induction. Before induction, pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram
      monitoring will be attached. For each group, inhalation induction was initiated using a face
      mask using "tidal volume" and "vital capacity" breathing in high sevoflurane concentration
      (8%).
