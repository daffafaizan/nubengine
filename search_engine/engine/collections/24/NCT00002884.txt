      I, II, or III esophageal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy with or without endoluminal
      brachytherapy. II. Compare the complete remission rate (local, locoregional, and distant) in
      these patients. III. Compare the overall and disease-free survival in these patients at 2 and
      5 years after therapy. IV. Compare the toxicity and quality of life experienced by these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, tumor stage, and chemotherapy. All patients receive fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 4 days (days 1-4) and/or cisplatin on day 2 of weeks 1 and 5. External beam
      radiotherapy begins on day 1 of chemotherapy and is delivered in daily fractions, 5 days per
      week, for 5 weeks, followed by a cone down dose administered during week 6. Patients
      randomized to brachytherapy (Iridium 192, high-dose rate) are treated on weeks 11 and 12 and
      receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy at weeks 9 and 14. Patients randomized to no
      brachytherapy receive additional chemotherapy courses on weeks 9 and 13. Quality of life is
      assessed. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 326 patients will be accrued for this study.
