      pandemic in early 2020 and currently represents an emergency state worldwide. Several reports
      have shown that the first step in the pathogenesis of Sars-Cov-2 is the recognition of the
      angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor by the virus. This ACE2 receptor is widely
      distributed on the surface of human cells, especially as type II alveolar cells and capillary
      endothelium, however bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus and spleen are known as immune cells,
      such as T and lymphocytes. B and macrophages, are negatives to ACE2. These results suggest
      that immunotherapy can be used to treat infected patients. However, an immunomodulatory
      capacity cannot be so strong, if just one or two major immunological factors used, as the
      virus can cause a "cytokine storm", such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10 , MCP1, MIP1A and
      TNFÎ±, followed by edema, gas exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
      cardiac injury and secondary infection that can lead to death. Therefore, avoiding a
      "cytokine storm" may be the key to treating patients infected with Sars-Cov-2. Mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for immunomodulatory activity, can have beneficial
      effects in preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm. Because MSCs have been widely used
      in cell therapy, from basic research to clinical trials. Safety and efficacy have been
      clearly documented in several clinical trials, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory
      diseases, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). The objective of the study is to verify
      the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients
      with SARS-CoV-2.
