      Netherlands. On of the most common complications after hernia repair is postoperative and
      chronic pain. Postoperative pain is an expected but undesirable effect after an operation,
      which can result in an prolonged hospital stay or longer time to return to full normal daily
      activities. There are indications that an insufficient treatment of postoperative pain is a
      risk factor for persistent or chronic pain after open inguinal hernia repair. Chronic pain is
      not uncommon after hernia repair, with an incidence of 11%.

      The objective of this study is to determine, whether the use of an perioperative echo guided
      unilateral TAP block has an superior effect on postoperative pain after open hernia inguinal
      repair compared to wound infiltration with a long acting local anesthetic. There will be no
      further analysis in this study regarding the incidence of open hernia inguinal repair and
      chronic pain.
