      in children under the age of 5 years old. High-dose aspirin is often administered, but the
      duration of such treatment varies. Many centers reduce the aspirin dose once the patient is
      afebrile, even before treating said patient with IVIG. However, a randomized controlled trial
      regarding high-dose aspirin in the acute stage of KD has not previously been carried out.

      Methods/design: This trial has been designed as a multi-center, prospective, randomized
      controlled, evaluator-blinded trial with two parallel groups to determine whether IVIG alone
      as the primary therapy in acute-stage KD is as effective as IVIG combined with high-dose
      aspirin therapy. The primary endpoint is defined as CAL formation at 6-8 weeks. Patients
      meeting the eligibility criteria are randomly assigned (1:1) to a test group (that receives
      only IVIG) or a standard group (that receives IVIG plus high-dose aspirin). This clinical
      trial is conducted at seven medical centers in Taiwan.

      Discussion: Since high-dose aspirin has significant anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet
      functions, it does not appear to lower the frequency of disease outcomes. Furthermore, it can
      decrease hemoglobin levels. Therefore, the investigators have initiated this randomized
      controlled trial to determine whether high-dose aspirin is necessary in the acute stage of
      KD.
