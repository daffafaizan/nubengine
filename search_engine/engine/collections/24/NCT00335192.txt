      interaction between TDF and other NRTIs, mainly at intracellular level, has not been so well
      studied.

      Since all the NRTIs are anabolized at intracellular level by numerous kinases, and are
      transported by passive carrier systems, the interaction may be between TDF and other NRTIs.

      This study aims to investigate the pharmacokinetic interactions between the TDF and the
      nucleosides abacavir (ABV) and lamivudine (3TC) at plasma and intracellular level.

      With this objective, intracellular and plasma levels will be analysed in a group of patients
      that receive the combinations 3TC +TDF, ABV+TDF and 3TC+ABV+TDF together with lopinavir/rtv
      or nevirapine. Subsequently, in a second phase of the study, in the group of patients given
      ABV and/or 3TC + TDF + lopinavir/rtv, the pharmacokinetic determinations will be repeated
      after a 4-week interruption of the TDF .
