      incidence or severity of chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) induced mucositis in
      patients receiving standard therapy that will produce a very high likelihood of oral,
      esophageal, or gastrointestinal mucositis (e.g. high dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      reconstitution in patients with multiple myeloma; concurrent 5-FU/ cisplatin and radiotherapy
      to the head and neck area; patients receiving paclitaxel).
