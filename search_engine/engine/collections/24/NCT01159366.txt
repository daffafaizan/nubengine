      early invasive angiography plus optimal medical therapy. We compared baseline
      characteristics, procedural findings including analysis of TIMI-flow and collaterals using
      the Rentrop-classification, 30-day and 6-months major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in
      patients with and without totally OCA.
