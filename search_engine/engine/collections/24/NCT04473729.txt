      benefits, such as remapping the auditory environment and learning to use acoustic cues. The
      developed technology, uses adaptive listening training that automatically increases noise
      level difficulty as performance improves, and includes age appropriate rewards to maintain
      interest. The mobile app includes an initial and final screening, a training system that
      administers training via the child's own mobile device, and detailed performance dashboard.
      The study will attempt to validate the technology by gathering feedback from clinicians and
      caregivers and from children with ASD and HL.
