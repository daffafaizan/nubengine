      Whilst many factors (genetic, cultural, socioeconomic and environmental) contribute to
      develop obesity during childhood, a multidisciplinary intervention (nutritional, behavioral
      and exercise) is the best approach to improve weight loss. In Mexico, the use of homeopathy
      for obesity is widespread. Although there are some homeopathic medicines used for obese
      individuals, there is a lack of well-designed clinical trials to demonstrate its efficacy in
      weight loss. Calcarea carbonica ostrearum is a homeopathic mineral medicine. Previously, it
      has been demonstrated that Calcarea carbonica has an effect in reducing the percentage of fat
      in adolescents.

      Therefore, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, superiority trial with a
      3 month study duration, will be conducted to prove the efficacy and safety of Calcarea
      carbonica ostrearum in reducing weight, body mass index (BMI) and fat percentage, as well as,
      to prove its effect on the lipid profile, fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and
      insulin.
