      treatment targets presumed to influence social learning in school-aged children with autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD). This proposal builds upon prior research on an empirically supported
      social cognitive skills training curriculum, NETT (Nonverbal communication, Emotion
      recognition, and Theory of mind Training). NETT is a cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI)
      for nonverbal communication, emotion recognition, and theory of mind deficits in youth with
      ASD. In this two-phase, 3 year, single-blind, contact controlled study, school-aged children
      with ASD (n=60) will be randomized into a 12-session, parallel group design of Integrated
      Oxytocin and NETT (ION) or a control social group condition (facilitated play). The study
      aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of integrating the neuropeptide,
      oxytocin (OT), with the social cognitive curriculum, as well as to identify targets of change
      and pre-treatment factors predictive of response to ION-ASD. Maintenance of treatment effects
      will also be assessed 1 month and 3 months post-treatment.
