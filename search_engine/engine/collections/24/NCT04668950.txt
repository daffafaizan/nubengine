      tested tested positive for COVID-19 and are currently experiencing mild symptoms. People
      around the United States and Canada can participate. All interactions for this study will be
      conducted remotely by videoconferencing, email, or phone.

      Screening: All participants will first complete a pre-screen to see if they may be eligible
      for the study. Once a participant is confirmed eligible and consented, the study team will
      send the study materials. These materials will consist of study medication and
      self-monitoring equipment, including an oxygen saturation monitor, blood pressure monitor,
      and thermometer.

      RCT: Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to take either fluvoxamine or a placebo.
      This phase of the study will last approximately 15 days and is double-blinded. Participants
      will take up to 100mg of fluvoxamine or placebo by mouth twice a day for a daily total of
      200mg. Participants will continue this dose for approximately 15 days. Depending on
      tolerability, the dose may be adjusted. Participants will also complete short 5 minute
      assessments daily to report the results of self-monitoring (including oxygen level, blood
      pressure, and temperature), a shortness of breath rating and any adverse events.

      Follow-up Phase: The study team will follow participants for approximately 90 days after the
      end of the randomized phase. If needed, the study team will review medical records to
      determine the clinical course of participants.
