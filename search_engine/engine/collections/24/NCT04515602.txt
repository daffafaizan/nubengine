      with NACT-IDS versus PDS, among different tumor burden groups. Compare survival benefit of
      PARPi therapy in patients treated with PDS or NACT-IDS.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized phase III multicenter study. Patients will receive upfront
      maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by at least 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy or 3
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery, and then at least
      3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, and maintenance therapy of PARP inhibitor for patients
      with gBRCA/sBRCA mutation who had a complete or partial clinical response after
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months within the first 5 years,
      and then every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 410 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
