      not been studied in patients with anoxic brain injury.

      Amantadine is a dopamine agonist and may help with stimulating the brain to awaken. The
      investigators will randomize subjects who remain comatose 72 hours following resuscitation
      from cardiac arrest to either amantadine or placebo. They will be treated with either
      amantadine or placebo for 7 days.
