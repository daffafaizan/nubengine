      beliefs that personal traits (including mental health problems) are malleable, can improve
      parent and child attitudes toward therapy, view of personality as changeable, and
      hopelessness among children identified as experiencing internalizing problems. Patients
      presenting with depression and/or anxiety will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio with
      their caregiver into one of two experimental conditions: (1 information, psychoeducation and
      referral (IPR); or (2) IPR plus a single session on-line intervention for parents and
      patients oriented to a growth mindset intervention (GMI).

      Assignment of Interventions: This study will randomize participants via online survey to
      IPR+GMI or IPR alone 1:1 using Efron's modification of a biased coin-toss, balancing on sex,
      age (10-14 vs. 15-18), and presence of depression.

      This study will pilot Bridging the Gap in a community pediatric practice using a biased
      coin-toss design (n= 100 youth/caretaker dyads).

      Hypothesis: H1: Impact of GMI on hopelessness, attitudes to treatment, view of self as
      changeable, anxiety and depression. Multivariate mixed effects regression, testing for
      treatment by time interactions, with follow-up post-hoc testing of individual measures.

      H2: Impact of GMI on service use: to test attendance at least one recommended session, will
      used mixed effects logistic regression; to test for the number of attended sessions, will use
      mixed effect linear regression.

      H3: Mediation of impact of GMI on service use Structural equation modelling will be used to
      test the significance of paths from GMI to hopelessness, attitudes to therapy, belief that
      self can change, and from these intermediate variable to the outcome of service use.
