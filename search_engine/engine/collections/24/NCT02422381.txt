      non-randomized phase II study. The first cohort of patients will receive 200 milligrams (mg)
      of MK-3475 by intravenous infusion over a 21-day period called a cycle along with Gemcitabine
      1250 mg/m2 given on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Patients will be
      seen in the study clinic 12 times over 126 days for an evaluation of signs and symptoms that
      may represent drug toxicity. Patients may continue to receive MK-3475 (without gemcitabine)
      for up to 2 years.
