      preventing the spread of HIV. Plasmid DNA vaccines are inexpensive and easy to construct.
      When DNA vaccines are administered in combination with cytokines, such as IL-12 or IL-15, the
      immune response to the vaccine is increased. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      safety and tolerability of the DNA plasmid vaccine, PENNVAX-B when administered alone, or
      with IL-12 or IL-15 DNA adjuvants. The most effective and safe dose of IL-15 will also be
      determined during this study.

      This study will last approximately 12 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of four groups. Group 1 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B combined with 0.8 mg IL-15 in
      each deltoid or placebo. Group 2 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B alone or placebo.
      Group 3 will receive an injection of PENNVAX-B combined with IL-12 in each deltoid or
      placebo. Group 4 will receive PENNVAX-B combined with 2 mg IL-15 or placebo. Injections will
      occur at study entry, Months 1, 3, and 6. Additional study visits will occur on Days 14, 42,
      98, 182, 273, and 364. At these visits a brief physical, blood collection, interview, and
      risk reduction counseling will occur. At some visits HIV testing, urine collection, and
      pregnancy tests will also occur.

      As of 05/30/08, participants will be enrolled into Groups 3 and 4 at a limited pace to allow
      for additional safety reviews for the first few participants in these groups. Additionally,
      safety data will be reviewed for Groups 1 and 2 to determine whether the remainder of
      participants in Groups 2, 3, and 4 will be enrolled.
