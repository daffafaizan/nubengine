      The goal of this study is to compare two treatment approaches for migraineurs. The first
      approach will be based on the physician only and is limited to fixed appointments (control
      group). The second approach will be based on a team involving a headache nurse (active group)
      who will participate in patient education and follow-up. The goal is to improve patient
      outcome but also physician productivity.

      First 100 patients (control group, phase 1): patients with episodic and chronic migraine will
      be screened, sign consent and be enrolled. They will be seen by the physician only, without
      the nurse's support. This situation will reproduce the actual conditions at the clinic.
      During this phase, the nurse will be involved in the follow-up of known patients (who will
      not be included in the protocol) and data collection. She will develop her headache
      management abilities and help the physicians to develop some educational tools for patients.

      Following 100 patients (active group, phase 2) : patients with episodic and chronic migraine
      will be screened and enroled. They will be seen by the physician and nurse team, with a
      treatment plan tailored to specific needs including regular scheduled visits, follow-up of
      chronification factors and educational sessions. Phone call follow-ups will be planned.
      Patients will have an easier and quicker contact with the team in an emergency situation.
