    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Provide a reliable and validated cadre of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      derived biomarkers that yield a better understanding of: 1) early clinical benefit from
      various therapeutic agents in investigational and recently approved therapies; 2) efficacy
      during novel therapeutics in investigational therapeutics and recently approved therapeutics
      at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI); and 3) possible predict prognosis or other long-term
      outcomes.

      II. Reveal a more detailed understanding of: (1) the in vivo biologic mechanisms of various
      therapeutic drugs in investigational therapies and recently approved therapies at HCI (2)
      information on why particular functional imaging profiles are seen in treated patients.

      III. Reveal a more detailed understanding of how the combination of molecular imaging derived
      biomarkers will be potentially useful to physicians for decision making and for explanation
      of efficacy or outcomes for patients with cancer.

      IV. Implement and evaluate a new imaging technology for multi-tracer PET imaging of these
      tracers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo PET scans with fludeoxyglucose (FDG) F 18 (18FDG), fluorine F 18
      fluorothymidine (FLT), and water (H2O) O-15 (15O) tracers at baseline and within 7 days of
      completion of 1 or 2 (if the course is less than 3 weeks) therapeutic agent courses.
