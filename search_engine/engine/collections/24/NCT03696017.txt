    
      A subset (n=120) of patients recently admitted to (and not yet stable in) Substance Use
      Disorder treatment in Wayne County who abuse (Group 1) opioids, (Group 2) benzodiazepines
      (BZD), and (Group 3) BZD/opioid (40 patients per group) will be assessed.

      Patients will be referred from the treatment regulator and local providers.

      Participants will take part in one 6 hour face-to-face assessment during which they will
      undergo comprehensive assessments of both clinical (substance use, mental health) and
      hypothesis-driven measures (affective, neurocognitive, behavioral).

      Participants must provide a supervised alcohol-free breath sample and a urine sample that
      will be screened for opioids, methadone, cocaine metabolites, BZDs, barbiturates,
      amphetamines.

      Psychopathology: The Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 will be used to evaluate
      lifetime and current psychiatric and substance use disorders.

      Affective dysregulation (inability to regulate emotions), neurocognition, pain and
      prescription misuse, insomnia, sleepiness, vigilance, and substance use will be assessed
      through the use of computerized measurements as well as paper and pencil questionnaires and
      face-to-face interviews.

      Sample Size: In Aim 2, 40 patients in each of the 3 drug-use groups (n=120 total) will be
      evaluated. This will offer greater statistical power to detect affective and neurocognitive
      effects than prior studies, including analysis of sex differences and correction for multiple
      comparisons.
