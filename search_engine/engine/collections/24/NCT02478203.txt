      this study. After watching a video about the intubation using Airtraq , Glidescope or direct
      laryngoscopy, they attempted to intubate a pediatric manikin in three different airway
      models; normal airway, tongue edema and an entrapped model by face-to-face approach.
      Intubation attempts, insertion and intubation times, success rates, Cormack-Lehane grades and
      the need for maneuvers of these devices were recorded.
