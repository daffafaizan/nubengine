      center for sexual offence and to extend this evaluation by a specific focus on childhood
      abuse and neglect trauma and dissociative history. After receiving complete information, the
      participants will sign the consent form and be referred to a unique on-site visit of
      approximately 2 hours long. During this visit, the participants will benefit from a
      psychiatric examination in search for clinical features of dissociation during the offence,
      lifetime dissociative experience, lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder; they will have to
      complete bioevaluation forms for dissociation (Dissociative Experience Scale) and childhood
      abuse and neglect (Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse). After this completion, they will
      benefit from a second part psychiatric examination, so as to complete the assessment and
      answer their questions if any.
