      will receive 12 weeks of HIIT, delivered twice per week. The primary outcome will examine the
      feasibility and acceptability of the 12 week HIIT program in patients with knee OA symptoms
      ranging from mild to severe. The investigators will determine adherence to and tolerability
      of HIIT, acceptability, and recruitment and retention rates during the 12 week program.
      Additional outcomes will include physical function, knee OA symptomatic burden (pain), static
      standing balance, isometric knee extensor and flexor strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and
      body composition.
