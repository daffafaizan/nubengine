      embryos. Subjects must have existing euploid embryos for transfer and test positive for SirT1
      testing on endometrial biopsy. To qualify, they must be 18 to 40 years of age, have a normal
      uterine cavity, no serious systemic diseases (diabetes, lupus, cancer, etc) and be willing to
      be randomized to treatment with a SirT1 inhibitor, EX-527 or placebo. The medication will be
      provided and administered for 5 days prior to embryo transfer, after progesterone therapy is
      begun. The drug will be stopped 24 hr before embryo transfer. Standard protocols will be used
      including administration of progesterone, checking hCG 8 days after transfer, ultrasound
      monitoring of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes recording, with Live Birth Rate (LBR) being
      the primary outcome of interest. We expect to enroll 30 women, with 15 subjects per arm. The
      goal of this study is to demonstrate efficacy for a specific inhibitor of SirT1 as a primary
      treatment of defects in endometrial receptivity due to endometriosis.
