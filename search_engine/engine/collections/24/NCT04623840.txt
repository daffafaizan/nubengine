      groups; n= 30 patients in every group. Both groups will receive five milligrams of tadalafil
      one time per day for 8 weeks but the exercised group only will receive - in addition to
      tadalafil - combined continuous and interval aerobic training, 3 session weekly for 8 weeks
      after detecting their target heart rate via the cardiopulmonary exercise test.
