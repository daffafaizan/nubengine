      enrolled in this study. Participants who provide informed consent will be randomized 1:1 to
      either group golf instruction or group Tai Chi classes. Participants will be evaluated before
      and after the intervention with a battery of cognitive, motor and balance assessments
      including the UPDRS, the Mini-BESTest of balance, and timed up and go tests. They will
      participate in classes twice weekly for 10 weeks which will be provided free of charge. At
      the end of the intervention period they will repeat the assessments. The primary outcomes of
      the study are feasibility and tolerability. The key secondary objectives are to measure the
      efficacy of golf instruction on measures of balance, risk of falls.
