      one reason or another, are unable to participate in the outpatient clinic.

      When extracting teeth in GA, local anaesthetics (LA) are regularly applied to control
      bleeding, reduce postoperative sensitivity, and to better control vital functions. The side
      effects of LA can be the patient's irritation due to not understanding the postoperative
      numbness and lip and cheek biting.

      The aim of our study is to determine if there is a difference between the two types of local
      anaesthesia (computer-controlled intraosseous anaesthesia and classical local/conductive
      anaesthesia) in the frequency and extent of the occurrence of side effects postoperatively.

      The research data would help establish a better dental extraction protocol for children under
      GA, which would allow for less postoperative complications.
