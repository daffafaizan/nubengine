      design will enroll 30 patients scheduled for elective radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, or
      cystoprostatectomy, and anterior/posterior spinal fusions, which includes routine acute
      normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) as a technique to decrease the need for banked blood
      transfusions. The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of volume replacement
      during the ANH procedure. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard crystalloid
      replacement with Lactated Ringers (LR) or 5% hypertonic saline. Selected measurements will be
      obtained by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for assessing changes in left ventricular
      volume and function associated with blood loss and replacement. This study will use the
      Accuson Cypress Cardiovascular System and the V5M transesophageal echocardiography probe
      (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA). The TEE measurements will be recorded on magnetic
      optical discs and assessed off-line by the researcher after the data collection is completed
      using the proprietary software included in the ultrasound system. In addition, stroke volume
      variation measurement (SVV), Cardiac Output (CO), Cardiac Index (CI), and Stroke Volume Index
      (SVI) will be measured using the Vigileo (TM) arterial pressure monitor with the FloTrac (TM)
      sensor (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA).
