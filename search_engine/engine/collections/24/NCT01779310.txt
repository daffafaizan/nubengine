      significant cognitive impairment will be invited to join the study during the study
      recruiting period (with informed consent signed).

        -  Patients enrolled into the study will be evaluated and diagnosed by participating
           physicians and may or may not be prescribed with therapy (pharmaceutical and/or
           non-pharmaceutical) based on physicians' medical judgment.

        -  For patients with routine clinical follow-up visits, their medical charts will be
           reviewed for documentation. The procedures of making diagnosis and developing treatment
           scheme will be retrieved and documented in clinical report form (CRF). Additional
           procedures ordered by the participating physician at current visits will also be
           documented in CRF.

      All participants will be followed twice after baseline visit to re-evaluate and confirm the
      initial diagnosis (where applicable), and to record compliance to treatment scheme, including
      the process of medication titration.

      This study does not recommend nor restrict any specific treatments.
