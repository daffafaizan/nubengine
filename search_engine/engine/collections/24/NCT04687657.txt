      will be enrolled in this study. Baseline data are collected and informed consents are signed
      before consolidation chemotherapy. At the same time, HLA typing test is carried out, and the
      corresponding cord blood is matched from the cord blood bank. During the consolidation
      chemotherapy stage, the cord blood transfusion is given twice (interval of 1 month) to
      support treatment. On the first day after umbilical cord blood transfusion, the proportion of
      NK cells in peripheral blood are detected. If it is less than 20%, the NK cells are activated
      by subcutaneous injection of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) on the second day after
      infusion. The treatment effects are continuously monitored and followed up regularly after
      treatment.The intend of this trial is to explore whether cord blood transfusion in the
      consolidation phase can further reduce the recurrence rate of AML and improve prognosis.
