      arm will be recruited. Subjects will be identified using a standardised exit site assessment
      tool by PD nurses in participating units during the routine care of their PD population. Any
      subject with an over-granulating exit site deemed to meet the agreed standard for treatment
      will be invited to participate.

      Therapy will be administered for two weeks followed by an additional two weeks if clinically
      indicated. Treatment must be according to randomisation for the first 28 days. If after 14
      days the over-granulation is worse than at day 0, then a medical decision to continue
      treatment may be taken. A further two weeks of the designated treatment may then be
      administered although this can be discontinued at any point if a satisfactory clinical
      response is observed.
