      profilometry, corneometer and skin elasticity tests in periocular regions and left forearm;
      skin biopsy on left forearm before/after treatment in B and in 10 randomly selected patients
      from A. Microscopic evaluation of corneal layer and epidermal thickness, dermal elastosis,
      new collagen and p53 epidermal expression performed by quantitative digital image analysis.
      Blind evaluations (group/time) conducted by two independent observers.

      Clinical evaluation results showed no alterations (0) or slight improvement (+1) for all
      patients; profilometry, corneometer and skin elasticity measurements presented a significant
      difference in pre and post treatment values (p=0,001 to 0,028) with no differences between
      A/B. Regarding histological findings and p53 expression no previous differences between
      groups before the treatment were observed (p>0,1).Quantitative microscopic digital analysis
      demonstrated no differences between groups at the end of the study for the majority of
      variables. However, slight but significant difference between A/B subjects was found for p53
      with major expression reduction for those treated with oral isotretinoin [0,66±0,31 vs
      0,94±0,34 respectively (p=0,04)]. The main side effects were cheilitis in 15 patients (75%)
      and xerophthalmia in 5 (25%). No significant alterations occurred in biochemical tests.
