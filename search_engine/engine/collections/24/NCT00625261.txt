      no clear guidelines to deal with this problem, in German speaking countries the
      "wait-and-see"approach is widely chosen, although longitudinal studies have found that
      children with language delay are at risc for cognitive, behavioral and social-emotional
      problems.

      During the last few years various forms of early language intervention have been increasingly
      implemented in German speaking countries. However, they have not been evaluated.

      Early parent-based intervention could be an economical way in prevention speech and language
      disorders.
