    
      Multiple myeloma（MM） is one of the most common malignant diseases in the blood system.There
      is still no cure for the disease which only control the development of the disease in various
      ways including proteasome inhibitors and immune regulator and hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation . Combined with the advantages of multiple therapies, chimeric antigen
      receptor T cells (CAR-T) have gradually becoming one of the strongest and most powerful
      weapons against multiple myeloma.The basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells
      to clear cancer cells.

      MM is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous,Antigen escape and relapse after CAR-T
      treatment is a global problem， so the effective treatment of refractory/relapsing multiple
      myeloma with CAR-T cells usually requires targeting multiple antigens. The investigators use
      Integrin β7(a large family of molecules that are central regulators in multicellular biology
      and orchestrating cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesive interactions from
      embryonic development to mature tissue function), BCMA(highly expressed on malignant MM
      plasma cells and providing a substantial antiapoptotic signal making it an encouraging target
      for BCMA-directed immunotherapy),CS1(encoded by the SLAMF7 gene,a robust marker of normal
      plasma cells and malignant plasma),CD38(encoded by the CD38 gene and functioning in cell
      adhesion, signal transduction and calcium signaling) and CD138(known as syndecan 1, a surface
      protein expressed on most healthy and malignant plasma cells as an adhesion protein, binding
      collagen and fibronectin molecules located in the extracellular matrix. ) as the Single or
      Compound Targets for the Fourth Genenation of CAR-T Cells ,thereby effectively treating
      refractory/recurrent multiple myeloma .
