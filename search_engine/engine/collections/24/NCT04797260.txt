      disease characterized by severely impaired T cell development with or without impaired
      natural killer (NK) and B cell development or function depending on the genetic defect.
      Mutations in recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2) represent about 20% of
      all types of SCID. SCID is a paediatric emergency since it leads to severe and recurrent
      infections often in combination with protracted diarrhoea and failure to thrive. When left
      untreated, it is usually fatal within the first year of life. Currently, the only curative
      treatment option for RAG-deficient SCID is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT). Despite improvements in HSCT in recent years, this treatment is associated with
      serious potential complications like graft-versus-host disease which results in an
      unfavourable outcome, particularly in patients who lack a human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-matched donor. In recent years, gene therapy based on transplantation of autologous
      gene-corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has evolved as an effective and safe
      therapeutic option for X-linked and ADA-deficient forms of SCID. We have recently
      demonstrated that gene therapy using lentiviral (LV) self-inactivating (SIN) vectors
      expressing codon-optimized human RAG1 in a mouse model for RAG1-deficient SCID effectively
      restores T and B cell development and function. In this phase I/II explorative intervention
      study feasibility, safety and efficacy of gene therapy using gene-corrected autologous
      CD34+-selected mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow cells will be investigated in
      patients with RAG1-deficient SCID with an indication for allogeneic HSCT but lacking an human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor.
