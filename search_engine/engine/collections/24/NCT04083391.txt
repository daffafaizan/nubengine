      muscles is an important consideration in assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal
      injuries. Up to the investigator's knowledge, there is no study assess flexibility changes in
      CAI. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate Hamstring flexibility in CAI.
      Material and methods: The study conducted on 42 subjects with unilateral CAI and controls had
      measure of hamstring flexibility using digital inclinometer during passive knee extension
      test .Results: Revealed statistical and clinical significant difference between non-injured
      control group and CAI group with decreased hamstring flexibility in the later. Conclusion:
      CAI subjects have proximal muscular affection include hamstring tightness which may alter
      sacroiliac joint stability and subsequently back pain.
