      of 2/3 of the vagina. The incidence is 1 in 4500 female children (46,XX) and a genetic
      component has been identified.

      In order to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to this disease, the research team
      has to identify the genetic abnormalities.

      This study will be led by the research team of the Imagine Institute and the clinical teams
      associated with the Reference Center for Rare Diseases PGR (Rare Gynecologic Diseases). Both
      groups are based on the Necker Hospital campus, and already closely collaborate on research
      into MRKH syndrome.

      This collaboration will allow to :

      i) collect biological samples from the propositus and their relatives,

      ii) have a medical expertise.

      The clinicians involved in the study will recruit patients, whose participation will involve
      providing a biological sample, ie, a blood sample and/or uterine tissue collected during
      surgical ablation, in the event that surgery is performed during clinical follow-up of the
      patients. No specific intervention will be planned for the purposes of this study.

      In order to perform genetic analysis on trios, the healthy relatives of the patients
      (parents, brothers, sisters) will also be included. Blood samples will be taken once for
      healthy relatives.

      Genetic analysis, especially whole exome sequencing, will be performed on blood samples by
      the research team of Imagine Institute.
