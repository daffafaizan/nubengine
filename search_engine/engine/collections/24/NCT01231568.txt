    
      GSK2118436 is an orally administered, potent and selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor that
      is currently being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. This study
      is designed to evaluate the effects of particle size on the relative bioavailability of
      GSK2118436 (Cohort 1) and to evaluate the effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics
      of GSK2118436 (Cohort 2). Subjects will randomly receive two of four possible regimens over
      two periods. Subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 will receive a single 150 mg dose of GSK2118436 as
      micronized particles fasted (gelatin capsule formulation) and a single 150 mg dose of
      GSK2118436 as non-micronized particles fasted (larger particle size). Subjects enrolled in
      Cohort 2 will receive a single 150 mg dose of GSK2118436 (HydroxyPropyl Methyl Cellulose
      (HPMC) capsule formulation) fasted and with a high-fat breakfast. GSK2118436 will be
      administered as the mesylate salt (equivalent to 150 mg free base). Safety and tolerability
      will also be evaluated. The study will be conducted at a sufficient number of centers to
      complete approximately 28 adult subjects (14 subjects per cohort) with BRAF mutation-positive
      tumors. Following completion of this study, subjects may continue dosing with GSK2118436 in
      the roll-over study, Protocol BRF114144.
