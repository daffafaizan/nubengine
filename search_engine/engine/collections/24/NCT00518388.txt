      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a survey about your health
      practices and knowledge about cervical cancer and HPV. You will also be asked to provide some
      personal history on yourself such as your age, gender, birthplace, ethnicity, relationship
      status and educational level. Female participants will be asked to indicate if they have
      received an HPV test (also called a "Pap" test) within the last 3 years. The survey will take
      about 5-10 minutes to complete and will be filled out on the same day as the focus group.

      Focus Group:

      You will also take part in a discussion group called a "focus group." A trained focus group
      leader will guide you and 8-10 others through a series of questions. He/she will lead a
      discussion to hear comments, opinions, and observations on a brochure and poster about
      cervical cancer and HPV. Groups will be made up of participants of the same gender (that is,
      all male or all female) and ethnic group (Filipino, Korean, or Vietnamese). Each discussion
      group will last about 2 hours and may be audiotaped so that the discussion may be transcribed
      and analyzed. You will only be called by your first name and you are not required to use your
      real name during the focus group discussion. You will not be identified by the audiotape
      recordings.

      Length of Study:

      When the focus group discussion is over, you will be off-study.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 60 participants will be enrolled on this study. All
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
