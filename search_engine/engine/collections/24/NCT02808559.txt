      patients' quality of life. To quantify the severity of psoriasis in a consistent and
      clinically meaningful way is important in order to decide the therapeutic orientation to take
      for the patient. PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scoring is recognised as gold
      standard for psoriasis assessment. However the measure of the PASI score is very complex.
      Given this complexity, the PASI is influenced by inter and intra-rater variation. In addition
      the PASI assessment process is time consuming. The bodystudio ATBM (Automatic Total Body
      Mapping) is a high-tech system performing standardized photos from head to feet and from all
      angles, which allows to map the entire skin covering all the human body in a few minutes. The
      mapping of the entire body is automatically done by the use of a digital camera performing 20
      pictures of the patient with 8 successive positions. The system is coupled to a software of
      automatic analysis of these pictures for the measure of the PASI score. The primary objective
      of this study would be to evaluate the ability of the bodystudio ATBM to calculate the PASI
      score of patients with psoriasis
