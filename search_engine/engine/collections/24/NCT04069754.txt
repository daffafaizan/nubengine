    
      In a group setting, the intervention will cover topics such as Mindfulness, Health (examine
      impact of trauma and stress on physical and mental well-being), Healthy relationships, Family
      matters (coping with conflicts) and Reflection session.

      Each group session (5) will last approximately 90 minutes, once weekly, and begin and end
      with mindfulness exercises. The women are also encouraged to download free mindfulness apps
      to practice the exercises between sessions.

      Women enrolled will receive health information that will cover a range of chronic health
      topics (pain, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, obesity), to complement already existing tools
      on mental health and post traumatic syndrome.

      Women enrolled will complete surveys:

      baseline questionnaires, a pre and post survey during each session, and follow-up
      questionnaires 4 weeks after the intervention.
