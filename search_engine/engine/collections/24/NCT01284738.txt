      through cell membrane activation processes and from apoptosis. MP originating from platelets,
      endothelial cells and monocytes have been most extensively studied, though similar particles
      can arise from red cells and granulocytes. The ability to form microparticles is an essential
      part of physiological coagulation.However, MP may play an important procoagulant role in
      several diseases including sickle cell disease, and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
      (PNH).

      Several studies reported the presence of MP in TI and their potential role in the
      hypercoagulable state. The investigators propose in this study to investigate the presence
      and origin of MP in TM patients.
