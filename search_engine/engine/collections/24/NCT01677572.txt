    
      The study consists of a placebo-controlled period to study week 54, followed by a long-term
      extension to study week 518. The placebo-controlled period is conducted with a staggered,
      parallel group design, with the first 3 treatment arms conducted in parallel, 2 further
      treatment arms subsequently beginning in parallel, 2 additional treatment arms beginning in
      parallel, and the last 2 treatment arms subsequently beginning in parallel. Qualifying
      participants can enter the long-term extension period for up to 42 additional doses of active
      drug for the first 3 years of LTE. Furthermore, up until the last participant in Arms 8 and 9
      has had his or her last dose in the fifth year of the LTE, eligible participants will be able
      to continue treatment beyond the third year of the LTE.
