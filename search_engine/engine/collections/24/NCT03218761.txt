      epigenetic modification of the Norepinephrine Transporter (NET). DNA Acetylation can be
      responsible for significant down-regulation of transcription. NET is an important clearance
      transporter that removes norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic neuronal synapses.Very low
      levels of NET can produce a hyperadrenergic phenotype and can "cause" Postural Tachycardia
      Syndrome (POTS). The Baker Institute researchers have started using quantified NET mRNA
      levels from a peripheral blood sample to assess NET availability. This is a huge advance due
      to its simplicity, in contrast to a prior method which involved a vein biopsy to look at the
      level of protein expression.

      In this protocol, the investigators seek to assess whether these NET messenger RNA (mRNA)
      levels correlate with NET function. When NET transports NE back into presynaptic neurons, a
      high percentage gets converted to a metabolite (DHPG) and then released into the blood
      stream. Therefore, the ratio of DHPG:NE ratio is decreased with reduced NET activity. The
      investigators will assess this DHPG:NE ratio in POTS patients and control subjects from both
      plasma and urine samples.
