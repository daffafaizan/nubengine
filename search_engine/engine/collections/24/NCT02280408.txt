    
      Between 1994 and the present, there have been many Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks affecting
      mostly central Africa. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds all
      previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of individuals affected and in disruption of
      typical activities of civil society.

      This is a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study to evaluate a novel vaccine to Ebola using a
      live VSV replacing the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein with the gene encoding the
      envelope glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola (VSVÎ”G-ZEBOV also known as V920 and
      BPSC-1001).
