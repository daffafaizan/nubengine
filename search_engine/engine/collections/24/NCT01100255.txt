      of the population. People with OCD experience anxiety-provoking, intrusive thoughts, known as
      obsessions, and feel compelled to perform repetitive behaviors, or compulsions. The only
      medications proven effective for OCD are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), but even with
      SRI treatment, most patients continue to experience significant OCD symptoms, impaired
      functioning, and diminished quality of life. Recent evidence suggest that a different
      neurotransmitter, glutamate, may contribute to the symptoms in OCD. Medications that target
      glutamate hold promise for ameliorating symptoms for those patients continuing to suffer from
      OCD. In this study the investigators are recruiting patients to receive the drug ketamine,
      which is thought to modulate the neurotransmitter glutamate through the N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA), in a 2-week placebo controlled study.
