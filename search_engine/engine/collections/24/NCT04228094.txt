      on the best evidence available. Nevertheless, CPGs have several limitations. First, many GPC
      are outdated shortly after their publication. Second, CPG recommendations are often not
      applicable to many patients treated in clinical practice. Most CPGs do not make
      recommendations for patients with a mild disorder or for complex patients with comorbiditie.
      Another limitation is that patients involvement in CPGs development is still poor.

      We aim to develop and assess TDApp1: an eHealth tool to formulate participatory,
      individualized and automated therapeutic recommendations for patients with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder.

      A 3-week, one group, open label study will be conducted. Fifty-five patients aged 6-65 with
      ADHD will use TDApp1. The therapeutic recommendations made by the TDApp1 and by relevant CPG
      will be compared. Concordance in the recommendations will be studied. Effectiveness, safety,
      changes in physical activity and satisfaction will be investigated.
