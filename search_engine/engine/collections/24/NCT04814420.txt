    
      This is a prospective observational pilot study. Fifteen mild to severe OSA patients and five
      age- and Body Mass Index (BMI)-matched controls will undergo a DE-MRI. Demographics, medical
      history and polysomnography results will be collected. Patients diagnosed with obstructive
      sleep apnea have undergone a polysomnography before the study and were diagnosed based on
      this test. The investigators will not be performing a polysomnography for any of the
      patients, just collecting the previous results from their medical charts to confirm they have
      a true OSA diagnosis for their inclusion in the study.

      Patients will be followed over a period of 6 months with a wearable device (WATCHPAT 300)
      that will record a home sleep apnea study biweekly, including OSA metrics like AHI and
      nocturnal oxygen variations. Patients will also use an ElectroCardioGram (ECG) Check device
      for arrhythmia detection.
