    
      Randomized clinical trial; Single Blind A physical training is recommended in people above 60
      yrs. engaged in a weight-losing program, in order to prevent the impairment of physical
      performance. Therefore a physical training program (endurance and strength training) will be
      implemented for all subjects participating in the study, starting 1 month before
      randomization. It will last for 13 months. Patients will be randomized either in the surgical
      group (gastric banding under general anesthesia) or in the reference group (mild calorie
      restriction and coaching). Physical performance of patients is evaluated at screening,
      inclusion, at randomization, 6 and 12 months after randomization.
