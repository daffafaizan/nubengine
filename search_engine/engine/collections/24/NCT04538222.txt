      education was developed for full-time employees working on a 100-bed hospital in Taipei City,
      Taiwan. Due to the setting that employees can take part in the program freely and chose types
      of activity by themselves. So participants may have various intensity of participation. This
      study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre- and post- 3-month workplace physical
      activity programs in body fat percentage, Muscle strength, body mass index, daily energy
      expenditure, and exercise self-efficacy. One group pretest-posttest design was used for the
      study by convenience sampling technique. Subjects were recruited from participants of the
      program. The intervention consists of : (1)education on nutrition: 2 times per month for 3
      months, 1 hour/time ; and (2)physical activity: a three-month group coaching program (24
      sessions), including three types of exercise courses such as aerobic exercise, muscle
      strength and stretching. All analyses were performed using Statistics Analysis System version
      9.3 and the effects of the intervention were assessed by the paired t-test. Multiple
      regression analysis was used to determine the contribution of attendances of activities and
      behavior change stage to effectiveness of workplace physical activity. The level of
      significance was set at p < 0.05.
