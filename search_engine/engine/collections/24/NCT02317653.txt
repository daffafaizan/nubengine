      considered normal weight prior to pregnancy will be enrolled in the study. The infants born
      to these pregnant women will also be enrolled after birth. Archive blood, archive breast
      milk, and clinical assessment data from up to 20 participants who were considered overweight
      or obese at enrollment in the Expecting Success study conducted at Pennington Biomedical
      Research Center (NCT01610752) may be used to test the primary hypothesis as well as
      additional hypotheses.

      We will measure levels of LC-PUFAS, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and regulatory hormones
      (resistin, ghrelin) in serum (35,0-36,6 weeks gestation and 4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum) and
      breast milk (4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum) in normal weight (n=20) and overweight and obese
      (n=20) mothers. Blood serum and plasma and breast milk levels of these measures will be
      compared from pregnancy to postpartum within and between normal weight and overweight and
      obese women. Additional maternal procedures including questionnaires, anthropometrics, body
      composition measurements, energy intake measurement, and physical activity measurement will
      be investigated at 35,0-36,6 weeks gestation and 4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum. Infant procedures
      including anthropometrics, body composition measurements, stool collection, and energy intake
      measurement will be investigated at 0,1-0,6 weeks and 4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum.
