      remissions. Patients more than 60 years of age or having histories of antecedent
      hematological disorders, prior chemotherapy, or poor risk cytogenetics have generally only
      short remissions and as a group have two year survivals of less than 10%. Equally patients
      with myeloid blast crisis of CML often fail to achieve remission or have responses of only
      brief duration. Laboratory studies have shown that AML leukemic blasts may be induced in
      culture to differentiate into dendritic cells which in turn may be used activate autologous
      lymphocytes to acquire leukemia specific cytotoxicity. This trial will assess the feasibility
      of generation of dendritic cell activated lymphocytes, and toxicity and efficacy of these
      activated cells given after reinduction chemotherapy. Before this study begins some toxicity
      information will have been generated in a trial of similar cells given to CML patients.
