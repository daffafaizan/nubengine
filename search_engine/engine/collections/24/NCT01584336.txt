      although the incidence is decreasing worldwide. Recently,as the rate of detection of early
      gastric cancer has increased and surgical techniques have been developed, laparoscopic
      procedures have been introduced and tried for the treatment of early-stage gastric cancer.

      Already the prospective, randomized trials for safety and oncologic outcomes of
      laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer had been tried, but the
      large-scaled, prospective study for laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) is seldom.

      One reason for the low popularity is that LATG requires the dissection of lymph nodes at the
      splenic hilum or along the short gastric arteries and the other reason is that the
      reconstruction after total gastrectomy is also more complicated. The third reason is that the
      chance for total gastrectomy is less frequent than distal gastrectomy because of the low
      incidence of upper gastric cancer.

      This KLASS-03 trial is a prospective, multicenter trial for LATG for early upper gastric
      cancer. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of postoperative
      morbidity and mortality and the second purpose is to evaluate the surgical outcomes after
      several methods of reconstruction in laparoscopic total gastrectomy and the postoperative
      course of LATG patients.
