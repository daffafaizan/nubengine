      I. Determine the toxic effects associated with ALVAC-hB7.1 alone or combined with
      ALVAC-hIL-12 in patients with surgically incurable melanoma.

      II. Characterize the inflammatory and lymphokine response to this regimen in these patients.

      III. Examine the extent of nodule regression, humoral immune response, and cytolytic T cell
      activity with this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ALVAC-hB7.1

      Patients receive ALVAC-hB7.1 alone or combined with ALVAC-hIL-12 intratumorally on days 1, 4,
      8, and 11. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level of ALVAC-hB7.1. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose of ALVAC-hB7.1 at which no more than 1 of 5 patients
      experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 43 days after the first vaccination.
