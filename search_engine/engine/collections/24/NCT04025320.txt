      All subjects will go through the following protocol: First, subjects will complete
      pre-testing measurements consisting of 6 tests; Pain Quality Assessment Scale,
      Semmes-Weinstein Monofilaments, NeuroCom SMART Balance Master, Quality of Life- Diabetic
      Neuropathy Scale (QOL- DN), Zeno Walkway, and Skin Temperature. Patients will then be
      randomized into two groups and blinded by the treatment. Patients who draw "Group 1" will be
      given the INF treatment and patients who draw "Group 2" will be given the SHAM treatment.
      Patients will then be completing 3 weeks of INF treatment, or SHAM treatment for 3 visits per
      3 week, totaling 9 treatment visits. Post treatment, patients will then return for the same 6
      measurements completed at baseline.
