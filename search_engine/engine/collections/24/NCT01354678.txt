      effective methods of treatment. One of them is stem cells transplantation into a myocardial
      tissue, which cause the improvement of contractility, myocardial remodelling after myocardial
      infarction (MI), dilated cardiomyopathy, etc. Use of autologous stem cells does not require
      of immunosuppressive therapy and does not correlate with some ethical problems. Clinical
      application of mesenchymal stem cells always requires a step of culturing, which is
      associated with increased risk of contamination Therefore haemopoietic stem cells,
      endothelial progenitor cells or mononuclear bone marrow cells are often used to be transplant
      for treatment of heart failure (HF) patients.Using NOGA XP Cardiac Navigation System improves
      specificity of transplantations, that is decisive.
