      ill neonates. It can result in severe hypoxemia refractory to mechanical ventilation. There
      are few options for mechanical ventilation for such situations such as high frequency
      oscillation ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The aim of the present study
      is to determine whether transfusion of red blood cells can decrease the mortality in neonate
      with ARDS.
