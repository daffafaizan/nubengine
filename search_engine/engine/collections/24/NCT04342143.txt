      seperate assessments (2 hours each) with a minimum of 24 hour recovery between each session.
      Before each assessment participants will undertake an overnight fast (only water is allowed
      to be consumed prior to the assessment). If required, participants will take their medication
      the morning of each assessment and this will be noted.During the first session participants
      will be randomised into either a supine or seated condition. Participants will rest in this
      posture for 15 minutes. Triplicate measures of peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave
      analysis will be measured using the SphygmoCor XCEL and Vicorder device. A 3-lead ECG will be
      placed on the participant and ultrasound measures will be taken at the carotid, brachial,
      femoral and posterior tibial artery. This will examine the caroid-femoral pulse wave velocity
      (cfPWV), brachial-femoral pulse wave velocity (bfPWV), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity
      (baPWV) and femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (faPWV). Following this, the Vicorder device
      will be used to measure these segments. All measures will be on both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic sides. This procedure will be repeated in a seperate session whereby individuals
      will be in the other posture.

      Session 3 and 4 will include participants resting for 15 minutes in a supine position.
      Triplicate measures of peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave analysis will be taken with
      the Vicorder. Followed by triplicate measures of cfPWV, bfPWV, baPWV and faPWV. This will be
      repeated in a seated position within the same session.
