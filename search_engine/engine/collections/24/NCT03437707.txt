      of severity for patients, causing significant stress and discomfort. Effective postoperative
      pain management in lumbar disc surgery may reduce complications and improve postoperative
      care. For postoperative pain, multimodal analgesic techniques are used to provide synergistic
      effects through different nociceptive mechanisms.

      Various analgesics are used for pain. Opioids, commonly used for postoperative pain, are the
      most popular drug group. Side effects such as sedation, respiratory depression,
      nausea-vomiting, pruritus and urinary retention that develop secondary to opioids may also be
      reduced by the combination of supplemental analgesics.

      Adjuvant agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), may be used in
      combination with opioids. These drugs not only reduce pain but also control the underlying
      inflammatory process. In addition, combining NSAIDs and opioids can help to reduce the side
      effects by minimizing administration of total opioid consumption.

      Intravenous (IV) ibuprofen is the first and only IV NSAID approved in the United States for
      both pain and fever control in adults. It has been reported in multicenter studies that IV
      ibuprofen is safe and effective in postoperative pain management for abdominal hysterectomy
      and orthopedic surgeries.

      IV paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic agent used as a first step drug for pain and
      fever control in adults and children. It has been clearly shown that IV paracetamol, with
      analgesic efficacy and good safety profile, reduces analgesic requirements for pain
      management. It provides better analgesic efficacy and reduces opioid consumption when used in
      combination with opioids.
