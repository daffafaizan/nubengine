      combined spinal-epidural (CSE) - is preferred over general anesthesia for all obstetrical
      procedures. However, one downside to neuraxial anesthesia is the increased time patients have
      to stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) due to residual numbness from the neuraxial
      block. In this study, the investigators will address the efficacy of using low dose
      bupivacaine spinal anesthesia (SA) in combination with epidural volume extension (EVE) for
      patients undergoing short obstetric procedures. This will be accomplished by performing a CSE
      with: 1) injecting the local anesthesia in the spinal space; 2) injecting sterile saline into
      the epidural space to help increase the spread of the local anesthesia in the spinal space.
      The idea is that physicians will be able to use less local anesthetic due to getting a
      greater spread of medication. This lower amount of local anesthetic will lead to a decreased
      duration of the spinal block; therefore, it will significantly decrease PACU length of stay.
      This technique will be compared to our traditional dose of spinal anesthetic without EVE in
      the CSE. Both groups will have an epidural catheter in place to allow us to give any
      additional local anesthetic to keep the patient comfortable throughout the procedure if the
      spinal anesthesia begins to wear off. The aim of this study is to determine if low dose
      spinal bupivacaine in conjunction with EVE can decrease the PACU recovery time for short
      obstetric procedures while still providing an adequate surgical block.
