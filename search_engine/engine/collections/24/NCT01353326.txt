      bone around the hip implant is preserved following a hip resurfacing system. Certainly, there
      are many factors which contribute to the preservation of bone mineral density - we are
      studying the role of cement. More specifically, we are trying to compare outcomes between
      patients who receive the cementless Cormet Hip Resurfacing System to those who receive the
      cemented CONSERVEÂ® Plus Total Resurfacing Hip System. Therefore, the primary purpose of the
      current study is to compare the bone mineral density between the cementless and cemented hip
      resurfacing systems. We are also comparing patients who receive these two different hip
      systems in terms of their x-rays and how they are managing with their hip.
