      disease with histologically-confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with no evidence
      of distant metastasis. All patients will receive the same treatment and there is no active
      control group.

      In this trial, patients will undergo biopsy followed by treatment with ISA101b vaccine which
      will be initiated 2 weeks prior to cisplatin-IMRT, and one week prior to the first dose of
      pembrolizumab. Vaccines will continue for 2 additional administrations at weeks 2 and 5, on
      the same day as successive pembrolizumab infusions. Pembrolizumab will be initiated 1 week
      prior to cisplatin-IMRT at the dose of 200 mg IV q3 weeks (+/- 3 days). Pembrolizumab will be
      continued concurrently through cisplatin-IMRT (weeks 3, 6 ), and continued for a 15 week
      maintenance period after completion of cisplatin-IMRT for a total pembrolizumab treatment
      period of 24 weeks (8 doses; 6 months).
