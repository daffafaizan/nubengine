      managing CSA in primary care results in better symptom control and quality of life than
      routine care; 2) assess whether the practice of providers assigned to the intervention group
      is more consistent with national clinical practice guidelines than that of control providers;
      3) assess satisfaction of both patients and providers with this approach to management; and
      4) assess marginal cost-effectiveness.
