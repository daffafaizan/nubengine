      population-based mammography screening programme for the first time at the age of 45 or 50
      years. Results from randomised controlled trials, observational studies, and systematic
      reviews continuously fuel the debate on the balance on benefits (reducing breast cancer
      mortality) and harms (overdiagnosis, overtreatment) of mammography screening. Physicians,
      policy makers, as well as laypeople or patient associations agree on the need to inform women
      about the potential benefits and harms in order to allow an aware decision process. Decision
      aids are an effective way to support lay people in their decisions about health.
