      I. To determine the feasibility, tolerability, and toxicities of administering a fixed dose
      of R115777 in combination with escalating doses of VP-16 in elderly adults ( = 70 years) with
      newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of R115777 + VP-16 combination, including
      the duration of R115777 administration, for future Phase II trials.

      III. To obtain preliminary descriptive data regarding the effects of R115777 + VP-16 on cell
      cycle progression and apoptosis in AML marrow cells.

      IV. To study mechanisms of leukemia cell resistance to R115777 in combination with etoposide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14 OR 1-21 and oral etoposide once
      daily on days 1-3 and 8-10. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) may
      receive up to 5 additional courses of therapy beyond documentation of CR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib and etoposide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 14 additional
      patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
