    
      ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol is a multimodal perioperative care pathways
      designed to achieve early recovery after surgical procedures by maintaining preoperative
      organ function and reducing the profound stress response following surgery. Even if efficacy
      and safety of ERAS protocol in gynaecological surgery is well-established in the literature,
      its implementation is limited to few selected centres in Piemonte. The aim of the study is to
      extend the implementation of the ERAS protocol to whole regional network of hospitals.
      Specific objectives are to estimate its impact on different dimensions of quality of care,
      including length of stay, complications and patient satisfaction, and to identify possible
      barriers or facilitating factors.
