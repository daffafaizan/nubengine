    
      Method: prospective, monocentric, descriptive study

      Primary objective:

      Evaluation of the expression and function of receptors activator of NK cell (KIRs) in
      patients with CLL at stage A with therapeutic abstention, or stage B or C which require a
      treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

      Measure of the evolution of cytotoxic function of NK cells and theirs biomarkers of
      activation when the patient receives an immunochemotherapy with Rituximab/ Fludarabine/
      Cyclophosphamide (RCF).

      Verification, by analysis, of functions and biomarkers of the adaptive and innate immunity
