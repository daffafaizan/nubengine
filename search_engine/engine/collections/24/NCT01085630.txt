      Primary

        -  To determine if maintenance therapy with pemetrexed disodium versus observation improves
           progression-free survival of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who have at
           least stable disease after completion of first-line therapy comprising pemetrexed
           disodium with cisplatin or carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen versus
           observation.

        -  To evaluate the frequency of responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to first-line
      chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin/pemetrexed disodium vs carboplatin/pemetrexed disodium),
      histologic subtype (epithelioid vs other) and number of courses received (< 6 vs 6).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation until disease progression. After completion of
           study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
