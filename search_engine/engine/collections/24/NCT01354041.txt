      cancer survivors. For subgroups of survivors, FCR is implicated in both treatment
      non-adherence and medical over-utilization. Although some degree of FCR is nearly universal
      among cancer patients, effective psychological interventions have been understudied.
      Educational and cognitive approaches that have relied on reassurance may feed into the
      anxiety by encouraging experiential avoidance, according to behavioral theories of anxiety.
      Mindfulness and values based living approaches teach techniques for reducing experiential
      avoidance allowing patients to break this cycle and focus on functional, satisfying lives.
      Interventions based on these techniques offer promise for addressing FCR in breast cancer
      survivors.
