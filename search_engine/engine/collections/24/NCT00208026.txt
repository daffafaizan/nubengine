    
      Patients with Netherton syndrome, a rare genodermatosis, manifest a chronic, eczematous
      dermatitis with erythema and scaling that is often recalcitrant to conventional therapy with
      emollients and topical corticosteroids. These patients display an altered epidermal barrier
      with increased permeability to topical agents and are therefore susceptible to evaporative
      transepidermal water loss and infection. Topical therapy with the calcineurin inhibitors
      tacrolimus and pimecrolimus has been demonstrated to improve the skin integrity and the
      quality of life of patients with several chronic dermatoses, including atopic dermatitis. As
      a result of the underlying skin barrier dysfunction, however, the possibility of significant
      systemic absorption and resultant side effects is a concern when these agents are used in
      patients with Netherton syndrome. Experience with topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for
      patients with Netherton syndrome has demonstrated both marked efficacy as well as significant
      systemic absorption of the drug in this patient population. Use of topical pimecrolimus in
      patients with Netherton syndrome has not been reported to date. Investigation of the extent
      of systemic absorption and side effects will help to define the safety and efficacy profile
      of topical pimecrolimus in patients with Netherton syndrome.
