      uncomfortable thoughts and emotions as a coping strategy, and encourages engagement in valued
      behavior in the presence of these emotions. ACT has been successfully applied to parents with
      similar mental health presentations. Using a randomized controlled study design,
      investigators seek to gather initial data on the treatment feasibility and acceptability,
      detect treatment effects in a cohort of parents who have a child (under the age of 15) with
      autism spectrum disorder.
