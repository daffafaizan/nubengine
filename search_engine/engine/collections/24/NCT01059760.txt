      Western world and is associated with high-calorie diet, high body mass, and a variety of
      other factors. CHD can lead to myocardial infarction (MI) and other embolic events. A growing
      body of evidence suggests that relatively low caloric intake in the diets of a variety of
      animals increases longevity and preliminary evidence among humans indicates that such caloric
      restriction reduces risk factors for CHD, including cholesterol levels, blood pressure,
      glucose, and obesity. Caloric restriction has also been shown to alter the expression of
      certain genes, especially the forkhead box (FOX) O and sirtuin (SIRT) genes whose
      over-expression has been shown to increase longevity in animal models. Extended avoidance of
      caloric intake, also called fasting or short-term starvation, has been shown to increase
      expression of the FOXA genes that have similar sequence and function as the FOXO genes and
      that have been shown to increase longevity among animals regardless of FOXO function. We
      recently demonstrated that the risk of CHD was significantly lower among patients who
      reported a history of routine periodic extended fasting. The two primary hypotheses for this
      observation are that fasting may improve individual ability to control dietary intake or that
      fasting may initiate a cascade of protective mechanisms that preserve cellular and metabolic
      health.
