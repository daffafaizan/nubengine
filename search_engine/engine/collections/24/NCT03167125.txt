      Aim 1: Develop personalized messages (e.g., phone scripts, text messages, patient portal
      prompts) and define an intervention using boot camp translation to increase colon cancer
      screening among Latino populations.

      Aim 2: Assess the reach, effectiveness, and differences by subgroup (e.g., preferred
      language) of a three-arm colorectal cancer screening program among Latino FQHC patients, in 2
      clinics, through a patient randomized-controlled trial.

      In addition to Usual Care, the arms are:

        -  Automated Prompts-an automated data-driven program for delivering FIT kit prompts (using
           automated phone calls, text messages, and/or emails) to patients due for colorectal
           cancer screening.

        -  Automated Plus Live Prompts-a higher-intensity program using automated, data-driven
           strategies for delivering FIT kit prompts plus linguistically and culturally tailored
           live prompts.

      Aim 3: Test the spread of the program across additional clinics using a two-arm randomized
      approach and develop an implementation guide that includes outreach materials, strategies for
      incorporating patient input, and resources.
