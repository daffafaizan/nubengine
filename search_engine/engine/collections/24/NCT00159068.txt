      polymorphisms in drug metabolism and disposition genes such as MDR1 and CYP3A4. In addition,
      reports have linked changes in the course of the disease with iron status, with high iron
      being detrimental. We will study polymorphisms in these genes and correlate with clinical
      course in HIV patients and also with phenotype of drug resistance and disease parameters
      (such as CD4 counts and opportunistic infections).
