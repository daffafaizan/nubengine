      cells/microliter could postpone the need for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prolong
      life-expectancy for HIV-infected persons. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) has been shown
      to up-regulate HIV-1 replication at the cellular level. (1) This finding has been supported
      by clinical evidence that individuals who are HSV-2 seropositive at the time of HIV-1
      seroconversion had higher HIV viral loads at 5 and 15 months post-seroconversion. (2) Earlier
      studies during the era of zidovudine (Retrovir) monotherapy showed a survival advantage when
      acyclovir (ACV, Zovirax) was added to the treatment of patients with HIV. (3) Acyclovir
      prophylaxis has been shown to decrease herpes simplex virus infections and varicella-zoster
      virus infections among HIV infected patients in a meta-analysis of randomized trials from
      North America and Europe. This analysis also found a reduced risk of mortality among patients
      treated with acyclovir. The potential of acyclovir to slow HIV-1 disease progression has not
      been assessed in a randomized trial in Africa where high rates of HSV-2 infection have been
      observed among HIV-1 infected individuals. This study proposes to assess the benefits of
      acyclovir prophylaxis among HIV-1 infected individuals dually infected with HSV-2 who are not
      on ART through a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial.
