      (340-400nm) or shorter wavelength UVB (290-320nm) irradiation in the treatment of
      inflammatory skin conditions. Inflammatory dermatoses refer to conditions like atopic
      dermatitis (eczema) and psoriasis in which circulating leukocytes (T cells, neutrophils, and
      monocytes) infiltrate the skin. The infiltrating cells may be of malignant phenotype as in
      mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma-CTCL). Up to 50 patients with one of these
      diagnoses or related conditions will participate in this study. The affected areas on the
      body will be treated with UVA1 or UVB for up to 5 times per week for 16 weeks. The UVA1 dose
      will be up to 130 J/cm2. The maximum UVB dose will be 4000 mJ/cm2. This UVA1 dosing schedule
      has been safely used in Germany for treating patients with atopic dermatitis, mycosis
      fungoides, granuloma annulare, scleroderma, and urticaria pigmentosa. Subjects will be
      evaluated clinically at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, and then at monthly intervals. More frequent
      evaluation may be required depending on the condition being studied. Paired skin biopsies may
      be taken from involved and uninvolved (or treated and untreated) areas before and during UV
      therapy.
