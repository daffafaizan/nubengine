    
      The present study was designed to evaluate the impact of a nutritionally balanced
      conventional meal replacement diet (rich in soy/pea protein and soluble fibers) with caloric
      restriction in Taiwanese obese subjects. Obese subjects (BMI>27; n=50, male 23, female 27)
      were recruited and requested to replace two meals/day (breakfast and lunch or dinner) by
      balanced nutritional meal replacement diet (equal to 240 kcal) for 8 weeks with one regular
      meal and make sure the daily target calorie limit should be less than 1500 kcal/day for men
      and 1200 kcal/day for women.
