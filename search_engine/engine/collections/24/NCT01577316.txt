      of influenza vaccination is low. In general, there are few studies on safety of the vaccine
      to this group, particularly during the first three months of pregnancy or evaluating
      trivalent vaccines containing inactivated pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus. Studies are controversial
      regarding passage of maternal antibodies and protection to the newborn. The investigators
      propose to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 2011-2012 seasonal trivalent influenza
      vaccine (Northern hemisphere)(containing an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus; an
      A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus) produced by Sanofi
      Pasteur. Study design is a Phase II/III, two arm, non-randomized clinical trial. The
      investigators will recruit 120 pregnant women, 18 to 39 years of age, 14 to 34 week pregnant
      and 120 non-pregnant women. Trivalent influenza vaccine (0.5ml) will be administered IM in
      the deltoid zone. Participants will be observed for 30 min post-vaccination for acute adverse
      reactions and periodically during the 60 days post-vaccination for reactogenicity, adverse
      effects and severe adverse effects. Baseline and 28 day influenza antibodies will be measured
      by hemagglutination and microneutralization. Umbilical cord blood (10ml) will be drawn during
      delivery. Newborns will be followed monthly for growth and morbidity up to six months of age.
      If necessary, they will be referred for appropriate clinical care. Main outcome will be
      seroconversion and seroresponse at 28 days post vaccination. Results will be adjusted by
      study group and other relevant covariables.Safety will be analyzed according to type,
      severity and study group.
