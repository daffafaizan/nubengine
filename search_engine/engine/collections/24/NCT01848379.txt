        1. To investigate if cytosolic Ca2+- ( delta[Ca2+]i) and pH (delta_pHi) signaling responses
           and bactericidal effector functions of PMN dependent upon the status of diabetic control
           and are reduced or increased when compared to age and gender matched controls

        2. To determine the biochemical basis for diabetic PMN alteration of motility as well as
           bactericidal functions: production of superoxide and release of elastase, respectively

        3. To characterize the molecular basis of the observed alterations in the regulation of
           cytosolic calcium (delta[Ca2+]i) and pH (delta_pHi) exhibited by diabetic PMN

        4. To investigate if the pre-activated state and altered bactericidal functionality of
           diabetic PMN are reversed when the patients' glycemic control is normalized, blood
           glucose levels as well as periodontal disease are corrected

        5. To evaluate, if systemic and periodontal intervention can lead to clinical attachment
           gain in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2
