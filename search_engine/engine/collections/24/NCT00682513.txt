    
      Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) is a rare, movement disorder with variable
      characteristics ranging from sudden onset (hours to days) of severe dystonic spasms to
      gradual onset of writer's cramp. RDP has elements of both dystonia and Parkinson's
      disease-two neurological diseases with motor and neuropsychological symptoms that hinder the
      quality of life. An internal trigger associated with extreme physiological stress has been
      reported prior to abrupt symptom onset of RDP.

      This study, which is a continuation of an earlier study begun by Dr. Allison Brashear, aims
      to more clearly identify the characteristics associated with RDP and to explore whether
      mutations in the RDP gene are associated with atypical dystonias, Parkinson's disease, and
      other movement disorders.

      The study involves in-person or remote (telemedicine) neurological assessments and blood
      samples for genetic analysis.
