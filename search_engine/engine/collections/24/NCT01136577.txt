      for jaundice with bilirubinometer JM-103®. If indicated (nomogram included in patient
      charts), a plasmatic bilirubin level is performed. If the baby is two days old or more with a
      bilirubin level indicating standard phototherapy (by opposition to intensive phototherapy),
      the parents are informed of the research protocol and after obtention of parental consent,
      the baby is included. The newborn is admitted in the neonatology unit and randomised in one
      of the three phototherapy devices group. Plasmatic bilirubin levels are checked at 6,12 and
      24 and 48 hours of phototherapy. At 12 hours of phototherapy, a biological checking is
      performed to address the etiology of the jaundice. The next plasmatic bilirubin level is
      performed at 72h after inclusion. During phototherapy treatment the baby is continuously
      monitored. Phototherapy is stopped when bilirubin level is below 200µmol/l. If the bilirubin
      level is increasing under one of this ramps or does not decrease at H24, the baby will be
      immediately move on intensive phototherapy and participation at the research protocol
      interrupted. Twenty four hours after the end of phototherapy treatment, plasmatic bilirubin
      level is checked to confirm the end of jaundice and statement is made for jaundice origin.
      The total duration of participation of a baby at this study is 72 hours.
