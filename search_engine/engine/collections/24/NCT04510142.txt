      using translated documents as appropriate) to the address of those patients who completed
      SONIA 2. Hospital approved translation services will be used. A return-addressed stamped
      envelope for ease of return will also be provided. Those who received nitisinone will be sent
      the nitisinone-administration questionnaire and those who did not receive nitisinone will be
      sent a no-nitisinone questionnaire
