      Background

      In November 2014 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published the
      90-90-90 targets for 2020 (UNAIDS 2014). The strategy aims at a massive scale-up in coverage
      of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among individuals infected with HIV. Based on accumulated
      evidence that viral suppression through successful ART reduces the risk of transmission(Cohen
      2011), it is expected that - if achieved - the 90-90-90 targets would lead to a reduction of
      the yearly global HIV-incidence from 2 million currently to 500'000 by 2020 (Jones 2014). In
      2015 two randomized controlled trials showed the benefit of starting ART as early as possible
      for infected individuals - even if CD4-cell counts were above the threshold of 500 cells/mL
      (TEMPRANO 2015; INSIGHT START 2015), leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend
      that anyone infected with HIV should start ART as soon as possible after diagnosis (WHO
      2015). A "seek-test-treat" strategy bears, however, unprecedented challenges in settings
      where HIV is hyperendemic and resources may be limited (Hull 2014; Delva 2015).

      The Continuum of Care Cascade ("the cascade") involves the steps HIV-infected individuals
      have to take in order to achieve viral suppression. It starts with knowing one's HIV status,
      continues with linkage to care after a positive HIV test, initiation of ART, uninterrupted
      continuation of ART (retention in care and adherence to medication), and ends with viral
      suppression (MacCarthy 2015). Already prior to announcement of the "seek-test-and-treat"
      approach, weaknesses in the cascade often hampered the effectiveness of HIV programs in
      resource-rich as well as resource-poor settings (Yehia 2015; Kratzer 2012). In Sub-Saharan
      Africa the care cascade is still far from the 90-90-90 targets with only 29% of infected
      individuals estimated to be on ART and virally suppressed in 2013. In order to achieve the
      UNAIDS targets innovative, effective, and practical approaches for improving the care cascade
      are thus urgently needed (Mills 2013; Piot 2015).

      Linkage to care after an initial positive HIV test has been described as the "Achilles' heel"
      of the care cascade (Nachega 2014). Most studies from Sub-Saharan Africa report linkage rates
      lower than 50% (Naik 2015; Parker 2015; Clouse 2013; Gerdts 2014). In a cluster-randomized
      trial comparing home-based with mobile-clinic HIV testing and counselling (HTC) in Lesotho,
      only 25% of newly tested HIV-positive individuals accessed care within one month after the
      test (Labhardt 2014).

      Several interventions have been shown to improve linkage to care, such as point-of-care CD4
      count directly after a positive HIV test, immediate start of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis,
      incentives such as food-assistance, extended post-test counselling during home-visits, or
      community-workers accompaniment. However, controlled studies testing programmatic
      intervention packages for improving linkage to care are still largely lacking (Okeke 2014;
      Govindasamy 2014). Furthermore, it must be noted that interventions, such as
      patient-accompaniment or food support are resource intensive and may work in small NGO-driven
      projects, but are not sustainable on a larger scale (Posse 2013). In a systematic review
      addressing barriers for linkage to care, transport cost and distance were the most frequently
      cited factors for patients not enrolling in care after a positive HIV test (Govindasamy
      2012).

      Objective of the trial

      This CASCADE trial tests the effectiveness of same day home-based ART initiation after a
      positive HIV test in combination with a reduction of the frequency of follow-up visits to the
      clinic as a pragmatic and programmatically feasible approach to improve linkage to care,
      retention in care, and viral suppression.

      It is a two-armed open-label randomized controlled trial. Allocation is 1:1 with parallel
      assignment. The intervention is targeted to individuals who tested HIV-positive during
      community-based HTC.

      Recruitment and participants

      Participants will be recruited during community-based HTC campaigns in the district of
      Butha-Buthe, in northern Lesotho. Home-based HTC campaigns will be conducted for an
      anticipated period of 3 months beginning at the end of February in the catchment areas of six
      health care facilities - four nurse-led health centers, one missionary and one public
      hospital.

      Three teams consisting of 4 lay counsellors, each supervised by one professional counsellor
      and a nurse visit all households in randomly pre-selected areas proposing HTC to all
      household members. If a household member tests HIV positive during the HTC campaign and
      eligible for the CASCADE trial, he/she will be randomized to one of the two arms.
