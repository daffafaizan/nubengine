    
      Clinical trial is a combined Phase I/II imaging, open label, single site study in patients
      with known or suspected carcinoma of the lung, breast, renal cell, pancreas or brain, and
      with gastrointestinal malignancies, neuroendocrine tumours, or lymphoma. One 18F-FLT PET scan
      will be performed in 10 Phase I patients, and pre-injection and post-imaging blood work and
      vital signs will be collected. Up to 5 18F-FLT PET scans will be performed in 170 Phase II
      patients.
