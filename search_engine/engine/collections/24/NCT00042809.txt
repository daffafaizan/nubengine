      I. Determine the safety, quantitative and qualitative toxic effects, maximum tolerated dose,
      and dose-limiting toxic effects of erlotinib when combined with paclitaxel and trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between these agents in these
      patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      erlotinib.

      Intermittent schedule: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed 30 minutes later
      by trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each course. Patients
      also receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 3-28 of course 1 and on days 1-28 of
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Continuous schedule: Once the MTD is determined using the intermittent schedule, an
      additional 12 patients are accrued to study the tolerability of a continuous schedule
      comprising paclitaxel and trastuzumab as above on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral erlotinib
      once daily on days 3-28 during course 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent courses using the same
      dose-escalation scheme as above. Courses repeat as above.

      Patients are followed every 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-13.3
      months.
