      cancer patients with liver-only or liver-predominant metastases who have failed at least one
      line of systemic chemotherapy in metastatic setting. The investigators hypothesize that HAI
      chemotherapy will be able to convert some patients to surgical resection candidates, or/and
      to overcome chemo-resistance of liver metastases to systemic i.v. chemotherapy for some
      clinically fit, heavily pre-treated patients.
