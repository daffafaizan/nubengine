    
      Phase II/III, prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind study to evaluate the
      efficacy and tolerability of axitinib in patients diagnosed with advanced G1-G2
      neuroendocrine tumors (WHO 2010) of nonpancreatic origin that have presented documented
      disease progression in the 12 months prior to entering the study. In the first part of the
      study (Phase II), 105 patients were enrolled. The second part of the study is the expansion
      to Phase III, which is expected to include 148 additional patients. Patients will be
      randomized to receive Sandostatin LAR with axitinib or Sandostatin LAR with placebo until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Randomization will be stratified by the
      time from diagnosis to enrollment in the study (more vs less than or equal to 12 months), the
      origin of the primary tumor (gastrointestinal tract vs non-gastrointestinal tract [lung or
      other sites]) and ki-67 (< 5% vs > 5%).
