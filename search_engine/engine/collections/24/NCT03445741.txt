      aerobic exercise in different intensity and duration and detraining period in women with
      metabolic syndrome.

      Methods: Fifty-one women with metabolic syndrome were divided into three groups: 12 weekly
      sessions of high intensity supervised treadmill group, respectively, at % 70 of maximum
      oxygen consumption (group I, n=17), low intensity supervised treadmill group, respectively at
      % 50 of maximum oxygen consumption (group II, n=17) and walking at low intensity,
      respectively at % 50 of maximum oxygen consumption with ECEPEDO pedometer (group III, n=17).
      Target heart rate (HR) corresponding to values of 50-70 % VO2max were determined by the
      submaximal treadmill test. Group 1 and 2 were instructed walking at their target HR on a
      treadmill. The number of steps taken in a minute corresponding to target HR was determined by
      a criterion pedometer and group 3 was instructed walking in this step range recorded to ECE
      PEDO giving audible feedback. Participants were evaluated by weight, BMI, waist circumference
      (WC), blood sugar, LDL, HDL and triglyceride; viseral fat, trunk fat and waist circumference
      by bioelectrical impedance device (VIScan); ergospirometric VO2max at baseline, 12-week and
      4-week detraining period.
