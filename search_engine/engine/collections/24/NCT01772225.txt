      Physicians will continue to provide usual medical care to patients. There is no study
      intervention, and no drug or other intervention will be provided to the site as part of the
      study.

      Methodology: the study will consist of two components:

        -  Medical record abstraction. Medical records of eligible patients (both living and
           deceased) will be reviewed, and data will be extracted for the study. Data collected
           will include patient demographic and disease characteristics, details of medical care
           received (including adjuvant treatment), and information about disease
           recurrence/progression.

        -  Patient survey. Living patients will be asked to participate in a patient survey. Living
           patients who agree to participate will be administered a brief patient questionnaire to
           collect information that is not available in the clinical sites' medical records [e.g.,
           local medical care, patient out-of-pocket expenses, work loss, and health-related
           quality of life (HRQOL)]. The site may exclude individual patients from the survey if
           site staff feel that it would be inappropriate for that individual; the study will not
           collect patient survey information from the families of deceased patients.

      Informed consent will be collected from living patients who participate in the patient
      survey, apart from the abstraction of their medical records. Country-specific requirements
      will be followed.

      The medical records of patients (living or deceased) with complete resection of stage IB-IIIA
      NSCLC between 01 August 2009 and 31 July 2012 will be identified. No vaccine or drug was
      administered during this study.
