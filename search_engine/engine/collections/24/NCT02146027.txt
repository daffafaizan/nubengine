      control after treatment with antiretroviral therapy will be enrolled to receive once a day
      Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo in a double-blind, randomized fashion.

      The main objective is to investigate whether the continuous, once a day, 12-weeks use of
      Yakult product containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota could affect immunological parameters
      in HIV-infected patients on suppressive antiretroviral treatment with poor CD4+ T cell
      recovery. A total of 48 volunteers will be followed for 12 week after initiation of daily use
      of Lactobcillus casei Shirota or placebo, randomized in a 1:1 ratio.

      We hypothesize that use of the Yakult product containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota after 12
      weeks of continuous use will increase the level of CD4+ T-cells, at least, 50 cells/mmÂ³.

      We also propose to investigate several markers of immune response, including T cellular
      activation and NK cells function, and changes in the intestinal microbiota.
