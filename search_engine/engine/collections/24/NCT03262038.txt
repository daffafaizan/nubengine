    
      Pruritus is one of the most common and bothersome side effects of intrathecal morphine (ITM)
      in children, with a reported incidence of 30-60%. Clinicians, who have witnessed unbearable
      itching and scratching in their young patients after intrathecal morphine, may be reluctant
      to offer this effective pain control to future patients, for fear of these unpleasant
      sequelae. A study previously found a 40% incidence of pruritus in young children who received
      intrathecal morphine for major urologic surgery.

      This is a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the
      incidence and intensity of ITM-induced pruritus and nausea/vomiting using pre-emptive IV
      ondansetron, followed by scheduled Around The Clock (ATC) ondansetron vs. control group,
      where pruritus and PONV are treated with PRN only medications.

      Enrollment of 3-17 year olds who are undergoing urologic or orthopedic operative procedures
      who are scheduled to receive low dose (4-5 mcg/kg) intrathecal morphine for pain management.
