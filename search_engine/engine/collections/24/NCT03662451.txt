      hysterectomy. Procedures are performed on two locations, Herning and Herlev Hospitals, by
      experienced surgeons. Patients are randomized to either R-SSH (No.=62) or R-MSH (No.=62).
      Patient's satisfaction with body image and cosmesis is assessed at different time points pre-
      and postoperatively by means of validated cosmesis scales and Body Image Questionnaire and
      photo-evaluations.

      Postoperative pain and split times spent at the operation theatre will be registered as
      secondary outcome parameters.

      A follow-up at 1, 3 and 6 month include evaluation of the scar and registration of port-site
      hernias and vaginal dehiscence or other complications. Interviews and diaries will include
      time of return to home and work, daily activities including sexuality The R-SSH is performed
      using da Vinci, Xi robotic system. One single port, diameter 2 cm is applied. Applying an
      additional assistant port is defined conversion of procedure R-MSH is performed using
      standard equipment and 4 trocars, 5 mm each.

      Sample size calculation was based a previous study on fast track hysterectomy, which showed a
      difference in return to work of 4 days. 62 women in each group is needed with standard
      deviation ±8 and a power of 80%. To include those not working, the calculation was performed
      with an expected visual analog pain score of 0.86 ±0.2 and 62 in each group and suggested
      that the sample was sufficient to detect of difference of 0.1 in visual analog pain score
      with a power of 80%. All calculation are based on two-sided testing with alpha of 0.05.
