      cancer death in Asian countries. And during the past three decades, the incidence of CRC has
      been increasing rapidly in china. Many studies supported that cigarette smoking, obesity and
      insulin resistance were associated with CRC. In recent years, metabolic syndrome (MetS) -
      Including glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension and chronic inﬂammation -
      and its individual components have been proven to be the risk for colorectal neoplasm.
      Colonoscopy is the most accurate technique for diagnosis, surveillance and exclusion of
      colorectal neoplasm for high-risk CRC groups. Therefore, improved risk stratiﬁcation
      knowledge of the target population is necessary to improve CRC patients' prognosis.

      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease
      worldwide and cause a wide spectrum of liver damage, such as steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, even
      end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD has been found to be associated
      with obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidemia, and is considered as a liver
      manifestation of MetS. Although it has been also well established that MetS and its
      individual components are risk factors for colorectal neoplasm, as above, there is paucity of
      research looking at the relation between NAFLD and CRC. Therefore, the investigators aimed to
      investigate the prevalence of CRC in patients with NAFLD and evaluate whether NAFLD is an
      independent risk factor for CRC.
