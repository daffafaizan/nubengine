      covering the 16 districts of Shanghai. The wearing off would be defined by two methods: the
      doctors' judgement or the WOQ-9 questionnaire which was a patient-determining tool. The
      investigation also includes the medicine, the severity of PD symptoms, the demographic
      factors. The study would be designed with the purpose of clarifying the prevalence of the
      "wearing-off" and its related influencing factors.
