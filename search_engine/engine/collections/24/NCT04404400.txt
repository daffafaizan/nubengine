      system are the main systems of host response to stress. In 2008 the scientific community
      described a syndrome called critical illness related corticosteroids insufficiency (CIRCI) in
      which body homeostasis is lost owing to insufficient cortisol production or bioactivity in
      tissues. Recent updates of international guidelines have spelled out the pathophysiology,
      diagnosis and management of CIRCI. The prevalence of CIRCI varies according to case mix and
      severity of illness. The combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone improved outcomes
      in septic shock, a condition often complicated with CIRCI. However, there is insufficient
      evidence on the efficacy of corticosteroids in patients with CIRCI and without septic shock.
      The hypothesis of the study is that the hydrocortisone-fludrocortisone association will
      improve ventilation and vasopressor free survival in ICU patients with Critical illness
      related Corticosteroid Insufficiency.

      Patients with a SOFA score â‰¥ 6 will be screened for CIRCI. Patients suffering from CIRCI will
      be randomized to receive hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone or their placebo. Patients
      without CIRCI will receive standard of care and will be followed up during 90 days
      (cohort-observational study).
