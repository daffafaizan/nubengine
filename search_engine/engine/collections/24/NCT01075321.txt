      I.Phase I: To establish the maximum tolerated dose of EVEROLIMUS and lenalidomide in subjects
      with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Hodgkin Lymphoma.

      II. Phase II: To assess tumor response to EVEROLIMUS and lenalidomide in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Hodgkin Lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and time to
      treatment failure of subjects receiving EVEROLIMUS and lenalidomide.

      II. To describe the adverse event profile (using CTCAE CTEP Version 4.0) of EVEROLIMUS and
      lenalidomide.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily and oral lenalidomide once daily on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
