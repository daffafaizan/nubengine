      This surgery has enable pediatric patients who have the repair to live into adulthood.

      Stage 3 of the surgery introduces immediate congestion of blood in the liver by increasing
      central venous pressure (CVP). CVP is the blood pressure within the vena cava, a major blood
      vessel in the body.

      Many patients later develop progressive liver fibrosis (stiffness) possibly as a result of
      increased blood pressure. Liver stiffness is increased both by congestion and fibrosis.

      Liver fibrosis has significant health risks and may complicate the patient's future
      healthcare.

      There are no established, noninvasive means of detecting the liver fibrosis until it becomes
      severe. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography, an ultrasound technique, can
      measure the stiffness of the liver safely from outside the body.

      The investigators hypothesize that liver stiffness will be increased by stage 3 of the Fontan
      operation due to onset of liver congestion.

      Using ARFI, the investigators will measure liver stiffness before and immediately after stage
      3 of the Fontan operation, when congestion of blood is likely the only contributor to any
      change in liver stiffness.

      The investigators will follow the trend of liver stiffness at six months by repeating the
      ARFI imaging.
