    
      An arterial line will be established then general anesthesia will be conducted. After
      adequate preoxygenation, anesthesia induction by IV fentanyl 1.5Âµg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and
      atracurium 0.5 mg/kg then appropriated size tracheal tube. The ventilator settings will be
      adjusted to maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETco2) at 30-35 mm Hg. Anesthesia
      will be maintained by isoflurane concentration 1.2%, with 40% oxygen in air then IV infusion
      of fentanyl 0.05 mcg/kg/min was started while atracurium 0.1 mg/kg incremental dose as
      required. Then patients will be turned into the prone position above pad support permitting
      free hanging of the abdomen. Intraoperatively, the target mean arterial arterial blood
      pressure (MBP) is 55-65 mm Hg. After surgical incision, if MBP exceeds 65 mm Hg (defined as
      hypertension) it will be managed by: increasing isoflurane MAC up to 2%, if no response after
      5 min, Nitroglycerin infusion initiated at 0.5 mcg/kg/min to 40 mcg/kg/min. Hypotension (MBP
      <55 mm Hg) will be treated by stopping nitroglycerin, proper compensation of losses, reducing
      Isoflurane MAC. If persisted; vasoactive drugs will be used. Bradycardia (HR <50 beat/min.),
      treated with 0.01 mg/kg atropine IV increments.

      The nitroglycerin infusion will be stopped after the finial surgical hemostasis. Fentanyl
      infusion will be stopped before ligament sutures. Isoflurane will be closed after the last
      surgical suture. After dressing, patient will be turned to the supine position and morphine
      0.025 mg/kg IV will be administered then 0.04 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.015 mg/kg atropine for
      reversal. Extubation will be done after establishment of acceptable spontaneous respiration.
