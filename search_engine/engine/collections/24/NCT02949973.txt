      organ graft rejection and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The aim of the current
      development program is to investigate whether voclosporin added to the standard of care
      treatment in active Lupus Nephritis (LN) is able to reduce disease activity, as measured by a
      reduction in proteinuria. The background therapy will be mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 2 g
      daily, initial treatment with IV methylprednisolone followed by a reducing course of oral
      corticosteroids. Patients with active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the study. They
      are required to have a diagnosis of LN according to established diagnostic criteria (American
      College of Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy features suggestive of active nephritis.
      Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug combination to reduce the level of
      proteinuria while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile.
