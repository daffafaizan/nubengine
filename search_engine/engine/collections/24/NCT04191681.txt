    
      The aim of this pilot study is to prospectively determine the short-term (at 3 months) and
      long-term (at 6 and 12 months) safety and efficacy of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin
      inhibitor (sacubitril-valsartan) in patients with contemporary durable continuous flow left
      ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation compared to standard-of-care (usual care)
      oral vasodilator therapy.
