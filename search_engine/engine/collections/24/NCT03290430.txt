    
      Objective 1: To examine the feasibility of conducting an evidence-based, cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) for tobacco cessation delivered in multiple formats. Participants will have the
      opportunity to receive a CBT-based tobacco intervention delivered several possible formats
      (face-to-face, telephone, video-counseling) based on availability and participant
      preferences. Study participants will be exposed to cognitive-behavioral cessation and relapse
      prevention strategies, and discuss barriers to cessation, previous quit attempts, risky
      situations, and benefits observed after quitting. Participants may also complete exercises
      designed to assist cessation attempts (e.g., mental and behavioral coping skills, cognitive
      reframing exercise, health benefits of cessation; and no-smoking behavioral contracts). As
      supplemental treatment, participants may have the option to receive up to 8 weeks of nicotine
      replacement therapy and text-messaging support.

      Objective 2: To examine the rates of smoking abstinence across intervention formats.
      Investigators will attempt to follow-up with participants for a 6-months after program
      completion. Investigators will assess point prevalence abstinence for each intervention
      delivery method.

      Objective 3: To assess individual difference variables that influence outcomes. Investigators
      will examine individual-difference predictors of outcomes, such as readiness to quit, social
      support, distress, and environmental factors.
