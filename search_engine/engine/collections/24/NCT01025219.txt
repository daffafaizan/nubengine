      its modulators. Nonetheless, results are contradictory, partially due to the heterogeneity of
      the phenotype addiction. Placed on the trafficking route of cocaine, and homogeneously
      populated, Martinique is of particular interest for the study of the vulnerability of the
      crack/cocaine addiction. In a precedent study, supported by a grant MILDT / INSERM 2000, on
      155 men dependent to crack/cocaine and characterised with three clinical dimensions
      -sensation seeking, impulsivity and childhood ADHD- we found an association between each
      dimension and polymorphisms of DRD2 and DRD4 genes.
