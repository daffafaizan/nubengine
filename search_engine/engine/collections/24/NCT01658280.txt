      adenopathy and lung cancer staging is well established. However, it is a blind procedure and
      its diagnostic yield seems to be related to the operator experience, as well as to the size
      and location of lymph nodes. In the recent years, there has been increased interest in
      imaging-assisted TBNA and the endobronchial ultrasound has been suggested to be feasible and
      to improve the diagnostic yield.

      Another technique able to optimize the performance of transbronchial aspirations is the rapid
      on-site cytological examination (ROSE), allowing to assess the adequacy of samples collected.
      In this context, no comparative studies between standard TBNA and EBUS-TBNA have been
      performed. It is very important for clinical practice to definitively assess the possible
      superiority of EBUS-TBNA in terms of sensitivity, and to provide information regarding
      safety, procedural time and costs to define the best diagnostic strategy.

      The study is focused on 252 patients who have at least one hilar/mediastinal lymph node > 1
      cm on CT scan in at least one approachable lymph nodal station (except 2R and 2L) for which a
      diagnostic cyto-histological assessment is required for clinical purpose. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 (control : intervention) by a computer-generated random-allocation system to
      undergo EBUS-TBNA or conventional TBNA. In case of failure of conventional TBNA, the operator
      will shift to EBUS procedure. Moreover,a subgroup analysis will be perform to assess the
      potential impact of lymphnode size and position on final results(univariate analysis).
