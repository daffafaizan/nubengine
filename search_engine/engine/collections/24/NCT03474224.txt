      hemodynamic monitoring (Flotrac Monitoring System) to guide fluid therapy; investigators will
      refer to a stroke volume target value obtained by a bolus of Crystalloids. After the
      induction of anesthesia, then each hour during surgery until the end of surgical procedure
      investigators will assess the time of adherence to the hemodynamic protocol and the
      venous-arterial CO2 gap.Investigators expect to find an inverse proportionality between the
      two parameters explored.
