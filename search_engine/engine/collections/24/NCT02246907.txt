      an exercise intervention on patient-reported anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep
      disturbances outcomes among acute leukemia patients. The study will include 2 groups for a
      total sample size of 30: n=15 control group and n=15 intervention group. Each patient
      enrolled in the intervention arm will participate in an exercise program for the duration of
      their hospitalization, 4-6 weeks on average during the first treatment (induction
      chemotherapy).
