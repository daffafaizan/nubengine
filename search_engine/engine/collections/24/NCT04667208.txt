      markers for effortful "gold standard" methods. In healthy volunteers potential biomarkers for
      intestinal permeability as well as an established "gold standard" method for intestinal
      permeability (urinary lactulose/mannitol excretion) will be measured at one time point. Using
      correlation analyses, potential associations will be assessed and potential biomarkers will
      be addressed and discussed.
