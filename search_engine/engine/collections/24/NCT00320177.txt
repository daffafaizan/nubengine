      exploratory study, we aim to examine the relationships between measured food intake during
      meals, binge eating behaviors as assessed by interview, and polymorphisms in genes believed
      to be involved in the regulation of energy intake. We will study children who report they
      have experienced loss of control over eating, children who report overeating without loss of
      control, and children who report neither of these episodes, and assess the impact of two
      different meal instructions on their eating behavior. We will ask children to eat a meal in
      the laboratory setting on two occasions. The only difference between the two meals will be a
      pre-meal instruction: Participants will be asked either to eat 'normally' (the 'normal meal'
      instruction) or to 'let yourself go' (the 'binge meal' instruction). Participants will be
      assessed for affective state; degree of hunger, fullness, and desire to binge; presence of
      overeating or loss of control; eating attitudes and dieting; and general school and social
      adjustment. Participants' DNA will be sequenced to seek polymorphisms in genes relevant for
      appetite, such as the leptin and melanocortin 4 receptor genes, to examine whether genetic
      variation in the leptin signaling pathway can account for variation in reported or actual
      eating behaviors. Samples will also be obtained for hormones believed to be relevant for food
      intake. By accurately describing eating behavior in children in relation to their age,
      weight, history of dieting and/or overeating behavior, and genetic variation, we can refine
      current theoretical models of disordered eating.
