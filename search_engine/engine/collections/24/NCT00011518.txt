      studies have shown that arsenic at high doses can cause cancer of the bladder. The risk at
      lower doses is unknown. This study is examining the relationship between ingested arsenic and
      bladder cancer in central Nevada and Kings County, California, two areas where a large
      percentage of the population was exposed to drinking water containing arsenic at low to
      moderate levels. Approximately 200 people with bladder cancer and 400 people without bladder
      cancer will be included. Subjects are interviewed by telephone about past residences,
      occupations, diet, drinking water consumption, and other lifestyle factors. Arsenic
      measurements in well water have been collected from the appropriate state agencies and are
      being matched with residences and drinking water consumption rates to estimate lifetime
      arsenic exposures for each subject. People with bladder cancer will then be compared to those
      without to see if people with cancer were more likely to have lived in areas with arsenic in
      their drinking water.
