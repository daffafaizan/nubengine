      muscles. Depending on the clinical, pathophysiological and laboratory characteristics, they
      may be subdivided into polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antissintetase syndrome,
      immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, and among others. Recently, the literature has been
      presenting better pharmacological treatment options to control these diseases. Despite these
      advances, this group of diseases still continues to be associated with high morbidity and
      functional disability, mainly due to the proximal muscular weakness of the scapular and
      pelvic girdles that may prevent the total recovery of these patients. On the other hand, the
      association of the transcranial current stimulation technique with motor recovery has been
      frequent, for example, in patients with ischemic stroke or for the optimization of muscular
      performance in athletes. However, to date, there are no studies evaluating this technique in
      patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies. Therefore, the main objective of the present
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the application of chronic transcranial current stimulation session - associated
      with aerobic exercises - in patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.
