      treat the migraine and to prevent it from starting. However, many patients have not had
      success in finding the drug that helps them best. Amitriptyline, an antidepressant, has been
      used successfully for many years to prevent migraine headaches. This study will compare the
      effectiveness of amitriptyline with the effectiveness of topiramate, an anti-seizure drug, in
      preventing migraines. The safety of both drugs will also be assessed. The objective of the
      study is to demonstrate that topiramate will be at least as effective as amitriptyline in
      preventing migraines. During the first 4 weeks of the study, topiramate or amitriptyline will
      be increased by 25 mg per week up to a total dose of 100 mg per day or up to the maximum
      tolerated dose, whichever is less. Treatment will continue at 100 mg per day for 22 weeks.
