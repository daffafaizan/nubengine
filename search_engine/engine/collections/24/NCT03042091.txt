      I. To estimate the difference in rates of surgical site infection following elective
      colorectal resections in patients given a preoperative mechanical bowel prep with oral
      antibiotics as compared to preoperative oral antibiotics alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine rates of post-operative clostridium difficile infection, adynamic ileus,
      cardiopulmonary complications, urinary tract infection, length of stay and mortality in
      patients given preoperative oral antibiotics with a mechanical bowel prep versus preoperative
      antibiotics alone.
