      (TL) in the first Polar Body (PB) correlates with TL in the corresponding Cumulus cells (CC).
      As a secondary objective, a possible correlation between TL in PBs and blastocyst TL and
      ploidy will be evaluated.

      To our best knowledge, there are no studies evaluating TL in CC and TL in PBs of the
      corresponding oocyte. With the present prospective study, we sought to investigate whether
      there is a correlation between CC-TL and PB-TL. If a correlation exists, CC-TL assessment
      would serve as a valuable non-invasive technique to gain information about oocyte competence.
