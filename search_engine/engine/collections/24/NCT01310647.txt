      required to grow coordinately. Marked follicular size discrepancies during COH imply that an
      important number of follicles undergo unsatisfactory maturation. It has been proved that
      follicular priming with estradiol during the luteal phase of the cycle prior to COH or
      testosterone treatment during the early follicular phase of the COH cycle may increase the
      amount of oocytes and embryos retrieved. Nevertheless there are no prospective studies
      comparing such approaches. The present study consist of two phases:

      The present study consists of two different phases:

        -  Phase I: (Non randomized) Identification of confirmed low responder patients. Potential
           low responder patients will be subjected to an standardized ovarian hyperstimulation
           protocol

        -  Phase II: (Randomized) those patients, once confirmed as low responders, will be offered
           the opportunity to enter the interventional part of the study, being randomized to three
           different treatment groups: estradiol, testosterone or combined progestagens and
           estrogens prior to the IVF-ICSI cycle. The previous cycle (phase I) will be used as a
           self-control for each patient.
