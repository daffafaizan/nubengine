      self-efficacy. The examinations performed at baseline and after six months were conducted by
      blinded examiners at a visit at the primary health care centers. All participants developed a
      person-centered health plan for physical activity together with a physiotherapist. The
      intervention group was supported with a digital platform for six months.
