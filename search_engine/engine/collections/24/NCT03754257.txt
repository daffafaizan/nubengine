      diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock in the experimental group (high frequency electrical
      stimulation) and sham group will be randomized. They will be evaluated in relation to muscle
      mass, peripheral muscle strength and functional status. They will also be submitted to the
      collection of inflammatory, metabolic, damage and muscular trophism markers.
