      Tobacco Quit Line (QL;) in which the counselor contacts the client with the standardized
      intervention protocol, or a Self-Paced Tobacco QL (which leaves the calling up to
      participants).The proposed active intervention will be a the Counselor-Initiated QL which
      includes 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and six scheduled telephone sessions
      of a behavioral intervention. The comparison condition will be the Self-Paced QL with
      provision of 2 weeks of NRT and encouraged obtainment of additional NRT. If participants in
      the Self-Paced condition make all six calls, they will receive the same behavioral
      intervention as in the Counselor-Initiated condition.
