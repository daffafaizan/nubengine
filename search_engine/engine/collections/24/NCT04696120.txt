    
      This study is a double-blind, parallel-group, and randomization study. The investigators will
      enroll the patients with heart failure who demonstrated LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 40%)
      and sinus rhythm with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 3. All patients would be randomly assigned to
      either the apixaban group or placebo group. Patients assigned to the apixaban group will
      receive 5mg bid or 2.5mg bid (patients with at least 2 of the following characteristics:
      aged≥80-year, bodyweight ≤60kg, serum creatinine 1.5 ml/dL) and patients in the placebo group
      will receive a placebo of apixaban. Both drugs will be maintained for 6 months. During the
      study period, all patients will be carefully monitored for thromboembolic events, including
      stroke. At the beginning of the study and 6 months after randomization, 3T Brain MRI and
      MMSE-2 test will be performed to identify changes in brain structure and cognitive function.
