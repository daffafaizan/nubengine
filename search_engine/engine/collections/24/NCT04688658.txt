      with advanced unresectable melanoma who have progressed on anti-PD1 therapy. In the Phase I
      part of the study (18) patients will be administered nivolumab 480mg intravenously and
      duvelisib orally in doses from 15mg once a day to 25mg twice a day to determine the
      recommended dose for the Phase II part of the study. In the Phase II study patients will be
      administered nivolumab 480mg intravenously and duvelisib orally (dose not determined until
      the Phase 1 study is completed) up to 1 year as long as their disease doesn't progress or
      have unacceptable side effects to the study drugs. This trial will attempt to determine
      whether duvelisib acts as an immunomodulator, to shift the TME from an immunosuppressive to
      an immunostimulatory setting, to overcome acquired resistance in anti-PD1 treated patients.
      The phase I portion of the study is uniquely designed to find the ideal dose of duvelisib as
      an immunomodulator, which is suspected to be lower than the previously determined maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of duvelisib in lymphoma studies.
