      middle schools in 6 states. The primary outcomes of bone mass and dietary calcium were
      assessed among Asian, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white girls between 10 -13 y. Lactose
      maldigestion (LM) was determined by a breath hydrogen test (BHT). Perceived milk intolerance
      (PMI) and calcium intake were assessed by questionnaires and bone mineral content (BMC) was
      determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Data from 473 girls were used in a
      multiple linear regression to examine the impact of the intervention while accounting for PMI
      and LM and adjusting for covariates.
