      infections (SSI) after orthopaedic surgery have an estimated incidence of 1-4%. This feared
      complication is associated with long-term antibiotics, repeated surgeries, prolonged hospital
      stays, economic burden and a poorer end result for individual patients. It is therefore of
      great importance to prevent SSI.While skin bacteria and contaminated surfaces have generally
      been claimed to be the main cause of infections, there are estimates that approximately 20%
      of hospital-acquired infections are air-transmitted, making this an interesting intervention
      target. Novaerus is an air-cleaner that sterilizes the air particles through a plasma
      chamber. Air in the operating theatre is pumped through the chamber (80-380 m3/Hr) and by
      using a small current it transforms the gas in the vicinity of the electrode into plasmaand
      eradicates any bacteria that pass through.The small size of the machine allows it to fit into
      any operating theater without interfering with existing equipment. This technology can reduce
      the number of colony forming units (CFU) when in hospital settings. In non-randomized
      settings it has been correlated to reduced respiratory infections, reduced personnel
      sick-leave, and absence of severe infectious outbreaks. Its effect has not been validated in
      randomized controlled trials. Both local and national registry data will be used according to
      availability.
