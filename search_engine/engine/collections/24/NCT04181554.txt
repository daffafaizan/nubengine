      abdominis muscles along the linea alba. Increased volume in the abdominal cavity, hormonal
      changes during pregnancy, neurodevelopmental differences, or abdominal wall laxity may
      caused. It is very common during pregnancy and may continue for eight weeks in postnatal
      period. The loss of abdominal wall stability and weakened pelvic floor muscles may occur with
      DRAM. The abdominal wall is one of the key point for body posture, trunk and pelvic
      stability. However, in our best knowledge, there is no study in the literature that evaluates
      women with and without DRA in terms of components related to postural control systems.
