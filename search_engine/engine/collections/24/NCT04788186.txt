    
      This is an open-label, non-inferiority, randomized comparison of beta-blocker continuation
      versus de-prescription at the 6-8 week follow-up following isolated and uncomplicated CABG at
      Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon.

      Patients treated with isolated CABG (without valve repair/replacement) and discharged on a
      beta-blocker are eligible for recruitment if they have preserved systolic function (EF â‰¥50%)
      and no history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation/flutter, or an alternate compelling
      indication for beta-blocker therapy. After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients are
      randomly assigned at 6-8 weeks to one of the two treatment groups: continued beta-blocker
      therapy per their usual clinical care OR beta-blocker de-prescription as per the study
      protocol.

      The primary safety outcome of this study is a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial
      infarction, stroke, arrhythmia, cardiovascular-related hospitalization (congestive heart
      failure, recurrent ischemia, arrhythmia [supraventricular including atrial fibrillation, and
      ventricular], syncope or need for pacemaker), or re-initiation for systemic hypertension over
      a 5-year follow up duration.

      Key secondary safety outcomes will include the individual components of the primary
      composite, and a change in patient-reported quality of life.
