      radiotherapy, the standard treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases, can only
      bring a modest survival improvement around 3-6 months. EGFR-TKIs like icotinib with its
      proven activity in non-small cell lung cancer may provide clinical benefits to brain
      metastases patients.
