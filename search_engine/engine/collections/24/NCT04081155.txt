    
      1. When the research team was available, adult patients within 7days who were sequentially
           admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine and required central venous
           catheters and mechanically ventilation were eligible for the study.

        2. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or next of kin before data were
           included in the study.

        3. Information collected at enrollment included demographic characteristics, such as age,
           sex.

        4. The blood pressure（BP）,heart rate（HR）, pulse O2（SpO2）,tidal volume and lung regional
           ventilation and perfusion were collected at PEEP 0 centimeter H2O column and PEEP 12-15
           centimeter H2O column.

        5. Indicator-based EIT method: rapidly inject 10ml 10% Sodium chloride（NaCL） through
           central venous catheter during a 8s respiratory hold, and the curve of impedence change
           was collected by EIT machine
