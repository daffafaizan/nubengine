    
      Patient population:

      Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after radical esophagectomy, then recurrent with lymph
      nodes in bilateral supravascular fossa or upper mediastinum 6 months beyond esophagectomy.

      Scheme:

      Eligible recurrent patients with esophageal cancer will first be stratified by recurrent time
      after esophagectomy (within 2 years after esophagectomy, or beyond 2 years after
      esophagectomy), then randomized to 2 arms at 1:1 ratio.

      Arm A:

      Chemoradiation + weekly Nimotuzumab for 6 weeks concurrent with radiation.

      Arm B:

      Chemoradiation only.
