      following a cancer diagnosis. The current evidence suggests that aerobic exercise training is
      safe during primary adjuvant therapy and improves cardiopulmonary function and patient
      related outcomes. Cardiopulmonary fitness is highly predictive of overall and cardiovascular
      specific mortality in women. Specifically, an increase in cardiopulmonary fitness of
      approximately 10% has been associated with a 19% reduction in risk for CV mortality. This is
      important as breast cancer patients already present at diagnosis with 31% lower
      cardiopulmonary fitness levels compared to healthy age-matched women. This enhanced risk for
      cardiovascular mortality in breast cancer patients is further compounded by cardiotoxic
      chemotherapy, which causes permanent cardiac damage. Few studies have tested the efficacy of
      exercise prescriptions that incorporate high intensity aerobic exercise training in cancer
      patients, especially those receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, the investigators seek to
      conduct an at home aerobic exercise training intervention in breast cancer patients whom
      elect to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy
