      syndromes not taking statins in chronic administration, high doses of a hydrophilic statin
      (rosuvastatin) administered before coronary angiography and/or angioplasty, may exert a
      renal-protective effect by reducing the incidence of contrast nephropathy. Contrast induced
      nephropathy is defined as increased values of creatinine >= 0.3 mg/dl from baseline values,
      within 72 hours after contrast medium exposure.

      Secondary end points: 1) verify if short-term (<48 hours)statin administration reduces the
      peak levels and the curve areas of markers of myocardial necrosis throughout the
      hospitalization period and if reduces the occurrence of periprocedural infarction.
      Biochemical markers (quantitative creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) mass and Troponin I) are
      measured at admission and at 6, 12, and 24 hours during the first day then once daily,
      immediately before angiography, and 24 hours thereafter. In patients who underwent coronary
      angioplasty (PCI), biochemical markers were measured at 12 and 24 hours after the procedure.
      Data were fitted, peak values and curve areas calculated; the occurrence of periprocedural
      infarction was defined as a CK-MB mass elevation more than three times the upper limit of
      normal within 24 hours after PCI. 2) determine the distribution of peripheral lymphocytic
      populations at the entry and at discharge using the flow cytometric analysis; 3) analyze the
      clinical composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization,
      dialysis and stroke at 30 days and 6 months.
