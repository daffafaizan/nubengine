      chronically infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease has also recently become clinically
      and epidemiologically relevant in several other countries due to social factors related to
      individuals migration and globalization. Chagas cardiomyopathy occurs in 30%-50% of the
      infected individuals, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality rates. Sudden cardiac
      death is the major cause of death in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. While implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator and treatment with amiodarone have been recommended and performed
      empirically for the secondary prevention in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, no
      consistent scientific evidence exists on the role of these therapeutic strategies for the
      primary prevention of Sudden cardiac death in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and high
      mortality risk.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation
      is more efficient in the primary prevention of death in Chagas cardiomyopathy than drug
      therapy with amiodarone in patients with documented non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

      We should point out that the death risk will be assessed using the Rassi risk score for death
      prediction validated based on non-invasive variables and, depending on the results of this
      study, it may guide the indication of implantable cardioverter defibrillator in Chagas
      cardiomyopathy.
