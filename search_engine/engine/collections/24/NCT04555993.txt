      of pulmonary, immunological and metabolic functions. Opioids are the current gold standard
      drug for postoperative pain relief, however exposure to large doses lead to multiple side
      effects of varying significance such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, constipation,
      respiratory depression, hypoventilation and sleep breathing disorders. Therefore strategies
      other than opioids are recommended without sacrificing proper and effective analgesia.
      Especially in cancer patients who are more susceptible to tolerance and addiction.

      The Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block, is a regional anaesthesia technique used
      effectively in laparotomies. Unilateral analgesia to the skin, muscles, and parietal
      peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall will be achieved without affecting visceral pain,
      when the anterior rami of the lower six thoracic nerves (T7-T12) and the first lumbar nerve
      (L1) are blocked.

      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) was shown to be an effective analgesic option for different
      types of surgeries. It's relatively a simple block, drug is injected in the plane between the
      erector spinae muscle and the vertebral transverse process. Blocking the ventral and dorsal
      rami of spinal nerves on the paravertebral area distributed from T2-T4 to L1-L2 and gives
      good coverage to visceral pain. Owing to the lower risk of blood vessel damage and neural
      damage compared to the epidural or the paravertebral block.

      Both blocks haven't been compared to each other in this type of surgery before.
