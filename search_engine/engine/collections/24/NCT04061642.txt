    
      Hypothesis 1. There will not be a significant difference in measured non-initial intake
      appointment lengths between the baseline period and the appointment length measured at two
      and four months after introduction of the study software and CDA.

      Hypothesis 2. Physicians will not subjectively report that using the CDA and study software
      increased the length of their appointments.

      Hypothesis 3. At least 66% of patients and 66% of physicians will rate the trustworthiness of
      the CDA as a 4 or 5 on a 5 point Likert scale (with higher ratings indicating greater trust).

      Hypothesis 4. At least 66% of patients and 66% of physicians will rate the overall usability
      of the CDA as a 4 or 5 on a 5 point Likert scale (with higher ratings indicating greater
      usability).

      Hypothesis 5. At least 70% of physicians and 65% of patients will still be using the
      application regularly by the end of the study. For physicians, regularly will be defined as
      the application being used in every study-related visit. For patients regularly will be
      defined as completing at least one PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaire on the application per week.

      Exploratory hypothesis: Based on our machine learning results to date, we expect between
      40-50% of patients starting a new treatment for depression and whose treatment follows the
      highest probability treatment output by the CDA to remit within 14 weeks. This is
      exploratory, and the study is not necessarily powered to demonstrate this.
