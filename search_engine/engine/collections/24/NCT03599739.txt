    
      This study will enroll facilities who participated in the adjuvanted influenza vaccine study
      in 2016-2017 to document the vaccine choice for the 2017-2018 influenza season through a
      survey. Additional facilities will be enrolled that did not participate to answer a survey
      responding to questions regarding the vaccine choice for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 flu
      season. Both groups will also gather information on vaccination rates for residents and
      staff, policies and procedures, and influenza outbreaks.

      The facility will complete a profile and answer questions regarding influenza vaccination in
      their facilities for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 flu seasons.

      The study team will obtain data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2019 to
      determine the study outcomes. None of the data used in the analysis will be linked to
      individual residents in facilities.
