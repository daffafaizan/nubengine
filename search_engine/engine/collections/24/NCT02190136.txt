      middle aged overweight/obese women. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: Protein-rich
      whole food only consumed as 20-25 grams per serving 4-6 per day (P); protein and resistance
      exercise training (R); and protein and stretching/yoga exercise training (S). All outcomes,
      including the primary outcomes of body composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers were
      measured at baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 12) in all study subjects.
