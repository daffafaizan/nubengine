      infectious diseases including Ebola, SARS, MERS and H1N1 flu. Given that there is no current
      medical treatment beyond supportive care for COVID-19, there is a great deal of interest in
      using convalescent plasma for patients with COVID-19. As a first step in this process,
      investigators are proposing to identify donors and collect plasma with antibodies against
      COVID-19. While the intention is to use this for patients in the near future, the purpose of
      this study will be to see if this is feasible and a separate application will be submitted
      related to the treatment of patients with these products.
