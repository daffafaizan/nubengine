    
      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover bioavailability study comparing Ondansetron 8 mg orally
      disintegrating tablets of OHM Laboratories Inc (A subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc,
      USA) with Zofran ODTÂ® orally disintegrating tablets (containing 8 mg of ondansetron) of
      GlaxoSmithKline in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fasting condition.

      During each period of the study after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a single oral
      dose of either test or reference product was administered by placing the tablet on tongue
      till it dissolved and then swallowed it using 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature
      under supervision of a medical officer.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters including vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,
      serology parameters and urine analysis) were assessed and laboratory parameters of hematology
      and biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.
