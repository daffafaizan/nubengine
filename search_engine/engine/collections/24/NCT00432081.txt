      disease (AD), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may retard the progression of
      the disease.

      Comparison(s): Cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate AD receiving the NSAID
      indomethacin, compared to cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate AD receiving
      placebo, during a one-year period.
