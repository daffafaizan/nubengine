      hemoglobin measurement in patients undergoing elective CS, who may often experience
      significant blood loss and postpartum anemia in the perioperative period. The measurement of
      perioperative blood loss is often inaccurate, and formal measurements of hemoglobin levels
      are often associated with time delays, especially in the setting of ongoing acute blood loss.
      We hope that this device will provide accurate continuous data of hemoglobin in this patient
      population, which may prove to be a significant advance in patient monitoring in this patient
      population. Probes for SpHb measurement will be provided by Masimo Corporation.
