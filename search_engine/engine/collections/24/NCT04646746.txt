      increase is primarily due to obesity, unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity.
      Therefore, it is important to find dietary products that counteracts this development.

      Intake of food with a low glycemic index (GI) reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes
      (T2D) and helps in the regulation of a preexisting diabetes.

      Barley has shown some beneficial effects on GI compared with wheat, however, barley is not
      commonly used in bread making in Denmark.

      The most common type of barley in Denmark is with rind and demands processing before use.
      Processing may remove important nutrients from the barley. Some of the original antiquity
      barley has a loose rind (nude barley), that falls of during harvesting, and thereby reduces
      the need for processing. However, it is not known how this ancient type of barley affects GI.

      The composition of the starch in barley is of importance when the grain is degraded after
      consumption. The starch consists of both amylose (which is slowly degraded) and amylopectin
      (which is quickly degraded). By genetic modification, it was possible for collaborative
      researchers at the Universities of Aarhus and Copenhagen to increase the amount of amylose in
      regular barley. Slowly degraded starch is expected to decrease GI.

      In a series of acute studies the investigators want to study the effects on the glucose
      metabolism to intake of bread made with different compositions of wheat, nude barley and
      gene-modified high-amylose barley in subjects with T2D.

      It is expected that both nude barley and gene-modified high-amylose barley lowers the
      postprandial glycemic response more than wheat and hereby positively affect the glycemic
      regulation for subjects with type 2 diabetes.
