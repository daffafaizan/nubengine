      I. To evaluate safety and feasibility of a single intramuscular injection of efineptakin alfa
      (NT-I7) in patients with locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe changes in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in peripheral blood after a single
      dose of NT-I7.

      II. To describe changes in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in tumor microenvironment of
      surgical specimen after a single dose of NT-I7.

      III. To evaluate changes in immune subsets in peripheral blood after a single dose of NT-I7
      and after surgery.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To make assessment of exploratory biomarkers for pharmacodynamic activity of NT-I7 in
      peripheral blood, and/or tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive one dose of efineptakin alfa intramuscularly (IM).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 35 days after dose or 21
      days after surgery.
