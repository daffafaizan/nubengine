      sub-maximal test on a ergo cycle to draw their linear relationship between VO2 and Fc. Then
      they will enter a metabolic chamber three times, for 24 hours each. A first session will be
      considered as sedentary, and volunteers will remain inactive. During the second and third
      session, they will have to complete a cycling test generating an energy expenditure of 400
      Kcal, once at low intensity (40%VO2max) and once at high intensity (70% VO2max). Those three
      sessions will be realized in a randomized order with an interval of at least 7 days and
      urinary collection over the 24hours will be done during all the sessions. At the beginning of
      the protocol, blood samples will be taken, body composition assessed by DXA and adiposity
      location evaluated by MNR.
