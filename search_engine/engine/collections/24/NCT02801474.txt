      unstable and displaced posterior malleolar fractures requiring surgical management. Patients
      with open fractures or pathological fractures were excluded. Preoperative anteroposterior
      (AP), lateral, and mortise view radiographs as well as computed tomography (CT) scans were
      routinely obtained to evaluate the characteristic of the fracture. Patients were then
      assigned to the direct reduction (DR) group or the indirect reduction (IR) group. Following
      reduction and fixation of the fracture using the direct reduction technique or the indirect
      reduction technique, the quality of fracture reduction was evaluated in radiograph and CT
      images. Functional outcome,including AOFAS score, ankle range of motion were evaluated at the
      last follow-up.
