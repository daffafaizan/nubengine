      management of patients with sorafenib-failed advanced HCC based on the promising data of
      Checkmate-040 phase I/II study. Although there is a lack of prospective data for
      pembrolizumab in biliary tract cancer except for small phase 1 trial, pembrolizumab is now
      available for use in Korea for the management of advanced biliary tract cancer. Because the
      approval of these agents was based on the small sample size, further prospective evaluation
      of nivolumab or pembrolizumab in patients with hepatobiliary cancer is needed.
