      elderly care. This could be achieved by integrating CGA in different disciplines dealing with
      the older patient. CGA is different from that of the standard medical evaluation; it is a
      systematic evaluation of frail older adults. It uses combinations of validated geriatric
      tools to formulate an inventory of health problems, and develop an individualized geriatric
      intervention plan.

      The software platform for CGA has been widely used in western countries; however, tools that
      can fit patients with different backgrounds should be implemented..

      From the initial pool of 3 potential subtests, four experienced geriatricians developed a
      bundle of 15 subtests, to evaluate cognition, mood, vision, hearing, urinary continence,
      nutrition, functional capacity, fall risk and balance impairment, frailty, polypharmacy,
      sleep, pain, home safety, and social problems. Moreover, a rapid survey of medical and
      surgical conditions was obtained.

      Initial evaluation of these subsets compared to the reference standard CGA was done. Each
      patient completed the bundle then underwent CGA by an experienced geriatrician blinded to the
      result of e-GAB
