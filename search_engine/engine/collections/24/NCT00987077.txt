      the neurosensory retina in the macular region secondary to a focal or retinal pigment
      epithelial defect. Patients with ICSC, oftentimes young male adults, experience visual
      disturbances including micropsia, metamorphopsia, central scotoma, reduced visual acuity and
      loss of contrast sensitivity. Most cases of ICSC are presumed to be self-limiting and usually
      resolve spontaneously within 3 to 4 months.Nevertheless the duration of the disease is
      strongly related to the vision prognosis and reattachment within 4 months of onset is
      considered as a relevant therapeutic target because prolonged detachment is associated with
      photoreceptor atrophy.

      The therapeutic effect of focal cw laser photocoagulation has not been fully established. One
      obvious theory postulates that the beneficial effect of photocoagulation is associated with
      the establishment of a new barrier of RPE cells which subsequently reintegrate the RPE pump
      function and the integrity of the RPE as a barrier. Based on this theory, the destruction of
      tissues surrounding the RPE, in particular Bruch's membrane, the choroid and the
      photoreceptors, would be an unwanted side effect. On the basis of this consideration
      Selective Retina Therapy (SRT), which is a innovative laser technology that selectively
      damages the RPE and spares the neurosensory retina, suggests itself as an ideal treatment for
      ICSC with focal leakage, especially if the RPE leak is located close to the fovea.

      It has been proved as safe, and microperimetry has shown that SRT does not cause
      microscotoma. SRT has already been adopted in the treatment of diverse macular diseases inter
      alia in patients with ICSC with promising performance.
