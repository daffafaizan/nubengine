    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase 3 trial of cabozantinib
      in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination
      with matched placebo. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab ("triplet") on the duration of
      progression-free survival (PFS) versus nivolumab and ipilimumab. A secondary objective is to
      evaluate the effect of triplet combination on the duration of overall survival (OS).
