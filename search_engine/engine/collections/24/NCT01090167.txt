      patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who are relapsed/refractory or elderly untreated
      AML for whom standard induction chemotherapy is unlikely to be of benefit.

      Cohort 1 will receive 20 mg/m2/day of Clofarabine once daily for five consecutive days,
      Cohort 2 will receive 30 mg/m2/day, and Cohort 3 will receive 40 mg/m2/day. Patients will
      receive one cycle as a rule. However, if there is evidence of some hematologic response after
      one cycle of treatment with Clofarabine, patients may receive up to a maximum of three
      cycles. If patients fail to achieve CR or CRp after two cycles of treatment with Clofarabine,
      further dosing for such patients should be stopped.

      Three patients constituting a cohort will receive Clofarabine and will then be assessed for
      dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at Cycle 1. If none of these three patients develops DLT, the
      next cohort will be introduced. If one of them develops DLT, three new patients will be added
      to the cohort, so that six patients in total are included in the tolerability assessment. In
      this case, treatment of the next cohort is allowed only in the case the number of patients
      who develop DLT is still one in this six-patient cohort. If two of the six patients develop
      DLT, however, the tolerability is ruled out. However, if two DLTs are observed at the
      20mg/m2/day dose cohort, new patients will be enrolled at cohort -1 15mg/m2/day; and if no
      more than one of six patients in the cohort develop DLT, it will be considered as the last
      cohort for this study.
