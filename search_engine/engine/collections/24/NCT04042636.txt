      Bacteremia occurs in trauma patients frequently and increases a morbidity and mortality. The
      aim of this study was to identify risk factors and to describe epidemiological patterns for
      early onset (EOB) and late onset (LOB) bacteremia after trauma.

      Methods: All trauma patients admitted to surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and general ward
      (GW) from January 2011 to December 2015 were retrospectively enrolled. The following
      information was collected for each patient and recorded in a computer database: demography,
      severity of trauma according to the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and each abbreviated injury
      score (AIS), severity of coma according to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), presence of shock
      and transfusion. Early onset bacteremia was defined as EOB when onset occurred within 7 days
      after trauma, and late onset bacteremia was defined as LOB when appearing after 7 days from
      trauma.
