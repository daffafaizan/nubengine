    
      Participants aged 13-17 years who have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for more than 1
      year will be invited to participate.Other inclusion factors are:

        -  HbA1c level between 7.5 and 10% inclusive

        -  Currently using carbohydrate to insulin ratio

        -  Acceptable form of birth control

      Exclusion factors:

        -  Oral hyperglycemic agents or medications which might affect blood sugar levels

        -  Recurrent severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance in previous 6 months

        -  Diagnosis of gastroparesis and/or require use of drugs that stimulate gastrointestinal
           motility

        -  Previous use of pramlintide

      The study consists of 2 overnight stays at the CTRC where a continuous glucose monitoring
      system will be worn for twenty-four hours. Blood will be drawn 15 minutes prior to start of
      each meal and for three hours following each meal. Meals will be controlled for carbohydrate,
      fat and protein content. Meals will be identical at each CTRC visit.

      After a baseline visit for all participants, randomization will occur to either Treatment or
      Control.Bolus insulin will be adjusted for participants when beginning pramlintide and will
      likely remain at a reduced rate throughout the trial. All participants will have access to
      staff to assist with insulin dosing. There will be six mandatory phone visits over the 36
      days to ensure the safety of participants in this study.

      Insulin, glucose and glucagon levels will be assessed as well as pramlintide levels at final
      visit of the study. Hypoglycemic events will be tracked, as well as any other adverse events.
