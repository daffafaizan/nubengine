    
      Two-arm, multi-centre, randomised prospective study comparing MitraClip速 to Surgical therapy
      in high and intermediate risk patients. Patients should be older than 18 years and high and
      intermediate risk is defined by a score (for MV repair) >= 3% and <= 10% or as determined by
      the local Heart Team (which should include a surgeon and a cardiologist), based on the
      evidence that STS risk calculator may not identify all possible risk factors. Patients are
      selected upon clinical conditions and severity of MR. Anatomical feasibility is assessed by
      ECHO, according to the IFU (information for use).

      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy of MitraClip速 vs. surgery in high
      and intermediate risk patients with DMR. Study Follow-Up includes the following visits after
      procedure: Hospital discharge, 1, 6, 12 months post-procedure.

      Primary Endpoints are the 30-day safety superiority (ITT analysis) and the 12-month efficacy
      non-inferiority (ITT analysis) of the MitraClip速. The overall rate of Serious Adverse Events
      (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Device Events (SADEs) until 12 months and the MR Severity
      reduction at 6 and 12 month in the MitraClip速 and Surgery groups are Secondary Endpoints
