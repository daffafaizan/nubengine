      of high risk babies for developing post partum hypoglycemia (Infants of diabetic mothers,
      infants of hypertensive mothers, infants with birth weight more than 4 Kg or less than 2.5 Kg
      and infants with meconium stained amniotic fluid)will be recorded including maternal breast
      feeding times and quality of feeding. Glucose levels shall be routinely monitored and
      recorded at the neonatal department. A comparison of all data will be made between those
      newborns that breast feed after labor and those who were not.
