      approach using a design that reduces many of the methodological limitations in earlier work.
      Study participants will include opioid abusers with a current psychiatric disorder. All study
      participants will receive comprehensive drug abuse treatment that includes adequate daily
      doses of methadone. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either an onsite and
      fully Integrated Substance Abuse and Psychiatric Care condition (ISAP-Integrated) or an
      offsite and non-integrated Parallel Substance Abuse and Psychiatric Care condition
      (PSAP-Parallel). Patients assigned to the ISAP condition will receive all of their ambulatory
      psychiatric care in the ATS treatment program; those assigned to the PSAP condition will be
      referred for matched "doses" of psychiatric care to the Community Psychiatry Program, which
      is located on the same campus as the ATS program. All drug abuse treatment services will be
      provided in the ATS program. Patients will be evaluated for 12 months on a range of outcome
      measures, including psychiatric medication and therapy adherence, drug abuse treatment
      adherence, changes in psychiatric symptoms, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
      drug use, exposure to traumatic events, psychosocial functioning, and retention in both
      psychiatric and drug abuse treatment.
