    
      Briefly, the data for this evaluation were collected from adults recruited from the Boston /
      Cambridge area to participate in an RCT conducted at an eating behavior lab at the Landmark
      Center (Lab). Participants were masked to the purpose of the study and were randomized to one
      of four conditions. To conceal the purpose of the study, participants were asked to
      participate in a pseudo-focus group pretending to conduct consumer research on restaurant
      preferences. Participants were asked not to eat after 3 pm prior to the 5:30 pm focus group.
      Participants were seated at individual dining tables and were asked to order and purchase
      dinner from a restaurant menu and consumed the meal while in the restaurant Lab. After the
      focus group, participants completed electronic questionnaires (e.g., demographic information,
      eating behaviors, and perceptions of the meal). Participants returned to the Lab the
      following day to complete a brief dietary recall interview. After they completed the study
      procedures, they were debriefed about the purpose of the study and provided the opportunity
      to withdraw from the study.

      The current evaluation will be conducted under an IRB-approved, apriori, statistical analysis
      plan using the data collected during the Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Portion limit Dining
      Lab RCT.
