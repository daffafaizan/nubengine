      procedures is infection. Continuous wound drainage poses a serious risk for infection and is
      often initially treated with absorbent dressings and/or oral antibiotics. Comorbidities such
      as obesity, diabetes and tobacco abuse predisposes to wound complications and therefore
      infection after these procedures. NPWT has proven to be effective for postoperative drainage
      and decreases the risk for infection or further reoperation. This prospective randomized
      trial will involve 160 patients at high risk for infection undergoing revision total knee or
      hip arthroplasty; 80 patients will be randomly selected to be treated with the NPWT system
      (Prevena) and randomly selected to be treated with the current standard of care wound
      dressing (control group). Patients will be enrolled at a single site of the Cleveland Clinic
      Health System (Main Campus).
