    
      A multi-center, phase II study of catumaxomab in ovarian cancer patients with recurrent
      symptomatic malignant ascites requiring therapeutic paracentesis. Each eligible patient will
      receive four ascending doses of catumaxomab, administered intraperitoneally via an indwelling
      catheter. Catumaxomab will be administered as a 3-hour constant rate infusion with a dosing
      interval of 3-4 days. Each patient will participate in this study for up to 7 months
      (includes the baseline therapeutic paracentesis and screening period, 11 to 21 days treatment
      period, and up to 180 days/6 months follow-up), with monthly post-study follow-up for the
      lifetime of the patient.

      Catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody targeting EpCAM on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells.
      Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new
      antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages,
      dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells) to the tumor site. According to
      preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these different immune effector cells,
      which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.
