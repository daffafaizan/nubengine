      50% of parturients continue to experience pain leading to suffering and increased caregiver
      workload. There is also higher risk of motor blockade found in those receiving epidural
      analgesia, and these factors is associated with dysfunctional labour requiring obstetric
      intervention (instrumental delivery). Automated mandatory bolus (AMB) of variable-frequency
      (VAMB) has been shown to provide better pain relief as compared with conventional
      patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with basal infusion, however its long lockout
      time per hour is associated with unsuccessful patient bolus requests, with similar motor
      block to conventional regimens.

      The investigators therefore proposes to develop a novel epidural delivery regimen: Variable
      volume AMB (VVAMB) will advance individualisation of labour epidural analgesia, by which a
      larger volume of bolus may contribute to better spread of the local anaesthetics within brief
      period and thereby reduces the chances of motor blockade that could reduce instrumental
      deliveries. This algorithm development including pilot and clinical trial will compare VVAMB
      with VAMB regimens, in reducing the incidence of motor block in 216 term women requesting for
      labour epidural analgesia.
