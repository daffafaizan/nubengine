      will take ruxolitinib SR once daily for 16 consecutive weeks and then transition to a
      comparable twice daily dose regimen of ruxolitinib using the immediate release (IR) tablets
      which have been under investigation in controlled Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials.

      Participants receiving benefit from treatment with ruxolitinib may continue further
      participation with IR tablets up to the time when the last participant completed Week 36 or
      the commercial availability of ruxolitinib IR, whichever was earlier. Follow-up will occur at
      least 30 days following the last dose of ruxolitinib.
