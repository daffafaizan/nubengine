      Respiratory morbidity, particularly chronic lung disease (CLD), remains a major cause of
      long-term morbidity and mortality for preterm infants. Although surfactant replacement has
      decreased acute respiratory morbidity and mortality, it has not reduced the incidence of CLD.
      A number of other approaches, including antenatal thyrotropin releasing hormone in
      conjunction with corticosteroids, postnatal steroid administration, as well as administration
      of Vitamin E, diuretics, and bronchodilators, have not resulted in clinically important
      decreases in CLD. Infants with the most severe CLD go on to develop findings suggestive of
      pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale. There is preliminary evidence in the preterm
      infant with severe chronic lung disease that low-dose inhaled nitric oxide may significantly
      attenuate the disease and decrease mortality.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The multi-center, controlled and blinded trial investigates the hypothesis that low-dose
      inhaled nitric oxide administered to preterm infants between 500 and 1250 grams birth weight
      who continue to require mechanical ventilation at 10 days of age will increase survival
      without chronic lung disease (CLD) at 36 weeks post menstrual age. Secondary outcomes are
      duration of ventilation, oxygen requirement and duration of hospitalization. In addition,
      that there will be expected improvement in infant respiratory status (ventilatory support,
      airway resistance and compliance) associated with inhaled nitric oxide treatment. Indicators
      of inflammation and oxidant stress will be assessed by measurements of specific cytokines and
      protein modifications in tracheal aspirate and plasma samples, respectively. The safety of
      this therapy will be evaluated by assessing toxicity as measured by clinical bleeding,
      including intraventricular hemorrhage as well as the incidence of other morbidities of the
      preterm infant (necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity and infection) and
      assessing neurodevelopmental outcome through two years of age. A total of 480 infants were
      randomized to either inhaled NO or placebo. In summary, this clinical trial will assess the
      efficacy and safety of inhaled nitric oxide for amelioration of a major disease of premature
      infants.
