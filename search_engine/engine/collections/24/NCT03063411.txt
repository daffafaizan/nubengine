      skills - specifically by their ability to maintain and update information (working memory)
      and to suppress inappropriate responses (inhibitory control). These skills undergo
      significant development during the preschool years. Notably, preschool executive function
      skills strongly predict school readiness, as well as concurrent and later academic
      achievements in mathematics. The aim of this project is to test an intervention that is
      specifically designed to improve preschoolers' executive functions - crucially, before the
      achievement gap sets in. The study will be carried out, following CONSORT (2010) guidelines,
      with typically developing preschoolers (aged approximately 4 years of age). The study will
      include children from socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged families. Children will
      be randomly assigned to either an executive function training group or an active control
      group. A nominated person external to the project will conduct the random allocation process.
      The random allocation will be done for each nursery to ensure roughly even numbers in each
      group from each nursery. Children in both groups will complete computerized tasks lasting
      15-20 minutes once a week for four weeks. The investigators will compare the trained children
      to an active control group that closely matches the training in terms of activity. To check
      for improvements, the investigators will measure cognitive and maths skills at baseline (one
      week before training); one week post-training; three months post-training; and one year
      post-training. These assessments will be conducted by testers blind to the child's group.
