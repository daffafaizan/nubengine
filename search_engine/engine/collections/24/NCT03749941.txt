      taskforce of gastroenterologists working on digestive endoscopy: Groupe de Réflexion et
      d'Action des Praticiens Hépatogastroentérologues en Endoscopie Digestive), and
      retrospectively included all patients who have undergone complete resection of their
      pancreatic SPN from 2000 to 2018. The use of the diagnostic filing software of each unit of
      cytopathology, endoscopy and digestive surgery allowed the completeness of the prospection in
      each center.

      The data were retrospectively collected by extraction from our medical patient management
      softwares.

      The following data were collected: age, gender, symptoms, tumor size, tumor location (uncus,
      head, isthmus, body or tail of the pancreas), presence of tumor calcifications, performing of
      a EUS-FNA for diagnostic purposes before surgical resection, follow-up, and diagnosis of
      recurrence of the SPN during follow-up. Other data were collected in case of EUS-FNA: path of
      the needle puncture (transgastric or transduodenal), diameter of the needle, number of
      passes, immediate EUS-FNA morbidity, and EUS-FNA diagnosis of SPN (certain, probable, false
      or absent).

      Patients with and without initial EUS-FNA were compared and the main criteria of this study
      was determinate: the presence of recurrence of the SPN during follow-up.
