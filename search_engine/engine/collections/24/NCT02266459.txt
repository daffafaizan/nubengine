      followed by confirmation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After subject enrollment the
      microwave measurement will be performed. The procedure will take approximately 15 minutes
      (the duration of the actual measurements is < 1 minute) and will not interfere with the
      patient's standard of care at the Stroke Unit.

      The measurement data will be evaluated for the presence of signal artifacts. The diagnostic
      ability of the device will be evaluated using a leave-one-out cross validation method with
      the CT diagnosis as ground truth. Microwave signals are sensitive to the dielectric
      parameters of the investigated object. In biological matter this is often related to amount
      of water. Brain tissue has different dielectric properties from blood. The physiological
      changes inside the brain that occurs as a result of a stroke will change the dielectric
      parameters.
