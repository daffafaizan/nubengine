      cystic fibrosis, chronic inflammatory arthritis) are at risk to develop fragility fractures
      both due to the disease itself and to drugs (mostly corticosteroids) used to treat the
      diseases.

      In addition, children with muscular dystrophy frequently complain of diffuse pain making
      daily care more difficult and almost always develop structural scoliosis.

      The objective of the present protocol is to offer these children a preventive treatment aimed
      at maintaining or increasing their bone mass. We also propose that maintaining bone mass will
      decrease fracture rates, as well as pain and the rate of progression of scoliosis.

      Rigorous care to ensure adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, as well as addition of a
      weekly bisphosphonate, are the central aspect of the project. In addition, we will monitor to
      avoid possible side-effects such as hypercalciuria and kidney stones.
