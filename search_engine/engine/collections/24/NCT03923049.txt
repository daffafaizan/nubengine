    
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to the study will be recruited from the
      Kirklin Clinic and UAB hospitals who will be undergoing FDG-PET/CT for cardiac study as part
      of their standard of care to diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis. MRI and FDG-PET screening
      questionnaire will be completed. A chart review will be completed to obtain data from patient
      medical records pertaining to study including age, gender, race, weight, height, vital signs,
      social and family history, past medical history especially if there is any history of
      hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, heart failure or history of lung diseases,
      lab results including brain natriuretic peptide levels, creatinine, hemoglobin, coagulation
      parameters, results of stress test/left heart catheterization, prior echocardiography if
      available. The CMR will be done solely for research purposes. The patient will be in the
      PET/MRI scanner for cardiac study only for 60-90 minutes, Finally, multi-sequence,
      multi-planar cardiac MR images will be acquired to assess cardiac chamber size, regional wall
      motion abnormalities, ejection fraction, left ventricular perfusion(using gadolinium-based
      agent) and late gadolinium enhancement.

      The investigators will also conduct MRI examinations on 5 healthy volunteers to establish
      cardiac MRI protocol for the PET/MRI scanner. These scans will not involve any FDG
      administration to the healthy volunteers. These will involve cardiac MRI examinations to
      determine the feasibility and quality of MRI scans with the new scanner.
