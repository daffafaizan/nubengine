    
      We are looking for volunteers for this study,wich involves 7 visits over a period of 13
      months, the first visit taking place about 2 weeks prior to the planned surgery.

      Visit 1 - baseline, before starting your pre-operative diet Visit 2 - just before the surgery
      Visit 3 - around the time your first band inflation occurs Visit 4 - 1 month after the band
      inflation Visit 5 - 3 months after the first band inflation Visit 6 - 6 months after the
      first band inflation Visit 7 - 12 months after the first band inflation

      At each visit we do the following tests:

        1. MRS to measure your fat in the liver, pancreas, heart, muscle (leg), subcutaneous fat
           and visceral fat.

        2. Frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test - it is a 3.5 hrs test which
           determines the amount of insulin your body produces and how well your own insulin is
           being used by the body

        3. Body measurements (waist, hip circumference), cholesterol panel, liver function tests,
           HbA1c (to monitor diabetes control), blood pressure, weight.

      We also do an oral glucose tolerance test to check for diabetes on 3 occasions: visit 1,
      visit 5 and at the end, visit 7.
