    
      All treatment is conducted by trained professionals from either the UNC Eating Disorders
      Program (in Chapel Hill) or Western Psychiatric Institute (in Pittsburgh) who are experienced
      in the treatment of eating disorders.

      Participants will participate in 16 1.5 hour long group sessions of group CBT over 20 weeks.
      Groups will include 5-8 participants, one or two co-therapists, and two sessions by a
      registered dietitian. Participants will be expected to complete self-monitoring forms which
      assess their mood and behavior. Groups will either take place face-to-face or online in a
      therapist-moderated chat group.
