      vision, brain function and improvement in bipolar symptoms. The aims are to investigate mood
      levels plus the eye and brain responses to visual contrast stimuli in healthy comparators
      (HC) and bipolar depressed patients.

      Study Design and Methods. Overview. The investigators plan to enroll 18-50 year old adults
      with BD Type I or II and a current episode of major depression on stable-dosed antimanic
      drugs, and age and sex-matched HC - without mental disorders. Depressed patients with BD will
      be assigned randomly to receive active light therapy vs inactive comparator for 6 weeks. The
      investigators will examine responses to contrast stimuli from measures of visual evoked
      potentials and electro-retinography in HC and depressed bipolar patients before and after
      6-weeks of daily midday light therapy. The investigators will assess repeated measures of
      mood symptom levels, attention and circadian rhythms.
