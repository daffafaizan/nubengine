    
      This is a prospective cohort monocentric study.

      The primary objective of this study is to research the vulnerability degree of ateromatous
      plaques before and after a myocardial infarction, based on multiomics data, invasive and
      non-invasive imaging data, in order to characterize the vulnerable coronary plaque and the
      vulnerable patient, in patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina
      or acute myocardial infarction).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  Evaluation of factors associated with the risk for reinfarction in patients with
           vulnerable plaques, according to their imaging characteristics of vulnerability.

        -  Evaluation of predictive factors for reinfarction in patients with vulnerable plaques,
           according to the multiomics profile of the patient.

        -  Determination of the rate of adverse events and MACE rates (Major Adverse Cardiac
           Events) according to the vulnerability degree of the coronary plaque at the index
           moment.

        -  Evaluation of the efficiency of new methodologies for assessing vulnerable plaques:
           coronary shear stress determination, trans-stenotic contrast gradient, quantification of
           coronary plaque components through CT, OCT and IVUS.

        -  Evaluation of the efficiency of non-invasive methodologies for assessment of the
           hemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses.

      Study population: The study lot will be comprised by 100 patients out of which:

        -  lot 1 (substudy 1) - 50 patients with unstable angina type acute coronary syndrome

        -  lot 2 (substudy 2) - 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) that
           occurred 30 days before randomization.
