    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant radiotherapy given
      concurrently with interferon alfa to patients with stage III or recurrent melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive interferon alfa IV over 20 minutes
      daily for 5 consecutive days a week for 4 weeks. Patients then receive radiotherapy on days 2
      and 4 and interferon alfa subcutaneously (SQ) on days 1, 3, and 5 for 2.5 weeks. Interferon
      alfa SQ continues 3 times a week for 10 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every month for 3 months, then every 3 months
      for 2 years, then every six months until year 5, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.75 years.
