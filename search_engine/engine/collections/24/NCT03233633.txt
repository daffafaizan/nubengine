    
      Primary Endpoint: Death or discharge

      Secondary and Exploratory endpoints:Secondary improvement in overall patient well being,
      weight stabilization with increased appetite, improved oxygen saturation, improvement or
      prevention of nausea and vomiting.

      Study design: This will be an open-label study. Patients will choose to participate in a
      Marijuana adjuvant treatment group, receiving marijuana in combination with standard opioid
      therapy.

      Subject number: Minimum 66 patients

      Treatment Duration: Minimum 5 days

      Duration of follow up: Patients' initial opioid dose, dosing schedule and numeric pain score
      will be recorded. For the duration of the study (at least five days) changes in opioid doses
      and numeric pain scores will be tracked daily.

      Marijuana will be administered to the patient via oral route three times daily for at least
      five days. Patients will receive standardized CBD:THC product provided by NIDA.

      On admission to the study, a modified Edmonton Symptom assessment scale to quantify baseline
      appetite, depression, nausea, vomiting, overall well-being, and anxiety.

      Data Tracking: Primary objective tracking will include average numeric pain scores and number
      of opioid dosage increases and average daily opioid amount (mg equivalents of morphine).
      Secondary objectives include Weight, Appetite, N/V, O2 Saturation, Self-reported data points
      from the modified Edmonton Assessment Scale.
