      by hypersensitive reaction to spores of Aspergillus fumigatus. The prevalence of disease is
      about 1-2% in asthmatics and 2-15% in patients with cystic fibrosis. The interest in ABPA
      stems from the fact that the disease is glucocorticoid-sensitive and early treatment can
      prevent progression to end-stage lung disease.

      Systemic steroids remain the mainstay of treatment in ABPA. Antifungal agents are also useful
      as they reduce fungal load. Newer therapies like omalizumab (anti immunoglobulin E [IgE]
      antibody), inhalational amphotericin and Anti Th2 therapies are being studied.

      In pathogenesis of ABPA, there is heightened Th2 activity as a result of type 1
      hypersensitive reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus and levels of Th2 cytokines like IL-3, IL-5
      and IL-13 and IgE levels are increased in patients with ABPA compared with asthma patients
      without ABPA.

      Recently anti Th2 therapies have been suggested as treatment for ABPA. Vitamin D has been
      shown to suppress the Th2 immunity and decrease the levels of Th2 interleukins. Hence, the
      investigators propose to assess the role of vitamin D in treatment of ABPA.
