      approval of a synthetic version of Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA), 1 mg (1 IU), SC. The aim is
      to conduct direct comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg (1 IU) of
      synthetic Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA) with that of GlucaGen® (manufactured by Novo Nordisk
      A/S, marketed by Bedford Laboratories), 1 mg (1 IU), SC in healthy adult subjects. This study
      will examine a comparison of the bioavailability pharmacokinetics of 1 mg (1 IU) of Glucagon
      (Fresenius Kabi USA) by having each subject receive in each period either a single dose of 1
      mg (1 IU) of Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA) or a single dose of GlucaGen® (Bedford
      Laboratories), 1 mg (1 IU), via subcutaneous injection. Blood samples will be collected three
      (3) times starting 2 hours prior to dosing and at intervals over 4 hours post dose. The
      concentrations of glucagon and glucose will be measured.
