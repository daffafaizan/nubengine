    
      Exploratory/correlative objectives: To systematically evaluate HER2/neu
      expression/amplification using standardized scoring criteria for both breast and gastric
      cancer and correlate clinical response in uterine serous carcinoma patients with HER2/neu
      scoring results. To correlate objective response rate, PFS and overall survival with the
      presence/absence of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit and F-box/WD
      repeat-containing protein mutations by standard Sanger sequencing, and presence/absence of
      Cyclin E2 overexpression by IHC in endometrial cancer patients overexpressing HER2/neu
      treated with Afatinib. To study HER2/neu extracellular domain circulating levels in the
      plasma of uterine serous carcinoma patients overexpressing HER2/neu before and during
      Afatinib treatment to elucidate whether changes in HER2/neu extracellular domain would
      predict response to Afatinib and to determine peripheral blood natural killer cell numbers
      and activity in HER2/neu+ uterine serous carcinoma patients before and during Afatinib
      treatment to assess the possible therapeutic contributions of immune mechanisms of action of
      Afatinib.
