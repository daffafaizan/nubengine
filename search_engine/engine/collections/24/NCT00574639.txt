      patients with diabetes to enjoy all the benefits of good glycemic control without the
      damaging limitations of severe hypoglycemia. The specific aim of this study is to determine
      if gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA A) receptors plays a role in the development of exercise
      associated autonomic dysfunction in type 1 diabetes and healthy man.
