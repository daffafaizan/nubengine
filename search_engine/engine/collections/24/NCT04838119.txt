      and across geographically diverse parts of the United States, summarized weekly, from the
      onset of the pandemic in Spring 2020 to the present time. Study will also gather
      contemporaneous data on weekly community COVID cases diagnosed, local positive test
      percentage, hospital admissions and ICU admissions for COVID-19, and deaths from COVID 19.
      Similar data will be obtained from a coalition of approximately 20 academic medical centers
      from around the United States, with Wake Forest School of Medicine, Department of
      Anesthesiology serving as the coordinating center. No individual patient information will be
      collected. Aggregated testing data, hospital disease burden, and local disease prevalence are
      all publicly reported.

      We will analyze the data as interrupted time series.
