      healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, adiposity and race/ethnicity, patients with
      adrenal insufficiency, whether primary or secondary, have disturbances of the circadian
      system that are associated with high day to day variability of sleep time as well as elevated
      markers of cardio-metabolic risk, including abnormal oral glucose tolerance and reduced
      nocturnal blood pressure dipping.

      A secondary hypothesis of the study is that adrenal insufficiency patients on a replacement
      regimen (as part of their standard of care ongoing treatment) that results in daytime
      cortisol profiles approximating the normal diurnal variation will have better
      cardio-metabolic function than adrenal insufficiency patients who have grossly abnormal
      cortisol profiles.
