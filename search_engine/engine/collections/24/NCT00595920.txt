      TERMS study will immediately be eligible for Tovaxin production and treatment in this open
      label extension study. The MRTC negative subjects will be monitored quarterly for safety,
      MRTC reactivity, paraclinical and clinical effect. Subjects who become MRTC positive during
      the monitoring phase will then be eligible for Tovaxin production and treatment in this
      study.
