        1. Observe changes in bowel pattern based on gum-chewing

        2. Examine bowel function after anterior lumbar interbody fusion

        3. Measure length of time to return of bowel function after anterior lumbar interbody
           fusion

        4. Compare return of bowel function in patients who chew gum and patients standardized to
           usual post-operative care

        5. Measure the hospital length of stay amongst study groups

        6. Measure post-operative pain amongst study groups

      Background (Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc.):

      One or two level anterior lumbar interbody fusions are designed to correct lumbar spondylosis
      and spondylolisthesis, which can cause debilitating back and leg pain. This surgery involves
      an anterior approach, which often requires displacement of bowel for the length of the
      surgery. Patients frequently have a slow return of bowel function secondary to anesthetic
      time, opioid use, and primarily due to the bowel displacement intraoperatively. Because this
      is a one or two level surgery, many patients would benefit from same-day discharge but often
      remain inpatient several days due to slow return of bowel function.

      Gum chewing has been shown to decrease the time for return to bowel function (RBF) in
      colorectal and gynecology patients postoperatively.

      Gum chewing and RBF has been studied in the spine population for posterior operations but not
      anterior spine surgery. This study aims to identify whether chewing gum has an impact on
      patient's report of pain, RBF, length of stay, and subjective report of satisfaction
      post-operatively. This could be an outpatient operation; however, pain and RBF often prevent
      patients from discharging home the same day of surgery.
