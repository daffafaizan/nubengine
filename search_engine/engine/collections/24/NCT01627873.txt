      (Fentanyl vs Remifentanil) during major abdominal surgery on postoperative cognitive status
      of patients. In particular, whether there is a correlation between type of anesthesia and the
      appearance of postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD), including type of anesthesia and
      levels of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and investigate whether there is an association
      between presence or absence of POCD and cytokines levels
