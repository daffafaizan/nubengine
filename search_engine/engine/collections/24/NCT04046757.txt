      best medical therapy (BMT) on patients with recent cerebral infarct and anterior circulation
      intracranial large vessel occlusion.

      In the Occitanie-Est region (ex Languedoc Roussillon), comprising 6 Stroke Unit, only the
      Comprehensive Stroke Unit of the CHU de Montpellier has a centre of interventional
      neuroradiology (NRI) that can perform mechanical thrombectomy.

      Patients suspected of stroke are referred to the nearest SU, then the candidates for
      thrombectomy, are transferred secondarily to the Stroke Center in Montpellier.

      Currently, there is no evidence that an initial management in a proximity stroke unit and a
      secondary transfer for a mechanical thrombectomy is associated with a loss of chance for
      patients, compared to patients initially treated at the Stroke Center regional reference.

      The objective of the study is to compare clinical outcome on patients admitted first in the
      Comprehensive Stroke Center of Montpellier those transferred after Proximity Stroke Unit or
      directly admitted when high suspicion of large vessel occlusion.
