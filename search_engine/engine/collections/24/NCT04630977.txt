      design. The participants recruited will be active, middle-aged and older healthy adults. The
      supplement intake will be a Pre-workout supplement intake or a placebo intake. The exercise
      training will be a Progressive Resistance Training, with sessions of ~1 hour (3 times/week).
      The intervention will last for a minimum of one year and the possibility to prolong it to
      another one (two years of intervention) if the adherence to the treatment was higher to the
      75% of the participants (of, at least, 85% of the training sessions and supplementation
      intake).

      The outcomes that will be assessed are: Body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass),
      physical performance (short test designed by Go Fit Lab: single-leg standing balance,
      upper-body strength - maximum number of push-ups repetitions in 15 seconds -, lower-body
      mechanical power - vertical jump -, agility/velocity - 30 seconds of static running at
      maximum velocity -, recovery assessment - 60 seconds monitoring of heart rate after the
      previous test -), Happiness Score (designed by Go Fit, including different self-reported
      validated tests, such as: Par-Q+, ACSM Cardiovascular Risk Factors Questionnaire, SF-12 for
      quality of life and self-perceived health status, PSS-4 Stress and mental health, Pittsburgh
      Sleeping Quality test, PREDIMED test: adherence to Mediterranean diet eating patterns, and
      the IPAQ short form), and for every workout: Self-perceived energy feeling (Questionnaire:
      Energy Level, Fatigue, Alertness and Focus for the Task), Rate of Perceived Exertion (OMNI
      RES Scale and Borg Scale) and adherence to regular physical exercise practise, healthy
      nutritional patterns, and supplement intake.
