      popular among strength athletes, has not been unequivocally assessed in the high-intensity
      sport disciplines that Crossfit belongs to. There is also a lack of data in these disciplines
      about the potential longer adaptation of athletes to the very low carbohydrate intake
      resulting from the ketogenic diet and its impact in high-intensity Crossfit training.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of a 4-week KD and a
      CHO-LGI diet on physical and specific performance capacity, exercise metabolism, as well as
      concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in Crossfit- trained athletes, in a
      randomised and parallel trial.
