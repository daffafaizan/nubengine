      I. To compare positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET/MR) and contrast enhanced
      computerized tomography (CECT) to determine the accuracy in patients with advanced-stage
      serous ovarian cancer or highly suspected ovarian cancer using diagnostic laparoscopy as the
      gold standard with respect to lesion detection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES (EXPLORATORY):

      I. Correlating imaging findings such as enhancement pattern, apparent diffusion coefficient
      (ADC) values, standardized uptake value (SUV) values, and advanced image analytics such as
      texture with pathology and genomic analysis for those lesions evaluated as a discovery arm.

      II. Assess whether MR (multiparametric and functional) and PET findings predict response to
      platinum based chemotherapy.

      III. To compare PET/MR and contrast enhanced CT to predict tumor negative (R0) resection
      using surgery as the gold standard.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care CECT scan and PET-MRI scan over 90-120 minutes within 30
      days before laparoscopy or cytoreduction. Patients who do not undergo cytoreduction based on
      diagnostic laparoscopy undergo additional PET-MRI and standard of care CECT scans after
      completion of chemotherapy and before cytoreduction.
