    
      This is a Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical study, in which
      40 patients with breast cancer associated secondary lymphedema will be randomized 1:1 either
      to Lymfactin® (1 x 10E11 viral particles, vp) or placebo (0.9% physiological saline) group.

      The study product (Lymfactin® or placebo solution) will be administered as a single dose in a
      volume of two (2) mL, by ex vivo perinodal injection into the fat pad of a flap of tissue
      containing lymph nodes from the patient's own abdominal wall or the groin area. This flap of
      tissue will then be surgically implanted into the axillary region of the affected arm. This
      treatment with the study product is performed in combination with a surgical lymph node
      transfer, in conjunction with or without breast reconstruction surgery.

      Patients will be followed-up for efficacy and safety according to a specified schedule up to
      5 years post-treatment.
