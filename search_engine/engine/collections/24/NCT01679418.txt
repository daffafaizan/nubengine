      describe PONV as more irritant in the postoperative course than the endured pain.
      Postoperative drains are put after thyroid surgery to early recognize bleeding and to collect
      wound secretion to avoid pressure on the trachea. Whether wound drains do impact on PONV is
      not known. Therefore, we tested the impact of wound drains on PONV after thyroid- and
      parathyroid surgery in a randomized controlled clinical trial.
