      five-year survival from breast cancer is lower in Hispanic than in non-Hispanic White women.
      This reduced survival has a number of potential causes, but differential screening rates may
      be a partial explanation, since Hispanic women have lower breast cancer screening rates than
      non-Hispanic White women. The overall purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a
      culturally-appropriate intervention aimed at increasing screening mammography rates in a
      clinic-based sample of predominantly Mexican American women in Western Washington.

      The recruitment goal of the Fortaleza Latina study is approximately 500 Latina women aged
      40-74 who have had a clinic visit within the past 5 years, but no recent mammogram, from the
      four selected Community Health Center clinics. After providing informed consent and
      completing a baseline assessment, eligible women are randomly assigned to intervention or
      comparison group, within clinic. The individual-level intervention implements motivational
      interviewing (MI) in two participant encounters. MI is a direct counseling style, led by a
      promotora (lay health advisor), that elicits behavior change by helping participants explore
      and resolve ambivalence.

      Of the 2194 women contacted by field interviewers, a total of 710 surveys have been
      completed; of these, 542 were eligible and have been randomized and enrolled into the
      Fortaleza Latina study (279 intervention, 263 usual care).
