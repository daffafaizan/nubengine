      randomized to receive 2 daily doses of either nebulised RNS60 or placebo (n=28 per group) for
      22 days. On day 19 they will undergo an exercise protocol to induce muscle damage and blood
      samples will be taken on days 19, 20, 21 and 23 to determine the effects on CK and hsCRP. ROM
      and pain VAS assessments will also be completed.
