    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tissue localization of 111In-BC8-DOTA antibody therapy (Ab) and establish
      reproducibly favorable biodistribution.

      II. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation delivered via 90Y-BC8-DOTA Ab
      when combined with fludarabine phosphate (FLU) and 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) as a
      preparative regimen followed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, related or unrelated
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for patients with multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the potential efficacy of this approach, within the limits of a phase I study,
      by examining disease response, duration of remission, disease free survival (DFS), and
      overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8
      (90Y-BC8 Ab).

      Patients receive 90Y-BC8 Ab intravenously (IV) on day -12 and fludarabine phosphate IV on
      days -4 to -2. Patients undergo TBI and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant on
      day 0. Patients also receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 180 or on days -3 to 100 with taper
      to 180; and mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO BID on days 0-27, or 0-40 with taper to 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.
