    
      This is an observational study with 3 groups, which are identified using a screening tool to
      obtain information on exposure to vitamin A programs and consumption of vitamin A-rich foods
      and supplements. Children and their mothers are studied over the course of one month to
      determine 1) child total body vitamin A stores, using the 13C retinol isotope dilution
      method, 2) the child's vitamin A intake, using multiple dietary assessment methods, 3) total
      breast milk intake (among breastfeeding children), using the dose-to-mother deuterium
      dilution method, and 4) potential biomarkers of excessive vitamin A status, including markers
      of bone and liver health. Blood collection is structured in a "Super-Child" design, to
      construct plasma retinol kinetic curves. Other indicators related to vitamin A nutrition
      among children will be measured, in addition to the vitamin A intake and breast milk vitamin
      A concentration (for breastfeeding mothers) of the mother.
