    
      This will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio)clinical trial of
      frozen-thawed embryo transfer vs. fresh embryo transfer after a uniform
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in infertile PCOS patients
      receiving IVF therapy. Qualified 1180 patients are randomized into either of two groups:
      group A will undergo fresh embryo transfer (590 cases), Group B will undergo elective
      cryopreservation of all embryos followed by transfer of thawed embryos to a programmed
      endometrium (590 cases). All of the participants will receive recombinant follicule
      stimulating hormone (rFSH)/GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation and standardized
      luteal phase support.

      The target population will be infertile PCOS patients aged between 20 and 35 years, diagnosed
      by the Chinese PCOS Criteria(i.e. menstrual disorders PLUS either one of the remaining two
      criteria, hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, with exclusion of secondary
      causes of hyperandrogenism and ovulation dysfunction). And subjects will be those who are
      undergoing their first IVF or intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle without other
      known factors interfere reproductive or metabolic functions.

      The randomization will take place at the oocyte pick-up day by an on-line randomization
      system.

      The pregnancy test results, pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies neonatal
      complications will be followed up by checking medical records and telephone calls.
