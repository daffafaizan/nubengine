    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of veliparib to use in combination with
      cisplatin and etoposide (CE). (Phase I) II. To determine whether the addition of ABT-888
      (veliparib) to cisplatin etoposide (CE) results in improved progression free survival (PFS)
      over CE with placebo in the frontline therapy of newly diagnosed extensive stage small cell
      lung cancer. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival (OS) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888.
      (Phase II) II. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) as well as complete response rate
      (CRR) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888. (Phase II) III. To determine the
      toxicity profile of the combination of ABT-888 and CE chemotherapy in this patient
      population. (Phase II)

      OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct exploratory correlative analysis of the impact of the select biomarkers. (Phase
      II) II. To compare the overall toxicity profile and specifically the incidence and severity
      of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with the addition of ABT-888 to CE. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

      Phase I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, etoposide
      intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM D: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on
      days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM E: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days
      1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.
