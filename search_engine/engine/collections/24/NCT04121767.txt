      of atrial fibrillation (AF), which is often associated with sudden death and stroke.
      Medication and percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation are commonly used treatment
      modalities. Pharmacotherapy is primarily symptomatic treatment; moreover, the effect of
      conversion to a normal rhythm is minimal, and mainly aimed at stabilizing heart rate.
      Catheter ablation is associated with a high incidence of recurrence in chronic AF, and it is
      difficult to treat left atrial appendage, thereby preventing discontinuation of
      anticoagulation therapy post procedure. Thoracoscopic ablation is known to be a less invasive
      and more effective modality to treat patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. However,
      anticoagulation therapy is mandatory in the early postoperative period due to intracardiac
      thromboembolism associated with atrial stunning despite conversion to a sinus rhythm and
      resection of the left atrial appendage. Further investigation would be required to assess the
      efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants such as edoxaban compared to that of
      warfarin for stroke prevention during the early postoperative period (6 months) after a
      thoracoscopic procedure. The need to maintain a constant level of blood coagulation and the
      potential development of complications such as hemorrhages are drawbacks associated with the
      use of warfarin. While novel oral anticoagulants such as edoxaban do have a role in atrial
      fibrillation, data regarding their effectiveness and incidence of complications after
      arrhythmia surgery do not exist. In this study, we will compare warfarin and edoxaban with
      respect to safety and efficacy, after they are used for 6 months following thoracoscopic
      ablation in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation
