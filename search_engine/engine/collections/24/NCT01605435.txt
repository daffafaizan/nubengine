      study in frail individuals. Using data from our previous study and the published literature,
      we have designed a single blind, single dose administration study in which we will examine
      food intake after ghrelin administration and metabolic parameters (plasma glucose, insulin,
      free fatty acids, and cortisol) pre and post ghrelin administration.We have selected a dose
      range using our own and previously published studies from which we will determine
      subcutaneous doses to use in subsequent studies. The selection criteria for subsequent
      studies will be the dose that maximizes food intake by more than 30% without inducing
      hyperglycemia or raising cortisol levels. Participants must meet all inclusion criteria and
      have no exclusion criteria. Data will be analyzed after the first three participants have
      completed the protocol and used to inform dose modifications for the next three participants.
      Data from this portion of the study will be analyzed immediately after its completion, to
      allow updates to the design of the next study.
