      and the intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) of Soroka Medical Center. It will include patients
      who suffer from AMI, patients with CKD with and without any cardiac disease and patients with
      no known renal or cardiac disease.

      The following information and measurements will be collected:

      Demographics - age, sex, weight, height. Past medical history - specifically regarding renal
      and cardiac diseases and procedures.

      Measured variables in blood serum - troponin T, troponin I, creatinine, total protein,
      albumin, myoglobin Measured variables in urine - troponin T, troponin I, creatinine, total
      protein, albumin, microalbumin, Î²2-microglobulin Calculations - GFR (according to MDRD
      equation), troponin correction to creatinine (gr troponin per gr creatinine), troponin
      excretion ( ), urine albumin/creatinine ratio, urine protein/creatinine ratio.
