      early luteinizing hormone (LH) activity deficit induced after ovarian stimulation with
      exogenous gonadotropins will be partly covered by the bolus of hCG used for triggering of
      final oocyte maturation due to the long half-life of hCG. In addition, the luteal phase will
      be covered by exogenous progesterone supplementation. After successful implantation the
      embryo itself will provide the supportive LH activity, securing the function of the corpora
      lutea. However, during the early luteal phase and peri-implantation, recent data suggest that
      an early-mid-luteal hCG/LH deficiency exists after hCG trigger during which the corpus luteum
      lacks an optimal stimulation. Furthermore, the early luteal progesterone profile in IVF
      differs significantly from the progesterone profile of the natural cycle, in which the peak
      is reached around the time of implantation. With this non-invasive trial, we wish to further
      explore the early luteal phase profiles of progesterone, 17-Hydroxyprogesterone and hCG in
      order to optimize current luteal phase support policies in IVF and hopefully increase ongoing
      pregnancy rates.
