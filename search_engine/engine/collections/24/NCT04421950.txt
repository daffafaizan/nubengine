      polyphenol-derived metabolites in plasma and urine for children ages 11-12 years supplemented
      short term with wild blueberry powder. The study will assess if a short-term supplementation
      (5 days) with wild blueberry powder impacts immune responses as well as markers for
      cardiovascular and bone health. Up to 44 children will be recruited. The participants will
      attend three visits at Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center.
