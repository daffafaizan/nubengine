    
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Replagal in patients with Fabry disease
      who are either naive to treatment, who were previously treated with agalsidase beta, or who
      had previously received Replagal.

      Patients diagnosed with Fabry disease who have not previously received treatment, who have
      received agalsidase beta, or who had previously received Replagal will be eligible to enroll
      in the study and will receive Replagal at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight administered by an
      IV infusion over 40 minutes every other week.

      This study will be conducted in the United States.

      Study visits will occur in 3 phases:

        -  Screening/Baseline Phase: A Screening/Baseline period (Day -30 to Day -1) to determine
           eligibility and obtain baseline measurements. Patients who have previously received
           agalsidase beta will be tested for the presence of anti-agalsidase beta antibodies.

        -  Treatment Phase: A 12-month treatment phase during which all patients will receive
           Replagal administered IV every other week. Clinical assessments will occur at Months 1,
           3, 6, 9, and 12. The study may be extended to continue giving patients access to
           treatment.

        -  End-of-Study Phase: An end-of-study contact either as an office visit or follow-up
           telephone call will occur one month after the last infusion.
