      overweight than their typically developing peers. The consequences of childhood obesity
      include increased risk for Type-2 diabetes, orthopedic problems, sleep apnea, elevated
      cardiovascular risk and menstrual irregularities. Research indicating a high prevalence of
      overweight, obesity, low fitness levels and other health problems among adults with DS
      suggest the need for more attention to health promotion among adolescents with DS, which has
      been limited to date. Educational interventions in nutrition and physical activity have not
      been tested through randomized clinical trial with families of adolescents with DS; nor have
      behavioral "lifestyle change" interventions based on Social Cognitive Theory. Among typical
      populations, the addition of training in behavior and lifestyle change to education-alone
      interventions increasingly is being seen as critical in helping to promote long-term weight
      loss and weight maintenance. The hypothesis of this study is that a parent supported weight
      reduction (PSWR) intervention that combines behavioral strategies with nutrition and activity
      education (NAE) will be more effective in reducing overweight in adolescents with DS than a
      program that provides NAE alone or a Wait-List (WL) control.
