      treatment will be randomised to receive standard nutritional support with placebo (15ml/day
      Sunflower oil, control group) or nutritional support with omega-3 FA supplementation
      (15ml/day Echium oil, experimental group) during radio(chemo)therapy. All patients will
      undergo a nutritional screening (Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment), a quality
      of life evaluation (EORTC QLQ C30 & HN35) and will be asked to keep a 3-day food diary at the
      start of their therapy, and again during the 4th week and the end of therapy. Body
      composition and grip strength will be measured with bio-electrical impedance (BIA) analysis,
      Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the JAMAR® hydraulic hand dynamometer once at baseline,
      and again in the 4th week of therapy. Blood samples are collected at baseline, and in the 4th
      week of therapy to (1) verify compliance rate by measuring fatty acid concentration, (2)
      verify the presence of potential biomarkers that can predict cachexia and (3) to detect the
      presence of SNPs associated with severe acute dysphagia. Demographic data, tumour
      characteristics and therapy-related toxicity will also be collected.

      Population Newly diagnosed non-metastatic (stage I-IVB) head and neck cancer patients (≥18 or
      older) eligible for curative primary or adjuvant radiotherapy with or without systemic
      therapy
