      efficacy, and pharmacokinetic profile of two doses of EPA-E in adult subjects with NASH.
      Subjects are required to have a liver biopsy with proven NASH in the 6 month period prior to
      screening. Up to 70 subjects will be enrolled into each treatment arm in a 1:1:1 ratio, for a
      total of 210 subjects. Subjects will be stratified at randomization by presence or absence of
      diabetes. Duration of treatment is 12 months.
