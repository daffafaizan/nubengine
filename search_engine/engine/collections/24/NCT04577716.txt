      programmes and pre-emptive surgical repair are lifesaving. Traditional open surgical repair
      is associated with major perioperative morbidity and mortality and there has been a move
      towards minimally invasive Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR), which reduces these early
      risks. However, the cost effectiveness and long-term clinical effectiveness of EVAR is
      undermined by concerns of durability due to the development of endoleaks and late aneurysm
      rupture secondary to progression of native aortic aneurysm disease and stent graft failure.
      It has previously been demonstrated that 18F-Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography can
      predict progression of aneurysm disease and is associated with greater rates of abdominal
      aortic aneurysm expansion and the future risk of rupture or surgical repair.

      The investigators here wish to examine whether 18F-Sodium Fluoride on Positron Emission
      Tomography uptake (i) is increased in patients with endoleaks or related complications, (ii)
      can prospectively predict the likelihood of developing endoleaks in patients undergoing EVAR,
      and (ii) is a feasible approach to select patients for EVAR with a reduced future risk of
      stent graft failure and re-intervention. The investigators believe that there is a compelling
      scientific rationale for this approach with major translational potential to better select
      subgroups of patients for EVAR and ultimately improve their outcome.
