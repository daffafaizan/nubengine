    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded crossover study designed to
      compare conventional burst stimulation parameters to two different burst microdosing
      paradigms.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the three groups. Each group will evaluate all 3
      stimulation paradigms in different order.
