      novel interventions to prevent significant sequelae (e.g. neurosyphilis) and onward
      transmission of untreated infections. Despite longstanding public health efforts to encourage
      conventional strategies of STI prevention, gbMSM continue to bear the burden of syphilis
      which poses synergistic effects in the transmission of HIV. This study will add to this field
      through providing the first methodologically rigorous, prospective multicentre, open-label
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of doxycycline-based STI PrEP (daily 100mg doxycycline) and
      STI PEP (200mg doxycycline after exposure event) versus standard-of-care for the prevention
      of bacterial STIs among gbMSM over 15 months (60 weeks) of follow-up with adequate power to
      address drug efficacy in the prevention of bacterial STIs. Beyond the determination of
      efficacy, our trial will provide insight to the unique challenges of medication adherence
      through assessing the acceptability, tolerability and safety of therapy with doxycycline.
      This study aims to provide health care providers one additional tool to address the burden of
      STIs in populations with an increased likelihood of infection.
