      KDIGO 2012 guidelines on acute kidney injury (AKI) suggest the adoption of RCA as first
      choice anticoagulation modality for continuous RRT (CRRT) in patients without
      contraindications for citrate. Citrate has been also introduced as anticoagulant for SLED and
      its use in the context of a mainly diffusive prolonged intermittent modality has been shown
      to represent an easy and safe method to maintain the extracorporeal circuit when concentrated
      citrate solutions, such as ACD-A are used. Hypophosphatemia is a known issue of RRT, and has
      been reported in up to 50-80% of cases when standard RRT solutions are used, especially in
      continuous/prolonged intermitted modalities when high RRT doses are delivered. RRT-related
      phosphate depletion should be avoided in critically ill patients due to the relevant
      hypophosphatemia-associated complications in this clinical setting. The adoption of
      phosphate-containing CRRT solutions could reduce the incidence of hypophosphatemia and
      minimize the need for parenteral phosphorus supplementation.The adoption of a commercially
      available phosphate-containing CRRT solution, in the setting of RCA-RRT may allow to meet the
      double target of minimizing RRT-induced hypophosphatemia and ensuring an adequate circuit
      life, also avoiding electrolyte and acid-base derangements.
