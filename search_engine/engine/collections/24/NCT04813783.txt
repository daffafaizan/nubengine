      agents and immunosuppressive treatments during the treatment, therefore they are at high risk
      of complications. Gastrointestinal mucositis is the leading factor affecting the quality of
      life of the child among the chemotherapy-related complications.

      Gastrointestinal mucositis (GM) can be defined as inflammation or ulceration in the
      gastrointestinal organs due to chemotherapy treatment. Symptoms of GM include abdominal pain,
      diarrhoea, bleeding, fatigue, malnutrition, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and secondary
      infections. GM can present in two forms as oral and anal mucositis. Both oral and anal all
      GMs have negative effects on growth and development in children. One of the main issues of
      the remedial approach in this regard is the provision of qualified mucositis care. There are
      studies in the literature that include parent training for the prevention and care of
      mucositis.

      Many national and international organizations have emphasized the responsibility of the nurse
      in patient education and stated it in the relevant laws and regulations. The regulations
      focus on the educative role of the nurse for patients. In pediatric oncology clinics where
      leukaemia treatment and care is provided, the educational role of the nurse is directed
      towards the child individual and their family, and determining and meeting the educational
      needs of the whole family is vital in the nursing management of the child with cancer.

      In this context, this study aims to examine the effect of mucositis care training to
      caregivers of pediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years, on the development of mucositis and the
      clinic's "mucosal barrier damage, laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infections".
