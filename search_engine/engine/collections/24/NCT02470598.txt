      volume and long dwell/large volume can improve the effectiveness of APD. However, these
      studies have been performed in a small number of patients during a short observation period.

      The aim of this study is to assess the hydration status of PD patients treated with aAPD and
      observe its development during one year using the BCM-Body Composition Monitor (BCM), a
      bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) device. In addition, it is intended to observe the
      variability of aAPD prescriptions and their influence on the hydration status of the
      patients.

      This is a purely non-interventional, observational study, where treatment decisions are
      completely guided by the discretion of the attending nephrologists.
