      of proteins and thereby inactivates these cleaved proteins. It was shown, that CD26 cleaves
      SDF-1 into a non-mitogenic molecule. Inhibition or deletion of CD26 leads to an increased
      homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow after transplantation by
      increasing the invasion capacity of these cells {Campbell et al. 2008; Christopherson et al.
      2004}.

      The cytokine SDF-1 is released in response to hypoxia, is crucial for progenitor cell homing
      and recruitment of cells for neovascularisation. Invasion capacity is closely related to the
      cytokine SDF-1 and the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 {Ceradini et al. 2004}. The in vivo
      neovascularisation capacity of progenitor cells is closely correlated to their functional
      capacity as SDF-1 induced invasion or colony-forming capacity {Heeschen et al. 2004; Britten
      et al. 2003; Assmus et al. 2007}.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      inhibitor vildagliptin on endothelial function as well as number and functional activity of
      progenitor cells in patients with documented diabetes mellitus.
