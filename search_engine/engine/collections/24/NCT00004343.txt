      and petrosal vein measurements of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and
      corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Patients also have a 2-day, low-dose dexamethasone
      suppression test.

      Patients with ACTH tumors are referred for pituitary surgery as indicated. Patients without
      Cushing's syndrome are entered as controls. During scheduled radiologic procedures, these
      subjects undergo ACTH and CRH sampling from the petrosal vein or cavernous sinus following a
      deuterated cortisol infusion.
