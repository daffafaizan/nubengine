    
      This is an open-label, sequential, single centre pharmacokinetic (PK) study investigating the
      effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate and
      plasma tenofovir when coadministered with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate during the
      maintenance phase of tuberculosis treatment in TB/HIV-1 coinfected participants (EpiTAF).

      An open-label, sequential, pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction study will be conducted
      in medically stable virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults coinfected with TB, who
      are in the maintenance phase of their TB treatment. After intensive PK evaluation of IC
      TFV-DP and pTFV, participants will be switched from their standard-of-care tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC/EFV regimen, to TAF + 3TC + EFV at the start of the study
      treatment period. After 28 days each participant will have intensive PK evaluation of IC
      TFV-DP and pTFV on TAF + 3TC + EFV with rifampicin (RIF). After the second intensive PK
      assessment is completed, participants will be switched back to TDF/FTC/EFV, with a final
      intensive PK evaluation of IC TFV-DP and pTFV 8 days after completion of TB treatment, at the
      final study visit. Eighteen volunteers will be enrolled for a target of 13 participants
      completing the study.

      The study includes screening and enrolment visits, 1 visit on day 28 and an end of study
      visit 28 days after the end of TB treatment.
