      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of TNF-bound colloidal gold (CYT-6091) in patients
           with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicities of CYT-6091 in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of CYT-6091 in these patients.

        -  Evaluate biopsy samples of tumor and adjoining normal tissue for levels of CYT-6091.

        -  Determine if antitumor effects of CYT-6091 occur in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive TNF-bound colloidal gold (CYT-6091) IV on days 1 and 15 (course 1).
      Approximately 4-6 weeks later, patients are re-staged and responding patients may receive
      another course of therapy. Patients may receive up to 3 re-treatment courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CYT-6091 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during the first course of therapy
      for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for the next year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
