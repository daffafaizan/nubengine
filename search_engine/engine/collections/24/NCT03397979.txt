      disease in children with AD, we implemented a randomized clinical trial using a single-blind,
      crossover-controlled design. Patients received the same moisturizer, cleanser, and class VI
      topical corticosteroid (TCS), and only bathing varied. After a 1 week run-in, children were
      randomized 1:1 into 2 groups: Group 1 underwent twice weekly soak-and-seal baths for 2 weeks
      ("dry method") followed by twice daily soak-and-seal baths for 2 weeks ("wet method"), and
      group 2 did the converse. A single treating physician assessed outcomes and, along with those
      analyzing the data, was masked to group assignment. Participants and their caregivers could
      not be masked. Analyses were based on intention to treat.
