      that put them at risk for poor outcomes. Electronic health records capture large amounts of
      information that may help guide decisions, but existing alert and reminder-based clinical
      decision support (CDS) frameworks do not adequately apply multiple overlapping care
      guidelines to complex patient histories to produce coherent clinical recommendations.

      The primary objective of the study is to design and evaluate the usability of a CDS
      intervention to improve the quality of primary care for low birth weight (LBW) and very low
      birth weight (VLBW) premature infants from the time of intensive care nursery discharge
      through 24 months corrected gestational age
