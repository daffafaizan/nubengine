    
      Part 1 is comprised of a single-dose, part-randomized, open-label, 6-way crossover in 12
      healthy participants. Participants will be dosed on 6 separate occasions (in 6 treatment
      periods), and will receive a single prototype of BOS172767 in each treatment period.

      Part 2 is comprised of a single ascending dose, fixed-sequence, open-label, 3-way crossover
      with an optional fourth dosing period in 10 healthy participants. Participants will be dosed
      on 4 separate occasions (in 4 treatment periods), and will receive a single prototype of
      BOS172767 in each treatment period.

      Part 3 is a double-blind (sponsor-open), placebo-controlled, randomized MAD part in 36
      healthy participants (12 per study cohort). Participants will be dosed on 3 separate
      occasions (in 3 treatment periods), and will receive a single prototype of BOS172767 in each
      treatment period.

      Parts 2 and 3 are contingent upon successful completion of Part 1.
