    
      MORAb-004 is a monoclonal antibody directed against endosialin, a cell surface glycoprotein,
      which is expressed on cells involved in tumor vasculature. Studies have found endosialin to
      play a key role in tumor growth and neovessel formation in numerous cancer types including
      (but not limited to) renal, breast, colon, pancreatic, lung, endometrial, ovarian, melanoma,
      sarcoma, and neuroectodermal tumors. Preclinical pharmacological studies have shown that
      MORAb-004 is a potentially useful anti-cancer agent. This clinical trial is being performed
      to determine the safety of MORAb-004 in subjects with solid tumors, as well as to establish
      serum pharmacokinetics of the antibody, and to assess tumor antigens that may serve as
      predictors of a response to MORAb-004. Study Part 2 was added to enroll subjects with
      specific histological diagnoses (colorectal cancer and soft tissue sarcoma) to further
      characterize the safety and tolerability of 5 dose levels of MORAb-004 previously tested
      during the dose escalation in Part 1.
