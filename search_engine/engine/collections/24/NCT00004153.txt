        -  Determine the feasibility of performing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
           (RT-PCR) for five different tumor antigen genes using lymph node samples or peripheral
           blood from patients with melanoma.

        -  Determine the ability of PCR-positive lymph nodes or peripheral blood to predict relapse
           of disease in these patients.

        -  Determine the correlation of positive PCR results from peripheral blood with disease
           stage.

      OUTLINE: Lymph node biopsies or peripheral blood are obtained from patients. These specimens
      are examined by nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed
      for various tumor antigens.

      Patients may choose to be told the results of this testing, but the results do not influence
      or change the planned therapy. Brief counseling is required to discuss the results and their
      potential implications.

      Patients are followed for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients for the lymph node portion and 80 patients (20 per
      stage of disease) for the peripheral blood portion will be accrued for this study within 3
      years.
