      premature infants. Lung inflammation plays a major role in its pathogenesis. Systemic
      steroids can be given to control this inflammatory process but their widespread use is
      limited by their systemic side effects and concerns for long neurodevelopmental adverse
      sequelae. Delivering steroids by inhalation which has been proven to be effective in young
      infants with asthma has been shown to be unsatisfactory for ELBW infants with BPD. This may
      be due to the fact that current delivery devices do not meet the requirements of the specific
      anatomical and physiologic characteristics of the airways and breathing patterns in this
      special group of patients. A novel approach to facilitate delivery directly to the lungs,
      thereby avoiding systemic concerns has been demonstrated in a recent study in which
      budesonide ( a topical steroid) was given to ventilated preterm infants using surfactant as a
      vehicle.
