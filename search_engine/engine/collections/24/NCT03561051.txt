      a complaint of chest pain and are subsequently attended by the ambulance service. A blood
      sample will be taken in the ambulance as well as information about the participant's
      symptoms, past medical history, physical examination findings and heart tracing findings. The
      participant will then be transferred to hospital, where another blood sample will be taken.
      Both of these blood samples will be analysed at a later date for the cardiac marker,
      troponin.

      Participants will then be followed up after 30 days via screening of their clinical records
      and contacting their GP. The investigators will gather information on the participant's
      initial admission to hospital, as well as any further hospital admissions and investigations
      that have occurred within the 30 days since this admission. The information collected will
      include data on serial cardiac marker testing; other laboratory analyses; length of stay; all
      imaging investigations and procedures; and details of any haemorrhagic complications.
