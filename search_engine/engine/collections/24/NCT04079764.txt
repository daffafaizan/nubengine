      patients with Bosniak III or IV choosing either active surveillance or surgery will be
      monitored closely. OBJECTIVES - PRIMARY Validate the feasibility issues (acceptability,
      recruitment rate, costs, protocol adherence and implementation of imaging central review) of
      an observational study on the treatments of complex cysts. SECONDARY a- Validate the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria in regard to the feasibility of the study; b- Validate the
      triggers for discontinuation of AS in terms of feasibility and safety for the patients.
      POPULATION - For the pilot study, the intended targeted population will be patients
      incidentally diagnosed with a Bosniak III or IV cysts and who opted to be managed by either
      surgery or active surveillance. METHODOLOGY - Upon written consent, patients will be
      explained the followup scheme which will consist of a semi-annual visits for 1 year. To mimic
      the upcoming larger study and to evaluate visit feasibility issues, the baseline and the
      follow-up visits will consist of the following items: blood results, CT-scan result, quality
      of life questionnaires and medical data. Baseline (prior to study entry) and follow-up
      abdominal imaging (CT/MRI) suspicious for progression will be reviewed centrally by an
      interventional radiologist at the CIUSSSE-CHUS, to confirm Bosniak classification.
