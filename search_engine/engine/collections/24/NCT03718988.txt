      to decrease meat consumption worldwide. Decreasing meat consumption and shifting to a
      plant-based diet has been linked to improvements in physical health, including decreased risk
      of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (Kahleova, Levin, &
      Barnard, 2017). However, the extent to which plant-based meat alternatives specifically can
      modulate biomarkers of physical health, particularly TMAO and IGF-1, and the gut microbiome
      remain relatively unexplored. It is also largely unknown to what extent consumers can
      feasibly and sustainably exchange meat products for plant-based meat alternatives for
      extended periods of time. Plant-based meat alternatives offer a promising way to support
      consumers' shift to a plant-based diet, and in turn, to potentially improve levels of TMAO
      and IGF-1 and decrease cardiovascular risk. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that consumer
      levels of TMAO and IGF-1 will be improved after 8 weeks of consuming plant-based meat
      alternative products, as compared to 8 weeks of consuming traditional meat products.
