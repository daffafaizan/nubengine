      another cytoreductive therapy). The dose should be gradually increased by 50 μg every two
      weeks (in parallel, other cytoreductive therapy should be decreased gradually, as
      appropriate) until stabilization of the hematological parameters is achieved (hematocrit
      <45%, platelets <400 x 10^9/L and leukocytes <10 x 10^9/L). The maximum recommended single
      dose is 500 μg injected every two weeks.

      At week 36 (month 9) and week 52 (month 12), the primary study endpoint, phlebotomy-free CHR,
      will be analyzed. After completion of the 52-week study duration, provision and
      administration of P1101, collection of the long-term follow up information (blood parameters,
      molecular and cytogenetic data, safety parameters and as also the optional bone marrow data)
      will be continued until the drug becomes commercially available for all study subjects..
