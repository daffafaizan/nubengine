      treatment for recurrent or advanced head and neck cancer (SCCHN). Pemetrexed and gemcitabine
      have helped fight against SCCHN when each was given by itself. This study is different from
      others because it tests these two drugs together, which has not been tried before in patients
      with SCCHN. We will see how well these drugs can work to help to control or shrink your
      cancer.

      We also want to find out what effects (good and bad) gemcitabine and pemetrexed have on you
      and your head and neck cancer. We do not know if these drugs will help you. Your cancer might
      get better or it might get worse. It might not have any effect on your condition. We can use
      what we learn from this research study to help other people with the same cancer.
