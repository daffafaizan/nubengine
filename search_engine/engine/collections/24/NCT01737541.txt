      great amount of disability, economic and social burden. This is particularly true in
      developing countries where it accounts for between 20% and 50% of all strokes.
      Pharmacological and surgical interventions have been attempted to diminish the mortality and
      disability derived from ICH, with unsuccessful results. Recently the use of Fluoxetine in
      addition to physical rehabilitation has been proven useful to improve motor recovery from
      cerebral infarct. The purpose of this study is to test whether a 3-month treatment with
      fluoxetine enhances motor recovery in non-depressed patients with acute intracerebral
      hemorrhage.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. This
      trial will recruit 86 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage of both sexes, ages >18 years,
      from four Mexican hospitals. The patients will receive either 20mg of fluoxetine or a placebo
      once daily for 90 days. The primary outcome is the mean change in Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale
      score between inclusion (day 0) and day 90. The secondary outcomes will be changes in Barthel
      Index, Modified Rankin scale and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale. The
      outcomes will be measured at day 45Â±7days and at day 90, for a total of four visits with each
      subject (at screening and at 0, 45 and 90days).
