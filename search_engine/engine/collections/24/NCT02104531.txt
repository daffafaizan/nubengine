      United States with a large health care burden. The current standard for diagnosis of shoulder
      disorders is a clinical exam, visual motion assessment and in some cases, costly magnetic
      resonance (MR) imaging. However, specific tissue pathologies are not always accurately
      identified, and often not directly linked to the magnitude of dysfunction. There is a need
      for categorizing or sub-grouping patients based on the underlying movement dysfunctions with
      which they present. Video fluoroscopy is a common clinical tool that can improve the accuracy
      of motion analysis. The investigators are using 2-D fluoroscopy, combined with 3-D MR imaging
      to measure shoulder motion. From the motion analysis we can predict areas of potential soft
      tissue disease, and compare these to disease locations from MR imaging. The investigators
      hypotheses is that our motion based predicted disease locations will be significantly
      associated with disease locations from MR imaging.
