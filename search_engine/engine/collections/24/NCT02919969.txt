      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for Advanced
      Anal Cancer, but it has been approved for other uses.

      Pembrolizumab, also known as KEYTRUDA or MK-3475, is approved in the USA and several other
      countries to treat a type of skin cancer called Malignant Melanoma.

      In this research study the investigators are studying an investigational drug called
      Pembrolizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are manmade and mimic
      proteins in the immune system by attaching to specific proteins in the body. T cells are
      cells in the immune system that are controlled by PD-1. PD-1 is a protein on the T cells that
      prevent the body from overproducing T cells. Pembrolizumab targets PD-1, attaches to it and
      blocks its action. By preventing PD-1 from working, T cell production rises and the body's
      immune system may increase its action against Cancer cells. Clinical and laboratory studies
      using pembrolizumab suggest that pembrolizumab may be useful in shrinking certain tumors.
