      conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) is one corner stone in the management of heart failure as
      well as the management of ischemic heart disease, especially after acute myocardial
      infarctionHigh plasma aldosterone levels have been associated with both direct and indirect
      toxic effects on myocardium. ACEIs are associated with partial and temporary reduction of
      plasma aldosterone levels.The RALES randomized controlled trial has shown a reduction of
      mortality associated with the use of the selective aldosterone receptor blocker
      spironolactone, on top of standard therapy including ACEIs in the setting of NYHA 3-4 chronic
      heart failure. The EPHESUS randomized controlled trial has shown a reduction of mortality
      associated with the use of another selective aldosterone receptor blocker Eplerenone,
      initiated 3 to 14 days after acute myocardial infarction complicated by clinical heart
      failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%.Both previous studies have also reported
      a rapid reduction of global and arrhythmia-related mortality, within 30 days after the
      initiation of the medication.Such benefit has been reported after delayed initiation of
      aldosterone blocked, while aldosterone is at its highest level at presentation after acute
      myocardial infarction, with a rapid decrease within days after admission. Furthermore high
      aldosterone levels on admission are associated with adverse outcome independent of heart
      failure.

      The ALBATROSS trial :Hypothesis: An early blockade of aldosterone receptors initiated at the
      first medical contact after acute myocardial infarction may reduce major cardiovascular
      events within 6 months after the occurrence of the myocardial infarction.

      Primary objective: To demonstrate the superiority of aldosterone blockade initiated as soon
      as possible within 72 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction on top of standard
      therapy, compared to standard therapy alone, with or without reperfusion therapy.
