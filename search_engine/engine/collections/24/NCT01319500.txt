      participants indicate that many users of oral contraceptives use these preparations not only
      for contraception but also for the treatment of hormone-dependent diseases and symptoms -
      such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder, acne, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary
      syndrome, bleeding disorders and painful periods. In the International Active Surveillance
      Study of Women Taking Oral Contraceptives (INAS) more than 30% of participants reported that
      they use their OC for contra¬ception as well as for the treatment of one of the mentioned
      conditions.

      It is also conceivable that some women use OC not for contraception but only for one of these
      hormone-dependent conditions. In most instances the exclusive use for these conditions would
      constitute off-label use as only few preparations have a stand-alone approved indication for
      one of these conditions.

      For many countries the actual extent of off-label use of OCs for these conditions is unknown.
      This applies also to Croatia. Therefore, the Croatian health authority requested a drug
      utilization study to investigate current prescribing indications for Yasmin® and other OCs in
      Croatia. The study details were agreed upon with the Croatian health authority.
