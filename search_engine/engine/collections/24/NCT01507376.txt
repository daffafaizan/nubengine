      in-vitro fertilization in royan institute, Tehran Iran.

      In this study all patients were treated with a long stimulation protocol in which
      GnRH-analogue (Buserelin subcutaneous, 0.5cc daily) was given as a pre-treatment and
      recombinant FSH (rFSH) administration was started when pituitary desensitization was
      confirmed. From the 7th day of stimulation in both groups, daily monitoring of follicle size
      by ultrasound was performed and the dose of rFSH was adjusted according to the response of
      each patient. When at least two follicles > 18 mm diameter were seen, ovulation was triggered
      with hCG and patients allocated into three different study groups as per the following:

        1. Group A consisted of 60 women who received recombinant hCG(250 µg Ovitrelle)

        2. Group B consisted of 60 women who received recombinant hCG(500 µg Ovitrelle)

        3. Group C consisted of 60 patients received 10,000 IU urinary hCG Oocyte retrieval
           performed about 34-36 hours after hCG administration and then oocytes were assessed for
           nuclear maturity. Embryos transferred 2-3 days thereafter.

      Data collection will be performed by using questionnaire to be filled as per the available
      records and laboratory results. Data analysis will be done through descriptive and perceptive
      statistical methods by using SPSS software version 16 for windows.
