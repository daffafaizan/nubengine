      vocal cord mobility as a reference value. A proper acoustic window is mandatory for optimal
      visualization of laryngeal structures. Visibility of false vocal cords, true vocal cords and
      arytenoids will be given one point each for one side, maximal score will be 6. According to
      points the acoustic window scoring for glottis aperture will be graded as fair, when both
      false vocal cords are visible (score1-2), along with false cord when both arytenoids are
      visible scored good (score3-4) and if single or both true vocal cords are visible then scored
      as very good(score5-6). After the surgery the same patient will be scanned again for vocal
      cord mobility at 4hours of extubation . Any change in mobility will be recorded. If any
      change will be observed, direct laryngoscopy (DL) will be done to confirm the diagnosis. Any
      complication in the post-operative period will be recorded.
