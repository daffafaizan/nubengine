      technique. Its difficulty of learning and the duration of operation are factors limiting its
      diffusion. The use of cyanoacrylate glue is proposed to simplify the procedure, without there
      being any comparative studies between the sutures over and the sizing of prosthetic
      reinforcements.

      The main objective of the study is to compare the operative time of promontofixation by
      coelioscopy with suture using threads to promontofixation using glue.

      Secondary objectives are the comparison between the two groups of complications per and
      postoperative, objective anatomical results and functional results of the tissue reaction
      judged by clinical examination (palpation) and ultrasound and direct cost.
