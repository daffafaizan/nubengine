    
      This study consists of a Double-blind , placebo controlled, and parallel group part with
      eligible patients enrolled into a 24 week Double-Blind Period, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to receive ofatumumab (700mg x 2 infusions) or placebo ( saline x 2 infusions) in addition to
      their background methotrexate treatment. Patients who completed the 24 week Double-Blind
      period without receiving rescue DMARD treatment will be eligible to proceed into the 120 week
      Open-Label Period to receive repeat treatment courses with ofatumumab. In the Open-label
      Period ofatumumab treatment courses will be given at individualized time intervals only if a
      clinical response has been achieved following the previous treatment course, and followed by
      a subsequent worsening in disease activity . Patients who have completed the Open-Label
      Period or have withdrawn will enter a maximum 2 year Follow-up Period, or until their Bcells
      return to normal or to baseline levels, whichever occurs earlier.
