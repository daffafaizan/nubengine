      radiotherapy is attractive. A Dutch randomized study (Cross trial) compared preoperative CRT
      to surgery in 368 patients with T1-T3 and N0N1. In the preoperative CRT group, patients
      received 41.4 Gy by EBRT over 5 weeks combined with carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50
      mg/m2). A 30 % tumor sterilization rate and a reduction of metastasis considered a distant
      effect of chemotherapy were observed. The 5-year survival was statistically better with CRT
      group. The preoperative CRT was well tolerated and few acute toxicities were observed.
      Intriguingly, in a French randomized study, conducted in less locally advanced disease, the
      combination of 45 Gy and 5 FU infusion and Cisplatin did not induce more tumor sterilization
      rate, suggesting carboplatine/paclitaxel is more effective than 5FU/cisplatin in CRT.

      Study design Since the optimal doses of each component radiotherapy- carboplatin - paclitaxel
      are unknown, we plan to conduct a phase I/II study

        -  Phase I: the objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
           doses for phase II (RP2D) of each component considering the treatment scheme of Dutch
           study as reference:

             -  for chemotherapy 3 levels: 50%, 75% and 100% of the standard Dutch dose
                (carboplatin AUC 2 and paclitaxel 50 mg/m2)

             -  for radiotherapy 3 levels: 41.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/f; 45 Gy/1.8 Gy/f; 50.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/f basel
                level being : 41.4 Gy and 50% of standard CT doses The phase I is conducted with
                increasing doses of each component with 9 levels.

        -  Phase II: after the determination of RP2D of each component, the study is continued as a
           phase II in order to assess tumor response Secondary objectives: Quality of life,
           progression free and overall survivals
