      of ZW49 and to determine the MTD or RD of ZW49 for further study. Selected expansion cohorts
      will be subsequently opened based upon Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommendation and
      sponsor approval to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW49 at the MTD or RD and
      to assess preliminary anti-tumor activity.
