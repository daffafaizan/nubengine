        -  Phase 1: Dose Escalation until MAD

        -  Phase 2: Evaluation of Toxicity and Response Rate in Selected Solid Tumor Cohorts

      The study is designed as an open label, Phase 1/2 trial of single agent EDO-S101. The Phase 1
      portion of the study is designed to define the MTD by evaluating toxicities during dose
      escalation until MAD. The Phase 2 portion of the study is designed to evaluate ORR and SD
      that persists for at least 4 months of the RP2D.
