      electroencephalographic pattern recognized when propofol is administered, is different to the
      pattern obtained in younger patients. Both groups presents an alpha and slow bands, but they
      differ in the intensity of the signal. Younger patients presents more intense
      electroencephalographic bands than older patients.

      Bispectral index (BIS) is a clinical indicator used to evaluate the depth of anesthesia. A
      correlation between this indicator and the power of electroencephalographic bands has not
      been determined.

      We will describe the LOC moment of elderly patients receiving propofol as anesthetic for
      general surgery, with the EEG characteristic bands and the BIS value obtained at that moment.
      The BIS values related to the EEG characteristic bands can be described, to correlate the
      actual indicators of depth of anesthesia with new parameters.
