      liver decompensation, portal hypertensive complications, and liver transplantation) in CHB
      patients beyond treatment indications by current guidelines

      Study procedure: 780 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (A:B) either to receive TAF
      25 mg QD or to receive best supportive care after stratification according to the HBeAg
      status. The duration of maintaining both arms is 4 years. During treatment period, among
      treatment arm B, subjects who are indicated for antiviral treatment by AASLD 2018 Guidelines
      of CHB (ALT 70≥ for male, 50≥ for female) will be treated with TAF.

        -  Treatment Arm A: 390 subjects administered TAF 25 mg once daily

        -  Treatment Arm B: 390 subjects received best supportive care

      The primary analysis will occur at Year 4 with the primary endpoint being cumulative
      incidence rate of clinical events
