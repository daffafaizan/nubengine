      cancer will be enrolled.

      The approach is to identify novel proteomic biomarkers for HCC patients treated with Lipiodol
      TACE using beads-based X-aptamer library, then validate and create a biomarker panel that can
      be used to predict the outcome of HCC post-Lipiodol TACE treatment.

      Lipiodol TACE will be done as standard of care and the only thing done as research will be
      blood draws pre and post-TACE.
