      reducing prolonged pharmacological management, minimizing hospitalization and improving
      developmental outcomes in drug exposed newborns. This study seeks to examine the physiology
      and symptoms of drug withdrawal (e.g., irritability marked by movement activity;
      cardio-respiratory instabilities) in infants exposed to drugs in utero and test whether
      sensory stimuli (tactile, auditory) reduce dysregulated systems in the withdrawing infant.

      Candidates at-risk for NAS due to fetal drug exposure will be identified to investigators by
      the infant's primary medical caregiver. Investigators will use a modified-consecutive
      sampling technique, restricted by equipment and personnel availability, for enrolling
      infants. Participants will be studied throughout their hospitalization. Effects of
      stimulation will be examined at different stages of withdrawal. Efficacy of stimulation will
      be examined as a potential complementary treatment of NAS.
