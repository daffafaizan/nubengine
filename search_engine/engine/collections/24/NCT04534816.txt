    
      The surgical management of penetrating bowel and intestinal injuries has been the topic of
      debate since before the second world war [1-3]. The injury is most often inflicted via a
      gunshot or knife stabbing. Different classifications systems have been proposed to help
      determine the best operative option: (i) Flint Grading System (FGS); (ii) Penetrating
      Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI); (iii) Colonic/Rectal Injury Scale (CIS/RIS); and (iv)
      destructive/non-destructive colonic injuries; (v) Stone and Fabian's criteria [2,3,10-14].

      Principally, a penetrating injury of the intestine can be managed by: (i) primary repair
      (suturing the hole in the intestine); (ii) primary diversion (the intestine, above the
      injury, is brought through the abdominal wall as a "stoma") or (iii) an abbreviated primary
      operation (laparotomy, where large bleeding is stopped and destroyed tissue is removed) and
      planned reoperation, within 24-48 hours, for definitive treatment (final treatment, for
      example reconnecting intestinal ends). The concept of abbreviated primary operation, also
      known as "damage control surgery", is today well established in trauma care [4-6]. A damage
      control operation with regards to intestinal injury, entails a primary resection/removal of
      the affected intestinal segment in which the remaining intestinal ends are closed off and not
      surgically connected (anastomosed) in the first operation.[4-9]. The abdomen is left "open"
      (the incision through the abdominal wall is not sutured closed but covered with a temporary
      dressing), and a relaparotomy (re-operation) is conducted once the patient is stabilized (at
      the end of which the abdominal wall is closed), usually after 24-48 h [4-9]. During the
      re-laparotomy, the intestines will then either be anastomosed (re-connected), or a stoma will
      be created if the intestine is deemed too damaged to be re-connected [4-9].

      Non-destructive colonic injuries (Flint grades 1 & 2 and CIS grades I to III) are generally
      treated with primary repair, which involves the identification, debridement and single-layer
      suture repair of perforation and then dressing the repaired site with omentum (an
      intra-abdominal layer of fat and vessels) [1,2,10,12]. Primary repair is generally considered
      the better option in this setting [1-3,28].

      Destructive colon wounds (Flint grade 3 or CIS grades IV and V) encompass those injuries that
      require segmental resection (parts of the large intestine have to be removed) due to
      extensive damage or loss of blood supply or both [10,12]. The management of destructive colon
      wounds is less clear and is still debatable. However, primary repair has been deemed as a
      safe option, while primary diversion has been opted for in particular cases [1-3,9,11,29-33].
      In unstable patients; those with hypovolemic shock (large blood loss), blood-poisoning due to
      intestinal content leaking into the abdominal cavity, systemic hypothermia (low body
      temperature), and complex intra-abdominal injuries; an abbreviated laparotomy is considered
      to be an appropriate course of action [7,11,30,32-34].

      In colonic trauma, the anastomosis leak rate (the connection between to intestinal ends
      breaks down) is reported between 4-27% [34-37]. A leak in the sight of intestinal connection
      is a severe complication which greatly increases the length of hospitalization, increases
      patient morbidity and has a significant negative impact on patient's recovery. The mortality
      rate for an anastomotic leak around 10-15% [38,39]. Factors associated with anastomotic
      failure include co-morbid immune-compromising disorders such as diabetes mellitus, acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome, cirrhosis and a transfusion requirement of more than six units of
      blood [36]. Other potential risk factors appear to be shock, significant associated injuries,
      and delay of operation [35,36].

      In firearm injuries the tissue damage is proportionate to a variety of factors: Projectile
      velocity, -entrance profile, -calibre, -design, distance travelled within the body
      (penetrating projectiles deliver their total kinetic energy to the body, whereas perforating
      projectiles transfer significantly less), biologic characteristics of the impacted tissue and
      the mechanisms of tissue disruption (e.g. stretching, tearing, crushing) [40]. The extent of
      damage in the tissue surrounding the entered organ can be difficult to assess, and despite
      improvements in diagnostics and treatment of abdominal gunshot wounds, high mortality and
      morbidity rates are still found [15,16].

      In conclusion, intestinal injuries can be difficult to manage. A primary repair is preferable
      but there is a need for more precise diagnostic tools helping the surgeon to access the
      extent of intestinal injury. Also, reducing the extent of intestinal removal has a high value
      for the patient as extensive resections can lead to nutritional difficulties even after
      discharge.

      Fluorescence guided surgery Assessing intestinal blood supply is a challenging task even for
      experienced surgeons. One of the biggest concerns is the blood supply of the anastomosis (the
      surgical connection between to intestinal ends) since poor blood supply is regarded as a
      significant risk factor for anastomotic leak [41-44]. As mentioned above, an anastomotic leak
      is a severe complication in gastrointestinal surgery and has a significant negative impact on
      patients recovery with the mortality rate for an anastomotic leak around 10-15% [38,39].

      Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) enables visualization of structures that are otherwise
      hidden from the naked human eye. A fluorescent contrast agent is used, most often indocyanine
      green (ICG), and by illuminating the tissue with near-infrared light, the excited ICG can be
      detected by a camera with an optical filter. ICG is a tricarbocyanine dye with very few
      adverse events, a short half-life, and exclusively metabolized in the liver and excreted
      unchanged in the bile [45,46]. The safety of ICG well established and the contrast is used
      routinely in surgical settings worldwide, just as it has gained popularity in oncological
      surgery in recent years [45-47].

      ICG binds to plasma proteins in the blood after intravascular injection, and by illuminating
      the tissue with near-infrared red light, the fluorescence intensity during the first passage
      in tissue is considered proportional to blood flow (perfusion). This real-time visualization
      of visceral perfusion (blood flowing to a given organ) may reduce the rate of anastomotic
      leakage because inadequate vascularization can be detected during the operation [18-20].
      Also, the option for intraoperative visual assessment of blood flow to the intestine, stomach
      and surrounding tissues, allowing for modification to the surgical plan, may eliminate
      anastomotic break down or leak due to inadequate vascularization despite satisfactory blood
      supply on naked-eye appearance [20,21,48], (Figure 1).

      Figure 1. A. Intestinal segment as viewed with the naked eye. B. Evaluation of blood flow
      after injection of ICG, viewed with the infra-red camera (ICG-FA). C. A computer generated
      combination of images A and B ("overlay") allowing the surgeon to evaluate intestinal blood
      supply.

      In a prospective observational study on patients with a left-sided colorectal cancer, ICG
      fluorescence angiogram (FA) altered operative decisions in 34.5% of the cases (n=111) i.e.
      the site of resection was adapted after tissue perfusion evaluated with ICG FA. Also, the use
      of ICG FA significantly reduced the anastomotic leak rate in patients undergoing surgery for
      colorectal cancer [49]. In patients undergoing esophagectomy, the use of ICG FA with
      intervention was found to have a risk reduction for complications of 69% and a significantly
      lowered risk of anatomic leaks [25].

      The use of ICG FA has been shown to improve patient outcome and reduce patients risks in
      elective settings, however, there is much need for evaluation in the acute/emergency setting.
      The risk of complications, patient morbidity and mortality are inherently higher in an
      emergency surgical setting compared to an elective/planned setting [50]. Thus, it is feasible
      to believe that the use of ICG FA in an emergency setting will improve patient outcome and
      reduce risk of complications. There is to date little literature on the use of ICG FA in an
      emergency/trauma setting. However, a recent retrospective study by Karampinis et al. 2018
      deemed the use of ICG FA as a feasible and technically reliable technique in patients
      undergoing emergency surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia. Indocyanine Green FA provided
      additional information regarding intestinal perfusion in 18 of their 53 cases (35%). In 11
      patients the surgical strategy was amended by ICG angiography, showing adequate perfusion,
      and thus no indication for intestinal resection. No further resections were performed on
      these patients during the second- and third- look laparotomies [26]. In March 2015, Green et
      al. presented a retrospective review of all war-related traumatic and reconstructive cases
      employing the intraoperative use of indocyanine green angiography within the US army over a
      three year period [27]. They concluded that - Intraoperative fluorescent angiography is an
      objective, useful tool to assess various war-related traumatic injuries [27].

      The Department of Surgical Gastroenterology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, have developed an ICG
      quantification algorithm which has been validated and described earlier [51]. This algorithm
      has now been incorporated into a touch screen tablet, allowing for live perioperative
      quantitative perfusion assessments with ICG (Q-ICG). A color-coded map of perfusion intensity
      is provided as an overlay on the white light visualized tissue (Figure 2). In a feasibility
      study of ten patients undergoing surgery for stomach cancer, significant alterations of
      optimal perfusion points selected by surgeons were found when comparing points selected in
      white light, ICG FA and Q-ICG (Nerup, in review).

      Figure 2. The remaining stomach (gastric conduit) viewed by white light, Near-Infrared Light
      (ICG FA) and with Q-ICG overlay.

      As ICG FA can assess micro-perfusion, we believe that it has the possibility to improve
      intraoperative evaluation of tissue integrity and as such improve the surgical plan and
      outcome in patients suffering gunshots to the abdominal viscera. We also believe that the
      quantification tool provided by Rigshospitalet will further assist the surgical
      decision-making.

      Aim This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of perfusion assessment with traditional
      visual, visual ICG FA and Q-ICG.
