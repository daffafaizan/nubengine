    
      Sunrise® is a type IIa medical device with the CE label. It is a new home sleep technology,
      non-invasive, reliable and affordable by the patient.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the device in comparison with
      PSG for sleep apnea diagnosis.

      40 subjects, suspected to be apneic, will be equipped at home by the chin sensor, the
      Sunrise® device, recording their mandibular movements while sleeping. The Sunrise® solution
      will provide the respiratory event index (REI) as well as the respiratory micro-arousals.

      Inclusion visit will be executed at the University Hospital Grenoble Alpes. However, PSG and
      Sunrise® will be set at the patient's home by IC@dom. The first night, the patient will be
      equipped by both PSG and Sunrise® and only by the Sunrise® for the two following nights.
