    
      Primary Objectives:

      Efficacy: Demonstrate that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) plus recombinant tissue
      plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for three days improves functional outcome by a 12% increase in
      the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-3 compared to medically treated subjects assessed at
      365 days.

      Secondary Objective:

      Demonstrate that the end of treatment volume and percent of ICH reduction from MIS+rt-PA is
      related to improved functional outcome, as compared to medically treated subjects.

      Safety:

      Demonstrate that early use of MIS+rt-PA for three days is safe for the treatment of ICH
      relative to rates of mortality, rebleeding, and infection in the medically treated subject at
      30 days.
