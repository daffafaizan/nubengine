      several randomly selected hospitals will use either a desktop PC or mobile (iPad) data
      collection tool. A validated user experience evaluation instrument will be used at the
      beginning, during interim analysis and at the end of the trial.

      The desktop-based data collection is built on Drupal, a renowned open source content
      management system (CMS). The same CMS will be used with a special interface designed for
      iOS/iPad. Both data collection platforms will be used in parallel to a prospective clinical
      trial.
