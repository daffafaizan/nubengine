      reach 15-30 cmH2O, is a commonly performed assessment to confirm that an endotracheal tube
      size is appropriate for a child in order to minimize the risk of airway injury and adverse
      events after removal of ETT. Many factors are known to affect the results of the leak test
      and variation in results among experienced anesthesiologists may be as great as 38%, but the
      accuracy of the audible leak test by directly observing the presence of a leak around the ETT
      has not been evaluated. This study will attempt to use direct visualization of the air leak
      to correlate to and assess the accuracy of the audible air leak test.
