      current, generating local temperatures above 60Â°C and leading to coagulative necrosis. The
      technique has been widely used in many solid organ tumours and has been shown to result in
      5-year survival rates comparable to surgery. The technique is currently the standard therapy
      in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal pulmonary metastasis particular in patients that
      are not suitable for surgery.

      The current study would be a multi-center prospective study involving four high volume
      international institutions. Consecutive patients suffering from solid neoplasms of the liver,
      stomach and adrenals would be recruited. EUS-guided RFA would be performed using a 19-gauge
      RFA electrode and a VIVA RF generator (STARmed, Korea). The primary outcome would be the
      overall adverse events rate. Secondary outcomes include mortality, technical success rate,
      completion ablation rate, 1 & 3 year overall and disease-free survival.
