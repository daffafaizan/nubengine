    
      This Phase I/II is a randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled study to assess safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of THV01 at three doses in patients infected with the HIV-1
      clade B currently on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapies).

      THV01 involves two intramuscular injections, consisting of the THV01-1 and THV01-2 lentiviral
      vectors, to be administered intramuscularly eight weeks apart. These lentiviral vectors are
      non-replicative and self-inactivating. Both encode the same HIV antigen.

      36 patients were planned to be enrolled. They must be HIV-1 (clade B) infected patients,
      treated by HAART for more than 12 months and with an undetectable viral load.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the groups:

        -  Group 1: patients will receive the THV01-1 and THV01-2 vaccines at 5.10E+6 TU
           (transducing unit) or placebo;

        -  Group 2: patients will receive the THV01-1 and THV01-2 vaccines at 5.10E+7 TU
           (transducing unit) or placebo;

        -  Group 3: patients will receive the THV01-1 and THV01-2 vaccines at 5.10E+8 TU
           (transducing unit) or placebo.

      Hence, twelve patients will be randomized in blocks of 4 in a 3:1 ratio (vaccine:placebo) for
      each dose.

      Experimental drugs' injection will occur at Week 0 and Week 8. HAART will be alleviated for
      all patients during this "vaccination phase" to enable efficient transduction of the host
      cells by the lentiviral vectors. Initial HAART will be resumed at Week 9.

      Starting on Week 24, HAART will be interrupted. Patients will then be monitored on a very
      stringent rhythm. HAART resumption criteria based on the CD4+ T cell counts and the viral
      load have been implemented to guaranty safety of all enrolled patients.

      38 patients were enrolled in THV01-11-01 study and received the 2 injections.

      A long-term follow-up of all enrolled patients will be performed for 5 years after the
      administration of THV01-1. During this follow-up, three visits are planned per year, during
      which blood will be sampled. This will provide data on the long-term safety of THV01 and the
      potential long-term risks/benefits associated with THV01.
