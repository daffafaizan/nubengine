    
      This study is a double blind, placebo controlled, ascending single and multiple oral dose
      study conducted in two parts, aimed at determining the safety and tolerability of single and
      multiple oral doses of NEO6860 in healthy subjects.

      Key secondary objectives are: assessment of the pharmacokinetic profile, effect of food and
      gender.

      The analgesic effect of NEO6860 will be investigated using experimental capsaicin-evoked pain
      methods. Measurement of capsaicin evoked pain, and secondary hyperalgesia will be performed
      at baseline and at estimated Tmax and 8 hours post dosing.

      Part A will comprise an ascending single dose, sequential group study in male subjects,
      incorporating a two-period crossover group to investigate the effect of food and a single
      group of female subjects to investigate gender effect.

      56 subjects will be studied in 7 groups (Groups A1 to A7), each group consisting of 8
      subjects (6 subjects will receive NEO6860 and 2 will receive placebo). Six dose levels will
      be explored: 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1 600mg.

      Part B will comprise an ascending multiple dose, sequential group study. 16 subjects will be
      studied in 2 groups (Groups B1 to B2), each group consisting of 8 subjects (6 subjects will
      receive NEO6860 and 2 will receive placebo) receiving 5 days of therapy with a dose schedule
      to be determined during Part A.
