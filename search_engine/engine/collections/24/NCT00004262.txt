      I. Determine the frequency and grade of toxicity of gadolinium texaphyrin as a
      radiosensitizer at two dose levels in patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme
      undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery.

      II. Compare the tumor, normal brain, and plasma concentrations of this drug regimen to 1.5
      and 8 Tesla MRI images in this patient population.

      III. Determine if the 8 Tesla images provide more data than the 1.5 Tesla images in terms of
      the radiosensitizing drug distribution in the tumor in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Within 5 weeks following surgery, patients receive daily external beam radiotherapy five days
      a week for 5 weeks. Within 2 weeks following completion of radiotherapy, patients receive
      gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 2 hours followed 3 hours later by stereotactic radiosurgery.
      Patients undergoing surgical debulking of tumor prior to external beam radiotherapy receive
      gadolinium texaphyrin IV over 2 hours, 3 hours prior to surgery in addition to the dose prior
      to stereotactic radiosurgery.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gadolinium texaphyrin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months for 5 years or until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
