      commonly used in combination with induction of labor. However, there is a lack of data on
      both effectiveness and ideal timing of this procedure. Yet for patients with an unfavorable
      cervix, a sharply ripening agent may be considered. As is well known to all,prostaglandin
      works efficiently in cervical ripening and labor induction. So dinoprostone surely performs
      quite well in promoting cervical ripening and labor induction since its main component is
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
