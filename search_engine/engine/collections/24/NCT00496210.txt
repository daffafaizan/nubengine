      children with a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). PDD presents particular challenges
      for caregivers because of the communication and socialization challenges of affected
      children, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the cause, prognosis and recurrence risks.
      The literature suggests that these challenges may make the process of adapting to having a
      child with a PDD different than it is for other chronic conditions. This study of caregivers
      is based on Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping. A cross-sectional
      design will be used to investigate the relationships among causal attributions, control
      perceptions, coping and adaptation. Caregivers will be recruited from support groups,
      listservs and magazines targeted to autism and other PDDs. Participants will be asked to
      complete either a web-based or paper survey. The main outcome measure is psychological
      adaptation to caregiving a child with PDD.
