      the suitable anticoagulation time. A set of exclusion criteria is being used to determine in
      which patients LMWH will be withdrawn. Patients are being followed after LMWH withdrawal
      until 6 months. Blood samples are being taken at baseline (LMWH withdrawal), 3 weeks and 3
      months after. We will look for association between several biomarkers and venous
      thromboembolism recurrences.
