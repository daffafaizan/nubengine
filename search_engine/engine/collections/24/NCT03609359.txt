      gastric cancer is judged to be effective, a prospective treatment regimen can be expected for
      a larger number of participating subjects.

      The anticipated disadvantages include any adverse events associated with lenvatinib and
      pembrolizumab. To minimize the risk and disadvantages of adverse events, the data center
      together with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will monitor any adverse events in the
      present trial to determine whether or not they are within the expected range. These bodies
      will also conduct a thorough examination in the event that serious or unexpected adverse
      events occur, and adopt an appropriate system to take any necessary actions.
