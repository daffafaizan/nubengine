      researchers at the University of Rochester known as Laser Induced Refractive Index
      Customization (LIRIC), which allows the alteration of the optical design of a finished soft
      hydrogel contact lens. Clerio Vision Inc. scientists have developed a diffractive multifocal
      optical design using the LIRIC procedure which shows an increase of the depth of focus of the
      contact lens when measured on an optical bench. It is hypothesized that a presbyopic patient
      wearing a soft contact lens of this design will experience an improvement in intermediate and
      near vision over that provided by their distance corrected single vision contact lenses,
      without significantly impacting their distance vision. The purpose of this feasibility study
      is the on-eye evaluation of the performance of the Clerio Vision designed and LIRIC modified
      soft contact lenses. Results from this study will guide future development of these potential
      products.
