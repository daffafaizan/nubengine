      patients and 4 normal participants have taken 10 days rTMS. One patients and one control
      withdrew their consent without any reason and one control withdrew the consent because of
      headache.

      We scanned fMRIs(to examine functional connectivity)twice for each participant, which were
      taken 3 days before the first and 3 days after the last rTMS.

      All of participants have not reported side effects except mild headahe. There's been no
      seizure event up to now.
