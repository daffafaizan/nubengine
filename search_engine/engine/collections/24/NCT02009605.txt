      treated non/light-smoking patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancer. An objective
      response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete
      response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response.
