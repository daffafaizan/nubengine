      the button. The PeerScope B Systemâ„¢ is an endoscopic platform that enables the physician to
      get a wide angle view while maintaining all of the features commonly used during
      Gastrointestinal (GI) procedures with very limited learning curve and in service process. The
      current standard devices have viewing limitations. By adding this viewing functionality,
      PeerMedical will potentially empower physicians to improve polyps detection and cancers
      within the colon.
