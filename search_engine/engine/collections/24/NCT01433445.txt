      life. Both ruxolitinib and panobinostat, as single agents, had shown significant improvement
      in both of those treatment goals and ruxolitinib had also shown greater reductions in
      splenomegaly compared to the standard of care at that time. To further the benefit seen with
      ruxolitinib in MF patients, panobinostat was added to the treatment regimen to act
      synergistically in the blockade of the dysregulated pathway driving this disease.

      The study was conducted in 2 phases - an escalation phase and an expansion phase.

      Escalation phase: the study utilised the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM),
      incorporating escalation with overdose control (EWOC), which is a well established method for
      dose escalation in oncology trials. Following this process, successive cohorts of 3 newly
      enrolled patients received increasing doses of ruxolitinib and panobinostat until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RPIID) was determined. Once the MTD and/or
      RPIID were suspected in a minimum of 3 patients, additional patients were enrolled to the
      same cohort level to reach a minimum of 9 evaluable patients. The process also included
      safety, PK/PD assessments and estimates of efficacy based on measures of splenic reduction at
      each dose level.

      Expansion: following the determination of the MTD and/or RPIID, a dose expansion phase was
      conducted at that dose to further define the safety and tolerability of the combination. At
      least 13, and no more than 23, additional patients were to be enrolled into the expansion
      phase.
