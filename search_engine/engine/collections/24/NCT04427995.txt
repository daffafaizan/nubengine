      innovative surgical alternatives to help better control intraocular pressure (IOP).1 The
      OMNIâ„¢ Surgical System (Sight Sciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) is a promising procedure which
      targets the conventional outflow pathway.2 This device treats the trabecular meshwork,
      Schlemm's canal and the distal collector channels, all conventional pathway points of aqueous
      outflow resistance. Its designed microcatheter allows for cannulation of Schlemm's canal,
      dilation using the controlled delivery of viscoelastic as well as a trabeculotomy by
      stripping the trabecular meshwork will retracting the catheter.3 Goniotomy-assisted
      transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) has shown promising results in using an ab interno approach
      to cleave the trabecular meshwork.4 Alternatively, viscodilation alone has also shown an IOP
      lowering effect. 5 The OMNI Surgical System combines both procedures in one hand held device
      without the need for additional incisions or extra instrumentation. The device recently
      received FDA approval in the United States for delivery of small amounts of viscoelastic
      fluid during ophthalmic surgery and to cut trabecular meshwork tissue during trabeculotomy
      procedures.6 To date, no study has examined the effect of standalone viscodilation and
      trabeculotomy on glaucoma drop burden and IOP.
