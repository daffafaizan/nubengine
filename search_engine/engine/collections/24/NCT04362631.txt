    
      The advanced, bio-integrated wireless sensor (ADAM) that provides a comprehensive assessment
      of cardiopulmonary health. The technology employs advanced low-power operation, in-sensor
      analytics, and cloud integration. The sensor's novel soft mechanics allows for comfortable
      placement on the suprasternal notch, a location of unique anatomical importance, to collect
      both core vitals (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and physical activity including
      sleep quality) and novel respiratory digital biomarkers (cough count, swallowing, throat
      clearing and respiratory effort). The investigators will deploy this system in a cohort of
      high-risk patients for respiratory infection in a home setting to predict for respiratory
      infections prior to clinical deterioration.

      The investigators aim to capture data on 122 study subjects over the course of 52 weeks of
      continuous wear or the investigator's device to thoroughly characterize physiological data
      and diagnosis of respiratory infections. Data from standard of care appointments, diagnostic
      testing or imaging, or treatment will be collected from the patient medical record to
      validate device data.
