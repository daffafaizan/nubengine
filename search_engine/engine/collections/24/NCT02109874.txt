    
      This Phase I study will be conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      dose-escalation study in four groups of healthy adult male and female subjects who are
      BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have no evidence of tuberculosis infection. The study will
      be conducted at one or two sites located in South Africa.

      Forty subjects will be sequentially enrolled into one of four study groups (i.e., Group 1,
      Group 2, Group 3, or Group 4) based on time of completion of screening, with 10 subjects
      enrolled into each group. Within each study group, subjects will be randomized to a treatment
      regimen of either AERAS-404 or placebo control administered by intramuscular injection on
      Study Day 0 and Study Day 56. All subjects will receive the same treatment on Study Day 0 as
      they receive on Study Day 56. The dose of antigen will increase between study groups. All
      subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days. A total of
      eleven clinic visits are planned (excluding screening) for all subjects.
