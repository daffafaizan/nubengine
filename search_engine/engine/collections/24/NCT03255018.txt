    
      Background:

        -  Gray-zone lymphomas (GZL) are rare, aggressive lymphomas that share clinical and
           biological features of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma

        -  Standard upfront therapy for GZL is dose-intensive chemotherapy, though disease is often
           resistant; consolidative radiation therapy reserved for patients who are relapsed or
           refractory, and patients who fail radiation therapy have a poor prognosis

        -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), primary testicular lymphoma (PTL),
           primary breast lymphoma (PBL), primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg-type, and intravascular
           B-cell lymphoma (IVBCL) are rare, aggressive extranodal subsets of DLBCL that usually
           have gene expression signatures of activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL

        -  ABC-DLBCL has cure rates below 40% after standard therapy, and is associated with late
           recurrences, often involving the CNS where treatment options are limited by chemotherapy
           resistance and an inability of many agents to cross the blood-brain barrier

        -  Molecular biology studies of GZL and extranodal DLBCL have identified potentially
           targetable genetic features involving the programmed death-1 (PD-1) signaling pathway

        -  A high proportion of GZL, PCNSL, and PTL cases have copy number alterations or
           chromosomal rearrangements involving the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2

        -  Pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor, is a
           rational therapeutic target for patients with relapsed and refractory GZL, PCNSL, PTL,
           and other extranodal DLBCL

      Objectives:

      -To determine the best overall response rate of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed and
      refractory GZL and extranodal DLBCL

      Eligibility:

        -  Confirmed diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, relapsed from or refractory to prior:

             -  Cohort 1: B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between
                diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (i.e., Gray-zone
                lymphoma or GZL)

             -  Cohort 2: Extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving one or more of the
                specified extranodal sites (i.e., extranodal DLBCL)

        -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function defined

        -  Age greater than or equal to 14 years

      Design:

        -  Phase 2 study of patients with relapsed and refractory GZL and extranodal DLBCL

        -  Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg (flat dose) IV every 3 weeks provided
           they have clinical benefit and no unacceptable toxicity; patients who achieve a complete
           response (CR) will have the option stop after 1 year of therapy.

        -  All responding patients (CR, PR, or SD with clinical benefit) who subsequently relapse
           or progress within 1 year after discontinuation of study drug are eligible for
           re-treatment.

        -  At least 20 evaluable patients each with GZL and DLBCL will be evaluated on this
           protocol for the primary endpoint (overall accrual ceiling of 52 patients)
