      the bilateral supplement motor Area (SMA), the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      and SMA+DLPFC in the treatment of OCD. 120 OCD patients will be randomized into four groups.
      Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) stimulation will be performed once a day, five
      times a week, for four weeks. The investigators will assess improvement after four weeks of
      cTBS. Though the study, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale（Y-BOCS）, the Dimensional
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11),
      the Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Stress
      Scale(PSS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index(PSQI), the Obsessive-Compulsive
      Inventory-Revised(OCI-R) and side effects will be obtained by a trained investigator. The
      patients will also receive magnetic resonance imaging scan and electroencephalography (EEG).
