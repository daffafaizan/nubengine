      traditional treatment. The most common regimen in clinical practice uses doses of 10 mg on
      waking, 5 mg at lunch time and 5 mg in the afternoon. Once daily prednisolone is another
      regimen in clinical use and now prescribed at less than 5mg daily. It has a longer duration
      of action and a smoother pharmacokinetic profile compared to hydrocortisone. Moreover,
      prednisolone is much more cost-effective than hydrocortisone with 5mg tablets. Prednisolone
      is less commonly used due to perceived concerns regarding loss of bone mineral density
      leading to osteoporosis, increased insulin resistance leading to steroid induced diabetes,
      and rises in blood pressure and weight leading to increased cardiovascular risk. This belief
      is perhaps driven by the fact that most clinicians encounter prednisolone in the context of
      the treatment of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis etc. where far higher doses are employed. Where
      effects on bone health have been noted, they have been in association with higher doses of
      prednisolone (7.5mg) than those employed today (2-5mg).

      Although conventionally prednisolone 5 mg is assumed to be bioequivalent to HC 20 mg (ratio
      1:4), newer studies suggest that the ratio may be nearer 1:6-8 i.e. lower doses can be used.
