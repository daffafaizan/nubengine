      that they return to normal, but at the same time they still have to struggle with the
      aftermath of cancer and fear of recurrence. This is why there is room in this period for an
      intervention designed to help patients to cope with their emotions. . Patient emotional
      skills are patient abilities to identify, express and manage their emotions for the best
      possible psychological adjustment. In general population, emotional skills have been shown to
      be highly related to a better quality of life. In this randomized controlled study,
      bronchopulmonary and oesogastric cancer patients between 6 months and 2 years after the end
      of treatments will undergo either the emotional skills intervention (intervention group) or
      the relaxation group (control group).
