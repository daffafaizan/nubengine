      periphery and the liver tissue in patients with advanced liver disease, and could promote
      hepatic regeneration. Moreover, G-CSF was reported to protect patients from sepsis by
      restoring the function of both neutrophils and monocytes. Therefore, G-CSF therapy may be
      beneficial for liver regeneration in patients with ACLF induced by different causes.

      standard therapy for the treatment of ACLF includes reduced glutathione, glycyrrhizin,
      ademetionine,polyene phosphatidylcholine, alprostadil, and human serum albumin) on the day of
      admission. HBV associated ACLF patients receive entecavir at the same time
