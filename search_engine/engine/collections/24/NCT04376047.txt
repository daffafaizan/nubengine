      oxygenation status. It is also associated with mechanical ventilation success or failure and
      may be a main determinant of the obese patients' outcome. Reverse Trendelenburg position is
      recommended for obese patients but in critical illness with mechanical ventilation little is
      known about its effect on respiratory therapeutic targets. This trial was conducted in four
      general intensive care unit of Alexandria Main University hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. One
      hundred and ten adult mechanically ventilated patients with body mass index â‰¥ 30 were
      randomly assigned by a computer program to either reverse Trendelenburg position group (n=55)
      which is the intervention group or semi-recumbent position group (n=55) which is the routine
      unit position. Patients were positioned in the study positions 4 times per day. Patients were
      maintained in the study positions for 2 hours each time. Baseline ventilation and oxygenation
      parameters were assessed immediately before positioning then it was reassessed every 10
      minutes after positioning for 30 minutes.
