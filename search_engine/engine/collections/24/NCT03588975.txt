    
      This is a 2-year prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group clinical
      trial; a total of 45 patients, ages 10 to 17 years, will be randomized to receive a 1-time
      treatment with MACI or microfracture (2:1, 30 MACI:15 microfracture).

      After meeting screening criteria at the initial visit, all patients will have a screening
      arthroscopy to further assess study eligibility. During the screening arthroscopy, patients
      will be further evaluated against entry criteria. Cartilage lesion size will be measured
      prior to any cartilage repair procedure and randomization. All patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria and are considered suitable for treatment in the study will have a
      cartilage biopsy taken prior to randomization to study treatment. Eligible patients will be
      randomized during the screening arthroscopy procedure to receive either MACI or microfracture
      treatment. Patients randomized to microfracture will undergo the procedure during the
      screening arthroscopy.

      All biopsied tissue will be sent to the Vericel manufacturing facility in Cambridge,
      Massachusetts, where the sample will be processed to isolate the autologous chondrocytes.
      Cells from patients randomized to the MACI group will be used in the preparation of the MACI
      implant; cells from patients randomized to the microfracture group will be cryopreserved.

      Patients randomized to treatment with MACI will return within 12 weeks of the screening
      arthroscopy to undergo the chondrocyte implantation procedure via arthrotomy. Patients are to
      follow a recommended postoperative rehabilitation program and compliance with the
      rehabilitation schedule will be monitored.

      Patients will be followed post-study treatment for 2 years (104 Weeks).
