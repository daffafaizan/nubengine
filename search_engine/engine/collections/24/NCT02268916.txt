      activity intervention is not available. The investigators developed a lifestyle intervention
      based on individual's home activity patterns. The goal of the study is to test the efficacy
      of this intervention among Veterans with diabetes in a randomized-controlled trial. In
      addition to physical activity, the investigators will also assess if the intervention will
      improve social participation among Veterans.
