    
      This is a 12-month, prospective, interventional, multi-center study to monitor safety in
      adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Taiwan who based on
      local practice are newly starting fingolimod at the time of study entry.

      Thirty-four patients will be included in this study in line with the study inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. After entering this study, the participants will continue to be treated
      for MS based on local practice. The patient will be taking fingolimod 0.5mg per day.
      Protocol-mandated procedures and visits for safety data collection will be conducted in
      addition to the required examinations according to the clinical practice.

      If a patient experienced an interruption of fingolimod treatment that requires a
      re-evaluation of FDO, the patient will be discontinued from the study. If the treatment
      interruption does not require a FDO when re-starting fingolimod, the patient can continue to
      participate in this study.
