      cells that persists despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), and is responsible for
      rapid viral rebound once treatment is stopped in most cases. In neonates, HIV-1 infection
      occurs at a time when the adaptive immune system is still in development, which may alter the
      establishment of a long-lasting viral reservoir and offer opportunities to reduce viral
      persistence through early antiretroviral treatment. Recently, scientific understanding of
      neonatal HIV infection has been challenged by the description of an infant who tested
      positive for HIV at birth, was treated with potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      within the first 30 hours of life, and achieved long-term remission of HIV infection when ART
      was stopped approximately 18 months later. Unfortunately, after 2 years off ART, rebound
      viremia occurred in this child, yet this case raises the provocative question of whether ART
      initiated within the first days of life for an antepartum infection, or in the first
      days/weeks of life for a peripartum infection, can prevent the seeding of a long-lasting
      reservoir of HIV infected cells in some infants (and therefore lead to long periods of HIV
      remission off ART).
