      or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR HL) after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)
      failure. It is expecting that BV alone administered earlier (after first treatment failure,
      without any additional treatment) can cure some RR HL patients and spare them from
      ASCT-associated risks and toxicity. Therefore in this study full course of BV which confirmed
      its curative potential in post-ASCT setting will be applicated to the potentially
      transplant-eligible RR HL patients immediately after first treatment failure, with a aim to
      assess curative potential of BV in this setting.
