    
      As no data exists for Palivizumab in the RSV human challenge model, this exploratory study is
      therefore planned to establish the margins of effect and variance of prophylactically
      administered Palivizumab within the RSV-A Memphis 37b challenge model in healthy adult
      volunteers.

      The study will be performed in adults aged 18-55 years, in two parts.

      • Part 1: All participants will be administered Palivizumab (8mg/Kg, intravenously).
      Pharmacokinetic (PK), safety will be measured.

      If there are no safety concerns in Part 1, and PK analysis of Palivizumab treated
      participants confirm the modelling of 8mg/Kg to be appropriate, Part 2 will commence with the
      planned 8mg/Kg treatment dose. However, if PK analysis of Part 1 suggests that 8mg/kg may be
      insufficient dose to provide suitable efficacious coverage in Part 2, then Part 2 will
      proceed with a dose of 15mg/Kg.

      • Part 2: Participants will be either administered Palivizumab (8mg/Kg or 15mg/Kg, as
      determined in Part ) or a placebo and they will subsequently be challenged with an RSV-A
      strain (Memphis 37b). The margin of effect and variance between groups will be measured, as
      well as safety and reactogenicity.
