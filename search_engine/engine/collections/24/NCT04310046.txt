      About 30-60% of patients undergoing TAVI exhibit coexisting coronary artery disease. Optimal
      timing of coronary revascularization in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant
      coronary artery disease undergoing TAVI is uncertain.

      The goal of this investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter, two-arm, open-label,
      non-inferiority trial is to compare two treatment strategies that are currently performed in
      clinical practice: PCI before TAVI versus PCI after TAVI in patients with severe aortic
      stenosis and concomitant coronary artery disease.

      In this trial, consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant coronary
      artery disease accepted for TAVI and PCI by the Heart Team will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to either FFR-guided complete coronary revascularization before (within 1-40 days) or after
      (within 1-40 days) TAVI using the Edwards SAPIEN Transcatheter Heart Valve®.

      For both treatment groups, suitable lesions with FFR≤0.80 or >90% diameter stenosis on
      coronary angiography in a coronary artery ≥2.5 mm in diameter are considered significant.

      TAVI and PCI will be performed according to current guidelines.
