      in length each by a consistent caller, five times a week, Monday through Friday for 4
      consecutive weeks to check in on them. After the first week of calls, subjects in the
      intervention arm will be asked if the frequency of calls is acceptable or if they would like
      to reduce the call frequency, potentially to a minimum of twice per week.

      Brief guidance and training will be provided for the daily conversation to maximize time
      spent speaking by the recipient but otherwise, the calls are unscripted other than specific
      prompts to ask about the recipient's general sense of well-being. "How are you doing today?"

      The control Arm will include 125 MOW clients who will be randomized to a control group that
      will not receive the intervention calls. The control group will receive calls from a member
      of the research team at the beginning of the study to collect baseline survey data and at the
      post-4-week period to collect post-study survey data.
