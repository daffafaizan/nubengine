      Lactobacillus rhamnosus or a combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and
      fructooligosaccharides significantly decreased both the occurrence and the incidence of
      Herpes labialis lesions after stimulation with UVR in a population with recurrent Herpes
      labialis. No difference in the function of either CD8+ T lymphocytes or natural killer cells
      was found, nevertheless a trend, that did not reach statistical significance, was observed
      for some of the immunological analyses pointing out towards an immunemodulating effect of
      probiotic or pre- and probiotic combination minidrink on the adaptive immune system. The end
      of study results of immune analyses were slightly improved compared to the baseline values in
      individuals using the probiotics or the pre- and probiotics combination minidrink, however
      the differences between groups did not reach the significance level. Phagocytosis and killing
      were clearly and statistically different in individuals that used either placebo or
      probiotics or pre- and probiotics minidrinks. Therefore, the probiotics and the pre- and
      probiotics minidrinks have an important effect on innate immunity, resulting in a significant
      improvement of both phagocytosis and killing. No effect was found on the quality of life of
      subjects. No special or unusual features of the safety evaluations were found. No serious
      adverse events were reported during the study.
