      causes limitations and dysfunctions for the patients and also according to some previous
      studies elective ilioinguinal neurectomy could result in less postoperative pain,we decided
      to perform a randomized double blind clinical trial.The primary goal of this study was
      evaluation of the effect of this type of neurectomy on postoperative pain and hyposthesia.
