    
      This is an observational, non-interventional, retrospective cohort study of infants with
      hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (HSCHD) who were less than 24 months of
      age when the first dose of palivizumab was administered (CASES), and infants who were
      diagnosed with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease but did not receive
      palivizumab in a historical respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season during the first 24
      months of life (CONTROLS). CASES are matched to CONTROLS based on RSV season, age, type of
      cardiac lesion, and type of prior corrective cardiac surgery. Subject medical records are
      reviewed for occurrences of the clinical end points of infection, arrhythmia, and/or death
      that meet criteria for serious adverse events. The groups will be compared for number and
      percent of subjects who experience these primary serious adverse events (both individually
      and collectively) during a defined 8-month chart review period.
