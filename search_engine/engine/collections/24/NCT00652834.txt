      it works and how well it is tolerated. Both drugs have the same active ingredient, but they
      are different in the way that they deliver them to the body. Myfortic® is an advanced,
      enteric coated formulation of mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) that delays the release of the
      active ingredient, MPA. MPA has more potent effects on the lymphocytes than other cells. This
      makes for improved GI tolerability of the MPA therapy.
