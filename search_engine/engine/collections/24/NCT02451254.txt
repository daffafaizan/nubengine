    
      Aim: To compare biomarkers and mediators associated with arterial and venous thrombosis from
      blood sampling from the LA, RA, and systemic circulation in patients with AF.

      Methods and population: A prospective trial of patients who undergo circumferential ablation
      of the pulmonary veins. For the clinical procedure, a conventional transeptal puncture is
      performed. In the beginning of the procedure, following transeptal puncture, and before
      intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin (bolus of 50-100 IU/kg), blood samples
      will simultaneously be collected from the peripheral femoral venous sheath, arterial line,
      right atrial sheath, and LA sheath. Samples from the RA and LA will be collected with the
      sheath positioned in the midchamber and close to the appendages. Each Patient will provide up
      to 40ml of blood for the following blood tests: (1) Blood count. (2) Fibrinogen (3) Factor
      VIII (4) D-dimer (5) P-selectin (6) von Willebrand factor (7) TEG - Thromboelastography Serum
      and plasma samples will be stored for future tests.
