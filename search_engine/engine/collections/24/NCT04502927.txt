      The realization of the measures will take place at the GHRMSA rehabilitation department.

      After receiving the written consent of the study participant, the physiotherapist will
      proceed with the passive mobilization of the spastic hand of the stroke patient or the
      dominant hand for healthy volunteers. Videos of the hand will be made using the Darfish
      system which will allow analysis of the primary endpoint.

      Two mobilizations will be performed for each participant, i.e. one for each type of medial or
      lateral grip. The order of mobilization will be determined by randomization.
