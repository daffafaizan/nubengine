      safe blood supply. With an aging population and increased restrictions on who can donate
      blood, maintenance of a stable blood supply is essential. Although 38% of the United States
      population is eligible to donate, only 5% actually does so. Retention of donors is essential
      to assuring the continuity of a safe blood supply; repeat donors are safer, more cost
      effective, and less likely to experience adverse reactions. Current recruitment and retention
      methods may not be sufficient to encourage repeat donations. According to Self-Determination
      Theory, people are more likely to persist with behaviors that are internally versus
      externally motivated. Internal motivation is enhanced by supporting an individual's needs for
      autonomy, competence, and relatedness. One intervention that has shown early promise as a
      novel method to enhance internal motivation to donate blood is motivational interviewing.
      However, implementation of a motivational interviewing intervention is costly and time
      consuming. Given the time and money required for training and delivery of a motivational
      interviewing intervention, the current study is designed to test the efficacy of a
      newly-developed web-based version of a motivational interview. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to complete either an on-line motivational interview about their blood donation
      experience or an on-line knowledge interview about blood donation.
