      brainstem control over LUT. The study will utilize a noninvasive functional MRI (fMRI)
      protocol that allows for evaluation of brainstem activity during continence and micturition
      in real-time, using high-resolution neuroimaging techniques (7T fMRI) in both men and women.
      The study will recruit 20 healthy subjects (10 male and 10 female) for participation in this
      study. The participants for this study will undergo a few tests including a uroflow, PVR and
      a protocol training session during screening at visit 1, and a fMRI at visit 2.

      During screening, subject will be asked to come to their appointment with a full bladder. For
      the uroflow, they will urinate into a special funnel connected to a measuring instrument in a
      private bathroom followed by measuring Post void residual volume through PVR scanner. This is
      to ensure that they do not have any urological issue which can disqualify them from the
      study. At this visit, we will also instruct them about the urine voiding-holding task, our
      noninvasive fMRI paradigm which will involve having the participant drink 500-750 mL of water
      approximately 20 minutes prior to the start of their scan, which the subjects will be
      performing during the fMRI portion of the study at visit 2.

      The subsequent Grey matter (BOLD) signals and functional connectivity (FC) analysis will
      allow investigators to further the current understanding of brainstem control of the LUT and
      bladder cycle.
