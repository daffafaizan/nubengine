        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DT_388IL3 fusion protein in patients with
           refractory or relapsed or poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk
           myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Measure the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Measure the immune responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate response and correlate with disease type (relapsed/refractory or poor-risk de
           novo AML or high-risk MDS), pretreatment marrow blast percentage, and leukemia blast
           interleukin-3 receptor density.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, multicenter, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II,
      open-label study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive DT_388IL3 IV over 15 minutes daily for 5 days in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DT_388IL3 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: An additional 15 patients receive DT_388IL3 at the MTD as in phase I. Patients
           undergo serum and blast collection periodically for laboratory studies, including
           analysis of expression of interleukin-3 receptors and anti-DT_388IL3 antibodies at
           baseline. Samples are also analyzed by immunoenzyme assays and flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
