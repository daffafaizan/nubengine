      to treat hyperglycemia. Julphar Insulin N and Huminsulin® Basal are both intermediate-acting
      human isophane insulins, i.e. consist of a suspension containing a crystalline precipitate of
      isophane human insulin (NPH) complexed with protamine sulphate and zinc. The new insulin,
      Julphar Insulin N, is biosimilar to Huminsulin® Basal. Demonstration of similar absorption
      (PK) and effects (PD) are necessary to achieve market approval of Julphar Insulin N.
