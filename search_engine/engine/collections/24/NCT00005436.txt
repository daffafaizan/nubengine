      The Johns Hopkins Lupus Cohort, begun by Dr. Petri in 1987, was a longitudinal study of the
      incidence and pathogenesis of thrombotic events and coronary artery disease in SLE. The usual
      natural history of thrombotic events and coronary artery disease is telescoped in SLE, so
      that patients present with these outcomes in their third and fourth decades.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Risk factors addressed in the study included: 1) the hypercoagulable state secondary to
      antiphospholipid antibodies (the lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody); 2)
      premature atherosclerosis, accelerated by prednisone and hypertension; 3) underlying vascular
      damage from lupus vasculopathy and vasculitis; 4) co-morbid factors, including obesity,
      smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, sedentary life style, and family history of coronary
      artery disease, and 5) other factors, including sex, age, race, immunogenetics, compliance
      with medication, and socioeconomic status. The Hopkins Cohort Study was uniquely able to
      focus on these issues, both because of its population, which reflected a broad racial,
      educational, and socioeconomic background, and because the four years of data accumulated
      showed promising preliminary results.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
