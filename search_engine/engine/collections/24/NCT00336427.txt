      dramatic increase in neonatal intensive care unit MRSA infections. Could mothers transmit
      MRSA to their newborns if they are asymptomatic carriers? Mothers come into close contact
      with health care providers, often have other children in daycare (known risk factor) and may
      have other exposures to MRSA. Our study was designed to sample 300 mother-infant pairs to
      determine whether MRSA carriage is present in asymptomatic women. The study consisted of
      obtaining informed consent, then performing a sterile swab of mothers' nares and vaginal
      area, then babies' nares and umbilicus once the baby was born.
