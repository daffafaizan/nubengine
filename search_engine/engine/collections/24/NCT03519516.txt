    
      Phase I clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ophthalmic solution
      PRO-174 versus Sophixín Ofteno®, elaborated by Laboratorios Sophia, S.A. of C.V. on the
      ocular surface of ophthalmologically and clinically healthy subjects.

      Goals:

      Methodology:

      Phase I clinical trial, controlled, of parallel groups, double blind, randomized,
      exploratory.

      Number of patients:

      30 subjects, divided into 2 groups [15 subjects (30 eyes) exposed per group]

      Test product, dose and route of administration, lot number:

        -  PRO-174. Levofloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution. Prepared by Laboratorios Sophia, S.A. of

      Duration of treatment: 7 days

      Statistical methodology:

      The data will be expressed with measures of central tendency: mean and standard deviation for
      the quantitative variables. The qualitative variables will be presented in frequencies and
      percentages. The statistical analysis will be carried out through the Mann-Whitney U test for
      the quantitative variables for the difference between the groups. The intra-group difference
      will be made with the Wilcoxon rank test. The difference between the qualitative variables
      will be analyzed by means of X2 (Chi2). An alpha ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant.
