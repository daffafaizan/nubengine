      factors interact with the biological effects of estrogen on the brain and consequently on
      cognition and behavior. Turner syndrome females lack endogenous estrogen as a result of
      dysgenetic ovaries. Turner syndrome therefore represents a unique, estrogen-deficient model
      in which to study the biological effects of estrogen on cognition and behavior. The specific
      aims of this project are to: 1) document further, the cognitive differences between girls
      with Turner syndrome at ages 5 to adult (less than or equal to age 50) versus age-matched,
      female controls. 2) to examine the differential effects of continuous estrogen replacement in
      infancy and in early childhood on cognitive and social function in a unique, previously
      approved, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment trial (87-CH-0152).
      Specifically, we hypothesize that estrogen replacement in early childhood will reduce the
      cognitive deficits of girls with Turner syndrome. In addition, we hypothesize that the degree
      of socialization ability in these girls will correlate with social-behavioral and social
      recognition ability. Finally, we hypothesize that earlier (infancy to 8 years) and longer
      estrogen replacement will result in less impairment of visual-motor ability, visual-spatial
      ability, socialization ability, and affective competence compared to later (9 to 12 years)
      estrogen replacement in girls with Turner syndrome.

      Children with Turner syndrome and controls will be tested in the Outpatient Departments at
      the two approved sites of protocol 87-CH-0152; the NIH and Thomas Jefferson University.
