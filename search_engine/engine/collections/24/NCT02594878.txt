      pathogenesis is unknown. The disease is mainly diagnosed in childhood. There is a strong
      association with inflammatory disorders of the skin, mainly psoriasis. The disease is
      characterized by recurrent episodes of pain and disability. It is unclear if SAPHO syndrome
      (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis) might be the adult version of chronic
      non-bacterial osteomyelitis. The disease can persist in adulthood and course chronic bone
      deformations.

      Wholebody MRI is the most sensitive imaging for diagnosing and monitoring the non bacterial
      osteitis.

      The treatment of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis is largely empiric. First line treatment
      is NSAID (Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug). When NSAID is inadequate the bisphosphonate
      pamidronate has been described relief pain in small cohorts in retrospective studies.

      In this research protocol, investigators seek to investigate if it is beneficial to use
      pamidronate in the treatment of chronic non bacterial osteomyelitis and the osteitis
      component in SAPHO syndrome. Primary outcome is whole body MRI. Secondary outcome is CT scan,
      patient measure reported outcome and biomarkers. A biobank may help us to understand the
      pathogenesis and future treatment targets of chronic non bacterial osteomyelitis.
