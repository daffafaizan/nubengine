      providing insulin dosing and titration information utilizing a V-Go disposable insulin
      delivery device. We look to compare two treatment arms of insulin dosing and titration in
      patients with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes - a fixed dose titration arm, and an arm
      where 50% of the insulin dose is given at the largest meal of the day. This study will
      provide practical information on glycemic control, dose requirements and safety in patients
      with Type 2 diabetes on basal insulin with or without oral anti-diabetic agents who are being
      primarily managed in the primary care office.
