        -  Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in post-operative outcomes using additional
           patient reported measures at 2 years: PKIP (overall and sub-scores), KOOS (overall and
           sub-scores), AKS and EQ-5D-3L.

        -  Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in pain and satisfaction over time as
           measured using a modified VAS Pain Score (discrete numbers rather than a continual
           scale) at 2yr.

        -  Evaluate type and frequency of Adverse Events

        -  Evaluate survivorship of the ATTUNE Primary Cementless TKA system for the CR RP and PS
           RP configurations using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 2yr and 5yrs.

        -  Evaluate primary, cementless ATTUNE TKA fixation through zonal radiographic analysis of
           the bone-implant interface at 6wk, 6mo, 1yr, and 2yr after surgery.

        -  Evaluate any changes in anatomic tibiofemoral, femoral component and tibial component
           alignment at 2 years compared to the first postoperative radiographs.
