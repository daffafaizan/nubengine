      different toxicities. This study will involve therapy of patients with AIDS or ARC with two
      of these agents, AZT and 2', 3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), which have different toxicity profiles,
      over a 2-year period of time. The rationale for using the two drugs will be to reduce
      toxicity and also possibly to delay or prevent the development of resistance. Patients will
      be randomized to receive either an alternating regimen or a continuous simultaneous regimen
      with these two drugs. The study will be structured as a randomized pilot study.
