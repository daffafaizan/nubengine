      Peyronie's disease and testosterone deficiency. Subject age range will be 18-70 years. Each
      subject will participate for approximately 6 months. All 20 subjects will receive Xiaflex®
      plus T treatment (Aveed®). Data collected from this pilot project will be analyzed and
      compared to historical data regarding treatment for PD using Xiaflex® only.

      The eligibility criterion for 2 samples of total testosterone (<350ng/dL) or free
      testosterone (1.5 ng/dL analog assay or 100pg/mL calculated free testosterone) was chosen
      with the aim of demonstrating what the effect of testosterone treatment is on men that fall
      into the low range. The remainder of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are designed to
      select subjects for whom protocol treatment is considered appropriate. All relevant medical
      and non-medical conditions will be taken into consideration when deciding whether this
      protocol is suitable for a particular subject.
