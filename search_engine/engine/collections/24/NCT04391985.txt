      Sofosbuvir/Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/ Ritonavir plus Ribavirin (OBV/PTV/r plus RBV), which was
      administered orally based on the participants' tolerability. The primary end point was a
      sustained virological response (HCV RNA level < 15 IU/ mL), observed 12 weeks after the end
      of the treatment (SVR12).
