      method of this important problem is to prolong the pregnancy period and to use
      corticosteroids to prevent fetal pulmonary distress. The most widely studied tocolytic
      agents, ritodrin, salbutamol and terbutaline are all betamimetics, and they are shown to
      prolong birth labor till 7 days and do not have any effct on the fetal mortality. However,
      their maternal side-effects are inevitable and can be mortal. They cause tachycardia,
      hypotension and some biochemical disturbances. Furthermore, maternal death is possible due to
      pulmonary edema. These adrenergic agonists are the first line tocolytics, but calcium canal
      blockers are becoming more popular since they have less side effects and comparable efficacy.

      Calcium canal blockers are nonspecific smooth muscle relaxants used in adult hypertension
      treatment. Their tocolytic effect depends on their inhibition of calcium ions into the
      myometrial cells. In vitro studies have shown that they have strong relaxant effects on human
      myometrium. In the present study, our aim is to investigate the effects of nifedipine in our
      clinic in a period between 2002 and 2005, when it was first used in our clinic as the sÄ±ngle
      tocolytic agent. Its success in preventing preterm labor and its complications in our earlier
      practice will be noted and this retrospective study will guide us in its current usage,
      dosages and side-effects.
