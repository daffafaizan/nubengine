      hospitalization and death, a reservoir of the disease, and the source of any second wave.
      Three important gaps still besiege their well-being and, consequently, the well-being of all
      of us. First, we cannot yet accurately predict the approximately 10% who deteriorate and need
      hospitalization. Deterioration happens quick and without warning. Delayed detection of
      deterioration worsens patient outcomes. Second, COVID patients feel terrified and alone. This
      leads them to come to EDs when not indicated, to have poor mental health and to risk
      violating physical distancing rules. Third, the health of people with COVID cannot be
      improved without having a means of studying and understanding what they are going through.
      None of these gaps are being filled by public health.

      It is imperative that Ontario have an effective and safe outpatient care and research
      strategy for people with COVID isolated at home and in long term care to survive this COVID
      pandemic.

      The investigators are building a mobile smartwatch/smartphone application to create a
      scalable safe virtual system that meets the care needs of COVID patients at home and in long
      term care (including reassurance when they are doing well), that uses continuous symptom,
      heart rate, respiratory rate, cough and other monitoring to predict who needs to go to
      hospital in real time and that provides a research platform to learn how to further improve
      and preserve their health.
