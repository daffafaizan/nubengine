      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE, delivered
      intramuscularly three times at three dose levels in subjects with high-risk colorectal,
      pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal adenocarcinomas with no evidence of disease (NED) after
      surgery and standard therapy

      II. Evaluate the cellular (T-cell) responses to Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at three different dose
      levels (10^11, 10^12, and 5x10^12 vp) administered intramuscularly three times, four weeks
      apart in subjects with high-risk colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal cancer with
      NED after surgery and standard therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the humoral immunologic response to GCC, defined as an incremental or sustained
      antibody (pan-Ig) response, measured at Weeks 5, 9, and 13 following the first vaccination
      (Week 1).

      II. Evaluate the relationship between immunological responses to GCC and 1) neutralizing
      antibodies to Ad5 and Ad5.F35 and 2) GCC protein expression in tumors to assess immune
      tolerance.

      III. Evaluate DFS and OS, where feasible.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. A safety cohort of 3 patients per arm (9
      total) will be enrolled first. If determined safe to continue, additional patients will be
      enrolled.

      ARM I: After completion of definitive surgery and standard therapy, Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at
      10^11vp Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5, and 9

      ARM II: After completion of definitive surgery and standard therapy, Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at
      10^12vp Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5, and 9

      ARM III: After completion of definitive surgery and standard therapy, Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at
      5x10^12vp Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5, and 9

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 24 months.
