      dexamethasone 40 mg po daily for 4 consecutive days. If the platelet count drops below
      30X109/L after response within 6 months, another four-day course of dexamethasone will be
      given, followed by 15 mg of prednisone daily, with gradual tapering (Arm 1).

      Prednisone 1 mg/kg po daily for 4-8 weeks, the drug is then decreased slowly over another few
      weeks (Arm 2).
