      produce growth hormone (GH) and GH receptor is expressed on different subpopulations of
      lymphocytes. Many in vitro and in animal studies demonstrate an important role of GH in
      immunoregulation. GH stimulates T and B cells proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis,
      enhances the maturation of myeloid progenitor cells and is also able to modulate cytokine
      response.

      The use of growth hormone in obese cases with COVID-19 may help them to recover earlier.
