    
      A total of 70 patients scheduled for a first ablation of paroxysmal AF will be included.
      Patients will be 1:1 randomized to PVI using the PVAC gold catheter or the cooled-tip
      catheter. A control group of 20 patients with AF but without undergoing ablation is included
      for neuropsychological testing.

      Before the procedure, the procoagulant state will be assessed by measuring several markers of
      endothelial damage, activated coagulation, fibrinolysis and by measurement of fibrinogen and
      thrombin generation. Measurements will be repeated during and after the procedure.

      Documentation of the formation of CE will be established by performing a DW-MRI before and
      after the ablation. The proportion of symptomatic CE will be quantified by neuropsychological
      tests and questionnaires.

      Finally, transcranial doppler will be performed during the entire procedure to quantify the
      number and pattern of cerebral microembolic signals (MES).
