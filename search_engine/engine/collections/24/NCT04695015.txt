      the Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University Third Hospital, will be selected and
      enrolled after informed consent to collect basic clinical information, preoperative blood
      samples, and ocular tumors Obtain pathological image annotation data and genomics-related
      data from ocular tumor tissue specimens, use blood samples for genomics information analysis,
      provide multi-dimensional data for the development of artificial intelligence algorithms, and
      establish artificial intelligence-assisted image data for eye tumors Standardize the process
      and establish a multi-modal ocular tumor standardized database of "clinical
      information-tissue samples-pathological images-genomics data". The database and the diagnosis
      system are correlated with each other to provide optimal image data for later machine
      learning and related algorithm establishment, and finally the investigators will be completed
      the design of a new artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis system for eye tumors.
