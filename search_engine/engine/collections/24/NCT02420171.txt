      suppose that adding insulin as a hormon and growth factor might improve embryo development in
      vitro so we decide to design a trial to compare the embryogenesis by sibling Oocytes of the
      same patient between to arm of the same culture media and yhe same culture condition but with
      one arm with insulin and the other is traditional one and closely monitor the outcome within
      the 2 arms abd record the results
