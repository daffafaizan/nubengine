      medicine is expected to be an effective method for preventing the initiation and progression
      of cancer. Although anatomical and functional imaging techniques such as radiography,
      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography
      (PET) have played an important role for accurate preoperative diagnostics, for the most part
      these techniques cannot be applied intraoperatively. Optical molecular imaging is a promising
      technique that provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in tumor margin
      detection. Furthermore, existing clinical applications have proven that optical molecular
      imaging is a powerful intraoperative tool for guiding surgeons performing precision
      procedures, thus enabling radical resection and improved survival rates. However, detection
      depth limitation exists in optical molecular imaging methods and further breakthroughs from
      optical open surgery to minimally invasive intraoperative imaging methods are needed to
      develop more extensive and comprehensive intraoperative applications.
