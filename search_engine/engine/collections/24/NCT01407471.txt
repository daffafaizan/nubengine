      topical glucocorticoids which are the treatment of choice for many inflammatory skin
      diseases. This atrophy results in fragile skin, delay of healing, purpura, irreversible
      striae, telangiectasia and secondary infections. Up to now, no treatments can prevent
      efficiently skin atrophy.

      The mineralocorticoid receptor, belonging to the superfamily of nuclear receptors, is
      expressed in human epidermis but its actual function is unknown. Experimental results in
      animals obtained in INSERM unit U772 by Dr N FARMAN suggest that spironolactone which is a
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist 1- might limit epidermal atrophy and 2- might promote
      healing.

      Study description We propose to test clinically these hypotheses for the first time on
      humans, at the CIC in BICHAT's hospital on healthy volunteers: 1- by applying on the skin a
      highly potent cutaneous corticosteroids in association or not with spironolactone, 2- by
      applying or not spironolactone on wounds after 3-mm punch biopsies.
