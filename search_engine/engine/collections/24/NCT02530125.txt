      I. To estimate the rate of response, whereby either cluster of differentiation
      (CD)4+CD25+programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)+ T lymphocytes or CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T
      lymphocytes has an "increase" following administration of pidilizumab in patients with
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have completed induction chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of pidilizumab therapy following induction
      chemotherapy.

      II. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years. III. To estimate the overall
      survival (OS) at 2 years. IV. To estimate time to second line chemotherapy (TSLC) at 2 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway specific expression markers from the
      diagnostic biopsy specimens.

      II. To characterize serum biomarkers of immune and inflammatory response during treatment
      with pidilizumab.

      III. To characterize levels of soluble PD-L1 related to treatment with pidilizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pidilizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 5 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 42 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 months
      for 2 years.
