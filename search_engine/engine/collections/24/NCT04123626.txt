    
      QR-1123 is an antisense oligonucleotide, designed to specifically target the mutant P23H
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in order to reduce the expression of the P23H protein
      selectively, while preserving expression of the wild type (WT) rhodopsin (RHO) protein. It is
      hypothesized that the reduction of mutant P23H mRNA will reduce the deleterious effects of
      the dominant-negative protein and should result in increased function of WT rhodopsin protein
      in photoreceptors. Restoration of WT RHO function is expected to improve vision in patients
      with adRP due to the P23H mutation.

      The study will comprise up to 8 single dose and repeat dose cohorts. Prior to initiating a
      higher single dose cohort and/or prior to initiating repeat dose cohort(s), available safety
      and efficacy data will be reviewed by the DMC.

      In the single dose cohorts subjects will receive a single, unilateral IVT injection of
      QR-1123 in an open label fashion. In the repeat dose cohorts subjects will be randomized to
      receive either a unilateral IVT injection of QR-1123 every 3 months or a unilateral sham
      procedure every 3 months, in a double masked fashion. Subjects will be followed for safety,
      tolerability and efficacy for a total period of 12 months.
