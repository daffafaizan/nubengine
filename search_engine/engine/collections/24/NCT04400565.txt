    
      This is a randomized control trial. Participants will be recruited from the psychiatric
      outpatient clinic of National Cheng Kung University Hospital. They will be randomly assigned
      to the intervention group or control group. The recovery program has 2 phases and consists of
      20 classes, 1.5 hour per class and one class per week. We will introduce concepts of recovery
      and personal strengths in phase 1. Then, we will help participants to set goals and implement
      their plans in phase 2. Participants will fill out three questionnaires during the
      recruitment meeting, including Stages of Recovery Scale, Empowerment Scale, and Brief Symptom
      Rating Scale-50. They will fill out the same questionnaires plus the course satisfaction
      survey in the end of phase 1 and 2. Three months later, participants will receive a follow-up
      interview and fill out the questionnaires again. The control group will receive a spiritual
      book and complete the questionnaires at the same time as the intervention group.
