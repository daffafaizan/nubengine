      that is capable of reducing the rate of formation of new skin cancers in patients with
      xeroderma pigmentosum or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. II. Determine the possible
      side effects associated with long-term use of isotretinoin in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (xeroderma pigmentosum vs nevoid
      basal cell carcinoma syndrome). Patients not previously treated with isotretinoin receive
      oral isotretinoin daily for 2 years and then are followed without receiving isotretinoin for
      1 year. After the follow-up period, treatment may be resumed if the rate of new skin tumor
      formation reaches 2 per year provided original eligibility criteria are met. Treatment may be
      resumed during the follow-up period if the rate of new skin tumor formation increases to the
      rate observed before study. Patients previously treated with oral isotretinoin continue
      treatment and are followed to evaluate any long-term effects of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
