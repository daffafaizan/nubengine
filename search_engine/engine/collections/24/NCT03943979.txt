      condition) or CT+tDCS (Active condition) stimulation on food intake in a sample of morbidly
      obese patients, as measured by dietary assessments the week before, during and the week after
      the intervention. Additionally, to further understand the neuropsychological and
      neurophysiological basis of its impact, measures of executive function and attention
      performance and EEG recordings, respectively, will be collected. Furthermore, we will explore
      the effect of the intervention on endocannabinoids previously related to eating behaviour.

      The Active Control condition will receive sham stimulation together with CT, through a
      computerized cognitive training platform (Guttmann NeuropersonalTrainer), including different
      tasks with designed to train executive functions and attention. Each session will last
      approximately 30-40 min.

      The Active condition will receive tDCS stimulation (20 min, multichannel with an excitatory
      target over the r-dlPFC) together with CT (same as for the Active Control condition).

      Participants will undergo a basal (the week before intervention) and a post treatment
      assessments (the day after finishing the intervention) that will include medical history,
      blood testing, anthropometric measures, a cognitive assessment battery and a 4-day dietary
      assessment.
