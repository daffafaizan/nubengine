      moderate-severe postoperative pain. Poor pain control in the postoperative period can lead to
      increased postoperative morbidities and poor quality of life. Furthermore, an emerging
      clinical literature suggests that acute pain may rapidly evolve into chronic pain if poorly
      treated. A meta-analysis of the literature found that > 30% patients had chronic pain one
      year after abdominal hysterectomy (5). Therefore, efficient postoperative pain management is
      imperative for the patient and is one of the new pain management standards recommended
      recently.

      Local anesthetics (LA) have been infiltrated subcutaneously, infused intra-abdominally, as
      well as injected into the peritoneal cavity as a single dose at the end of the operation
      following abdominal hysterectomy with variable effects. When injected as a single dose,
      analgesia is limited to approximately 2-4 hours due to the short duration of action of local
      anesthetics. In one recent study, the authors used a catheter inserted intra-abdominally and
      local anesthetic or placebo infusion into the abdominal cavity for 24 h postoperatively and
      found a reduction in postoperative analgesic requirements by 40% during 4-24 h. In another
      study, the investigators found that LA injected intermittently intra-abdominally resulted in
      better pain relief compared to intra-abdominal infusions.
