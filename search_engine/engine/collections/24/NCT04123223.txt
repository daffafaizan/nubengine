      exhibit marked neurocognitive deficits on measures of attention, learning and memory,
      problem-solving, language and sensory-motor skill. Particular significance has been attached
      to these deficits as their severity has been linked to impaired community function, social
      problem-solving and progress in psychosocial rehabilitation programs. Cognitive remediation
      (CR) is a type of behavioral intervention that addresses cognitive deficits in schizophrenia
      by restoring lost cognitive skills or providing strategies for bypassing deficits through
      task practice. Meta-analyses have revealed that cognitive remediation is a validated approach
      to improving cognitive function in schizophrenia, however a lack of precision regarding the
      active elements of the intervention have prevented its recommendation as a standard treatment
      for the illness. The present three-year proposal seeks to identify cognitive training
      mechanisms that are most effective at improving cognitive function in schizophrenia by
      comparing two different systematic programs of CR with different foci: drill-and-practice
      exercises vs. compensatory strategies. Both programs have strong preliminary empirical
      support. One-hundred and thirty-five clients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a neuroplasticity-based,
      drill-and-practice program of computer-assisted cognitive training exercises designed to
      restore lost cognitive capacity; a manualized strategy training method for bypassing deficits
      in cognition, or a computer games control condition. Study measures, organized according to
      an experimental therapeutics approach, with targets distinguished from outcomes, will assess
      generalization of any observed training effects.
