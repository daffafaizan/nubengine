      positive for postnatal depression on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) would be
      recruited randomly assigned into two groups in each of the four primary health care (PHC)
      facilities designated for the present study. Groups one will receive the LTP+CaCBT treatment
      - the intervention will consist of a total of 12 (social distancing) group training sessions
      (60-90 minutes). Groups two will receive routine treatment as usual (TAU) currently available
      in the PHC facilities (e.g. antidepressants) in the selected communities. Each group will
      comprise of approximately 10 mother-child pairs.
