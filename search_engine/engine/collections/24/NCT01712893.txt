      premenopausal patients received chemotherapy for breast cancer. However this is still a
      controversial issue. Sequential use of GnRHa (Zoladex) as ovarian suppression treatment after
      chemotherapy has been established as an effective endocrine therapy for ER positive
      premenopausal breast cancer. The present study is a randomized open-label phase III study
      that aims to observe the efficacy and safety of the adjuvant chemotherapy with simultaneous
      combination of Zoladex up to 2-3years and chemotherapy compared with the sequential schedule
      in â‰¤ 45 year old premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients.
