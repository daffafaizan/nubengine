      rate. LDE225 is a new type of drug that inhibits or blocks a pathway responsible for cancer
      cell growth. LDE225 is an investigational drug that has been used either solely or in
      combination with chemotherapy in other types of cancer but not in ovarian cancer. Research
      evidence suggests that by combining LDE225 and paclitaxel together, ovarian cancer cells may
      become more responsive to treatment.
