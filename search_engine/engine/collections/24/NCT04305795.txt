    
      Cohorts of patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous cell cancer of the head and
      neck (HNSCC) or advanced or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma will receive
      anti-PD1 therapy in combination with anti EGFR antibody-dye conjugate, ASP-1929, followed by
      photoimmunotherapy (PIT). HNSCC patients are required to have positive expression of
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) defined by Combined Positive Score (CPS) â‰¥1. Primary
      endpoints are safety, tolerability, and tumor response of ASP-1929 PIT treatment in
      combination with anti-PD1.
