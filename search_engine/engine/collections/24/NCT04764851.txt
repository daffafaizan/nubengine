      research unit into one of three cohorts. On the morning of Day 1, subjects in cohorts 1, 2,
      and 3 will receive fasted doses of probe substrate(s) per assigned cohort. On Day 5, Cohort 2
      only will receive a second fasted dose of probe substrates. Subjects in cohorts 1, 2, and 3
      will receive the final fasted dose of probe substrate(s) on Day 13. Fasted ecopipam
      administration will begin on Day 5 and will continue through Day 17 at ~2mg/kg for all
      cohorts. Ecopipam doses will be tapered starting on Day 18 by 25 mg/day increments until
      subjects are off drug, with final discharge occurring 24 hours after the ecopipam HCl dose
      has been reduced to 25 mg (Day 21, 23, or 25).
