    
      The overall purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a 9-week
      integrative medicine program that is comprised of a prescribed anti-inflammatory
      (Mediterranean) diet, as well as general behavioral and psychosocial support among patients
      with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS), in order to
      determine the recruitment potential in this population and to measure the ability of
      individuals to complete the program. Participants will be prescribed a food plan, and
      adherence to and feasibility of the food plan will be measured through participant food
      tracking and a subjective assessment of the food plan in a brief satisfaction survey.

      This study aims to recruit 20 patients with HSD or EDS and make preliminary observations
      regarding the effects of integrative medical care on pain reduction and improved quality of
      life.
