      receive a 6-week exercise training program with testing occurring before and following the
      training program. Participants will be provided with 3 days of a high fat diet prior to each
      of the three testing sessions at the Clinical Research Unit. All who agree to participate
      will undergo the same intervention.

      The goal of this proposal is to study the impact of a 6-week moderate intensity walking
      training program on exercise induced lipid metabolic flexibility in older adults with
      prediabetes. Study Investigators will seek to determine if exercise induced lipid oxidation
      following a high fat diet is increased in trained individuals relative to their baseline.
