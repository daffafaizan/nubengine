      study. The overall duration of treatment (Core and Extension) is approximately 104 weeks with
      the Core study being 26 weeks and the Extension study being 76 weeks. Approximately 45
      participants 18 years of age and over who meet all the eligibility requirements will be
      randomized. No single platelet count should be greater than 35x10^9/L (liter). Participants
      will be centrally stratified at randomization by splenectomy status, baseline platelet count,
      and use of concomitant ITP medication at baseline, and randomized to receive either
      double-blind avatrombopag or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will receive blinded
      therapy at a starting dose of 20 mg avatrombopag or placebo once daily. Participants will be
      allowed to have their dose titrated up (maximum dose 40 mg avatrombopag or matching placebo)
      or down (minimum dose 5 mg for avatrombopag or matching placebo) depending on their response
      to study drug. The goal of dose modification is to maintain the platelet count at levels
      greater than or equal to 50x10^9/L and less than or equal to 150x10^9/L, and to decrease the
      need for ITP-directed concomitant medications.
