      1. To estimate the RFS in patients with HER2 positive locally advanced breast cancer
      vaccinated with a HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the safety of a HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine administered concurrently with
           trastuzumab.

        2. To determine the immunogenicity of the HER2 ICD peptide based vaccine when given within
           one year of initiating standard treatment which includes trastuzumab.

             1. To determine the incidence of the development of T cell immunity specific for the
                HER2 ICD.

             2. To determine the incidence of the development of intramolecular epitope spreading.

             3. To determine the magnitude of the HER2 ICD specific CD4+ and CD8+ immune response
                generated with immunization.

        3. To assess whether there is an association between RFS and the development of an immune
           response (HER2 specific T cell immunity and/or the development of intramolecular epitope
           spreading).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HER-2/neu intracellular domain peptide-based vaccine mixed with GM-CSF
      intradermally (ID) once monthly for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months and
      then annually thereafter for up to 5 years.
