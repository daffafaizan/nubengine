    
      This study will comprise a single dose, sequential group design. Overall, up to 72 subjects
      will be studied in up to 9 planned groups (Groups 1 to 9), with each group consisting of 8
      subjects. In addition, a further 6 subjects will participate in a crossover food effect arm.

      Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to dosing. Each subject will participate in 1
      treatment period only, except the food effect arm where subjects will be dosed both fed and
      fasted. Subjects will reside at the clinical research unit from Day -1 (the day before
      dosing) to Day 5.

      All subjects will return for a follow-up visit 7 to 14 days after dosing. The investigator
      (or designee) may also request that the subject return for an additional follow up visit.

      In each of groups 1 to 9, 6 subjects will receive a single dose of HTL0014242 and 2 subjects
      will receive placebo oral capsule in accordance with a randomisation schedule. In the food
      effect arm, 6 subjects will receive a single dose of HTL0014242 in both the fed and fasted
      state, separated by 14 days.
