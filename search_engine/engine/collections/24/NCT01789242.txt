      of carfilzomib in patients with previously treated systemic light-chain amyloidosis. The
      study will also explore the efficacy of carfilzomib in both proteasome inhibitor-naive and
      proteasome inhibitor-exposed patients including hematologic response, organ response,
      progression free survival, and time to next therapy.
