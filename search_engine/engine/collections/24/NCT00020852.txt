        -  Determine the feasibility of temperature-monitored, ultrasound-guided cryosurgery in
           women with highly suspicious breast lesions.

        -  Determine the safety of this procedure in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo cryoablation of up to two breast lesions. Within 3-21 days, patients undergo
      lumpectomy or mastectomy.

      Patients are followed at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after lumpectomy or mastectomy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
