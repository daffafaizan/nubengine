      that rhPDGF is effective in enhancing wound healing.

      OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of R-Pdf/Gbb gel
      in treating wounds caused by III degree thermal and electrical burns.

      HYPOTHESIS 1: That the applications of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel on III degree thermal and
      electrical burns will heal these wounds within 3 months.

      HYPOTHESIS 2: Subjects, who having III degree thermal and electrical burns with the treatment
      of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel, will show improvement in general condition without any complications.

      We aim to test these hypotheses by evaluating the clinical outcome in about 120 patients
      after three months of treatment with R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel applied once daily.
