      I. To record electrocorticogram (ECoG) data intraoperatively with surface electrode grids
      during various motor, sensory (tactile) and speech tasks, and identify functional brain areas
      through the spectral analysis, and compare the preliminary data with our current pre-surgical
      mapping methods: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS), and the gold standard, intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To perform a preliminary assessment of the utility of using ECoG data in these patients to
      quantify new neurological deficits in the short term (24 hours) and long-term (1 and 3
      months), and achieve a safe maximal tumor resection.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo tumor resection. During surgery, patients also undergo electrocorticography
      with either the CorTec high resolution hybrid grid, the PMT high-resolution grid, or the
      Ad-Tech grid followed by direct electrocortical stimulation.

      Following completion of study, patients are followed up within 24 hours from surgery and at 1
      and 3 months.
