    
      Eligible subjects will receive pembrolizumab beginning on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle
      (d1, qd22) together with maraviroc administered perorally on day 1 to 21 of each cycle
      (d1-21; qd22).

      Treatment with pembrolizumab / maraviroc combination will continue until progressive disease
      (PD), unacceptable adverse events (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further
      administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject
      withdraws consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure
      requirements, administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment, or completion of
      treatment per protocol.

      Subjects with a treatment response or stable disease after completion of the first treatment
      phase of eight cycles (core treatment period) will be offered, at the discretion of the
      investigator, participation in a maintenance phase consisting of up to 24 additional
      treatment cycles of pembrolizumab monotherapy (total treatment duration up to 24 months).

      Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than PD will have post-treatment follow-up for
      disease status until PD, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent, or
      becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed for overall survival (OS) until
      death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study.

      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for AE monitoring.
      Serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs of special interest (AESIs) will be collected for 90
      days after the end of treatment or for 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject
      initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
