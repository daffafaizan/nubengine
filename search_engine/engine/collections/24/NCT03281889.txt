      participants that require craniospinal radiation (whole brain and spinal cord radiation
      therapy) with sparing of the bony spine will work. This is the first time investigators are
      examining bone sparing proton therapy in pediatric craniospinal radiation.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved proton radiation for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying proton radiation in participants that
      require craniospinal radiation. The standard of care for this procedure is photon radiation,
      which is very similar to proton radiation. The investigators believe that the precision of
      proton radiation may help to reduce the negative effects radiation has on the surrounding
      non-cancerous growing and developing tissue
