      I. To compare perioperative outcomes and complications after robotic assisted radical
      cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion (IUD) and RARC with extracorporeal
      urinary diversion (EUD) in a prospective randomized fashion.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to passage of flatus. II. Analgesic requirement (narcotic use). III. Hospital length
      of stay. IV. Total operating time. V. Estimated blood loss. VI. Readmission rate. VII.
      Bladder Cancer Index Questionnaire. VIII. Ureteral strictures. IX. Stomal stenosis. X.
      Disease recurrence. XI. Secondary procedures.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo RARC with IUD.

      ARM II: Patients undergo RARC with EUD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 90 days and then for 2-5
      years.
