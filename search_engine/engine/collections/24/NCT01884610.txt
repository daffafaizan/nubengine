      unrelated donors, post donation and confirm or refute the observations of "long-term genetic
      or epigenetic effects" published by Nagler et al[Nagler,A. et al. Exp.Haem (2004) 32;122-30].
      The employment of more sensitive methods such as iFISH and gene array analysis to assess any
      permanent genetic changes, our primary objective, will make our study more robust.

      There will be two arms:

      i) Retrospective arm - the peripheral blood of unrelated donors who donated 3 to 5 years
      previously will be screened.

      ii) Prospective arm - peripheral blood of unrelated donors will be examined prior to donation
      and at 120 and 360 day's post-donation. In those found to have aneuploid changes at these
      time points, there will be additional sampling at 24 and 36 months and if necessary these
      donors will be followed up.

      Each arm of the study will include 50 BM unrelated donors and 50 PBSC unrelated donors giving
      a total sample population of around 200 unrelated donors. There will be one positive control
      group of 50 patients with a range of haematological malignancies. The blood samples taken
      from both BM and PBSC donors prior to donation will act as internal negative controls.
