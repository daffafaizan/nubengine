    
      CAV, a rapidly progressive obliterative disease involving the graft coronary arteries, is the
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality beyond the first year after heart transplantation.
      This common complication occurs in almost half of recipients within 3 years after heart
      transplantation, and is associated with high rates of graft failure and mortality. Clinical
      care of heart transplant recipients in the current era is greatly limited by the lack of
      effective treatment options to prevent or retard the progression of CAV. CAV appears to be
      strongly associated with the state of insulin resistance, which is present in over half of
      heart transplant recipients and is characterized by metabolic abnormalities including glucose
      intolerance, dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, and high levels of circulating
      inflammatory markers. Insulin resistance can be effectively treated with pioglitazone, a TZD
      compound which directly affects tissue insulin sensitivity. In this study, we will enroll 32
      insulin-resistant heart transplant recipients and will randomize them to pioglitazone or
      placebo for a one-year period. We will determine the efficacy of pioglitazone for the
      treatment of insulin resistance and prevention of the development and progression of CAV
      after heart transplantation. The data generated from this study will provide important
      preliminary data for future, larger-scale clinical investigations.
