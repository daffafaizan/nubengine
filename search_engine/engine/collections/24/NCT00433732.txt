      placebo as assessed by pain relief and the incidences of photophobia, phonophobia and nausea
      at 2 hours after treatment as the primary endpoints. Another objective of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of Trexima when compared to the individual components (sumatriptan and
      naproxen sodium) using sustained pain-free as the endpoint. It is the intent that this study
      be sufficiently powered to detect differences that are clinically meaningful and
      statistically significant in order to meet both objectives.
