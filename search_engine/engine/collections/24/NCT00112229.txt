      immune activation is often only weak or even undetectable, and clinical responses (supposedly
      corresponding to protective immunity) are unfortunately infrequent. Further progress is
      required to improve the vaccines, with the goal to increase the strength of immune
      activation.

      The tumor antigenic peptides Melan-A/Mart-1 (EAA and ELA) and Tyrosinase (YMD) are combined
      with two drugs in this study, both of which are known to enhance immune responses: first, CpG
      7909 oligodeoxynucleotides, and second, Montanide ISA-51.
