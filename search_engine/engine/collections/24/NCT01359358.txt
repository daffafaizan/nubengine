      alternatives of treatment for diseases caused by this pathogen are available. In this study,
      36 isolates from colonization or different clinical specimens from infected patients of the
      Hospital Rizoleta Tolentino Neves will be analyzed. These results will provide important data
      for doctors and nurses, such as whether there is any strain dissemination or not in the
      hospital what could suggest an outbreak. It will be performed molecular typing by pulsed
      field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The investigators
      will evaluate the efficiency of several antimicrobials and the frequency of h-VISA and VISA
      among the Brazilian MRSA. Besides, the investigators will verify the presence of mutation in
      genes that are involved in resistance mechanisms of VISA. According to the strains profile
      present in the hospital, if this is suggested that there is a dissemination of some strain,
      the health professionals can start a more rigid infection control measures in order to
      decrease the number of cases of nosocomial infection, decreasing the time of hospitalization
      of patients and, consequently the cost for the hospital.
