      reversible. Because of a poor understanding of COPD pathogenesis, treatment is mostly
      symptomatic and new therapeutic strategies are limited. There is a direct relationship
      between the severity of the disease and the intensity of the inflammatory response.One of the
      hypothesis for persistent airway inflammation is that the presence of recurrent infections is
      responsible for this condition.

      Macrolide antibiotics have a bacteriostatic as well as anti-inflammatory properties. This
      clinical trial will investigate whether maintenance treatment with macrolide antibiotics
      during 1 year in people with 3 or more exacerbations in the preceding year of inclusion can
      decrease the exacerbation rate in that same year of treatment.
