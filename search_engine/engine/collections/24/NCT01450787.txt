      at high risk for multiple eye problems, including retinopathy and glaucoma. They also have
      been shown to have poor ocular surface healing. I would like to evaluate the prevalence of
      dry eye disease in diabetics to see if they are also at greater risk for the known
      complications of dry eye disease. If so, they might benefit from early intervention.
