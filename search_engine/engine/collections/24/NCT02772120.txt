      progesterone or Crinone® 8% vaginal gel) does not affect implantation and clinical pregnancy
      rates in women receiving cryo-thawed blastocysts that were produced using their own eggs and
      frozen before age 41 years. Both intramuscular progesterone (25-100 mg compounded in oil) or
      vaginal progesterone (Crinone® 8% vaginal progesterone gel) are widely used for luteal phase
      support in patients receiving vitrified-warmed embryos. Crinone® 8% is FDA approved for
      progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology
      (ART) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency (FDA approval letter, 1997).
