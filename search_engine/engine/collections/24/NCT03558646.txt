      cases of suspicion of cyanide intoxication associated with the inhalation of fire smoke (1).
      However, cyanokit has never been evaluated in this indication. Clinical data suggest that in
      patients with severe burns, its use is associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury
      by intra tubular precipitation of oxalate crystals (2, 3). The purpose of this observational
      study is to investigate the association between use of hydroxocobalamin and outcome after
      smoke inhalation. The results of this study should guide future research and advice on the
      benefit-risk ratio of hydroxocobalamin.
