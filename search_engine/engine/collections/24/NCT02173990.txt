    
      Patients with an unresectable metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) histologically proven
      will be treated with a combination of Irinotecan/bolus-infusion-5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin
      (FOLFIRI regimen) and aflibercept. On day 1 of each cycle patients will receive aflibercept
      followed by irinotecan, 5-Fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (FOLFIRI regimen). This treatment
      will be repeated every 2 weeks until RECIST progression or unacceptable toxicities,
      investigator's decision or patient's refusal of further treatment or death, whichever comes
      first.

      All patients will be assessed during their FOLFIRI-aflibercept with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced
      Ultrasound (DCE-US) at baseline, D7 (± 1 day), D28 (± 2 days).

      The recruitment period is 24 months. The average duration of the study per patient will be
      approximately 12 months, i.e. 3 weeks for screening, 10 months for the combination of FOLFIRI
      plus aflibercept and 30 days for follow-up of adverse events after the last dose of study
      treatment.
