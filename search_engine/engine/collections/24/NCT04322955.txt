      of the cancer. In addition, people who still have the kidney where the cancer started may
      have the kidney removed during the course of treatment in order to decrease the amount of
      tumor in the body. This surgery is referred to as a cytoreductive nephrectomy. In the current
      study, nivolumab is being administered in combination with cabozantinib. Both of these drugs
      are FDA approved medications for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. Previous studies
      have demonstrated that these two medications can be combined together without significantly
      increasing the side effects beyond what is expected from each medicine individually. The
      combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer is an
      investigational regimen and not FDA approved for the treatment of kidney cancer.
