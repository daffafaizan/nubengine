      (x-ray imaging of the breast) helps find breast cancer early. Some breast cancers, however,
      are not seen on mammography, which creates two-dimensional images for the radiologist to see.
      The goal of this study is to make a breast tomosynthesis or tomosynthesis 3D
      (three-dimensional) x-ray system by taking x-ray images from many angles. This is similar to
      a CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan for the breast and can give radiologists 3D
      information so that they can find breast cancers which might otherwise be hidden from view.
