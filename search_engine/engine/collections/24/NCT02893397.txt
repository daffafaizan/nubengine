      I. To determine if regular exercise, which may improve delivery and efficacy of chemotherapy,
      is feasible in children and young adults with malignant bone tumors undergoing neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if exercise results in a change in tumor vascularity as evidenced by magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) in children and young adults with malignant bone tumors who
      participate in structured aerobic exercise as compared to children and young adults who do
      not.

      II. To determine whether serum levels of thrombospondin-1, an endogenous anti-angiogenic
      protein, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, an angiogenic modulator, increase in children and young
      adults with malignant bone tumors who participate in supervised aerobic exercise over a 4
      week period of time during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      III. To determine if aerobic exercise decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the
      peripheral blood of bone sarcoma patients.

      IV. To determine if the numbers of circulating tumor cells decrease in patients who
      participate in supervised exercise over a 4 week period of time.

      V. To determine whether a home-based exercise program or supervised exercise program is more
      feasible for this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients wear a fitbit and undergo supervised physical therapy exercise sessions
      over 40 minutes 3-5 times a week for at least 4 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients wear a fitbit.
