    
      Allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is used in the treatment of a variety
      of hematological, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancies
      involving solid tumors. Patients receiving HCT can develop a life threatening condition
      called graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donor T cells from the donor bone
      marrow recognize host cells as "foreign" and initiate an inflammatory immunological response.
      The standard of care for treatment of acute GVHD consists of intravenous delivery of
      methylprednisolone starting on day 1 and continuation of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus.
      This regimen of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs may relieve symptoms of GVHD, but some
      patients are refractory to current standard of care treatment. For treatment-refractory
      patients with grades III-IV GVHD mortality is approximately 80%. A therapy that could
      effectively suppress the immunological response from GVHD and help repair the damaged tissue
      could significantly decrease the mortality rate from this disease.
