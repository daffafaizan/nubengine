      lower chambers of the heart contract to pump blood to the body. The lower chambers have to
      relax so they can refill with blood to pump out again. Many patients with high blood pressure
      have stiffness in the lower chambers which prevents the heart from relaxing so it can
      properly fill with blood. Some patients with the stiffness in the lower chambers of the heart
      will develop heart failure.

      The study is to test whether or not Nebivolol (Bystolic)and a diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide
      (HCTZ) will help the heart relax so the heart can properly fill and prevent stiffness of the
      lower heart chambers.
