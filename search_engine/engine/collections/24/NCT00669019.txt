      I. To determine whether the Src kinase inhibitor, AZD0530 (saracatinib), has single agent
      clinical activity in patients with advanced melanoma.

      II. To determine whether this drug will increase progression-free survival of these patients
      from 3 months to 4.5 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether this drug may inhibit the activation of peripheral blood T cells
      analyzed ex vivo.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
