      antiretroviral therapy in HIV infected patients. However the incidence of heart disease has
      increased four-fold and is now one of the major causes of death in HIV infected patients.
      While HIV drugs are known to adversely affect serum lipids, the evidence concerning the
      association between raised blood pressure (a major risk for cardiovascular disease) HIV
      and/or its treatment is limited and conflicting. The researchers believe it of interest to
      study heart disease risk factors in patients with HIV infection to avoid one premature cause
      of death (AIDS) being replaced with another potentially preventable cause of death and
      disability (heart disease). In this cross sectional observational study the researchers will
      systematically measure blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in HIV positive
      patients on and off antiretroviral therapy. These individuals will be matched for age, sex
      and ethnic group with HIV negative individuals.
