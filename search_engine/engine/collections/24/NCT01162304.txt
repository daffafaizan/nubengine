      trial. Subjects will complete each of the following (unless they withdraw from the trial):
      (1) a one-week baseline period during which the subject completes pain diaries and remains on
      stable dosages of their existing pain medications; (2) immediate-release (IR) oxycodone 5 mg
      3-4 pills every four hours; (3) extended-release (ER) oxycodone 40 mg 1 pill every 12 hours
      and IR-oxycodone 5 mg 1-2 pills every six hours. Subjects will be randomized to one of two
      treatment sequences (ER-oxycodone first then IR-oxycodone or vice verse). It is expected that
      this trial will take approximately 2 years to complete.

      Crossover periods. Each of the two treatment periods will be 6 weeks in duration, which will
      allow ample time to assess pain relief, adverse effects, treatment satisfaction, and impact
      of treatment on health-related quality of life. There will be no need for a titration period
      at the beginning of either period or for a washout period before the second period because
      oxycodone at the same dosages will be administered in both periods. At each visit, subjects
      will be given sufficient medication to sustain them until at least the following visit.
