      either receive mDOT for the initial 6 weeks of treatment or standard adherence support. Both
      intervention and control groups will receive standard HIV care that includes HAART
      medications free of charge, clinical and laboratory follow-up, psychosocial adherence support
      by a trained social worker, and referral to community-based peer support groups. Patients in
      the intervention group will in addition to stand care, receive their morning weekday dose of
      a twice-daily HAART regimen under DOT in clinic for 6 weeks. Nighttime and weekend doses are
      self-administered. A group of HIV-positive DOT activists, who are trained and paid lay-clinic
      personnel, will be primarily responsible for the direct observation of treatment in the mDOT
      group. In addition to observing treatment, DOT activists will provide counseling, education,
      and emotional support to patients, and will also locate patients not presenting for DOT on
      the same day. Although the HIV activists may also provide psychosocial and adherence support
      to specific patients in the control group, this support will only be a daily and formalized
      part of care in the group randomized to mDOT.
