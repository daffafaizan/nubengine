      load of the diet (catabolic component) in part determines whether the diet as a whole has a
      net anabolic or catabolic effect on bone and muscle. This study will investigate whether the
      addition of an alkaline salt of potassium, potassium bicarbonate, will allow dietary protein
      to have a more favorable net impact on intermediary indices of bone and muscle conservation
      than is observed with protein in the usual acidic environment.

      Men and postmenopausal women, age 50 and older, will be enrolled in this 42-day study in
      order to have 20 completers. Subjects may continue in the study for up to an additional two
      weeks should this be necessary for reasons related to intercurrent illness (unrelated to the
      research) or scheduling circumstances. Over the first 15 days, subjects will be placed on
      gradually increasing doses, up to a maximum of 90 mmol/d of potassium bicarbonate or placebo.
      They will remain on this dose for the rest of the study. Subjects will then have two 10-day
      metabolic diet cycles each, in random order, as follows:

      Group 1 - low protein diet (0.5 g/kg/d) then high protein diet (1.5 g/kg/d) Group 2 - high
      protein diet (1.5 g/kg/d) then low protein diet (0.5 g/kg/d)

      There will be a 5-day period between the two metabolic diets in which subjects consume their
      usual diets but continue to take the study pills.
