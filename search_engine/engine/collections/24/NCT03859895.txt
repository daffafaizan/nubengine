      early PDB. Although the ZiPP study is expected to provide information on whether ZA can
      favourably influence the development of bone lesions characteristic of early PDB as
      determined by radionuclide bone scan imaging, longer term follow up is required to determine
      if this will translate into clinical benefit. The extension study described here will provide
      new information on the natural history of PDB by follow up of people that took part in the
      ZIPP trial. Although the ZIPP-LTE study is an observational study, treatment for PDB may be
      given to participants according to normal clinical practice if they develop signs or symptoms
      of PDB during the extension. Treatment will therefore be offered to all participants that
      develop symptoms of PDB during follow up. Additionally, subjects that were previously been
      exposed to ZA in the core study will also be offered further ZA or another bisphosphonate
      licensed for PDB if they develop evidence of increased metabolic activity thought to be due
      to PDB, even if asymptomatic. The reason for this is that adverse effects are rare in
      patients who have previously been treated with ZA but are common on first exposure to ZA.
      Both therapeutic approaches are commonly used in patients with early PDB with no evidence
      that one is superior to another. In addition to providing information on the natural history
      of PDB, part of the aim of the extension will be to evaluate the risks and benefits of these
      two approaches to standard care of in terms of new lesion development, pain, quality of life
      and adverse events in the context of people who inherit SQSTM1 mutations.
