      preload and, consequently, cardiac output. However, this increase only occurs if there is a
      preload-dependence of cardiac output, which is present in 50% of cases. A test to predict the
      effectiveness of volume expansion prior to administration would avoid the need for excess
      treatment if it proves to be unnecessary. The end-expiratory pressure test (PEEP) would be to
      vary the PEEP in patients in shock conditions placed under mechanical ventilation. PEEP is
      the positive pressure maintained in the airways at the end of expiration. It opposes systemic
      venous return and lowers cardiac preload. It also distends the pulmonary vessels, increases
      their resistance and opposes the ejection of the right ventricle. The decrease in PEEP could
      alleviate the obstacle to venous return and thus increase cardiac preload, mimicking a volume
      expansion, increasing cardiac output only in the case of preload dependence. This test would
      be an easy alternative to the tests used in current practice. To evaluate the ability of the
      PEEP test to detect a preload-dependence condition, defined by a passive passive leg raising
      test, in patients in shock.

      The primary endpoint will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
      constructed to describe the ability of the PEEP test to detect a preload-dependency
      condition. We measure cardiac output by analysis of the pulse wave contour before and after
      the passive leg raising and PEEP test tests, then according to these tests, measurement of
      the cardiac output before and after volume expansion.
