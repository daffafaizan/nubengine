    
      PLE patients will be recruited through the Photodermatology Unit of the Department of
      Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria. Eligible patients will be identified
      through diagnosis-related computer-assisted search in the electronic patient chart system of
      the Unit. The diagnosis of PLE will be verified by patient's history, clinical symptoms,
      histologic findings, laboratory studies and/or phototesting procedures.

      The levels and function of Tregs, memory T cells, neutrophils, mast cells, Langerhans cells,
      cytokine and chemokine profiles, vitamin D levels in the blood and/or skin will be studied in
      PLE patients compared to control groups. Volunteers of four groups will be enrolled in this
      study: i) patients with PLE undergoing preventive medical UV photohardening in spring; ii)
      PLE patients not undergoing preventive UV photohardening; iii) healthy control subjects; and
      iv) patients with other diseases (including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and other
      conditions) undergoing therapeutic phototherapy.

      Blood will be taken by venous puncture (mainly of a cubital vein) from the individual study
      participants at four defined time points during the year: (i) spring (March to April) (before
      medical photohardening in PLE patients); (ii) spring/early summer (April to June)
      (immediately after medical photohardening of PLE patients); (iii) late summer (August to
      September); and (iv) late fall (November to December). In addition, optional skin biopsies
      will be taken to study the parameters listed above. The statistical power analysis (alpha
      0.05; power 0.8; assumed difference in Treg level/function of 30% among groups; based on the
      data by Myara et al., 2005) revealed that 23 patients (21+2 expected drop-outs) need to be
      enrolled per patient group. All patients of the non-PLE groups will be sex- and age
      (plus/minus 5 years)-matched to the PLE subjects.
