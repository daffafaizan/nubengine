      patient electronic records who have developed chronic pulmonary regurgitation and are
      undergoing monitoring for right ventricular dilatation. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is
      used to facilitate its optimal timing. Pulmonary valve replacement can prevent irreversible
      right ventricular (RV) dilatation and dysfunction and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is
      used to facilitate its optimal timing. There are different post-processing techniques
      published for measuring RV volumes on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (detailed vs.
      smoothed and manual vs. automated). The primary aim of this study is to identify whether the
      choice of myocardial contouring technique affects the preoperative RV volumetric thresholds
      for intervention. As a secondary aim, the investigators will determine the reproducibility of
      different contouring methods.
