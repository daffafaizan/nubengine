      Five participants will be recruited to pilot test and give feedback on the control
      educational website and the FB community. Participants will have access to the educational
      website and FB, for a period of one week. The main purpose is to test ease of use and
      satisfaction with both platforms. After 1 week, research staff will call the participant to
      obtain feedback about the websites. The interview will last approximately 30 minutes and in
      the case the participant does not finish the interview, the investigators will conduct a
      follow-up phone interview.

      Randomization Phase:

      Participants will complete a self response electronic questionnaire at baseline. Participants
      then randomized into one of two arms: Intervention (FB + Website) and Control (Website
      alone). The participant will be shown how to access the website and the Facebook page on the
      internet about rheumatoid arthritis. Patients will be assessed at three and six months after
      baseline via email self response electronic questionnaires. This phase will recruit 220
      participants.
