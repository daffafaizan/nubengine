    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether filgrastim (G-CSF) used in addition to standard antibiotic therapy
           accelerates time to resolution of febrile neutropenia in children receiving
           chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard antibiotic therapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously or IV once a day until at least 2 consecutive afebrile days have passed
           and absolute neutrophil count is at least 500/mm3.

      Patients are followed for 3 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
