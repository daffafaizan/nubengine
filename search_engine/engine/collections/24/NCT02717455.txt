      This is a multicenter, phase 1 trial of Panobinostat (LBH589) for children with diffuse
      intrinsic pontine glioma tumors.

      Panobinostat is a pan-HDAC inhibitor of Class I, II and IV histone deacetylases (HDACs)
      involved in the deacetylation of histone and non-histone cellular proteins. Panobinostat
      inhibits purified total cellular histone deacetylase activity (IC50 = 0.03 uM) and activities
      of most HDAC isoforms (IC50 <10nM). In addition, panobinostat induces expression of the
      cell-cycle control genes including CDKN1A (p21), and selectively inhibits the proliferation
      of a variety of tumor cells compared to normal cells. It has been extensively profiled for
      its in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activity on a variety of tumor cell lines and tumor
      xenograft mice models.

      Based on the in vitro and in vivo activity of panobinostat in preclinical models using DIPG
      cell cultures and orthotopic xenograft model systems, and the potentially important role of
      histone deacetylases and histone 3 K27M mutations in relation to pontine malignancies, the
      investigators are conducting a Phase 1 study of panobinostat in children with
      recurrent/progressive DIPG.

      The primary objectives of the study are to (1) describe the toxicity profile and define the
      dose-limiting toxicities of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG, or with
      non-progressed DIPG taken every other week; (2) estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or
      the recommended Phase 2 dose of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG, or
      with non-progressed DIPG taken every other week; and (3) evaluate and characterize the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG, or with
      non-progressed DIPG taken every other week.

      Schema

      STRATUM 1:

      Only patients with recurrent or progressive DIPG will be enrolled initially. Panobinostat
      will be administered every other day, 3 times/week, p.o. preferably on a
      Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule for three weeks, followed by a rest period. Three weeks of
      therapy plus the one week rest period (total 4 weeks) will constitute one course. Treatment
      will continue for up to two years (26 courses) unless the patient experiences progressive
      disease, unacceptable toxicity or any of the off-study criteria.

      The starting dose (dose level 1) is 10 mg/m2/day. Below are the proposed dose levels to be
      studied:

      Dose level # Panobinostat oral dose (mg) Minimum BSA Restriction

      0*: 5 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a
      BSA ≥ 0.80 m2.

      1 (starting dose level): 10 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28
      days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.

      2: 16 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a
      BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.

      3: 22 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a
      BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.

      4: 28 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a
      BSA ≥ 0.50 m2.

      5: 36 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a
      BSA ≥ 0.50 m2.

      Panobinostat will be administered as a single agent

      * Dose level 0 represents a potential treatment dose for patients requiring a dose reduction
      from dose level 1 and may be used as a contingency dose level if the starting dose level of
      panobinostat is not tolerated in the initial cohort.

      STRATUM 2:

      Patients with DIPG who have received adequate radiation therapy but have not yet progressed
      will be enrolled in the currently open Stratum 2. Panobinostat will be administered every
      other day, 3 times/week, every other week p.o. preferably on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday
      schedule. Total 4 weeks will constitute one course. Treatment will continue for up to two
      years (26 courses) unless the patient experiences progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity
      or any of the off-treatment criteria.

      The starting dose (dose level 1) is 16 mg/m2/day. Below are the proposed dose levels to be
      studied:

      Dose level # Panobinostat oral dose (mg) Minimum BSA Restriction

      Negative 1*: 5 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA
      ≥ 0.80 m2.

      0*: 10 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65
      m2.

      1 (expected starting dose level): 16 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days).
      Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.

      2: 22 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65
      m2.

      3: 28 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.50
      m2.

      4: 36 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.50
      m2.

      Panobinostat will be administered as a single agent

      * Dose levels 0 and -1 represent potential treatment doses for patients requiring a dose
      reduction from dose level 1 and may be used as a contingency dose level if the starting dose
      level of panobinostat is not tolerated in the initial cohort.
