      last part of the abortion in their homes will be invited to participate. 300 women with a
      pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation (63 days) will be compared to 300 women with a gestation
      length between 64 and 70 days of gestation. The primary endpoints will be number of patients
      with an incomplete abortion, with a need for surgical or pharmaceutical intervention.

      Secondary endpoints include duration of bleeding, acceptance and satisfaction with the method
      and number of additional visits to the clinic/facility.

      The study will be performed in five abortion clinics in Sweden.
