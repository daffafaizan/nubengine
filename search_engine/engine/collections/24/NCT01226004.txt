      prostate cancer. The Florida Robotic Radiosurgery Association (FRRA) launched the first
      registry for prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT.

      The registry is designed to track surrogate treatment endpoints including PSA, IPSS, SHIM,
      QOL, Karnofsky Performance Status, VAS scores, urine and bowel health, in addition to
      physical and survival data. Utilizing an independent vendor (Advertek, Inc.) experienced with
      the design and implementation of similar electronic registries.

      FRRA developed a data collection tool that staff members with a basic medical background can
      use to register and upload pertinent patient data requiring no more than 20 to 30 minutes per
      patient. Participating patients will be monitored in follow-up for three years, with analysis
      and publication of the results semi-annually.
