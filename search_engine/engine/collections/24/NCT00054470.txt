        -  Determine the antitumor activity of tipifarnib and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients
           with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21 and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-20
      months.
