      Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MTT. The three
      parts of this trial are described below.

      Part 1: Randomized Trial The trial will begin with a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial which will include a 2-week treatment with oral vancomycin (Group A)
      or placebo (Group B), then 1 day of Miralax to cleanse the bowel of vancomycin and
      bacteria/feces (both groups), followed by oral administration of FM (Group A) or placebo
      (Group B). An initial high dose of FM (or placebo) for two days will be followed by a lower
      maintenance dose of FM or placebo for 12 weeks.

      Part 2: Extension (Group A) and Treatment (Group B)

        -  For Group A there will be 12-week observation period

        -  For Group B, there will be treatment similar to that received by the treatment group in
           Part 1 (partial cross-over, open-label), except that they will not receive vancomycin.
           So, they will be treated with Miralax followed by an initial high dose of FM for 2 days,
           and then a maintenance dose of FM for 12 weeks. The purpose of this arm is to determine
           if vancomycin is necessary or not.

      Part 3: Follow-up There will be a follow-up evaluation at 6, 12, and 18 months after
      treatment ends, to determine long-term safety and efficacy.

      Participant duration will be approximately 6.5 months for treatment, and follow-up at 6, 12
      and 18 months after treatment ends.

      Study duration will be approximately 4 years, including IRB approvals, training staff,
      recruiting, clinical trial, data analysis, and reporting.
