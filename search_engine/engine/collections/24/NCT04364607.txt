      anesthesia. All women will be asked to urinate before transfer to the operating theatre. On
      arrival of the patient to operative theatre, intravenous (IV) cannula will be inserted and IV
      infusion of Ringer's acetate (20 ml/kg) will be given as a fluid preload. All participants
      will receive the standard intraoperative care and monitoring. After surgery, in the
      postoperative care unit, participants will receive either 0.5 mg IM neostigmine (study group)
      or IM NaCl 0.9% (control group).

      Urinary bladder ultrasound will be performed hourly until spontaneous micturition occurs. If
      POUR occurred (inability to void with at a bladder volume > 600 ml detected by ultrasound),
      then they will be catheterized by closed envelope technique. The prolate ellipsoid method was
      used to measure urinary bladder volume based on the formula volume = length × width × height
      × 0.52 on a two-dimensional image. The duration of surgery, the amount of administered
      intraoperative fluid, and the urinary bladder volume before IM injection will be recorded.
