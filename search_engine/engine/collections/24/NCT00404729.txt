    
      Participants: 30 patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and 15 patients (mean age
      64.6±3.3ys) with non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NION) were enrolled enrolled.

      Ten OAG patients will be untreated (NT-AOG, 10 eyes), while 20 OAG patients (T-AOG, 20 eyes)
      and 15 NION patients (T-NION, 14 eyes) were treated with Citicoline (oral treatment:1600
      mg/die per 60 days) (Cebrolux®, Tubilux, Italy).

      Methods: In T-OAG, NT-OAG and T-NION patients, Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs)were recorded
      in response to 15' checkerboard pattern stimuli.

      VEPs were assessed 5 times during a total period of 360 days: at baseline conditions (0 day),
      after two different cycles of 60 days of treatment (days 0-60 and days 180-240), and after
      two different cycles of 120 days of wash out (days 60-180 and 240-360). In NT-AOG patients,
      VEPs were assessed at baseline conditions (0 day) and after 60, 180, 240 and 360 days.
