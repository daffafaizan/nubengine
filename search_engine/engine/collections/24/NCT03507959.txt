      outcomes. Yet, the implementation of deceptive placebos in clinical practice is incompatible
      with key principles of openness and patient autonomy. However, recent research suggests that
      placebos remain effective even if they openly described as placebos (so-called Open-Label
      Placebos (OLP)), hence questioning the necessity of deception in clinical trials.

      However, comparisons between OLP and deceptive placebos (DP) with regard to their particular
      mechanisms are lacking. Therefore, the current study aims to identify components of OLP and
      DP. For this purpose, experimentally induced sadness is examined using a standardized
      paradigm which has previously been developed by our working group. In particular, healthy
      volunteers are informed that a new application method for a well-known antidepressant would
      be tested. Sadness is assessed before and after receiving a nasal spray. Two experimental
      groups (DP groups) are informed that they would receive an antidepressant nasal spray,
      another two experimental groups (OLP groups) are informed that they would receive a placebo.
      In fact, all nasal sprays are active placebos inducing prickling nasal sensations (sesame oil
      with 0.014% capsaicin). In addition to the factor "Transparency" (DP vs. OLP), the
      instruction is experimentally varied, with which the substance is administered
      (scientifically-objective vs. personally-affective), resulting in a 2x2 design. Further,
      there is an additional fifth group receiving no intervention. The primary outcome is
      self-rated sadness after taking the nasal spray.
