      gamma and other band oscillations and their correlation with disease pathophysiology and
      clinical status of the patients, and to potentially determine a more objective biomarker of
      response to deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment. This study aims to find evidence that
      changes in the power and coherence of the beta and gamma bands can be consistently linked to
      DBS adjustment and associated clinical effects. This approach can be of significant potential
      benefit to provide a foundation for closed loop DBS therapy in patients with continuous DBS
      adjustments.

      This study will use a novel bi-directional neural interface system that can chronically and
      simultaneously record, sense, process and telemeter LFP signals from DBS electrode (Rouse et
      al. 2011) to study the stability and subsequent change to LFP linked to the clinical state
      relevant to the present disorder, and DBS stimulation at rest and during motor and cognitive
      tasks. This investigation will be conducted at the Ohio State University.
