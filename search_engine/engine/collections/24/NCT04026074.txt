      combinations to assess which medication leads to the best medication during placement of
      regional anaesthesia. This assessement includes NRS, patients' satisfaction and wellbeing.
      The tested substances will be administered intravenously (fentanyl-bolus,
      remifentanil-infusion, clonidine-bolus) or transcutaneously (EMLA salve). The fifth
      combination will be the control group with only placebo medication. We expected to get first
      information for objectifying analgosedation during placement of regional anaesthesia for the
      conduction of further studies in this field.
