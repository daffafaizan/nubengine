      around the world in seasonal epidemics, killing hundreds of thousands of people and having
      high economic consequences due to healthcare costs and lost productivity. Each year
      governments recommend groups who are at risk of influenza or its complications to receive
      influenza vaccination. Current vaccine supply is not sufficient to meet the demand if this
      recommendation were to be taken up by all. This study is part of the clinical development of
      a particle mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) trivalent DNA vaccine for the prevention of
      influenza.This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of this vaccine as well as
      assess the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine in healthy subjects.
