    
      Niraparib is an oral, selective poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor. A
      strategy of combining a PARP inhibitor, as a chemopotentiator, with chemotherapy is a
      promising approach in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. This study will
      evaluate the combination of niraparib with several standard chemotherapy regimens used to
      treat breast cancer to determine a recommended Stage 2 dose (RS2D) of chemotherapy regimens
      with niraparib. Stage 1 will be conducted in subjects with metastatic TNBC and will include 4
      chemotherapy treatment arms in escalating dose levels (Arm 1: doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide
      (AC) every 14 days with pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar) for 4 cycles followed by AC every 21
      days; Arm 2: AC every 21 days; Arm 3: weekly paclitaxel; Arm 4: weekly paclitaxel +
      carboplatin every 21 days), each combined with oral daily niraparib. Treatment will continue
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject withdrawal.Stage 2 will be
      conducted in subjects with non-metastatic TNBC. Subjects will receive neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with either AC every 14 days (Arm 1A) or every 21 days (Arm 2A) at the RS2D of
      chemotherapy combined with oral daily niraparib from Stage 1. Treatment will continue for 4
      cycles.
