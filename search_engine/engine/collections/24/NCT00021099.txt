      I. Determine the response rate of patients with advanced carcinoma of the urothelium treated
      with ixabepilone.

      II. Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with taxanes (yes vs no).

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
