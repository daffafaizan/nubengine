      wave sleep (SWS) or delta sleep (non-REM stage 3; N3) is especially important for cognition
      due to its association with synaptic plasticity, synaptic potentiation, synaptic
      renormalization, and cortical reorganization, especially in prefrontal cortex. Clinically,
      SWS contributes to memory consolidation and language performance. The investigators have
      previously shown that the amount of SWS in persons with Parkinson's disease (PwP) is related
      to cognitive performance, especially in the domain of executive function. The investigators
      have also shown that exercise increases SWS in some PwP and that participants who have an
      exercise-induced increase in SWS also have improvement in executive function. This study will
      evaluate changes in cognitive function and SWS due to progressive resistance training
      rehabilitation (PRT). Participants who do not have an increase in SWS with PRT
      (non-responders) over 12 weeks will be transitioned to an endurance training (ET)
      intervention, while those who do have an increase in SWS (responders) will continue in PRT
      for an additional 12 weeks.
