    
      This is a phase II proof of concept (POC), multi-center, prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD) study, in which a total of
      60 subjects with schizophrenia will be enrolled.

      The study will be conducted in two stages. The study treatment will be administered in a
      double-blind fashion for all subjects throughout both stages of the study. A total of 60
      subjects with schizophrenia will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to drug-drug sequence [n=20;
      i.v. sodium nitroprusside (0.5 μg/kg/min for 4 hours) at week 0 and week 2], placebo-drug
      sequence [n=20; i.v. placebo at week 0 and i.v. sodium nitroprusside (0.5 μg/kg/min for 4
      hours) at week 2], and placebo-placebo sequence [n=20; i.v. placebo at week 0 and again at
      week 2]. The 4-week double-blind phase of treatment will be divided into two phases: Phase 1,
      from week 0 to week 2, and Phase 2 from week 2 to week 4. At the end of Phase 1 (week 2), the
      randomized subjects will be assessed and categorized into responders and non-responders,
      based on 20% or more reduction from baseline in their PANSS total score as per the
      evaluations at Randomization Visit (week 0). The data from the patients deemed placebo
      non-responders in phase 1 who go on to either stay on placebo or to receive treatment with
      sodium nitroprusside will be pooled with the data from Phase 1 from all subjects, according
      to SPCD.
