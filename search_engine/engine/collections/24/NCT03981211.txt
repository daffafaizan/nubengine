    
      This study will be conducted as a Phase IV, multicentre, sequential cohort trial.

      60 participants will be enrolled from participating hospital inpatient services. They will be
      evaluated for eligibility by the use of rapid point-of-care (POC) confirmation of viraemia in
      people who inject drugs (PWID) hospitalised for IRID. The period of hospitalisation for
      management of IRID, particularly when prolonged, may represent an ideal opportunity to engage
      HCV-infected PWID and a potential important strategy for broader HCV elimination.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled into one of two treatment cohorts A and B.

      A) 30 patients will immediately commence treatment whilst an inpatient of G/P
      (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) with continuation of therapy and follow-up in viral hepatitis
      services post discharge (standard duration therapy).

      Following the successful completion of Cohort A, eligible patients will be enrolled into
      Cohort B.

      B) 30 patients will immediately commence treatment whilst an inpatient of 4 weeks of SOF/G/P
      (sofosbuvir/glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) with continuation of therapy and follow-up in viral
      hepatitis services post discharge (short duration therapy).

      Any patient with recurrent viraemia during follow-up will be genotyped +/- sequenced to
      exclude re-infection. If relapse is confirmed the patient will be offered re-treatment with
      standard of care (SOC) salvage therapy based on results of resistance testing.
