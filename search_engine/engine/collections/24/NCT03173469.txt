        -  Study subjects: all female with operable breast cancer seeking health care at general
           surgery department and decision of therapeutic mammoplasty was taken depending on
           clinical examination, findings on mammography and sonography.

      The size, number, and location of breast cancer lesions were identified on US and
      mammography.

      Also size, number, location, pattern of enhancement and presence or absence of intraductal
      component will be evaluated by preoperative MRI.

      The surgical plane will be decided based on US and mammography findings. The final decision
      will be based on MRI findings. When the initial surgical decision was the same as final
      decision the patient will be assigned to the unchanged group.

      However, if the final decision differed from the initial surgical decision the patient will
      be assigned to the changed group.
