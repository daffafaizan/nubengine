      8, 11, 15, 22, and 29. Assessments will include clinical status assessments, vital sign
      measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and adverse event collection. Patients that
      recover prior to Day 29 will complete an end-of-treatment visit. Patients will have an
      in-person follow-up on Day 29, regardless of treatment adherence and recovery status prior to
      Day 29, and a safety follow-up 60 days after randomization for clinical status assessments,
      vital sign measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and adverse event collection.
      Follow-up in-person visits are preferred but recognizing quarantine and other factors may
      limit the subject's ability to return to the site for the visit. In this case, the visit may
      be performed by phone. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will advise the study
      leadership on safety aspects and overall progress of the study.
