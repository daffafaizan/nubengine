    
      Visceral leishmaniasis is a relevant public health problem in Brazil with approximately 3500
      cases registered every year. Eight percent lethality rate has been observed during the past
      decade in spite of free of charge availability of antileishmanial drugs supplied by the
      public health system.

      The present study was designed as a phase IV, multicentric, open label, active controlled
      clinical trial targeted to visceral leishmaniasis adult and pediatric cases.

      The current drugs approved for visceral leishmaniasis treatment in Brazil will be compared in
      four treatment groups: meglumine antimoniate, amphotericin B deoxycholate, liposomal
      amphotericin B and a combination of single dose of liposomal amphotericin B plus meglumine
      antimoniate. Meglumine antimoniate treated patients will constitute the active control group.

      Drugs will be compared based on the cure rate observed after six months follow-up.

      The study arm submitted to treatment with Amphotericin B deoxycholate was suspended in
      September 2012.
