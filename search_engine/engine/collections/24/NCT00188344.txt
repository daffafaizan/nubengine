      regurgitation of swallowed food, and chest pain. In achalasia, there are two problems in the
      esophagus. First, the esophagus does not properly push swallowed food down towards the
      stomach. Second, the valve at the lower end of the esophagus, called the lower esophageal
      sphincter, does not relax to allow food to pass from the esophagus into the stomach.

      Achalasia cannot be "cured". However, the symptoms of achalasia can be improved by treatment.
      Treatment is usually directed towards reducing the degree of blockage caused by the lower
      esophageal sphincter. the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter can be stretched using a
      technique called pneumatic dilatation, or it can be divided (cut in half) during a surgical
      operation. The operation is called laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and is done by laparoscopic
      ("keyhole") surgery, where small incisions are used and patients usually stay in hospital 1-2
      nights. Other treatments for achalasia, such as medications or injection of Botulinum Toxin
      Type A are not often used because they do not provide effective long-term improvement.
