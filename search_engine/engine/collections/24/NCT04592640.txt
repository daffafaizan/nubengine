      lesions. Sepsis due to the infection of ulcerated wounds is a common cause of death. To date,
      practical therapies typically include wound care, pain management, anti-infection and
      aggressive treatment of predisposing conditions. Drugs such as sodium thiosulfate,
      bisphosphonate, and cinacalcet are also suggested. However, it's still a lethal disease with
      1-year mortality up to 80% for dialysis patients. Here the investigators plan to treat uremic
      calciphylaxis patients with human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs).
