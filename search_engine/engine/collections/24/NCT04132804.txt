      reducing symptoms of IBS. The investigators hope that subjects practicing Tai Chi will have
      reduced symptoms of IBS-C as measured through overall global symptom relief as well as the
      IBS-SSS, IBS-QOL, VSI, HADS, Visual Analogue Pain Scale, and changes in bloating, abdominal
      pain, abdominal distention, and constipation severity. The study will also use daily entries
      made through the GeoPain app to record trends in pain intensity.
