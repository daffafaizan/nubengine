      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The present study was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin as an add-on
      to sulfonylurea in type 2 diabetic patients who had uncontrolled blood glucose despite
      treatment with an sulfonylurea as well as diet and exercise therapies.
