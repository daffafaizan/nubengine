      is linked with improved clinical and efficiency outcomes. This research study tests whether
      providing goal-directed feedback on daily ambulation to patients using activity monitors in
      combination with an app that provides step count-rated "art tours" of the surgical floors
      will increase the amount of steps taken after surgery. Upon enrollment, all patients will be
      assigned to either the control (no intervention) or experimental (activity monitor feedback +
      art tours) group, stratified by surgery type. This randomized controlled trial aims to
      determine if this feedback system/art tours approach improves: (1) daily step count, (2)
      length of stay, and (3) patient satisfaction compared with standard of care.
