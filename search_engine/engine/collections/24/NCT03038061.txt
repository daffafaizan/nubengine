      conducted in order to optimize working space for surgeons. As a side effect, the abdominal
      pressure alters physiological thoraco-abdominal configuration and pushes the diaphragm and
      lungs cranially. Since lung image acquired by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) depends
      on the conditions within the thorax and abdomen, it is crucial to know the diaphragm position
      to analyze the effect of cranial shift of diaphragm on EIT images of the thorax. Presence of
      diaphragm in the region of EIT measurement is to be determined by ultrasound in approx. 20
      patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Data are to be obtained at three phases at supine
      horizontal position (during spontaneous breathing, at mechanically ventilated patient under
      general anesthesia with muscle relaxation and at mechanically ventilated patient under
      general anesthesia with muscle relaxation during insufflation of carbon dioxide into the
      peritoneal cavity to achieve exposure during laparoscopic surgery). The results of this study
      will serve during design of a subsequent study dealing with optimization of EIT electrode
      belt position during laparoscopic surgery.
