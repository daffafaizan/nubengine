      leukemia, but relapse remains an important problem. Therapy options for relapse include
      stopping immune suppression, re-induction of chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI),
      and another transplantation used alone or in combination. However, the efficacy of these
      interventions is limited. One approach to the relapse problem is to intervene before
      hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal residual disease (MRD) using immune
      or molecular techniques.DLI is an effective post-transplantation therapy for prophylaxis of
      leukemia relapse, but is associated with a substantial risk of GVHD. Whether MRD-directed DLI
      could improve outcomes remains unclear. In this study, the efficacy of MRD-directed DLI on
      transplantation outcomes will be evaluated in patients with acute leukemia receiving
      allo-HSCT.
