    
      To compare the effects of a single intra-articular injection of a novel polyvinyl alcohol
      preparation (PVA Hydrogel) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisc-One®) in patients with symptomatic knee
      OA.

      Patients with knee OA (ACR clinical and radiological criteria) symptoms for ≥6 months,
      insufficient/failed response to analgesics, K&L stage II-III (x-Rays within past 12 months),
      a knee pain score of 4-9 (0-10 NRS) in the target knee and <3 in the contralateral knee, will
      be enrolled in a randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel group 26-week clinical
      investigation to receive a single intra-articular injection of PVA Hydrogel or Synvisc-One®.
      Safety (both at the injection site (primary end-point) and overall) and efficacy (change in
      pain in the target knee (0-10 NRS), WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (total and subscales) and
      Patient's Global Assessment of knee OA (0-10 NRS)) will be evaluated.

      After signing an informed consent, patients will be screened at least 7 days before
      randomisation, when they will received a single intra-articular injection of either PVA
      Hydrogel or Synvisc-One® (1:1 allocation ratio) and will be then seen for follow-up 1, 2 and
      4 days (this latter just in case of AE occurrence at the target knee) and 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and
      26 weeks after IA injection.
