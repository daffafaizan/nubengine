      is limited by post-infarction left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Many clinic trails showed
      the short term outcome of bone marrow stem cell transplantation for MI patients, but rare
      report of long term follow-up results.

      Aim is to evaluate the long term efficiency of unselected bone marrow mononuclear cells in
      treatment of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), especially with regard
      to the left ventricular function. The cells are delivered by intracoronary infusion 7 days
      after the PCI. Outcomes including LVEF, myocardial viability and coronary artery status are
      assessed by echocardiography, SPECT and coronary angiography.
