    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Sixty-six
      outpatients (ages 18-45) with severe major depressive disorder (MDD) (17-item Hamilton Rating
      Scale for Depression total score greater than or equal to 20) are enrolled from Beijing
      Anding Hospital. All participants receive oral escitalopram 10 mg/d throughout the total of 4
      weeks treatment. Meanwhile, they are randomized equally to one of three add-on treatment arms
      during the first three days: (1) intramuscular injection (i.m.) with saline (1 ml) at 9 am
      and 3 pm per day; (2) scopolamine (0.3 mg in 1ml saline, i.m.) at 9 am and saline (1 ml,
      i.m.) at 3 pm per day; (3) scopolamine (0.3 mg in 1ml saline, i.m.) at 9 am and 3 pm per day,
      respectively. Patients were assessed at baseline, day 2, day 3, day 4, day 7, day 14, and day
      28 using 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(HAMD-17), Montgomery-Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale(MADRS), Young Mania Rating Scale(YMRS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7),
      Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-report 16(QIDS-SR16) and Clinical Global
      Impression(CGI) by assessors masked to treatment assignments. The primary outcome measure was
      the time from randomization (baseline) to early improvement (at least 20% reduction in
      HAMD-17 score ). The second outcome measures were response rates (at least 50% decrease in
      the HAMD-17 at any visit from baseline), remission rate (HAMD-17 scoreâ‰¤7) at day 28, change
      in HAMD-17 score ,MADRS score, QIDS-SR16 score, GAD7 score and YMRS score from baseline to
      any visit, change in CGI-S from baseline to the end of the trial, and CGI-I score at any
      visit.
