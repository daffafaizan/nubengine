      caregivers.

      Overall aim:

      This study aims to evaluate the effects of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) on:
      depression and anxiety symptoms; levels of hope; resilience; mindfulness; self-compassion and
      quality of life. The study also aims to demonstrate whether CBCT training has any effect on
      clinical parameters of transplanted patients, as well as whether it has an effect on cortical
      activity and heart rate variability inpatients and caregivers.

      Specific objectives:

        1. Develop an adaptation of the CBCT protocol for hospitalized patients;

        2. To evaluate the effect of CBCT on depressive and anxious symptoms in patients and their
           caregivers;

        3. To evaluate the effect of CBCT on resilience, quality of life and self-compassion in
           patients and their caregivers;

        4. Investigating the CBCT training results in altering the cortical activity of patients
           and caregivers while performing a recall task of recent autobiographical experiences;

        5. Investigate whether CBCT training results in changes in heart rate variability in
           patients and caregivers;

        6. To investigate whether CBCT training has any effect on patient's levels of symptoms,
           such as: pain, nausea, insomnia, among others;

        7. To evaluate how correlations between psychosocial factors and biological markers:
           cortical activity and heart rate variability;

        8. Evaluate perceptions and impressions of patients and caregivers on the protocol.
