      Standard chemotherapy cures less than 40% of patients. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      support (or transplant) is showing some positive results in patients with NHL that fail
      standard chemotherapy. The cure rate of this treatment is only about 50%.

      Another treatment option called immunotherapy is being tested in lymphoma patients to see if
      adding immunotherapy to NHL treatments improves results. Rituximab, a form of immunotherapy,
      is an antibody (a type of protein) that attacks the CD20 protein found on lymphoma cell,
      which may result in the death of the lymphoma cell.

      The study design is as follows: Patients with poor prognosis NHL receive rituximab as part of
      the peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization process and as part of the preparative
      regimen in combination with high-dose chemotherapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) are collected and stored. After
      recovery from high-dose cyclophosphamide, patients are admitted to the hospital for
      transplant. The preparative regimen consists of rituximab, followed by high-dose
      chemotherapy.
