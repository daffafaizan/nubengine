    
      This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) seeks to test the efficacy and dose responsiveness of
      a manualized family therapy intervention called Family Focused Grief Therapy (FFGT), which is
      delivered to families of patients with advanced disease and continued into bereavement.
      Randomization is to three arms: 6 sessions of FFGT, 10 sessions of FFGT, or standard care.
      The study also explores the potential mediators of effective outcome, empowering further
      refinement of the intervention, and undertakes an analysis of health-related costs of
      bereavement care. It is a multi-site study involving Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied
      Diseases (a comprehensive cancer center), Calvary Hospital (a dedicated palliative care
      hospital with home hospice care program)and Beth Israel (a medical center with a dedicated
      pain and palliative care department. Consenting families will be assessed at baseline through
      completion of questionnaires that appraise each individual's psychosocial well-being and
      perception of their family's functioning. Therapy will be delivered by family therapists
      (social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists), who will attend regular supervision
      sessions to sustain fidelity of the model of intervention. Follow-up of family members for
      psychosocial well-being, perceptions of family functioning, and costs of heath-related care
      will occur at 3, 6, 9, & 13 months after the patient's death or completion of therapy
      sessions.
