      aberration, from normal to metaplasia, mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia and then
      carcinoma in situ (CIS) before becoming an invasive cancer. Progression rates to invasive
      carcinoma can vary depending on the initial grade of the lesion and it is generally accepted
      that high-grade lesions are more likely to progress to invasive cancer than low-grade
      lesions. Early detection and treatment of these lesions is critical to improving survival.
      There is no evidence base examining how, or whether these high-grade lesions (HGLs) should be
      treated, resulting in diverse treatment practices both nationally and internationally. This
      is the first randomised clinical trial of a bronchoscopic intervention in treating HGLs using
      EC.

      EARL is a phase II/III multicentre 2:1 randomised controlled trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of electrocautery (EC) in the treatment of high-grade lesions of the lung. All
      patients consented/registered onto the trial will have an autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB)
      to check for high-grade lesions (HGLs) in the lung, as verified by tissue biopsy. Only
      patients with â‰¥1 lung histologically confirmed lung HGL will be randomised to receive either
      electrocautery ablation (EC) treatment and AFB surveillance (= intervention), or AFB
      surveillance (= control).

      The principal objective of the main phase II trial is to demonstrate that airway High-Grade
      Lesions (HGLs) that are treated with electrocautery are less likely to progress to lung
      cancer compared to HGLs that are not treated with electrocautery.
