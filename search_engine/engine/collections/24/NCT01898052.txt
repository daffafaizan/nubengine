      single local anaesthetic drug comparing with placebo for pain controlled in TKA. But in this
      study would like to determine which one of both drugs are more efficacy.

      In multimodal drug injection consist of levobupivacaine, morphine, ketorolac and epinephrine
      while single anaesthetic drug has levobupivacaine and epinephrine.
