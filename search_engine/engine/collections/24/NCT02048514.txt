    
      This is a multicenter, multi-country prospective, single-arm, non-randomized clinical trial.
      The comparative control arm is a combination of patient data drawn from the abdominal aortic
      aneurysms (AAA) open surgical control arms of four commercially approved AAA devices as part
      of the Society of Vascular Surgeons. Patients enrolled in this study will be pre-screened and
      have a diagnosis of an infrarenal AAA with or without the need for treatment of iliac artery
      aneurysm, are candidates for endovascular repair, and meet the eligibility criteria. Patients
      enrolled in the study will participate in follow-up visits 31 days, 6 months and at 1 year
      following the index procedure. At the follow-up visits there will be a clinical assessment,
      blood collection, and abdominal CT imaging of the patient.
