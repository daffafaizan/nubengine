    
      Patients with moderate and severe COPD (GOLD stage II and III) will be studied and their
      results will be compared with age-matched healthy non- smokers and smokers.

      RAAP will be taken every 5 minutes for 15 minutes before salbutamol and every 5 minutes for
      another 15 minutes after salbutamol.

      Several parameters of lipoprotein profiles, anti-oxidant plasma capacity, inflammatory
      cytokines, hormones, growth factors and vascular cell adhesion molecules will be studied in
      blood. In addition, several inflammatory and oxidative markers will be studied in exhaled
      breath condensate. Lung function and impulse oscillometry will be made to investigate airway
      resistance, and exhaled NO (nitric oxide) at different expiratory flows will be measured to
      assess alveolar and bronchial NO. Clinical assessment including dyspnoea and depression
      scores will also be made.
