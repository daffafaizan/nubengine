      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxychloroquine that can safely be
      administered to cancer patients in association with radiation prior to developing this
      approach for disease treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Beginning 3 days before the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive hydroxychloroquine
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). Treatment continues until completion of
      radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
