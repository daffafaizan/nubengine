    
      Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a rare form of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).
      Optimal treatment strategies and clinical outcomes are not well established.

      This multicenter, international, observational study will assess the effectiveness and safety
      of current treatment options in patients with IVC thrombosis, and describe the long-term
      outcomes of patients with IVC thrombosis.

      Patients with an objective diagnosis of IVC thrombosis, either with or without proximal lower
      extremity DVT will be included. Information will be collected on baseline characteristics,
      risk factors for thrombosis, symptoms, mode of diagnosis, presence of concomitant lower limb
      DVT, PE, IVC filter or unusual site thrombosis (splanchnic, gonadal and renal veins),
      treatment modalities (anticoagulation and/or thrombolysis), choice of anticoagulant, dose and
      duration of treatment, recanalization assessment (if available), recurrence of VTE during
      follow up, bleeding according to International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis
      criteria, development post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) according to Villalta score and
      mortality during follow up. Patients should be followed up for 24 months from diagnosis. The
      number of visits is left to the discretion of the treating physician, but information on
      clinical outcomes at two intermediate time points is requested.
