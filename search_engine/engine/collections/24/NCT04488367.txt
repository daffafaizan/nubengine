      patient will then be randomized and stratified based on the fracture type, fixation method
      anticipated, and presence of anticoagulation.

      Treatment drug and saline placebo will be blinded from the patient. Treatment arm patients
      will receive a dose of 10 mg/kg of TXA IV as soon as possible in the ED. They will then
      receive repeat doses prior to skin incision and again after the end of surgery. Control group
      will receive a placebo dose of normal saline in the ED and then the standard 10 mg/kg TXA
      doses prior to surgery and again after the end of surgery. The perioperative doses will not
      be blinded.
