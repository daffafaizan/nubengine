      represents one of the main causes of morbidity in western countries, and it has also an
      important effect on healthcare cost absorbing 1-2% of the total health budget in western
      countries. Clinical manifestations related to CVD are well documented in adults, with
      clinical guidelines that standardize both diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, there is a
      scarcity of published data regarding CVD in children, and in addition, venous duplex
      ultrasound test of the lower limbs is performed much less commonly in children than in
      adults.

      Therefore, the natural history of pediatric venous reflux remains unclear, although it is
      possible that it precedes the onset of CVD in adulthood. In this context, this observational
      study aims to identify the presence of venous reflux, as well as clinical and morphological
      data in pediatric subjects, aged between 9 and 18 years old, by performing an office vascular
      visit and an echo duplex scan of lower limbs. The endpoints of this study are to
      prospectively assess the prevalence of CVD in children, as well as to evaluate a possible
      correlation between vein diameter and pathological vein reflux.
