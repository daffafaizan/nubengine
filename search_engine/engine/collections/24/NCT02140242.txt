    
      In the first part of the trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 90 mg/m2
      or 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin in the first induction cycle in addition to standard dosed
      cytarabine. Assuming a superiority of 90 mg/m2, 436 patients will be recruited. In the second
      part of the trial, good responders will be randomized to receive either a second or no
      further induction cycle. Assuming a non-inferiority of the single induction regarding the
      rate of complete remissions, a number of 360 patients will be included in the second part.
      Furthermore, in case of a non-inferiority of single versus double induction in good
      responders, about half of all younger AML patients could be spared a second induction cycle,
      leading to a reduction in treatment-related mortality, fewer days spent in hospital and
      improved quality of life.

      As a result of the preplanned interim analysis of part I, the sponsor decided to suspend
      randomization in trial part I and to offer all patients the standard dose of 60 mg/m2
      daunorubicin in both induction cycles (part I and II of the trial). Because of this an
      Amendment was sent to and approved by regulatories and ethics comitee.

      The inclusion age was raised to 65 years based on the current German treatment guidelines in
      which patients up to the age of 65 are considered eligible for intensive induction
      chemotherapy with DA60 [Onkopedia-Leitlinie 2017].
