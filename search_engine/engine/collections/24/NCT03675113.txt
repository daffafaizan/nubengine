      failure patients. For this reason intolerance to arm exercise is a significant problem in
      heart failure patients and may contribute to a decrease in performance in activities of daily
      living. Considering the fact that developments in these patients are caused by vasculature
      functional adaptation the extremity skeletal muscle and applied limbs, upper extremity
      exercises may be useful to reduce exercise intolerance during activities requiring continuous
      arm movement.
