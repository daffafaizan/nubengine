      greater potency and efficacy in all patients, but particularly in genetically defined
      subpopulations that respond poorly to rituximab because they express a low affinity version
      of the Fc receptor on their immune effector cells. A monoclonal antibody that has increased
      binding for this receptor should be more effective in stimulating effector cell killing and
      thus improve response to the antibody.
