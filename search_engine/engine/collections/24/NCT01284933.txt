      25% of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
      Non-invasive high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) of the carotid artery allows
      detecting vulnerable plaques (VP) and quantifying single plaque components. The hypotheses
      behind this study are that i) a substantial proportion of cases of AIS and TIA within the
      anterior circulation and no identified cause (cryptogenic AIS or TIA) are caused by VP in the
      carotid artery; ii) that these patients are at a high risk of developing a recurrent stroke,
      TIA, or clinically silent lesions detectable by brain MRI; and iii) that VP in the carotid
      artery are associated with specific infarct patterns as detected by diffusion-weighted MR
      imaging. Finally, the investigators will search for biomarkers associated with vulnerable
      carotid artery plaques. Motivating this study are the following considerations: i) data on
      the frequency and characteristics of VP in patients with cryptogenic AIS or TIA will provide
      valuable insights into stroke mechanisms; ii) depending on the results this study may have
      implications for diagnostic decision making and provide the basis for the planning of
      targeted interventional studies.
