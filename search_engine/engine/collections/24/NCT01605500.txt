      be demonstrated to the subjects. Subsequently, this will be repeated with a wall air
      conditioner turned on. The subjects will then be asked to complete a three-part questionnaire
      regarding their perceptions of the Patient Alert tones.

      Data analysis will include overall ability to hear tones, as well as subgroup analysis
      according to gender, age, and BMI.

      Simultaneously, in order to calculate the loudness of the alert tones, digital recordings
      will be obtained using two microphones located near the subject. These digital recordings
      will be analyzed, and a loudness value will be calculated. The loudness value is a calculated
      index, devised by Medtronic, which incorporates frequency and intensity. Data analysis will
      include a correlation between loudness value and patient characteristics, and between
      loudness value and ability of subjects to perceive the tones.
