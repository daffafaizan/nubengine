    
      Two panels (Panels A and B), will receive alternating single rising oral doses of
      MK-1064/placebo (i.e., order of administration will be Panel A 5 mg, Panel B 10 mg, Panel A
      25 mg, Panel B 50 mg, and continuing in this alternating sequence). Following dosing for a
      given treatment period, a minimum of 3 days will elapse before administration of the next
      scheduled dose. After administration of each dose, safety and tolerability will be reviewed.
      The decision to proceed to the next Panel/Period in the alternating sequence will be
      contingent on acceptable safety and tolerability data from the preceding Panels/Periods.
