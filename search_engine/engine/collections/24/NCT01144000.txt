      shoulder PJI (as defined below) caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant
      staphylococci will be included. An informed consent will be obtained prior to patient
      inclusion. Medical records will be prospectively abstracted for demographic characteristics,
      clinical, radiographic, laboratory and microbiologic data using a standardized case report
      form (CRF). After inclusion, intravenous daptomycin 10 mg/kg (calculated as actual body
      weight) is given once daily for 2-3 weeks, followed by oral rifampin-containing antibiotics
      for a total of 3 months (as outlined below).

      Two surgical modalities will be applied according to the PJI treatment algorithm:

        -  Open debridement and retention of the prosthesis (change of mobile parts): daptomycin
           will be combined with rifampin.

        -  Two-stage exchange of the prosthesis with a short interval (2-3 weeks): daptomycin of
           the prosthesis: daptomycin will be used alone.

      The decision whether the implant will be retained or removed is based on objective criteria
      of the treatment algorithm and is not subject to bias. All consecutive patients with a
      staphylococcal PJI infection of the hip, knee or shoulder prosthesis will be included, if no
      exclusion criterion is present, obviating the selection bias. Since not many specialized
      institutions are treating patients with PJI, we expect low number of patients.
