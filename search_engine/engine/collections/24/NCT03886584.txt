      ability to distinguish internal-generated events from external ones) and internal-monitoring
      testing (i.e. the ability to distinguish an imagined source from a performed one). A
      source-monitoring deficit have been demonstrated in patients with psychiatric conditions such
      as schizophrenia and seems linked to frontotemporal abnormalities (frontotemporal
      dysconnectivity and temporal hypoactivity). With a total of 150 patients, the investigators
      will include 30 patients per group: patients with pre-dementia stage Alzheimer, Alzheimer,
      Fronto-Temporal dementia, Lewy Body dementia or Parkinson and Bipolar Disorder, with the
      hypothesis that Bipolar Disorder patients will present less marked deficit. The investigators
      will recruit 150 healthy controls.
