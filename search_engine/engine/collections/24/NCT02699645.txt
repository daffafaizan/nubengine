    
      Acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious and least treatable form of stroke,
      accounting for at least 10% of the 20 million new strokes that occur globally each year.
      Survivors of ICH are at high risk of recurrent ICH and other serious cardiovascular events.

      While there is strong evidence that this risk can be reduced by lowering the blood pressure
      (BP) of patients after ICH, many patients with ICH do not receive BP-lowering treatment
      long-term unless BP levels are particularly high, and many do not receive BP combination
      therapy.

      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination of fixed low-dose
      generic BP lowering agents, as a "Triple Pill" strategy on top of standard of care for the
      prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of ICH and high normal or low grade
      hypertension. The study is a large-scale, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomised controlled trial.
