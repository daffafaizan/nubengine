      oral sucking and feeding in clinical practice, and the insufficient evidence that relates
      early measures of abnormal sucking activity with the underlying neurological impairment.

      The main goal of this study is to quantitatively assess the sucking and feeding activity of
      infants at high risk of neurological impairment (preterm infants and term infants at risk of
      abnormal neurodevelopment) during oral sucking and feeding and correlate it with their
      underlying neurological impairment for the early diagnosis of brain injury. We aim to study
      three groups of infants who are inpatients on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at
      Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), the NICU or Newborn Nursery at Beth Israel Deaconess
      Medical Center (BIDMC), the Special Care Nursery (SCN) or Newborn Nursery at Winchester
      Hospital as follows: (i) group A consisting of preterm infants (gestational age of <37
      weeks), (ii) group B consisting of term infants admitted to the NICU at BCH and BIDMC for
      therapeutic hypothermia who are at risk of developing hypoxic ischemic injury (HIE); admitted
      with concern for neonatal stroke; seizures of unknown etiology; and those admitted to the
      NICU, SCN or Newborn Nursery at BCH, BIDMC and Winchester Hospital at risk of abnormal
      neurodevelopment such as those with hypoglycemia or neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and;
      (iii) group C consisting of healthy term infants admitted to the NICU, SCN or nursery who had
      an initial uncomplicated postnatal course that will serve as the control group. Additionally,
      those infants who have MRI of the brain for any reason during the course of their hospital
      admission will also be included in the study and allocated to the appropriate group
      accordingly.
