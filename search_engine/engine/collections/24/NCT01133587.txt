      intervention group will have a contract on "self-referral to inpatient beds" for one year.
      They can call the CMHC directly and ask for a bed for until 5 nights.

      The patients in the 'treatment-as-usual' group will follow common procedures by either
      contacting their general practitioner, emergency department or duty doctor, and they will be
      offered a "self-referral to inpatient bed" contract after a year if they satisfy the
      inclusion criteria.

      Regardless of the participation in the intervention group, the patients can also be ordinary
      admitted during the project period by a doctor via regular procedures in both hospital and
      CMHC if there is a need for this. All admissions will appear in the register data.
