    
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind study with a subsequent open-label
      intervention period to explore whether a course of hyperbaric oxygen can ameliorate
      persistent symptoms after brain injury. In this study, adult men and women with persistent
      symptoms 6 months to 10 years after injury will be randomized to receive 40 hyperbaric oxygen
      sessions (100% oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 minutes door-to-door) or sham chamber
      sessions (room air chamber excursion at near-ambient pressure, 60 minutes door-to-door).
      Chamber sessions will be provided Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, and participants
      will have up to 12 weeks to complete their 40 sessions.

      Participants will be evaluated before the chamber sessions, at 13 weeks, and at 6 months.
      Assessments include self-administered questionnaires, neuropsychological function, a brief
      neurological examination, electroencephalography, visual function tests, and a
      neuro-optometry evaluation. These outcome tools will measure symptoms and deficit at the time
      of enrollment and subsequent evaluations, and provide insight into whether hyperbaric oxygen
      can play a role in recovery from brain injury.

      Once the participants have completed their 6 month evaluations, they will enter an open
      intervention group, receiving 40 hyperbaric sessions at 1.5 atmospheres absolute for 60
      minutes. Participants will have up to 12 weeks to complete these sessions. Participants will
      be evaluated after the second set of chamber sessions (at 9 months and again at 12 months).
      Individuals will then be assessed annually until study closure (12-month follow-up of the
      last enrolled participant).

      Participants will be asked to provide blood for long-term storage of serum, plasma, and DNA
      for future investigations, including apolipoprotein E genotype.
