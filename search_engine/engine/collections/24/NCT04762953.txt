    
      Patients with histologically proven primary gastric or gastroesophageal junction (Siewert 3)
      adenocarcinoma with positive peritoneal cytology or peritoneal carcinomatosis detected by
      laparoscopy, laparotomy or imaging and without evidence of distant organ metastasis will be
      eligible for this study. Patients will undergo systemic therapy for 3-4 months at the
      discretion of the medical oncologist based on molecular makers (PD-L1, HER -2 neu, MSI).
      Patients without distant organ metastatic progression after completion of systemic
      chemotherapy, will undergo diagnostic laparoscopy and IP port placement. IP regimen will
      consist of IV Paclitaxel, 5- FU and Leucovorin and IP Paclitaxel. Paclitaxel 40 mg/m2 will be
      instilled into the peritoneal cavity through the IP port on days 1 and 8, repeated every 21
      days for 3 months (3-4 cycles). Restaging imaging with CT and /or diffusion weighted MRI with
      contrast will be obtained 4-6 weeks after completion of IP chemotherapy. Based on response
      and extent of disease, patients will be triaged to one of the following treatment plans:
      stable disease or response and PCI >10 - continue IP chemotherapy regimen, progression -
      switch to second line regimen, response with PCI â‰¤ 10 and complete cytoreduction is feasible
      - consider cytoreduction surgery (CRS) with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPEC).
