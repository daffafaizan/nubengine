      Several split-dose bowel cleansing regimens have raised over the last decade aiming to
      substitute standard preparation the day before. These split-dose regimens (based on sodium
      phosphate and polyethylene glycol solutions) have demonstrated better cleansing scores, so it
      is probably more important the time that preparation is given rather than the type of
      solution. However, the time to administer the second half of the solution in split-dose
      regimens for morning colonoscopies remains controversial. A major concern of split-dose
      regimens is the risk of aspiration pneumonia during sedation if liquids have been
      administered quite close to the procedure. As such, the second part of the preparation is
      usually given early in the morning (2-3 am) in order to have a safety-period of at least four
      hours prior to the colonoscopy. However, this is quite disturbing for patients and may hamper
      the adherence to further colonoscopies. Furthermore, On the other hand, no study addressing
      the role of split-dose Citrafleet has been published to date

      Therefore it is necessary to make a controlled clinical trial to directly compare "the day
      before" and " split-dose" regimens with Citrafleet for morning colonoscopies. In order to
      maximize the efficacy of the split-dose regimens, the time period between fluids intake and
      the colonoscopy will be shortened up up to 2 hours for morning colonoscopies scheduled from 9
      to 11 am and up to 3 hours for that scheduled after 11 am. The results of this study will
      conclude whether there is still room for improvement in bowel cleansing for morning
      colonoscopies, using more palatable low-volume solutions without interrupting sleep time.
