        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of rituximab combined with vinorelbine in
           patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma following autologous peripheral blood stem
           cell transplantation.

        -  Assess the response rate and duration of response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV weekly on weeks 1-4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and vinorelbine
      IV on weeks 2-4, 6-8, and 10-12. Patients who achieve partial response may continue on
      vinorelbine from week 14 until disease progression.

      Patients are followed until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
