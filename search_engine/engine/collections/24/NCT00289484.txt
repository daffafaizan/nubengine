      efficacy pf Omega-3 as an augmentor of antidepressant treatment for depression. People aged
      between 18 and 65 with a first or new episode of depression warranting treatment with
      antidepressant medication will be recruited. In addition to their antidepressant medication,
      participants will be randomly allocated to receive either Omega-3 (fish oil) or placebo
      (paraffin oil)for 4 weeks. Participants will commence treatment with the antidepressant and
      Omega-3/placebo simultaneously. Participants will be followed up at 1,3 and 4 weeks and will
      be asked to rate their mood daily for the 4 week study period. Blood samples will be taken
      pre and post treatment to measure change in Omega-3 levels.
