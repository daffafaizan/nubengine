      modeling and remodeling, fundamental to maintenance of normal skeletal integrity. In
      acromegaly, a disease characterized by longstanding exposure to excess GH and IGF-1, these
      hormones induce marked skeletal changes. Most dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) studies
      report that bone mineral density (BMD) is normal in acromegaly. Despite this, however, there
      is mounting evidence that bone health is adversely affected in patients with both active and
      successfully treated acromegaly.
