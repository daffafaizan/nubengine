      healthy patients with joint discomfort.

      Native collagen is detected in the gut's Peyer's patches and, thanks to a mechanism known as
      oral tolerisation, reduces the autoimmune attack to joints' collagen improving joint function
      and pain.

      Oral tolerance consists of two phases of immune response: the maintenance of homeostasis and
      the suppression of immune responses mediated by Ag-specific regulatory T cells. T-cells
      detect the epitopes of type-II collagen in the gut and suppress the immune response against
      bodily type-II collagen. Then, these regulatory T cells generated in the gut are presumed to
      migrate to a local microenvironment where a protein analogous to the orally dosed antigen
      resides, in this case type-II collagen. Upon reactivation in a new microenvironment,
      regulatory cells will suppress ongoing inflammation.
