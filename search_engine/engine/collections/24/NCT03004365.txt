    
      A single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and oral
      microbiology of C16G2 Varnish application in male and female dental subjects 12-75 years of
      age. This multi-center study will evaluate multiple study drug administrations of C16G2
      Varnish or Placebo Varnish.

      The study will enroll subjects into up to three study arms. Up to 33 subjects will receive
      multiple doses of study drug applied with a small brush typically used in dental varnish
      administration. Subjects will be enrolled in an 8:3 ratio. The Sponsor will perform unblinded
      microbiology review on an ongoing basis to determine whether to enroll additional 11 subjects
      into the next dose cohort or to terminate enrollment based on microbiology data.
