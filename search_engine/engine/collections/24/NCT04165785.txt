      subject allocated to the study group will be treated with Optimal pulsed technology intense
      pulsed light (OPT IPL) administered in the malar region, from tragus to tragus including the
      nose, 2-3 mm below the lower eyelids. Immediately following the OPT IPL administration, the
      subject will undergo meibomian gland expression (MGX) in both eyelids of both eyes. Subjects
      in the control arm will receive exactly the same treatment, except that the OPT IPL
      administration will be sham. A single follow-up will occur at 2 months after the baseline (or
      2 weeks after the 4th treatment session). At the follow-up, the changes in the outcome
      measures will be evaluated, and compared between the two arms.

      For each subject, the duration of the study will be 2 months: 1st treatment at baseline; 2nd
      treatment at 2 weeks after baseline; 3rd treatment at 4 weeks after baseline; 4th treatment
      at 6 weeks after baseline; and a single follow-up at 8 weeks after baseline).

      Statistically significant differences between the two arms will support the study hypothesis
      that IPL treatment is potentially reduce demodex counts and decrease levels of cytokines ,
      and relief to both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
