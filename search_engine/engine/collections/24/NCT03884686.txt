      previous study. The website is partially populated with several pages which contain
      educational material designed for patients newly diagnosed (within the last 12 months) with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The education material provides information related to different
      problems, short video clips of patients talking about their problems and ways of managing it,
      or a patient and health care professional consultation in relation to a particular problem,
      as well as question and answer fact sheets. In order to make the intervention relevant and
      acceptable to patients and health care professionals, both these groups were actively
      involved at each stage of the intervention development. During the 3 month intervention
      patients will have free and unlimited access to the website. Use of the website during the
      intervention phase will be monitored by the researcher and weekly emails will be sent to
      participants who do not engage in the intervention. Monthly emails will be sent to all
      intervention group patients to encourage engagement with the intervention.

      Usual care. The patients randomised to usual care will have access to all usual care,
      including scheduled appointments and nurse-led telephone helpful. They will not have access
      to the intervention website.
