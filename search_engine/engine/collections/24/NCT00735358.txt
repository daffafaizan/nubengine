      hemorrhage is still the most serious complication of portal hypertension and chronic liver
      disease. Occurrence of gastric varices (GV) rupture is less often than esophageal varices
      (EV) but it is characteristic of higher rebleeding rate and mortality and represents an even
      tougher problem than EV hemorrhage. Facing these challenges, there is no consensus on the
      best treatment of GV hemorrhage and therefore it is mainly empirical. Endoscopic treatment is
      an alternative in the management of GVH. Injection sclerotherapy has been applied to arrest
      GV hemorrhage but it is associated with a high rebleeding rate (50~90%) and thus is regarded
      as only a temporary hemostatic measure. The advantage of endoscopic variceal ligation for EV
      hemorrhage has been documented, however, endoscopic variceal ligation for GVH is not as
      promising because of its high rebleeding rate around 50%. Endoscopic injection of
      N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, a so-called "tissue glue", was more effective for GV hemorrhage than
      other sclerosants and endoscopic ligation, however, its rebleeding rate is still high around
      30~50%. The theoretical advantages of tissue glue derives from its unique ability to plug the
      varix lumen immediately. Each injection of tissue glue in conventional use was usually
      prepared by a mixture of 0.5 ml cyanoacrylate and 0.5 ml Lipiodol. Therefore, we hypothesized
      that double dose cyanoacrylate (1 ml cyanoacrylate mixed with 1 ml Lipiodal) may obliterate
      the varices in further distance and broader area and that may achieve more effective
      hemostatic results than conventional dose. Therefore we designed a randomized trial to test
      the hypothesis.
