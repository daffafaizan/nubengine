      problematic what might result in a permanent lower weight. A short period high quality food
      supplementation could improve weight gain after an infection.

      Children aged 6-59 months presenting with malaria caused by P. falciparum who are provided
      with a RUTF supplement (PlumpynutÂ®) of 500 kcal/day for 2 weeks will show significantly
      better catch up growth compared to a similar patient group not provided with RUTF (at 2 weeks
      and 4 weeks post-intervention).
