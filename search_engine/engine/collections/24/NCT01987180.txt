    
      After 2-3 months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), mothers and fathers of Very Low
      Birth Weight (VLBW) infants face discharge home with trepidation. Having a VLBW infant that
      has survived to discharge, these parents now must perform a myriad of health care tasks once
      at home, yet parents often feel ill-prepared, uninformed, and unskilled to provide this care.
      The goal of this exploratory research is to develop and pilot the NICU-2-Home service, a
      health information technology (IT) concept centered on the smart phone that will be created
      with researchers at Motorola. NICU-2-Home will provide support to parents of VLBW infants as
      they transition from the NICU to their homes and eventually establish a medical home with the
      infant's pediatrician. Phase 1 of this research uses qualitative methods and an iterative
      process to design the NICU-2-Home content service that will support parents as they
      transition to home from the NICU through interviews with the major stakeholders: parents,
      neonatal physicians, neonatal staff, and community pediatricians. Phase 2 evaluates
      NICU-2-Home as parents are transitioning to home and includes a feasibility study with
      randomization to pilot test the ability of NICU-2-Home to (a) improve parent's self-efficacy
      and confidence in caring for their VLBW infant, (b) decrease parental stress, and (c) enhance
      involvement with their VLBW infants compared to controls.
