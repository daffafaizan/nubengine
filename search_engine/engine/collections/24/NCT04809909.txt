      relief through electrical stimulation of the painful area at the lower back. Previous studies
      have shown that the use of PNFS is effective in reducing pain intensity and improving
      physical functioning.

      Peripheral stimulation of acupuncture points (PSAP) is a novel therapeutic strategy which
      involves the combination of PNFS and acupuncture from traditional Chinese medicine. Through
      electrical stimulation of specific acupuncture points, synergistic effect and additional
      benefits such as relief of sciatica might be observed. As such, the intervention is of our
      interest in the study.

      The study will involve 50 subjects. After signing the consent form, subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two groups, either PSAP or PNFS.

      For group PSAP, two electrode leads will be implanted and connected to an external
      neurostimulator for electrical stimulation of acupuncture points.

      For group PNFS, two electrode leads will be implanted and connected to an external
      neurostimulator for electrical stimulation of the painful area.
