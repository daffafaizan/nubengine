    
      2.1 Purpose To perform a randomised trial assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      intensive antiplatelet therapy (Asp+Dip+Clop) versus guideline antiplatelet therapy (Asp+Dip
      or Clop) in patients with recent ischaemic stroke or TIA and who are at high risk of
      recurrence.

      2.2 Primary Objective To assess ordinal stroke severity at 90 days after short-term
      administration (1 month) of intensive antiplatelet therapy versus guideline therapy in
      patients with very recent ischaemic stroke or TIA.

      2.3 Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess the safety of short-term administration (1 month) of intensive antiplatelet
           therapy versus guideline therapy in patients with very recent ischaemic stroke or TIA.

        2. To further assess, in high risk patients with stroke/TIA, whether:

      ii. it is feasible to administer intensive therapy acutely and is tolerable to take for 1
      month, iii. intensive therapy is superior in respect of surrogate markers such as platelet
      function.

      iv. intensive therapy improves functional outcome
