      muscle tenderness in the working population, is characterized by myofascial trigger points
      (MTrPs). This study aimed to examine the immediate and short-term effect of the combination
      of two therapeutic techniques for improving neck pain and muscle tenderness in male patients
      with upper trapezius active MTrPs.

      Methods: This was a pretest-posttest single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Sixty male
      subjects with mechanical neck pain due to upper trapezius active MTrPs were recruited and
      randomly allocated into group A, which received muscle energy technique (MET) and ischemic
      compression technique (ICT)along with conventional intervention; group B, which received all
      the interventions of group A except ICT; and group C, which received conventional treatment
      only. Baseline (Pr), immediate post-intervention (Po), and 2-week follow-up (Fo) measurements
      were made for all variables. Pain intensity and pressure pain threshold (PPT)were assessed by
      a visual analog scale (VAS) and pressure threshold meter, respectively. All three groups
      received their defined intervention plans only. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was
      used to perform intra- inter-group analyses. Cohen's d test was used to assess the effect
      size of the applied interventions within the groups.
