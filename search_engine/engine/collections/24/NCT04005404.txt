      peripheral regional anesthesia technique.

      After positioning on the non-fractured side, a double injection technique is used (dual
      guidance concept: nerve stimulation and sonography).

      The injections are performed parasacrally (blockade of the sacral plexus under the piriformis
      muscle) and lumbar paravertebrally (psoas compartment block and transmuscular quadratus
      lumborum block). Per block 20 ml ropivacaine 0.375% is administered (total dose: 225mg
      ropivacaine).

      The study examines the success rate (rate of successfully performed nerve blockade; need for
      supplemental medication: sufentanil and/or propofol; conversion rate to general anesthesia),
      circulatory stability (need for application of ephedrine or norepinephrine) and side effects.
