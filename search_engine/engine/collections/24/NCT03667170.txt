      non-colorectal cancer patients are limited. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or
      microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) played a role of positive predictive factor, which
      had been documented after the pembrolizumab and nivolumab trial were reported, for PD-1
      blockade monotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal and non-colorectal cancers.

      In this study, patients with previously-treated locally-advanced or metastatic mismatched
      repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal carcinoma (CRC)
      and other solid tumors will be treated with KN035 monotherapy. There will be two cohorts in
      this study: Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. For Cohort 1, colorectal cancer participants, who are
      required to have been previously treated with standard therapies, which must include
      fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan. For Cohort 2, other solid tumor participants,
      who are required to have been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard
      of care therapy.
