      homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film
      instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neuro- sensory
      abnormalities play etiological roles." (DEWS II Report, 2017).

      For the treatment and prevention of dry eye disease (DED) there are a number of treatment
      modalities available, depending on the severity and classification (aqueous deficient /
      evaporative) of the disease. The liposomal eye spray Tears Again® (TA, Optima Medical Swiss
      AG - medical device with CE marking) represents an option to treat mild to moderate
      evaporative DED. A novel preservative-free eye spray, Ectoin® Eye Spray - Colloidal (EES09;
      bitop AG -medical device with CE marking), was developed, in which colloids (colloidal
      lecithin emulsion) serve as a carrier for Ectoin. Ectoin is known as a natural
      cell-protective and inflammatory-inhibiting molecule. The principle mode of action of Ectoin
      is based on the physical interaction of this compatible solute with water and the resulting
      effects of the Ectoin-Hydro-Complex on the tissue treated.

      The aim of this study is to subjectively and objectively evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of preservative-free "Ectoin® Eye Spray - Colloidal" and to compare the efficacy
      and tolerability between "Ectoin® Eye Spray - Colloidal" and Tears Again® in patients with
      mild-moderate dry eye disease.
