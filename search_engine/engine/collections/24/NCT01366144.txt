      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ABT-888 (veliparib) in patients
      with varying degrees of renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 in combination with carboplatin
      and paclitaxel for patients with varying degrees of liver or kidney dysfunction.

      III. To provide dosing recommendations for ABT-888 in combination with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel based on degree of hepatic and renal impairment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with the use of
      this combination in patients with varying degrees of renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of ABT-888, carboplatin, and paclitaxel when
      administered as a combination in patients with varying degrees of renal or hepatic
      dysfunction.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic measurement of poly-ADP-ribosylated (PAR) and platinum
      adducts in tumor cells associated with the use of this combination in patients with varying
      degrees of renal or hepatic dysfunction.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib* orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: * All patients receive a single dose of veliparib PO on day -6 before course 1 (except
      patients with very severe renal dysfunction who receive veliparib on day -5 or -6 to coincide
      with a dialysis day).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
