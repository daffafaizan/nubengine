      will be screened for eligibility and approached for informed consent. Enrolled patients will
      be stratified based on the leading etiology of their fever: either neurologic injury or
      infection and then randomized to receive IV acetaminophen 1 gram or normal saline 100
      milliliters (mLs). Core body temperature will be measured using a zero-heat flow thermometry
      system (non-invasive, small disk on forehead). Patients will be monitored and data collected
      during the 4-hour post study drug administration period. A rescue protocol will be
      implemented if the temperature reaches ≥ 40 ºC during the study period and includes
      notification of primary team provider by the nurse and the pharmacist will contact them to
      inform the provider of study group (acetaminophen or placebo). The provider can decide
      whether to order antipyretic medication or physical cooling interventions at that time.
