      conditions. While these disorders are rare, they represent a significant public health
      problem because they are extremely debilitating and lack efficacious therapies. Neuroleptic
      use in PDD is high and the population appears to be at increased risk of serious sequelae
      including tardive dyskinesia. Newer atypical neuroleptics including risperidone are now used
      in 87% of cases but dosing, safety and efficacy is undetermined in the vulnerable population.

      This study consists of a total of 3 visits, the initial screening visit where consent,
      medical history, demographics and vitals will be recorded. Two additional visits with blood
      sampling will occur. The second visit will be no greater than 30 days from the screening
      visit and the 3rd visit will be one month from Visit 2.
