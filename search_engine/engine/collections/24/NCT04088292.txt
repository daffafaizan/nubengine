      associated with a significant risk of death or hemodynamic deterioration. The optimal
      treatment strategy should balance efficacy in reducing thrombus burden and hemodynamic
      compromise with risk of complications, in particular bleeding. Previous studies have
      investigated conventional high-dose, short term thrombolysis by (rtPA), finding a reduction
      in risk hemodynamic deterioration, but no reduction in mortality and a substantial increase
      in significant bleeding complications.

      Catheter based techniques and low dose thrombolysis may offer lower risk of complication with
      reasonable efficacy. Such studies have not been performed in RCTs with a reasonable sample
      size, and no study have compared low dose intravenous thrombolysis and catheter based
      techniques.

      The current trial addresses this paucity of data by randomizing patients to one of three
      treatment modalities:

      Intervention: 1:1:1 randomization, stratified for site to

        -  UltraSound Assisted Thrombolysis (USAT) with low dose thrombolysis (20 mg of rtPA,
           Alteplase) over 6 hours plus unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight
           heparin (LMWH) within 12 hours of randomization

        -  Intravenous low dose thrombolysis (20 mg of rtPA, Alteplase) over 6 hours plus UFH or
           low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

        -  UFH or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) only (with option for conventional
           thrombolysis according to local protocols for hemodynamic deterioration) Design:
           Regional collaborative, randomized trial with 1:1:1 allocation of 210 patients with
           acute intermediate-high risk PE with no absolute contraindications to thrombolysis
