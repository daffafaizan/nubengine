      hormonal and behavioral assessments to better understand the impacts of glucose and fructose
      on appetite and its central regulation in humans and have made important observations in lean
      individuals linking fructose consumption to overeating and obesity. The investigators now
      propose to expand this work by examining the impacts of glucose and fructose ingested
      together (sucrose), as occurs in real life, and by examining effects of a common
      non-nutritive sweetener, sucralose, on brain and appetitive response. The investigators
      propose a random-order crossover design to determine the effects of caloric and non-nutritive
      sweeteners among lean, overweight, and obese participants. The investigators will measure
      circulating levels of hormones involved in satiety signaling, quantify food intake, and
      measure brain activity using blood-oxygen level dependent and arterial spin labeling methods
      and functional connectivity analyses.
