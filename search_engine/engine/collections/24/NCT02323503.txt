      prevention ICD indication at first implantation of a CRT-D, the relevance defibrillator
      back-up after the replacement of the first CRT-D. For that, the rate of patients with at
      least one sustained VTA detected by the CRT-D or a conventional surface ECG will be assessed
      after the device replacement.

      Furthermore, the association between the baseline characteristics of the CRT-D population
      after replacement and the risk of subsequent VTA will be explored after a minimum of two
      years FU.
