      as the bladder, seminal vesicles and vas deferens. Nerve damage during prostatectomy can
      result in undesirable outcomes such as impotence and urinary incontinence. Robot assisted
      minimally invasive prostatectomy offers enhanced visualisation of the surgical field.
      Superior clinical outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay, blood loss, and oncologic
      margins compared with open surgery are reported. Confocal endomicroscopy provides high
      resolution subsurface cellular imaging in real time and is already in clinical use in
      gastroenterology and under investigation in other surgical applications. A potential role
      exists for confocal endomicroscopy to enhance microscopic nerve identification
      intra-operatively and guide surgical decision making during robot-assisted prostatectomy.
