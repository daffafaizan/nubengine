    
      Kidney stone disease has become a common phenomenon in the US and Europe with a growing
      incidence of about 10%. A history of kidney stone disease has also been connected to
      cardiovascular and renal insufficiency events to a point that kidney stones is looked at
      today as a systemic predictor of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and more.

      Seeing the importance of these risk factors we initiated a stone clinic for our kidney stone
      patients several years ago run jointly by a urologist and a nephrologist. Seeing that life
      style and dietary changes have a cardinal part in kidney stone prevention, it was only
      natural to determine the impact of the addition of a nutritionist to a stone clinic run by a
      urologist and a nephrologist on our patient parameters.
