      function. Pertinent to the proposed work, dietary intake has been recently shown to have the
      potential to directly influence the gut microbiota composition as well as brain function.
      Specifically, the consumption of prebiotics or fibers metabolized by gut bacteria may also
      play a role. These foods are readily available in the marketplace, however, their
      implications for physical and cognitive function are not clear. Accordingly, the proposed
      study aims to investigate effects of prebiotic beverage consumption on changes in behavioral
      and biological measures of cognition and stress among adults.
