    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose study of 14C-labeled belinostat to determine
      routes of elimination of belinostat. A single dose of 14C-labeled belinostat (approximately
      94.3 to 105 ÂµCi, 1500 mg) will be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion to the patient.
      Routes of elimination of belinostat and its metabolites will be assessed by estimating the
      recovery of total radioactivity and parent belinostat over a period of 7 days. Plasma samples
      will be taken for 3 days at specified intervals for PK assessments. Total radioactivity in
      plasma, urine, and feces will be determined by liquid scintillation counting. Concentrations
      of belinostat in plasma and urine will be determined using a validated liquid chromatography
      - tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) method. Selected plasma, urine, and feces samples will
      be retained for use in the metabolism investigation. Samples will be initially analyzed using
      radio-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the number and relative
      proportion of belinostat and metabolites present. Selected samples will be subsequently
      analyzed using LC-MS to identify the major metabolites (> 10% of parent area under the curve
      [AUC]). If it is in the interest of the patient, treatment with non-radiolabeled belinostat
      may be continued with 21-day cycles until disease progression, initiation of new anticancer
      therapy, or an adverse event (AE) that may affect patient participation.
