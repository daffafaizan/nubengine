    
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to one of two interventions: Prolonged Exposure
      (PE) consisting of 10 weekly treatment sessions that include education about and exposure to
      the memories of the trauma to which the patient was engaged; or Present Center Therapy (PCT),
      which will consist of a control therapy of the same duration that will provide emotional
      support for the trauma victim.

      Primary Hypothesis: Prolonged Exposure (PE) will be more effective than Present-Centered
      Therapy (PCT) for the treatment of PTSD due to military-related trauma in women veterans. PE
      specifically targets PTSD symptoms, and the CAPS, our primary outcome measure. The Clinician
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is considered to be the gold-standard for PTSD assessment.

      Secondary Hypothesis: PE will be more effective than PCT for treating the anxiety and
      depression that often are comorbid with PTSD.

      Study Abstract: As noted in a recent report on the VA Women's Health Project, it is important
      to study women veterans because they are increasingly seeking VA health care. For many women
      veterans, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a specific healthcare concern that is
      associated with substantial psychosocial and functional disability.

      The study was proposed in response to the Research Priority Announcement on Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder research issued August 1, 1997, as a study aimed a special subpopulation of
      VA patients with PTSD: women veterans who have been traumatized during their military
      service.

      The first planning meeting for the study was held January 20-21, 2000 in Washington, DC. The
      protocol was submitted on August 1, 2000; it was reviewed and approved by the Cooperative
      Studies Evaluation Committee on October 10, 2000. Intake of training cases is expected to
      begin 01/01/2002.
