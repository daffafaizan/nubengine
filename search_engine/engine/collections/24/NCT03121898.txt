      surgery patients (1,2). Conversely, there is a lack of information with respect to
      postoperative platelet function and postoperative bleeding, and specific cut-off values have
      not been identified yet.

      This study will verify the hypothesis that postoperative platelet function is associated with
      bleeding, and will test the ability of platelet function tests (PFTs) in predicting severe
      postoperative bleeding. Additional analyses linking platelet function to other preoperative
      and intraoperative conditions are planned.

      Patients: Enrollment between February 2017 and January 2018. 800 consecutive adult cardiac
      surgery patients are considered based on our usual surgical activity. Exclusion criteria:
      unwillingness to participate, known congenital coagulopathy. Moderate/severe bleeding occurs
      in about 12% of our patient population. Considering a 15% dropout rate, there are about 80
      predicted events. Power analysis: to build a predictive model, at least 60 events of
      moderate/severe bleeding are required. The study will be stopped at reaching (whatever comes
      first) 800 enrolled pts; 60 events; or 31st January 2018.

      Methods: all the patients will receive a preoperative (in the operating room) PFT (ADPtest
      and TRAPtest) using the aggregometry Multiplate (Roche). The same test will be repeated after
      protamine administration at the end of CPB.

      Definitions of bleeding: 12-hours chest drain blood loss; moderate/severe bleeding
      adjudicated based on the universal definition of perioperative bleeding (3).

      Statistics: ROC analysis with identification of adequate cut-off values and definition of the
      PPV and NPV
