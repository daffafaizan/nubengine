      women at risk for placenta accreta. Intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA), a drug with
      anti-fibrinolytic activity, is routinely used in elective orthopedic and cardiac surgery to
      reduce blood loss. Intravenous tranexamic acid is currently FDA approved for use in patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery or total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty to reduce
      peri- and post-operative blood loss and to reduce the need for blood transfusion. There has
      been growing interest in the application of tranexamic acid in obstetrics and gynecology. In
      multiple international studies, intravenous TXA has been shown to significantly reduce blood
      loss when given prophylactically with cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery without an
      increase in morbidity from adverse thrombotic events. TXA has not been studied in the
      particular population of patients requiring cesarean hysterectomy for placenta previa or
      accreta. This inexpensive, low risk medication has potential to greatly reduce perioperative
      morbidity and cost when used in a high risk obstetrical population.
