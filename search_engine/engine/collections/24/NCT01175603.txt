      City home visiting programs. We will screen 200 women who are pregnant or have a child < 6
      months for study inclusion; 91 women at elevated risk for developing postpartum depression
      (PPD) will be randomized to an intervention (MB Course) or usual home visiting control group.
      Women in the intervention group will receive the 6-week MB Course delivered in a group
      setting by the Study Clinician with reinforcing messages provided by home visitors during
      1-on-1 home visits, while women in the attention control will receive usual home visiting
      services and information on postpartum depression. Primary outcomes include depressive
      symptoms and depressive episodes.
