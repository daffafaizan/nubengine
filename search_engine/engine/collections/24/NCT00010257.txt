        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced thymoma or thymic
           carcinoma treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

        -  Determine the duration of response in these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel by intravenous (IV) infusion over 3 hours followed by
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression. Patients achieving complete or partial remission or stable
      disease receive 4 additional courses of therapy for a maximum of 6 courses. Further treatment
      may be given at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-68 patients were to be accrued for this study within 3.8-4.6
      years.
