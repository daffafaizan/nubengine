      3.01 to provide a 80% power to detect a 40-50% difference before and after treatment using
      either topical antioxidants or retinoids with a significance level of 0.05 (based on the
      results of a previous clinical trial). Assuming 10% dropout, 30 patients will be recruited in
      each treatment group.

      •Statistical analysis: Data will be collected and recorded on excel data sheet. Data will be
      tested for normality. Quantitative data will be represented as mean and standard deviation,
      or median and interquartile range. Qualitative data will be presented as number and
      percentage. The relevant statistical method will be used for comparison. P value will be
      considered statistically significant if it is less than 0.05
