      perilunate dislocations. We study a new surgical technique that allows for early wrist
      excises postoperatively. We compare this technique to Inoue et al. 's techniques affect the
      objective and subjective outcomes. We also compared the long-term outcomes of these two
      procedures performed in similar patient groups.Although both groups had satisfactory results
      with regard to their pain relief, sufficient grip strength and union of scaphoid fracture,
      the technique using in group I was more easily and quickly to perform. It allows early
      postoperative excises and results better functional wrist range of motion.
