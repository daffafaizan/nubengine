      of the same systematic review summary (infographics, PLS and scientific summary). The content
      of these three formats is based on the same systematic review, but the ways of data
      presentation will differ: visual presentation, plain language, and scientific language. The
      trial will be performed at the beginning of the 2016/2017 academic year, with first year
      university students as participants. The trial will be voluntary and anonymous. The survey
      will consist of 4 parts: 1) demographic data, 2) one format of the summary (randomly
      assigned), 3) comprehension test of the information given in the summary, 4) accessibility of
      information and overall satisfaction with the given summary assessed by survey and 5) health
      numeracy test. All materials will be in Croatian. The materials used in this research will be
      assessed by experts in order to confirm face validity of developed questions.
