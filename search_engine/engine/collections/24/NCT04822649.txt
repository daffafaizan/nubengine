      coronary artery disease (<50% stenosis) in coronary angiography and preserved ejection
      fraction (â‰¥50%) in echocardiography. All patients will undergo body composition analysis and
      adenosine stress echocardiography with the evaluation of coronary artery blood flow by
      Doppler echocardiography and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) by cardiopulmonary exercise
      test. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure will be assessed during coronary angiography.
      Coronary flow reserve (CFR) is defined as the ratio of peak to baseline mean diastolic
      velocity of coronary blood flow. The correlation of CFR and body composition with
      cardiopulmonary exercise capacity will be assessed.
