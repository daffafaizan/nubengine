      central obesity and dysglycemia) subclinical disorders related to chronic inflammation and
      cell damage have been reported on metabolic syndrome. Therefore, regarding the systemic
      feature of metabolic syndrome, we investigated an new approach of aerobic interval training
      on several clinical biomarkers widely used. Such training used differs from current aerobic
      protocols in order to attenuate metabolic and musculoskeletal overload on untrained and
      unhealthy subjects.
