      adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This is especially true for vital organs like the
      brain. Unfortunately, neither cerebral oxygen consumption nor cerebral oxygen delivery are
      directly monitored in the clinical setting while this type of information is of particular
      importance when taking care of patients inflicted with critical neurologic conditions. In
      addition, cerebral autoregulation - the mechanism of maintaining a constant cerebral blood
      flow in the face of arterial blood pressure fluctuation, is also not routinely monitored. The
      recent establishment of Coherent Hemodynamics Spectroscopy (CHS) is promising in offering
      what is needed in this context. The uniqueness of CHS is that it does not add any additional
      monitoring modality other than the cerebral oximeter based on near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS) that is currently used in clinical care. However, CHS is based on its own innovative
      algorithm that quantifies microvascular cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption, separates
      arterial and venous blood, and assesses functional status of cerebral autoregulation while
      the conventional cerebral oximeters do not. The investigators have established collaborations
      with Dr. Fantini from Tufts University and Dr. Tromberg from Beckman Laser Institute who are
      both leading scientists in Biophotonics research and development. Based on the clinical
      strength at UCSF, it is the investigators collaborative plan to explore the clinical
      application of CHS in patients with and without intracranial pathophysiologies. The study
      protocol has been submitted for review at UCSF.
