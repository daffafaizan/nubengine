    
      This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to irinotecan/cisplatin (IP)
      or etoposide/cisplatin (EP) treatment arms. The IP regimen consisted of at most 6 cycles of
      irinotecan 65 mg/m2 of body-surface area on days 1, 8 and cisplatin 75mg/m2 of body-surface
      area on day 1. The EP regimen consisted of at most 6 cycles of etoposide 100 mg/m2 of
      body-surface area from day 1 to 3 and cisplatin 75mg/m2 of body-surface area on day 1. Cycle
      length for the two arms was 3 weeks. The dose adjustment was allowed in at most within Â±5%
      per investigator discretion if necessary.
