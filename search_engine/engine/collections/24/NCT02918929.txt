      healthy subjects. A "fasted" and "fed" two-part cohort will also assess food effect.

      The second phase assesses multiple ascending doses (active drug or placebo) for 14-days in
      healthy subjects and also in subjects with presumptive NAFLD (i.e., obese subjects with or
      without prediabetes or T2DM).

      Each cohort within each phase will enroll a total of 8 subjects who will be randomized to
      receive EDP-305 or placebo. The cohort assessing food effect will enroll 10 subjects
      randomized to receive EDP-305 or placebo.
