      participants will self-administer treatments in the home setting over a period of 12 weeks.
      Changes in cerebral blood flow perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity and functional
      connectivity between the pre-treatment baseline and the end of the treatment period will be
      monitored and compared to changes in validated standardized clinical measures of motor and
      non-motor symptoms in PD.
