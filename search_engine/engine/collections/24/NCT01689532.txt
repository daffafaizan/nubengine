    
      This is a randomized (patients will be assigned to treatment by chance), double-blind (study
      personnel and patients will not know what treatments are being given), multicenter study. The
      expected duration of the study is 68 weeks. This will include 52 weeks of treatment with
      study agent with dosing every 2 weeks and 16 weeks of safety follow-up after the last dose.
      Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including MTX and SSZ, are not permitted from
      4 weeks before the first dosing with study agent until Week 24. The use of DMARDs is
      discouraged at or any time after Week 24; however, patients who have less than 20%
      improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts at Week 24 will be allowed
      to take DMARDs. At or any time after Week 16, the initiation and/or adjustment of oral
      corticosteroids will be allowed for patients who have less than 20% improvement from baseline
      in both swollen and tender joint counts at Week 16.
