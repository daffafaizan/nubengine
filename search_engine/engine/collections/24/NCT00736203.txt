      During scanning participants will complete the n-back task-a measure of working memory-and
      the cue-reactivity task-a measure of responses to smoking cues. Before scanning, participants
      will complete a training session where they will be familiarized with the tasks.

      All participants will have to pass a screening visit in order to be included in the study.
