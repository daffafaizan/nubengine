      to serious COVID-19. Hence, it is important they get sufficient protection by a COVID-19
      vaccine. However, these patients may also be at risk for a less robust vaccine response.
      There is an urgent need to assess the humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19
      vaccines in these patient groups. The clinical consequences could be to administer several
      re-vaccinations or to adjust medication. This prospective, observational study aims to assess
      the immune response after COVID vaccination in patients suffering from inflammatory diseases
      and using immunosuppressive medication. Also, liver transplanted patients on
      immunosuppressive medication will be included.

      Serum and whole blood samples will be obtained from all participants before and 1-4 weeks
      after the vaccination. Additionally, serum samples will be collected every 3-6 months for 5
      years. In a subset of patients, samples will be drawn to study cellular immune responses.
      Demographic data and data regarding immunosuppressive medication will be recorded. Disease
      activity (clinical activity indices and biomarkers of inflammation) will be assessed. Blood
      samples will be obtained for biobank. Information regarding vaccination status and potential
      COVID-19 testing will be obtained from relevant registers.
