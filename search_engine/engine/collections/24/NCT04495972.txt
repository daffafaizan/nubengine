    
      The study aims to assess the effects of a microbiota-based product containing Intestinimonas
      in adults with pre-diabetes.

      Intestinimonas is an aerobic microorganism which produces butyrate and interacts with the
      local microbiota in small and large intestine.

      In preclinical studies, it was demonstrated that the insulin sensitivity can be enhanced by
      Intestinimonas and similar microbiota.

      The purpose is to determine the safety and efficacy of the microbiota-based product on
      insulin sensitivity in a target group of prediabetic individuals.

      The study participants will be subjects who are overweight and are at risk of developing Type
      2 diabetes.

      The key objective of this randomized, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate whether
      Intestinimonas is able to improve the insulin sensitivity, to assess the response to the oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and whether it is able to modulate the microbiota composition
      in the study subjects.

      Furthermore, in a open-label follow-up of 14 weeks the effect of a high-dose of
      Intestinimonas will be compared with the low-dose tested in the initial double-blind
      Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT).
