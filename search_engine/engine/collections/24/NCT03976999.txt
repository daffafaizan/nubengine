    
      A Clinical and Biological Database is a collection of reliable, prospective and
      representative datas.

      This collection, provided to the scientific community, will help to develope research
      programs such as :

        -  Cinicals and biological predictive factors of treatments response

        -  Identification of biological tumoral markers associate with survival

        -  Identification of prognosic factors after recidivism

        -  Diagnostics tests optimisation and follow-up from blood samples ( Circulating Tumor
           Cells (CTC) )

        -  Developing strong preclinical models. Those models would be later used to test
           alternative treatments and would help to identify new biomarkers
