      cholesterol (mg/dL) and fractions, triglycerides (mg/dL), blood count, liver function (U/L)
      and classical glycemic index (mg/dL); hormonal profile - insulin (uIU/ml), luteinizing
      hormone (IU/L), follicle stimulating hormone (IU/L), thyreostimulating hormone (uIU/ML),
      total and free testosterone (ng/ml), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (ng/ml), dehydroepiandrosterone
      (ng/ml), prolactin (ug/ml). Body composition (BMI) will be performed by absorption technique
      of two low energy beams emitted by X-ray - full body densitometry (DEXA). Expected result: To
      evaluate visceral fat and truncal of patients with diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
