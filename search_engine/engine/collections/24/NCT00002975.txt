        -  Determine the efficacy of aminolevulinic acid and laser irradiation in patients with
           superficial and nodular epidermally derived lesions.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to lesion type
      (superficial basal cell carcinoma [BCC] vs nodular BCC vs superficial squamous cell carcinoma
      vs actinic keratoses). Individual lesions on patients within each stratum are randomized to
      receive either a 4-5 or 18-24 hour application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA).

      ALA is topically applied in a cream mixture and an occlusive dressing is placed over the
      lesion. After the randomized duration of ALA application has expired, the dressing is removed
      and a dye laser is used to treat the lesion.

      Patients are followed for 2-5 years after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 200 patients could be accrued, assuming 1 lesion per patient. 50
      lesions are required for each stratified group.
