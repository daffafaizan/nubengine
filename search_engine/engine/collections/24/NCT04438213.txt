      ertugliflozin in acute and post-acute hospitalized heart failure patients with or without
      diabetes, compared to both placebo and the active control metolazone. The broad study design
      will be designed around evaluation of change in gold standard determined body fluid spaces
      (blood volume, extracellular fluid, total body water), administering a sodium chloride
      challenge, and collecting the necessary biospecimens to test our hypotheses. The general
      study design will randomize to ertugliflozin vs. placebo early during IV diuretic therapy
      with continuation post discharge for a total therapy of 6 weeks.
