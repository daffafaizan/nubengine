    
      This is a randomized, single -center study conducted in China to compare the tolerability and
      toxicity of different dose of Anlotinib Plus Pemetrexed / Docetaxel in patients of Advanced
      Gene Negative Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.From low dose group up to high dose
      group, each one had 3 patients at least.Primary group received anlotinib 8mg. The dose of
      Anlotinib would increase gradually until MTD.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A and arm B:

      Arm A: Patients were instructed to take folic acid 400ug orally daily beginning 1 week before
      the first dose of pemetrexed and continuing daily until 3 weeks after the last dose of
      pemetrexed. A 1000ug B12 injection was administered intramuscularly approximately 1 week
      before the first dose of pemetrexed and was repeated approximately every 9 weeks until after
      discontinuation. All target volumes were instructed to take dexamethasone (4 mg orally twice
      daily the day before, the day of, and the day after pemetrexed) as a prophylactic measure
      against skin rash. Patients on the pemetrexed arm received 500mg/m2 pemetrexed as a 10-minute
      intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and 8mg/10mg/12mg Anlotinib orally daily on
      day 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle.

      Arm B: Patients on the docetaxel arm received 60mg/m2 docetaxel as a 10-minute intravenous
      infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and 8mg/10mg/12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1to 14 of
      a 21-day cycle.

      Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled to ensure that roughly 9 patients per arm complete
      treatments for primary endpoint analysis.
