    
      This is an open-label (physician and participant will know the name of the assigned drug),
      multi-center, non-randomized, drug-drug interaction study of JNJ-39758979 in participants
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on a stable oral methotrexate (MTX) dose (7.5 - 25 mg). The
      treatment phase will last 17 days. Participants will be housed in the clinic for dosing and
      study procedures from Day -1 to Day 3 and again from Day 13 to Day 17. Participants
      completing treatment will have a follow-up visit between Days 22 and 25. Participants who
      discontinue the study prematurely will complete the Day 22 to 25 follow-up procedures at the
      time of discontinuation or as soon as possible, thereafter. The length of participation in
      the study for an individual participant may be up to 9 weeks (including screening).
      Participant safety will be monitored. Day 1: A single oral dose of the participant's weekly
      methotrexate dose. Days 3-15: Weekly MTX co-administered with three 100-mg, enteric-coated
      tablets of JNJ-39758979, administered daily.
