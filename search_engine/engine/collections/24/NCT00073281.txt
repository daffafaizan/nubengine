      transplanted into the portal vein of patients with T1DM who have stable renal allografts to
      achieve insulin independence for the recipient. The protocol will employ a defined islet
      isolation procedure, percutaneous islet infusion into the recipient's portal vein via an
      intra-portal catheter, tight glycemic control during the peri-transplant period, and an
      immunosuppressive protocol that avoids glucocorticoids.
