        -  Determine whether prophylactic treatment with levofloxacin reduces the rate of clinical
           infection in patients receiving myelosuppressive antineoplastic chemotherapy for solid
           tumors or lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to age (under 40 vs 40-59 vs 60 and over), type of cancer (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      vs Hodgkin's lymphoma vs breast vs germ cell vs small cell lung cancer vs other), and
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral levofloxacin once daily for 7 consecutive days during the
           expected neutrophil nadir of each chemotherapy course.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo once daily for 7 consecutive days as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable side
      effects or allergy or a clear continuing indication for the prophylactic use of antibacterial
      agents during subsequent courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,500 patients (750 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
