      questionnaire has previously been investigated in a Danish population. The scale contains the
      10 ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases)symptoms of depression and these symptoms
      are identical with the DSM-IV major depression symptoms with the exception of one symptom,
      low self-esteem, which in DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is
      incorporated in the symptom of guilt. On a six-point Likert scale, the individual items
      measure how much of the time the symptoms have been present during the last 14 days. The MDI
      is then scored according to specific guidelines and can be used as both a rating scale and a
      diagnostic instrument.

      Patients will approximately one week after the diagnosis of breast cancer has been made,
      corresponding to approximately one week before surgery, be asked to complete the MDI.
      Patients therefore only complete the MDI once in the whole study. At the same time a Mini
      Mental State Examination (MMSE) and questions regarding previous illnesses and medication
      will be asked. Patients will not be followed up in any way.
