      on health related quality of life of AB/FF 400/12 μg compared to the individual components
      (AB 400 μg and FF 12 μg) in COPD patients. The trial duration of 24 weeks allows the
      assessment of the effect on symptoms improvement of the combined treatments versus individual
      components as well as the long term bronchodilation comparison between AB 400 μg and TIO 18
      μg in minimizing the risk of COPD exacerbations in current or former smokers, aged ≥40 in
      symptomatic COPD patients.
