      and efficacy of MVA85A/AERAS-485 in BCG vaccinated infants without tuberculosis or HIV
      infection. Infants (126 to 182 days) received intradermal (ID) study vaccine
      (MVA85A/AERAS-485 or Candida skin test antigen control). All infants were to be followed for
      at least 15 months after the last infant was enrolled into the study. Given completion of
      enrollment in 21 months, the total duration of follow-up for each infant was scheduled to be
      at least 15 months and up to 36 months. Infants were to be followed for the entire duration
      of the study both for the development of tuberculosis and serious adverse events.

      On enrollment to the study, eligible infants were assigned to a study group starting with
      Study Group 1 and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within a study group to receive either
      MVA85A/AERAS-485 or Candida skin test antigen control. Infants were assigned to a safety
      cohort (Study Group 1), then into 1 of 3 immunological assay evaluation groups (Study Groups
      2-4), and finally the remainder of infants were assigned into the correlate of protection
      cohort (Study Group 5). At least 330 infants were to be randomized in Study Group 1, up to
      50-60 infants each in Study Groups 2-4, and the remaining infants were randomized in Study
      Group 5.
