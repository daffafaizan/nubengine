      be enrolled. Immediately prior to BTVA treatment, an initial bronchoscopy will be performed
      to evaluate the baseline condition of the airways and to confirm anatomy of the lung segments
      targeted for BTVA treatment. Up to 3 segments in either the right or left upper lobe will be
      treated with a vapor dose of 10 calories per gram of lung tissue (10 cal/g). Targeted lobe
      for treatment will be based on lobar disease severity.
