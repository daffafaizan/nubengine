    
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease which requires long-term treatment. Due
      to the need of long-term safety data in Japanese participants and to fulfil the conditions of
      approval of adalimumab by the Japanese regulatory authority, this post-marketing
      observational study (PMOS) was conducted. The study investigated the long-term safety of
      adalimumab, particularly associated with the development of infections and malignant tumors.
      Data was collected once every 6 months up to 3 years.
