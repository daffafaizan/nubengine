      I. Evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF) as prophylaxis of grade III-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) in patients
      undergoing mismatched unrelated and related donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) starting on day -3, 3 times a week during
      hospitalization and then once a week for up to 6 months. Patients undergo HSCT on day 0.
      Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil intravenously (IV) or PO three times a day (TID)
      on days 1-180. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 30, 60, 100, 180, 270,
      and 365, and then yearly thereafter.
