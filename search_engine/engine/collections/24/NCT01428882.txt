      Nonanesthesiologist administration of propofol is controversial owing to deep sedation
      concerns. One of the latest therapeutic innovations on this issue has been the development of
      balanced propofol sedation, which consists of adding low doses of opioids or benzodiazepins.
      Several studies have recently demonstrated that BPS allows successfully moderate sedation,
      maintains a reversible drug component, reduces the total dose of propofol even by more than
      50% without increasing adverse events and maintains high levels of physician and patient
      satisfaction, even for advanced endoscopic procedure. However, recovery may be prolonged by
      using midazolam or meperidine as they have a longer elimination half-life than propofol has.

      Up to date, nonanesthesiologist administration of propofol and BPS, using either midazolam or
      fentanyl, for outpatient colonoscopy have been compared in a single non-placebo controlled
      randomized trial (VanNatta and Rex, 2006). In this study, the authors obtained shorter
      recovery times with BPS compared to propofol alone, in contrast with the expected on account
      of pharmacokinetics. These results can be easily understood yet single-agent propofol was
      titrated to deep sedation, whereas BPS was titrated to moderate sedation.

      Therefore, it is necessary to make a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to
      directly compare both sedation regimens targeted to a similar moderate level of sedation. The
      results of this study will conclude which should be the first line treatment for moderate
      sedation in colonoscopy, providing further insight in drug synergy and its impact on the
      depth of sedation and recovery times
