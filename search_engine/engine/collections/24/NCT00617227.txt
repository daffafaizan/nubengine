      not appreciably absorbed orally and is eliminated primarily via the renal route. Enteral
      vancomycin therapy (oral/intracolonic ) is used inpatients with severe Clostridium difficile
      associated colitis who are unable to take oral metronidazole or have failed treatment with
      metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is not detectable in serum of normal persons, but
      concentrations below therapeutic range may be found in patients with colitis. There are a few
      case reports of serum concentrations within the therapeutic range after oral/intracolonic
      administration of vancomycin, in association with renal failure. The use of enteral
      vancomycin in our geriatric population with variable creatinine clearance prompted us to
      measure the serum vancomycin levels in these patients.
