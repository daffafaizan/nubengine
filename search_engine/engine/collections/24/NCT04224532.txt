      different positions with intracranial pressure during laparoscopy. Reverse Trendelenburg
      position has been shown to slightly reduce the intracranial pressure associated with
      pneumoperitoneum. However, there are no studies on the effect of the timing of reverse
      Trendelenburg position on intracranial pressure. This study will monitor the effect of
      reverse Trendelenburg position before or after pneumoperitoneum on intracranial pressure and
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation. Ultrasound guided measurement of the optic nerve sheath
      diameter as a non-invasive method will be used for measurement. The investigators believe
      reverse Trendelenburg position before pneumoperitoneum may prevent undesired sudden increases
      in intracranial pressure.
