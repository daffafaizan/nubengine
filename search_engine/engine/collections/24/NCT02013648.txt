    
      This is a randomized phase III open-label, multicenter trial evaluating standard induction
      therapy (daunorubicin [DNR] and cytarabine [Ara-C]) and consolidation therapy (high-dose
      cytarabine [HDAC]) with or without dasatinib in adult patients with newly diagnosed CBF-AML;
      in the investigational arm, consolidation therapy is followed by a one-year maintenance
      therapy with dasatinib. Patients with molecular disease persistence or molecular relapse as
      assessed by quantitative RQ-PCR for the CBF fusion transcripts will be eligible for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before overt hematologic relapse occurs. Primary
      endpoint is event-free survival.

      AML patients will be assessed for the CBF fusion genes in one of two AMLSG central
      laboratories within 48 hours of diagnosis, and only patients with CBF-AML will be enrolled.
