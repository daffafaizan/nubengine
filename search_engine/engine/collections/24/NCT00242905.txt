    
      Twenty children aged from 6 to 18 years with temporal and/or frontal epilepsy and 20 normal
      children in the same age range will undergo the following examinations in a unique day in the
      Unit Hospital F. JOLIOT(CEA in ORSAY, France):

        1. complete neuropsychological evaluation including episodic memory,

        2. structural MRI to quantify, using VBM, the potential abnormalities of the anatomical
           structures, to perform cognitive-morphological correlations, and to localize the
           neuronal networks activated on fMRI,

        3. functional MRI using an original task of episodic memory, specifically dedicated to
           children and being under behavioural validation laboratory.

      The analysis of fMRI data will be performed using SPM and taking into account the existence
      of epilepsy or not, of cerebral lesion or not, age, handedness, the side and location of
      epileptogenic focus, the age of seizure onset, and the type of antiepileptic treatment.

      This study has been approved by the Ethic Committee in september 2004 (CCPPRB BICETRE,
