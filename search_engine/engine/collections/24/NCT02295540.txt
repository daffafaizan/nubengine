      I. 2 year locoregional control for advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated
      with preoperative hypofractionated radiation followed by surgical resection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rate of pathologic complete response after preoperative hypofractionated radiation at both
      the primary site and lymph nodes (LN).

      II. Rate of radiologic complete and partial response (computed tomography [CT] neck with
      intravenous [IV] contrast performed before and after radiation therapy, judged per Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria).

      III. Grade III/IV/V toxicity both short term (from start of radiation to 60 days after
      surgery) and long term (more than 60 days after surgery).

      IV. Rate of flap complications: Rate of flap revisions, and complete revisions required.

      V. Molecular correlates. VI. Quantitative imaging correlates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) every other
      day for up to 5 treatments. Patients then undergo surgery 7-14 days after the last radiation
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
