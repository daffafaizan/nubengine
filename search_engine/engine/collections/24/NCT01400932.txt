      Assessment (ISGA) score of 2 or greater at baseline visit, and have both 17 to 60 facial
      inflammatory lesions (papules plus pustules) and 20 to 150 facial non-inflammatory lesions
      (open and closed comedones), including nasal lesions. The primary objective is to demonstrate
      the superiority of GI148512 to vehicle gel in total lesion counts. The secondary objectives
      are to demonstrate the superiority of GI148512 to vehicle gel in inflammatory lesion counts,
      and to evaluate the efficacy of GI148512 compared with vehicle gel at each visit. A total of
      360 subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the groups.
