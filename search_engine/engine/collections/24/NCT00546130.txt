      clinical trial on extensive-stage disease (ED) small cell lung cancer: set test groups of
      cisplatin + irinotecan + Krestin therapy as first-line treatment and chemotherapy
      (radiotherapy or radiotherapy + chemotherapy also allowed) combined with Krestin as
      second-line treatment after exacerbation, evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment in a
      small number of cases, and compare with historical control or community control.
