      lifestyle intervention combining weight control, diet and physical activity on the risk of
      recurrences among breast cancer patients with non-metastatic tumours. As secondary objectives
      we aim to assess whether the proposed intervention is able to improve the overall survival or
      the disease-free survival, as well as quality of life of breast cancer patients. METHODOLOGY:
      This multicentric randomized controlled trial aims to include 2108 women (1054 per arm), aged
      up to 75 years, diagnosed with a non-metastatic breast cancer (stage I, II, IIIA) in the
      participating centres, whose standard treatment was completed within the last 3 months.
      Participants will be assigned to either an intervention or a control group, and followed for
      five years. Patients assigned to the control arm will continue with the usual care, including
      standard guidelines for weight control applied in the centre. Patients in the intervention
      group will be involved in a lifestyle program with two components. The dietary part will aim
      to achieve a calorie reduction while maintaining nutritional quality; the physical activity
      part will include supervised sessions of moderate intensity. Data will be analyzed on an
      intention to treat basis using time-toevent analysis. HYPOTHESES: We expect a significant
      reduction in the 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrences (primary outcome) in the
      intervention group. Furthermore, as secondary outcomes, we expect a significant increase in
      overall survival and an improvement of quality of life of patients included in the
      intervention arm.
