      health systems and exacts a tremendous toll world-wide. Individuals with a dual diagnosis
      have more severe symptoms, greater disability and poor quality of life than those with either
      diagnosis alone, and pose a greater economic burden to society due to their higher use of
      treatment services. New, enhanced, efficient, innovative and cost effective treatment
      strategies aimed at reducing the burden that the disorders impose on the suffers and their
      families as well as the community and health systems are required. In a pilot trial of
      supportive text messages for patients with alcohol use disorders and co-morbid depression,
      the investigators established that patients who received twice daily supportive text messages
      for three months had significantly less depressive symptoms than those who did not receive
      such messages. There was also a trend to finding that patients who received the supportive
      text messages were more likely to have higher cumulative abstinence duration than those who
      did not receive any supportive text messages.

      This research seeks to extend the knowledge gained from the pilot trial. A randomised trial
      will be conducted on a larger sample size of patients with alcohol use disorder and a
      co-morbid depressive disorder (including bipolar depression) for an extended duration (6
      months of supportive text messages and 1 year follow-up instead of 3 months text messages
      with 6 months follow-up in the pilot trial). It is hypothesised that patients receiving
      supportive text messages will report significantly greater cumulative abstinence duration as
      well as significantly less relapses, hospitalizations and mood symptoms than those not
      receiving such messages. It is anticipated that this technology intervention for relapse
      prevention will be acceptable to patients as well as cost effective.
