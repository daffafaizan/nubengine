    
      A total of 300 HIV-uninfected transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, defined as
      currently identifying as a gender different from sex assigned at birth, with high-risk
      transmission behavior will be enrolled into this study. Each participant will be followed for
      a maximum of 48 weeks after enrollment. The primary endpoint will be measured at 48 weeks, or
      the last week on study if the participant is discontinued early.

      All participants will start PrEP with TDF / FTC fixed dose combination taken once daily.
      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the iTAB text messaging adherence reminder intervention
      either with or without brief motivational interviewing (MI-b) for suboptimal adherence. All
      participants will receive the iTAB system to provide personalized, automated text messages to
      support and monitor adherence. In the MI-b arm, poor adheres by iTAB reporting will receive
      targeted MI-b via telephone.

      Both groups will receive PrEP in accordance with standardized comprehensive methods of
      prescribing, which includes risk reduction counseling, adherence counseling, and clinical
      assessments with safety monitoring, as well as HIV and STI screening.
