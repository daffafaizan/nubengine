      enrich the lives of veterans by enhancing their connection to their community. Initial survey
      findings support the mission by showing that involvement in Team RWB (1) increases
      connectivity; (2) helps bridge the civilian/military divide; and (3) improves well-being and
      life satisfaction.

      Numerous trials indicate that engaging in exercise programs can improve mood and reduce
      symptoms of depression and anxiety (for review see Penedo and Dahn, 2005). Accordingly,
      prescribing a structured exercise program has the potential to facilitate involvement in RWB
      and a reduction in reintegration difficulties. Compared to other levels of exercise
      intensity, vigorous-intensity exercise has been associated with increases in well-being (Cox,
      Thomas, Hinton, Donahue, 2006), reductions in anxiety and depression (Balchin, Linde,
      Blackhurst, Rauch, & Schönbächler, 2016; Cox, Thomas, Hinton, & Donahue, 2004; Katula,
      Blissmer, & McAuley, 1999) and improvements in quality of life (Ostman, Jewiss, & Smart,
      2016). According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), high intensity exercise
      methods are the leading trend in the fitness industry (Thompson, 2013). Importantly, high
      intensity exercise programs have gained increasing popularity particularly within military
      units (Haddock, Poston, Heinrich, Jahnke, & Jitnarin, 2016).

      This study aims to provide a pilot test of (1) the acceptability and effectiveness of RWB for
      veterans transitioning out of the military and (2) the effectiveness of a vigorous-intensity
      aerobic exercise prescription for enhancing the efficacy of RWB. To this end, the study will
      be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that involves 75 veterans discharged from the US Army
      at Fort Hood who will be assigned to: 1) 8-weeks of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise in
      addition to participation in a community-based program (Team RWB) or (2) 8-weeks of
      participation in Team RWB alone or (3) 8-weeks on a waitlist.
