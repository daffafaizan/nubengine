      study. Enrolled patients were examined and characterized for clinical and blood samples
      analysis and A.actinomycetemcomitans antibodies were expressed and evaluated enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units (EU). The Spearman Correlation Test and Jonckheere-Terpstra
      Test were applied in order to assess the interdependence between serum IgG
      A.actinomycetemcomitans antibodies and clinical periodontal parameters.
