      recent years. There are relatively few, well known factors, both genetic and environmental,
      which predispose to the development of thyroid cancer. Vitamin D deficiency has been
      associated with other cancers, but the association between vitamin D and thyroid cancer is
      unknown. We plan to do a case control, pilot study to evaluate the relationship between
      vitamin D levels and thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer in remission, and active thyroid cancer.
