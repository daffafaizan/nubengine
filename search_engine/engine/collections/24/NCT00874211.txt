      Primary

        -  To prospectively access the cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) at 3
           years in cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic acid treatment.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the clinical presentation and natural history of ONJ.

        -  To identify potential risk factors for the development of ONJ.

        -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of ONJ at 3 years for different tumor types (i.e.,
           breast cancer, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers).

        -  To better define the patient-related outcomes of ONJ.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo dental assessments at baseline and every 3-6 months for 3 years.
