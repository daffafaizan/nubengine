      in reducing the incidence of actinic keratoses and protecting against other ultraviolet skin
      damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.

      OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study. Groups of 6 patients are randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to Arms I and II, respectively. Arm I: Chemoprevention. Lotion composed of T4
      endonuclease V protein encapsulated in liposomes and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline
      in a hydrogel base, T4N5 Liposome Lotion, T4N5. Arm II: Control. Liposomes suspended in
      phosphate-buffered saline in a hydrogel base, Placebo, PLCB.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 6-30 patients will be entered in this multicenter study.
