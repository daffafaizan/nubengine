      joint. Moderate physical activity can slow cartilage degeneration in moderate OA stages.
      Remarkable weakness and atrophy of the quadriceps and hamstrings is a common problem in
      patients with chronic osteoarthritis, but in arthritis, it may be difficult to achieve
      strength gains due to the pain caused by heavy load-resistant exercises. Exercising with
      these high loads may not be possible or may injure painful arthritic knees. For this reason,
      lately, blood flow restricting exercises have been directed to achieve the same gain by
      exercising with lower loads by restricting the blood flow with a cuff. We aimed to limit the
      blood flow in osteoarthritic knees and to provide strength gain and pain reduction provided
      by conventional exercises given routinely. Our hypothesis in this study is that exercises
      that limit blood flow will reduce pain and increase strength as well as conventional
      exercises. Forty patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis by X-ray will be included in the
      study. Grade II-III (high rate of exercise therapy) individuals according to the Kellgren
      Lawrence classification will be included. Patients diagnosed with orthopedics and
      traumatology will be randomly divided into two groups according to the order of entry through
      the door. Conventional Exercises that increase muscle strength, flexibility and reduce pain
      will be included in the first group. In the second group, the same exercises will be used,
      but during the application, a cuff will be placed on the thigh and the blood flow will be
      prevented by inflating, therefore, exercises with lower loads will be performed. Exercises
      will be practiced for 12 weeks and pre-exercise results will be compared within and between
      groups.
