    
      Patients from a private practice who received dental implants (T3 dental implant Biomet 3I)
      from November 2012 to October 2013 were eligible to enter the study.

      Two groups were formed: one group received a T3 dental implant with platform switch concept
      and the other received an implant with platform matched type of connection.

      We evaluate osseointegration at T1 (12 weeks) and marginal bone position in relation to the
      implant platform at baseline (implant installation) T0 and again at T1 and T2.

      From data recorder in T0,T1 and T2, we evaluate changes in marginal bone position.
