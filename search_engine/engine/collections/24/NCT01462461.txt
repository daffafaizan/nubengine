      a vivid impression that their lost limb is not only fully present, but also painful. The John
      Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Virtual Integration Environment (VIE) is a
      highly flexible and adaptable virtual reality system that allows patients to observe movement
      of a 3D virtual arm. Using the VIE, recorded signals from the residual limb will be
      correlated to the desired motion of the phantom limb. We hope to correlate the consistency of
      these patterns with PLP to determine if increased control of the phantom limb leads to
      decreased PLP.
