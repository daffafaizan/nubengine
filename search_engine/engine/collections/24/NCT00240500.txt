    
      The primary study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of
      hepatitis B vaccine in newborns of HBeAg+ and HBsAg+ mothers in comparison with a historical
      control group.

      The present study is carried out to evaluate the anti-HBs persistence 16-20 years after the
      first vaccine dose and to further investigate the prevalence and incidence of other hepatitis
      B markers and the clinical significance of these at all time points from Year 16-20.

      No additional subjects will be recruited during this long-term follow-up study and no vaccine
      will be administered.
