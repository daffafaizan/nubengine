      phase of the study. All patients will be placed on treat-to-target insulin regimen alone
      during the run-in phase. At the end of the 3-month run-in period, all participants will
      continue on treat-to-target insulin regimen, and will then be randomized to either of the 2
      arms of the study: an experimental arm, consisting of treat-to-target insulin regimen plus
      metformin, and a control arm consisting of treat-to-target insulin regimen plus placebo. Both
      the physicians and patients will be blinded to the oral agents being administered to
      patients.
