      Patients in group 1 (n=17) received Lugol's solution for 10 days before surgical
      intervention, whereas patients in group 2 (n=19) didn't receive it. Blood flow through the
      thyroid arteries of patients with Graves' disease was measured by color flow Doppler
      ultrasonography. The microvessel density (MVD) was assessed immunohistochemically and Western
      blot analysis using the level of expression of CD-34 in thyroid tissue. The thyroid gland's
      weight and blood loss were measured in all patients.
