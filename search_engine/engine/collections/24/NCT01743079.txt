      clinics/delivery unit at YouAn Hospital in Beijing. Subjects are prospectively followed from
      gestation week 26 to postpartum week 52. Treatment naÃ¯ve mothers with HBV DNA > 6 log10 c/mL
      and normal ALT are eligible. Mothers with abnormal fetus, cirrhosis or evidence of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are excluded. At gestation week 28, mothers will receive
      telbivudine (LdT) 600 mg per day or lamivudine (Lam) 100 mg per day until postpartum 4 or no
      treatment as per their preference. All infants will receive standard immunoprophylaxis. Data
      is collected from patient records using data extraction forms. Primary endpoints are vertical
      transmission rates at infants' age of 52 week and the safety of telbivudine or lamivudine
      use.
