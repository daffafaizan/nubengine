      those observed to have poorer long term outcomes of diabetes management and to spend a higher
      proportion of their income on diabetes care. Therefore, diabetic individuals from resource
      poor settings require special attention and effective management strategies to assist them
      improve their health outcomes. Patient self-management education, including nutrition
      education is a feasible strategy in resource poor settings.

      The nutrition education programme in this study is based on the target group assessed needs,
      as tailored education is shown to be more effective in improving health outcomes.

      The experimental group will receive nutrition education in group format on a weekly basis for
      eight weeks, this will include a vegetable gardening component offered in collaboration with
      the Department of Agriculture. In addition written education materials will be provided
      (pamphlet and wall/fridge flyer). A follow-up intervention on a monthly basis will follow the
      group education.This is to revise the learnt content and for group problem solving
      activities. The control control group will receive usual care plus the written education
      materials.
