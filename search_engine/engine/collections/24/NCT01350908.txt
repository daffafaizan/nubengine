    
      Technique development:

      In a first step, the different available techniques will be evaluated for specificity and
      sensibility using serial dilutions of cell lines with or without TP53 mutation.

      Validation:

      The tumor DNA detection rate will be estimated from patient's blood with ovarian cancer.

      The investigators will study 25 patients to obtain at least 15 patients bearing a TP53
      mutation that could be characterized in the primitive tumor or metastasis. With those 15
      patients, the investigators will determine the most sensitive technique and the best
      cost/efficiency ratio.
