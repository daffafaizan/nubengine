      complexity of communication during the cancer genetic consultation. It will be proposed to
      women referred to genetic counselling in the participating Cancer Genetic Clinics .

      New qualitative (moderate risks, secondary results) and quantitative results (variation in
      the degree of cancer risk identified for the counselee and family members) and thus a
      personalized breast cancer risk may be obtained. How this complexity affects counselees'
      psychological reactions is not known.

      It is primarily aimed at comparing psychosocial needs and distress in healthy women
      (unaffected with BC) at high risk of breast or ovarian cancer undergoing genetic testing
      based on an enriched gene panel (index case gene panel plus PRS) at Curie Institute in France
      and at the University Hospital in Cologne, Germany.
