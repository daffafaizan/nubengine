      biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy and viable retinal cells. Mutations in
      the RPE65 gene are associated with several clinical manifestations including nyctalopia,
      decreased visual field and decreased visual acuity. Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl uses a
      non-pathogenic recombinant adeno-associated virus vector serotype 2 (AAV2) to deliver cDNA
      encoding RPE65 protein to target cells in the retina. Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl is
      administered to each eye via subretinal injection. The administration of voretigene
      neparvovec-rzyl is recommended to be performed to each eye on separate days within a close
      interval. Prescribing information recommends an immunomodulatory regimen concomitant with
      administration, with the actual regimen dependent upon the dosing center.

      This post authorization safety study will focus on further characterizing the long-term
      safety profile of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl in patients with RPE65 mutation-associated
      retinal dystrophy using an observational, longitudinal design.
