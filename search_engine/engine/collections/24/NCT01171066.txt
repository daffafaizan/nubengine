    
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a condition characterised by partial or complete collapse
      of the upper airway during sleep. The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive
      Airway Pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positive
      airway pressure to the upper airway via a tube and mask. The mask is attached to the
      participant's nose via head straps. The type of mask used is dependent upon participant
      choice and comfort and the mask that provides the best fit.

      Some participants stop using CPAP therapy finding it difficult to tolerate due to leak issues
      or discomfort from their nasal mask. Another frequent concern is mask dislodgment while
      sleeping causing leaks and consequently waking the patient up.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Tasman CPAP system via
      objective and subjective assessment of comfort and ease of breathing compared to the
      participant's current CPAP device.

      Aim

        -  To determine if the efficacy of the treatment is clinically equivalent to or better than
           the predicate device (S8 Escape)

        -  To evaluate the performance of the Tasman CPAP system in terms of comfort of breathing
           and general ease of use
