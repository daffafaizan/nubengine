      is obtained. According to the agreement a few drops of nose blood are preserved. Subsequently
      the standard therapy is performed. This blood sample is promptly analyzed with the rapid test
      devices.

      We successfully applied the exception to the analysis of blood samples prior to obtaining the
      written consent due to following reasons: Analysis with the rapid test devices needs to be
      immediate and without delay in order to satisfy quality standards prescribed by the
      manufacturers. In addition, patient's treatment should not be delayed.

      Simultaneously, a venous blood sample for the corresponding values is carried out according
      to medical indications. After the treatment of the acute emergency and thus after the
      greatest stress situation, we ask the patient again whether he agrees to the study
      conditions. The written consent is obtained in the end of the acute treatment.

      Both inception and termination of the research project will be reported within 90 days of the
      Ethics Committee.
