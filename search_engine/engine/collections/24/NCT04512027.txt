      structure enabling it to rapidly infect and spread among the population. COVID19 is a global
      health emergency and has affected lives of all people irrespective of being infected. There
      are no proven therapies and a vaccine is yet to be approved for wide public usage.

      Our study aims to test a hypothesis of physically blocking the spike protein from infecting
      the human cells, thus promoting its rapid excretion from the infected person.

      We will randomise 10 subjects in this proof of concept trial and test the hypothesis by
      measuring the effect of Prolectin-M; a (1-6)-alpha-D-Mannopyranose in reducing the viral copy
      numbers over 5 days of treatment. The absolute copy numbers will be measured on digital
      droplet PCR developed by BioRad. A fall in copy numbers by 2-fold from baseline will be
      considered a positive treatment effect in this population. All standard care measures
      currently being practiced for these patients will be continued.
