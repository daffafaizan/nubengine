      a VEGF pathway. The administration of bevacizumab (a VEGF-A monoclonal antibody) in
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) murine models at a dose of 5mg/kg (a standard chemotherapeutic
      dose) has shown a significant reduction in stenosis formation and an overall improvement in
      vascular remolding. However, previous pharmacokinetic human studies have shown that
      bevacizumab administered at a low dose of 1.25mg intravitreally (ocular neovascularization
      patients) is sufficient enough to suppress circulating VEGF-A levels up to 30 days post
      administration. A chart review on 14 hemodialysis patients receiving an arteriovenous access
      and intravitreal bevacizumab has demonstrated a significant improvement in patency (HR: 0.45,
      p-value: 0.037) when compared to controls. Prior to a phase 1 trial, it is essential to
      determine if intravenous administration of bevacizumab demonstrates the same pharmacokinetics
      and bio-response profile as intravitreal administration, and to determine the optimal dose
      and frequency. This phase 0 study will be conducted in 10 existing hemodialysis patients at a
      dose of 1.25mg with a potential dose escalation to 2.5mg if optimal results are not seen. The
      findings from this study can have a substantial clinical impact not only in ESRD patients but
      also in patients receiving other vascular or endovascular procedures.
