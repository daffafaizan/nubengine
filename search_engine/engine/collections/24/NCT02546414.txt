      cirrhosis. Using noninvasive parameters for high-risk variceal haemorrhage may reduce the
      need for endoscopies. The ratio of platelet count/diameter of the spleen (PC/SD ratio) is the
      principal noninvasive predictor of esophageal varices. This was an analytical cross-sectional
      study to validate the diagnostic test for HBV hepatic cirrhosis and was performed between
      January 2013 and August 2015. This study is to validate the PC/SD ratio to identification of
      those patients with high bleeding risk and selection for prophylactic treatment.
