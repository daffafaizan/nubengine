      and has reported patient benefits associated with a single port approach. The single port
      robotic platform offers the potential to ameliorate the significant technical and ergonomic
      challenges that currently limit more widespread application of single port donor surgery.
      After being informed of the potential risks and off-label use of the da Vinci Single-Site
      approach in our study, patients will undergo a robotic-assisted single-site donor nephrectomy
      performed by a two-surgeon team utilizing existing da Vinci instrumentation and Single-Site
      platforms. Renal mobilization and vascular dissection will be performed with manual
      laparoscopy performed for vascular division utilizing stapling devices.
