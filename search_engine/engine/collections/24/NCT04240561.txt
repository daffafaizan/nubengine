      average hearing aid benefit and satisfaction, benefit is still highly variable between
      individual patients, with some individuals reporting much greater benefit than others. The
      standard approach to selecting signal processing does not consider individual auditory and
      cognitive differences and how these may be affected by different levels of advanced signal
      processing. Data provided by the parent grant, R01 DC0012289, indicate that adults with low
      working memory capacity (a cognitive skill describing ability to process and store
      information), more hearing loss and/or advanced age receive limited benefit from hearing aid
      signal processing that substantially modifies the original speech signal. The long term goal
      of the investigator's research is to optimize choice of signal processing based on individual
      auditory and cognitive abilities.

      The investigators will measure patient outcomes in response to two hearing aid signal
      processing strategies that represent two clinically common but very different approaches,
      which differ in the extent of their signal modification. Commercially available hearing aids
      will be used for this study. The primary patient outcomes for this project are an
      individual's speech intelligibility and conversation analysis in aided and unaided
      conditions. Conversation Analysis quantifies conversation breakdowns and repair behaviors as
      a function of hearing aid signal manipulations and communication partner perceptions of
      conversation difficulty. Outcome measures will take place after 3-5 weeks of use of each
      signal modification strategy. The flexibility in timing is to accommodate the scheduling
      needs of individual participants.
