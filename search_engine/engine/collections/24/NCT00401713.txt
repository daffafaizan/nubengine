      improve or preserve visual acuity in patients with AMD. Transplantation of autologous RPE and
      translocation of autologous RPE and choroid represent two promising therapeutic interventions
      in patients with AMD. This prospective, randomized clinical trial compares the two surgical
      treatments and additionally compares the clinical results (visual acuity, FLA) with OCT- and
      UHR-OCT data.
