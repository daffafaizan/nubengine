    
      Mapping Procedure:

      Each patient will receive an injection of 1.0 mCi of technetium-99m sulfur colloid into the
      normal breast tissue surrounding the primary cancer or biopsy cavity directed subareolar or
      around the tumor.

      If the radioactive SLN cannot be located prior to incision via gamma probe then the blue dye
      will be used in the breast either in the subareolar plexus or peritumorally at the discretion
      of the surgeon. For this contingency (expected to occur <3% of the time), the blue dye will
      be used in the breast (and NOT the arm), as the prime concern is locating the SLN for
      staging.

      If the blue dye is unnecessary to find the sentinel node draining from the breast, then it
      will be injected dermally in the upper inner arm along the Biceps groove of the ipsilateral
      arm in order to locate the draining lymphatics from the arm. No more than 5cc of blue dye
      will be injected in either the subareolar plexus, peritumorally (intraparenchymal or
      dermally), or dermally in the patient's ipsilateral arm dependent upon the contingencies
      stated above. Site of all injections (radioactivity and/or blue dye) will be recorded.
