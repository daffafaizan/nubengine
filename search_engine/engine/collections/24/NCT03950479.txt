      approximately 29000 deliveries annually and 10000 women are giving birth for the first time.

      Challenges: The invitation to participate in the study will be given to all women expecting
      their first child fulfilling inclusion criteria. The biggest challenges in the project will
      be logistical. To be able to inform, recruit and follow women having their first child is a
      challenge in itself.

      Applications: If it is possible to identify a risk group for pelvic floor injuries before
      delivery, it might be ethical to recommend a prophylactic cesarean section to avoid disabling
      incontinence and prolapse later in life.
