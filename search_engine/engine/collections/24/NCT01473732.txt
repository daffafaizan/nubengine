    
      Specific Aim 1: To investigate allograft and peripheral blood cell gene expression patterns
      of patients with CAI by using Affymetrix microarrays.

      Hypothesis 1: Gene expression patterns of patients with biopsy findings suggesting
      calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity without significant tubulointerstitial infiltrates or
      transplant glomerulopathy might demonstrate upregulation of genes related to tissue injury,
      fibrosis, and extracellular matrix deposition without upregulation of genes related to
      alloimmune response, such as, T and/or B lymphocyte activation markers, surface receptors,
      co-stimulation molecules, adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines comparing to patients
      with significant tubulointerstitial infiltrates and/or transplant glomerulopathy that might
      show upregulation of genes related to alloimmune response, such as, T and/or B lymphocyte
      activation markers, surface receptors, co-stimulation molecules, adhesion molecules,
      cytokines, and chemokines.

      Specific Aim 2: The effect of everolimus (Zortress)/ mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®)
      treatment on allograft and peripheral gene expression patterns.

      Hypothesis 2: Everolimus (Zortress) and mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®) treatment
      attenuates the progression of CAI due to CNI toxicity by downregulating the expression of
      genes related to fibrosis, such as, transforming growth factor-β, thrombospondin 1, and
      platelet derived growth factor-C.

      Specific Aim 3: To document the clinical outcomes of everolimus (Zortress) and mycophenolate
      sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®) in patients with CAI due to CNI toxicity Hypothesis 3: Everolimus
      (Zortress) and mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS, myfortic®) can attenuate the progression of CAI
      due to CNI toxicity and may improve the creatinine clearance.
