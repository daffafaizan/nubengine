    
      The purpose of this pilot study intervention is to investigate brain mechanisms of response
      to memory enhancement training (MET) compared to Kundalini yoga and "Kirtan Kriya" meditation
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that will be acquired from each subject at
      baseline and at 12 weeks (post-randomization).

      Overall, the investigators anticipate recruiting 66 adults with memory complaints and
      diagnosed with MCI for adults 55 years old and older. Subjects will either receive: (1) MET
      class for 60 minutes per week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and "Kirtan Kriya" meditation class for
      60 minutes per week. All assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions
      for a total of 10 visits in 12 weeks and a follow-up visit at 6 months (24 weeks)to monitor
      the overall benefit of the intervention.
