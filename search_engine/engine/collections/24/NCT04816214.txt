    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, global phase III study that
      will enroll adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating
      mutation, T790M negative, MET amplified who have progressed following either 1st/2nd
      generation EGFR TKIs or osimertinib.

      The study will consist of an initial safety run-in part to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of capmatinib in combination with osimertinib and to confirm the recommended
      dose for the randomized part, and a randomized part that will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of capmatinib in combination with osimertinib compared to platinum (cisplatin or
      carboplatin) - pemetrexed doublet based chemotherapy as second line treatment.

      Participant's respective treatment (either with capmatinib in combination with osimertinib,
      or with platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) - pemetrexed based doublet chemotherapy) will be
      continued until participant experiences any of the following: documented disease progression
      by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) (as assessed by the
      investigator in the run-in part, and as assessed by the investigator confirmed by blinded
      independent review committee (BIRC) in the randomization part), withdrawal of consent,
      pregnancy, lost to follow-up, or death. Respective treatment may be continued beyond initial
      disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 if, in the judgement of the investigator, there is
      evidence of clinical benefit, and the participant wishes to continue on the study treatment.

      After treatment discontinuation, all participants will be followed for safety evaluations
      during the safety follow-up period.
