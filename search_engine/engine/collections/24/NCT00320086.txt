      patients with diabetes. Microalbuminuria (MA) is predictive of future diabetic nephropathy
      (DN) in adult patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). This link between MA levels and DN allows
      patients to receive timely interventions. The predictive value of MA for DN in children with
      DM, however, is not well established. Most studies looking at this association in children
      have only been forced to use adult MA values. Children, particularly adolescents, are known
      to have different normal values for 24-hour total protein excretion compared to adults and it
      may be that they also have different normal levels of MA. Little literature exists on normal
      levels of 24 hr MA in healthy children and in children with diabetes.

      In this study, we seek to define the range of MA levels that falls between the 2.5 and 97.5
      percentiles for children with and without DM. Once these values are established, we will have
      a foundation for further studies to define which, if any, MA values are predictive of DN in
      children. If we can establish a MA level which is predictive of DN in children, it will allow
      physicians to direct medical intervention at those most likely to benefit while protecting
      others from unnecessary medications, procedures, and risks.
