      algorithm is incorporated for improved detection of ventilation efforts. In addition, sensors
      are integrated, automatic feedback electronics are improved, and the device is made more user
      friendly to be appropriate for out-of-hospital situations in demanding environments.

      In addition, waveforms will be recorded for later analysis and evaluation of the diagnostic
      value of a thoracic push ( a gentle push on the sternum) to detect tube position.
