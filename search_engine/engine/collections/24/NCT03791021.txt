      questionnaire done in the third trimester and three months later in order to identify
      pregnant women in higher risk to develop PPD.

      the minimal number of objectives participating in the research would be 100 pregnant women
      during the third trimester of pregnancy.

      the Draw A Person (DAP) test was described by Machover in 1949. it is still considered a
      reliable and well recognized test for evaluation of mental stress and disorders (Gilory,
      2012).

      in the research approximately 100 pregnant women in the third trimester would be asked to
      draw a self portrait in two different time points (during the third trimester and three to
      six months postpartum). in addition to the self portraits the participants would be asked to
      fill a set of questionnaires to evaluate the degree of depression, self esteem, personal
      history of traumatic events, and demographic data.

      the self portraits would be evaluated by three judges. the reliability between judges would
      be tested using KAPPA test.
