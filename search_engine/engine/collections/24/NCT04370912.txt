      quantity and muscle quantity. Work done by Strasser et al, has shown that ultrasonic measures
      of muscle thickness in the quadriceps muscle has a highly significant correlation with
      maximal voluntary contration. Other work done by Miron-Mombiela et al has shown that measures
      of muscle thickness and echointensity (a measure of muscle quality) also show high
      correlations with grip strength. These findings (supported by our pilot data, see Pilot Data)
      and new technological advances in bedside ultrasonic devices suggest that these measures
      might be a valuable contribution to the process of screening for sarcopenia in older adults.
      In this proposal, Investigators hypothesize that bedside ultrasound, which is increasingly
      becoming a mainstream component of the standard physical exam, will be a much more specific
      and accurate alternative to our current best screening methods.
