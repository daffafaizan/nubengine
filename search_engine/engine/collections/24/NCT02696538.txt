      of three balance measures, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)
      and the mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BESTest), among individuals with history
      of traumatic brain injury. Participants will complete a health history questionnaire and
      six-month fall history. When available, fall history will be corroborated with a family
      member that resides with the participant. Participants will complete the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment. Each participant will then participate in a 45-minute evaluation using the three
      performance-based outcome measures, with order randomized, with two blinded assessors. Six
      and 12 month follow-up of number of falls will occur via telephone. Statistical analysis with
      investigate the inter-rater reliability, predictive validity of fall risk and to determine
      cut off scores for fallers vs. non fallers in the population.
