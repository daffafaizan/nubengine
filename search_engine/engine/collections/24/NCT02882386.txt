      athletes to patients and elderly. Resistance exercise and protein ingestion are two of the
      most potent stimulators of muscle protein synthesis. Both the physical characteristic of
      proteins (e.g. different digestion rates of whey and casein) and the amino acid composition,
      affects the potential of a certain protein to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Given its
      superior ability to rapidly increase blood leucine concentrations to high levels, whey is
      often considered the most potent protein source to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Native
      whey protein is produced by filtration of unprocessed milk. Consequently, native whey has
      different characteristics than WPC-80, which is exposed to heating and acidification. Because
      of the direct filtration of unprocessed milk, native whey is a more intact protein compared
      with WPC-80. Of special interest is the higher amounts of leucine in native whey.

      The aim of this double-blinded randomized 5-arm cross-over study is to compare amino acid
      kinetics in blood after a bout of strength training and ingestion of 20 grams of high
      quality, but distinct, dairy protein supplements (native whey, whey protein concentrate 80,
      hydrolysed whey, microparticulated whey and milk). Furthermore, the investigators investigate
      whether differences in amino acid kinetics affect acute blood glucose and urea response, as
      well as recovery of muscle function after a bout of strength training.

      The investigators hypothesize that native whey will give a faster and higher rise in blood
      concentrations of leucine compared to the other protein supplements.
