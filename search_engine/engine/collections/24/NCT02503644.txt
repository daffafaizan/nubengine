      proof-of-concept trial of IVA337 for the treatment DcSSc.

      The treatments are randomly assigned. The randomisation is stratified for background therapy
      to ensure even distribution of background therapies among treatment groups.

      There are 3 parallel treatment groups: placebo, IVA337 400mg bid and IVA337 600mg bid
      (identical capsules of 200mg IVA337 or placebo). Both, patient and investigator are blinded.

      The treatment lasts 48 weeks. A follow-up assessment takes place 4 weeks after the last dose.
