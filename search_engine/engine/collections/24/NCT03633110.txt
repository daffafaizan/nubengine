    
      This first-in-human study of GEN-009 will be conducted in two parts in adult patients with
      cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma (Part B only). In Part A, the
      safety and immunogenicity of single-agent GEN-009 will be evaluated in patients with the
      above-noted tumor types who have completed treatment with curative intent for their disease
      (eg, surgical resection, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy)
      and have no evidence of disease (NED) at the time of initiating vaccination with GEN-009. In
      Part B, up to 15 patients in each disease cohort will be enrolled and evaluated for safety,
      immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of GEN-009. Patients in Part B will
      receive GEN-009 at the schedule selected in Part A, in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor
      therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) at the approved dose and schedule per the United States
      Package Insert (USPI). In addition, up to 15 patients who enroll in one of the Part B
      disease-specific cohorts but whose disease progresses during the screening period therapy may
      be enrolled into a separate relapsed/refractory disease cohort.
