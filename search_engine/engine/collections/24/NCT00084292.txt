    
      OBJECTIVES: This is the first multi-center, multi-national study of children with stroke. It
      seeks to build a network of investigators and high-quality disease data to enable
      population-based studies, natural history studies, and clinical trials to improve the care of
      children with stroke.

      STUDY POPULATION: Infants and children with ischemic stroke (arterial ischemic stroke and
      cerebral sinovenous thrombosis), or those at high risk (e.g. arteriopathies).

      DESIGN: This study includes a data collection component and collaborative process. Our
      network of over 150 investigators prospectively collect data on neonates or children with a
      diagnosis of stroke made after January 2003. Data on stroke diagnosis, etiology, treatment
      and outcomes are collected and entered into a secure web system, REDCap. Neuro-imaging data
      from the index event and a series of follow-up time points are captured and stored in the
      SILC-IPSS data repository.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: This study will quantify outcome event rates (initial stroke
      characteristics, recurrent stroke, mortality, neurologic deficits), which can be used in
      designing future intervention studies and determining sample sizes. Analysis will be
      primarily descriptive. Participating investigators submit investigator-initiated research
      proposals or grants with a specific focus, leveraging the clinical and imaging dataset.
