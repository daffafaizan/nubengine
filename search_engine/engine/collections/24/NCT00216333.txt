    
      This is a multiple country, multicenter study, using the parallel group open-label randomised
      trial design. The primary objective of this investigation is to assess the efficacy,
      acceptability and toxicity of a combined FDC regimen of chemotherapy in patients with newly
      diagnosed smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis in comparison with the standard regimen using
      separate drugs.

      Patients will be allocated at random either :

        -  an initial intensive phase of eight weeks of daily ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and
           pyrazinamide, in a fixed dose COMBINED tablet, followed by 18 weeks of rifampicin and
           isoniazid, in a fixed dose combined tablet three times a week (2COMB/4(RH)3) or

        -  the same drugs given in SEPARATE formulations in the initial intensive phase of eight
           weeks, followed by 18 weeks of rifampicin and isoniazid, in a fixed dose combined
           tablet, three times a week (2SEPA/4(RH)3)
