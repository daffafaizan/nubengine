      individuals, resulting in substantial immune restoration and decreased morbidity and
      mortality. However HIV-1 cannot be eradicated from infected individuals by current regimens.
      Cellular reservoirs and tissue sanctuary sites allow latent HIV-1 persistence and ongoing
      low-level virus replication, despite maximum virus suppression on HAART. This project aims to
      characterize the residual replication of HIV-1 in subjects on HAART, particularly in the
      gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). A group of 20 HIV-1-infected patients on effective
      HAART will undergo GI endoscopy and GALT biopsies will be taken. A sample of venous blood
      will also be collected. These samples will be use to characterize the residual viral
      populations on effective HAART in three compartments, plasma, monocytes, and GALT. HIV-1
      coreceptor usage and its evolution on HAART will be characterized in virus reservoirs. This
      project could provide further insights into the residual replication of HIV-1 in subjects
      receiving HAART.
