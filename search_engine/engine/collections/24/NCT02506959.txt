    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with refractory or relapsed
      myeloma receiving panobinostat/gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine)/busulfan/melphalan
      (panobinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel) with autologous stem-cell transplant, either as a first or a
      salvage stem-cell transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate. II. To determine the overall survival (OS).
      III. To determine the CR + very good partial remission (VGPR) rate. IV. To determine the
      overall response rate (ORR). V. To determine minimal residual disease posttransplant,
      measured by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC).

      VI. To describe the toxicity profile of panobinostat/Gem/Bu/Mel. VII. To analyze the
      predictive value of pretransplant levels in myeloma cells of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1),
      inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u), sliced XBP1 (XPB1s), XBP1u/XPBs
      ratio and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (Myc), by analyzing their
      correlation with CR, VGPR+CR and response rate (RR).

      VIII. To study the prognostic effect of pretransplant levels in myeloma cells of XBP1, IRE1,
      XBP1u, XPB1s, XBP1u/XPBs ratio and Myc, by analyzing their correlation with PFS and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panobinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -9 to -2, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days -8 and -3, busulfan IV over 3 hours on
      days -8 to -5, and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -3 and -2. Patients then undergo
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, 100 days, 6 months,
      1 year, and then every 3-6 months for at least 2 years.
