      levels on a tumor sample using the nCounter-based technology. This will be centrally
      performed at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. If the tumor is PD1-high (Cohort 1), as defined by
      the pre-specified cutoff, patients (a total of 111) will receive spartalizumab 400 mg every
      four weeks. A cohort of 30 patients with PD1-low advanced solid tumors where the efficacy of
      PD1 inhibitors has been previously established (i.e. with a FDA or EMA monotherapy indication
      approved) will also be recruited (cohort 2).

      One of the aims of the study is to show the value of the biomarker independently of the tumor
      histology. Thus, a wide variety of cancer-types (30 different types) will be represented.
