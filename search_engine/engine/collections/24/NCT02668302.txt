    
      This prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded trial aimed to assess the efficacy of a
      drug-eluting sinus implant placed following ethmoidectomy in addition to post-op standard of
      care, including debridement, irrigation, and topical steroids, compared to the same standard
      of care alone (control). Patients returned for follow-up examination at 2 weeks and again at
      1, 3 and 6 months after placement. Follow-up examination consisted of patient-reported
      outcomes and endoscopic grading by clinical investigators and an independent sinus surgeon
      based on a centralized, blinded video-endoscopy review.
