      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and recommended phase II dose of OGX-011 when
           administered with docetaxel in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent solid
           tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the effect of OGX-011 on serum clusterin levels and clusterin expression in
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells and accessible tumors.

        -  Assess objective response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of OGX-011. Patients are
      sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 treatment schedules.

        -  Schedule A: Patients receive OGX-011 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, and
           36 of course 1 and once weekly in weeks 1-6 of all subsequent courses. Patients also
           receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 1-5. Treatment repeats every 6
           weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Schedule B: Patients receive OGX-011 IV over 2 hours on days -7, -5, -3, 1, 8, and 15 of
           course 1 and days 1, 8, and 15 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive
           docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks (course 1 is 4 weeks
           in duration) for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of OGX-011 (in each schedule) until the
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is determined. The RPTD is defined as the dose preceding
      that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients undergo serum collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
