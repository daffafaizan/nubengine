      people. Despite their success, most implant patients are not able to communicate in noisy
      environments (e.g., in a restaurant). Communicating in noise still remains one of the biggest
      challenges in cochlear implants. Little is known about the factors that contribute to the
      poor performance of CI users in noise. In this project, we propose a series of experiments
      aimed at isolating these factors. We propose new programs that can be tailored for noisy
      situations.
