      patients presenting with knee pain, sometimes accompanied with swelling and loss of function.
      Many meniscal tears occur without a trauma in physically active individuals as well as in
      older people and could be a part of early osteoarthritis. Partial arthroscopic meniscectomy
      is the most common orthopaedic procedure and is used to treat patients with meniscal tears.
      Many patients report improvement after arthroscopy referring especially to reduced knee pain,
      better knee function and improved quality of life. However, similar results have also been
      obtained with conservative treatment (physical therapy) of patients with degenerative
      meniscal tears. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of arthroscopic
      partial meniscectomy for the treatment of degenerative tear of medial meniscus of the knee
      using a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial. The outcome of arthroscopic
      partial meniscectomy (vs. sham surgery) is assessed using the Lysholm knee score and pain at
      rest and activity (VAS) at 2, 6 and 12 months after the operation. In addition, the
      functional outcome is assessed using the WOMET knee score (a disease-specific quality of life
      -knee score development on the assessment of meniscal pathology), the general quality of life
      score (15-D), and cost-effectiveness analysis.
