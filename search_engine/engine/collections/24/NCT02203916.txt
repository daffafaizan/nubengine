      being tested to treat Korean adults with hypertension. This study will look at changes in
      blood pressure in people who take azilsartan medoxomil.

      The study will enroll approximately 325 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg

        -  Azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take two tablets at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Korea. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 12 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by
      telephone 7 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
