      surgery. This device usually delivers a mixture of red blood cell (RBC), fresh frozen plasma
      and normal saline. Rapid infusion of RBC is known to result in the increase of potassium and
      the decrease of calcium in the plasma of the patient. However there is no report about the
      consequence of rapid transfusion of the blood mixture in the reservoir of the FMS, especially
      in the liver transplantation recipients. The primary end point of this study is to
      investigate the change in the plasma potassium and to assess the possibility of hyperkalemia
      and related morbidity. Changes of blood pH and plasma calcium will also be sought.
