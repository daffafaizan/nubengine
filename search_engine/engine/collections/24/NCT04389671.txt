      associated acute lung injury who are being cared for in a critical care environment.

      Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant that, in its liquid form (SURFAXINÂ®), is approved by
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (NDA 021746) for the prevention of respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants at high risk for RDS.

      It has been studied in over 2000 children and adults. Preliminary data from animal and adult
      human studies indicate that lucinactant may be able to benefit those with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) in the context of COVID-19 infection, improving oxygenation and lung
      compliance. When given to intubated patients, Lucinactant could potentially decrease the
      duration of ventilation.

      Lucinactant has an extensive safety profile in different patient populations for different
      indications.

      It is hypothesized that lucinactant may improve the respiratory status of patients suffering
      from COVID-19.
