      650,000 new patients start dialysis each year. Furthermore, the number of patients receiving
      dialysis is increasing as access to dialysis in the developing world improves and the
      prevalence of diabetes and vascular disease rises. Despite technical advances in dialysis,
      the outcomes for patients with ESRD are poor. Patients have frequent hospitalizations, poor
      health related quality of life and strikingly, high mortality rates.

      The most common cause of death in patients receiving dialysis is cardiovascular disease,
      accounting for >40% of all deaths. Observational studies suggest a causal pathway to
      cardiovascular death that includes progressive ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation as well
      as accelerated atherosclerosis. These changes result in myocardial ischemia and cardiac
      fibrosis that, in turn, lead to heart failure, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Strongly
      implicated in this pathophysiology is aldosterone. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
      (MRAs) in non-ESRD patients, prevent cardiovascular deaths and small randomized controlled
      trials of MRAs in ESRD suggests they may reduce death and may be safe.

      Spironolactone is the most commonly used MRA worldwide. We will conduct a multicentre
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine if spironolactone reduces cardiac mortality
      and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients treated with dialysis. This trial is
      called the Aldosterone bloCkade for Health Improvement EValuation in End-stage renal disease
      (ACHIEVE).
