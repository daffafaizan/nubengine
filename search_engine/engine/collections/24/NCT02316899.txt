      comparative study is conducted using IBS-C patients as subjects to verify efficacy of ASP0456
      and examine the safety. After the 2-week bowel habit observation period, subjects satisfying
      the primary enrollment criteria are randomly allocated to either ASP0456 group or placebo
      group, and orally administered the drug or placebo once daily before breakfast for 12 weeks.

      <Period II (non-blind period)> A multicenter, collaborative, non-blind, non-controlled study
      is conducted to examine safety and efficacy of ASP0456 in long-term administration in IBS-C
      patients. After Period I, subjects satisfying the transfer criteria are orally administered
      ASP0456 once daily before breakfast for 40 weeks.
