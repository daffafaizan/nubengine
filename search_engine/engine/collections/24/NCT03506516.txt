    
      Hangover is the most commonly occurring morbidity associated with heavy drinking.

      Our aim was to test the hypothesis that mixing alcoholic drinks as compared to drinking one
      type of alcohol only (beer, wine or spirits) associate with a higher alcohol intake and worse
      hangover.
