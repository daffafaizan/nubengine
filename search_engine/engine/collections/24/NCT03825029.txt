      has an effect on the patients' pain-free range of movement, dislocation rates and
      satisfaction. However, the angles of the cup orientation (i.e. the tilt and rotation), which
      are preoperatively planned and postoperatively measured on radiographs, have a high
      variability even when an experienced surgeon is performing the surgery. One of the reasons
      this occurs is because the operated leg can move the pelvis to a different position in the
      time between set-up and actual implantation which may lead to the cup being placed in a
      non-optimal position. This study aims to see if the difference between planned and achieved
      cup angles and pelvic movement can be lessened by putting a pillow in between the legs to
      keep it in a stable horizontal position.
