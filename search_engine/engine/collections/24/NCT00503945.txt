      respectively, and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
      Therefore, cardiovascular consequences must be evaluated in the clinical management of OSAS
      and the study of cardiac functional parameters could be particularly useful. Reported
      findings are conflicting with respect to the influence of OSAS and nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (nCPAP) on left ventricular function. In this study, we assess cardiac
      dysfunction with echocardiographic parameters, such as LVEF, left ventricular mass, ratio of
      E to A (E/A) and mitral deceleration time (DT) from the mitral inflow velocity, and
      Tei-index, or plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level at baseline, and 1 and 3 months
      after nCPAP treatment. The main endpoint is the comparison of echocardiographic parameters
      and BNP between OSAS patients and control subjects, and the changes of them after short-term
      of nCPAP treatment.
