      characterized by loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue (lipoatrophy) that is more apparent in
      the limbs, face, and buttocks, or by accumulation of adipose tissue (lipohypertrophy) in the
      intra-abdominal cavity, the mid, upper back, and breasts. Lipodystrophy may also occur in a
      mixed form (lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy in the same patient).

      Participants made a single study visit. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was performed
      within 30 days of this study visit. In addition, routine visit clinical results, demographic
      data, disease data, comorbidities and concomitant medications were collected.
