      muscle invasive UTUC patients in several studies. This study is designed to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients with locally advanced
      upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) which are ineligible for cisplatin.
      Tislelizumab, an anti-programmed death protein-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, was engineered
      to minimize binding to FcÎ³R on macrophages to abrogate antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a
      mechanism of T-cell clearance and potential resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. The safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of tislelizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive urothelial
      carcinoma who progressed during/following platinum-containing therapy was proved in a phase 2
      trial (CTR20170071). This trial focuses on the efficacy of Tislelizumab to induce
      pathological down-staging of locally advanced UTUC in neoadjuvant setting.
