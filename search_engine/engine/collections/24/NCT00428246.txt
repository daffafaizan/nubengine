      improvement in oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function and subsequently
      ambulatory blood pressures and glomerular filtration rate. We will pursue our hypothesis by
      the three specific aims:

      Aim 1: To compare oxidative stress markers in patients treated with paricalcitol before and
      after the study. Aim 2: To measure endothelial function by flow mediated dilation in patients
      with chronic kidney disease before and after paricalcitol. Aim 3: To measure actigraphy
      guided ambulatory blood pressure and GFR in the absence of changes in anti-hypertensive
      medications in patients with chronic kidney disease.

      The study will be double blind randomized pilot trial in 24 patients with chronic kidney
      disease with 1:1:1 allocation to paricalcitol 1 microgram: paricalcitol 2 microgram: Placebo.
