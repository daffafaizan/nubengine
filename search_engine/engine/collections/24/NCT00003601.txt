      topical tretinoin with or without systemic fenretinide in patients with dysplastic nevi with
      personal or family history of cutaneous melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to
      personal history of cutaneous melanoma vs family history of cutaneous melanoma in at least 2
      blood relatives. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive topical tretinoin twice daily and oral fenretinide once a day for 6 months. Tretinoin
      is applied to one half of the back with the untreated side of the back serving as a matched
      control. Arm II: Patients receive topical tretinoin as in arm I twice daily and oral placebo
      once a day for 6 months. Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 38 patients accrued for this study.
