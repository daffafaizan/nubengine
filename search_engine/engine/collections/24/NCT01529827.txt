      I. To determine the transplant related mortality (TRM) of this reduced-intensity
      transplantation (RIT) combination, fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), melphalan, and TBI in
      a patient population usually not eligible for a full a myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical response, progression free survival (PFS) at one year, engraftment
      rate, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) incidence with the proposed RIT regimen across a
      variety of hematological conditions.

      II. Correlative studies will include chimerism analysis by molecular analysis and evaluation
      of immune reconstitution by cytomegalovirus (CMV) dextramer analysis using flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE: PREPARATIVE REGIMEN:

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2
      and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Patients undergo low-dose TBI twice daily (BID)
      on day -1.

      TRANSPLANTATION:

      Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.

      GvHD PROPHYLAXIS:

      Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) BID on days -1 to 100 with taper over 4-6
      months, MMF PO or IV every 6-8 hours on days -1 to 60, and methotrexate IV over 15-30 minutes
      on days 1, 3, and 6. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically.
