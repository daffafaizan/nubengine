      Pavlovian conditioning in human subjects. The general approach is to use whole brain
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to describe brain regions and circuits that
      contribute to the acquisition and performance of this form of learning. The specific aims of
      this proposal are:

        1. To identify brain regions that respond to aversive stimuli.

        2. To identify brain regions primarily responsible for the expression of cognitive and
           autonomic responses versus those involved in stimulus processing and memory encoding.

        3. To relate patterns of activity within selected brain areas to implicit versus explicit
           memory performance.

        4. To compare the parallel development of implicit and explicit knowledge about stimulus
           relationships during Pavlovian delay and trace fear conditioning.

        5. To test specific predictions regarding the nature of learning-related activity in the
           amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex as they develop during
           conditioning and to integrate these findings into a more general theoretical
           understanding of memory phenomena in humans.
