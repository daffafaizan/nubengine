      and if you choose to continue on, we will randomize you (like a flip of a coin) to receive
      either 12 weeks of case management combined with problem solving therapy (CM-PST) with a
      social worker or 12 weeks of self-guided problem solving therapy (SG-PST) with support from a
      senior peer counselor.

      As part of your participation in the study you will participate in three 1.5 hour assessment
      interviews of psychological and neuropsychological functioning (similar to your screening
      assessment) prior to your first week of treatment (baseline), two weeks after your final
      session (week 14), and three months after your final session (week 24). Additionally, you
      will participate in three shorter assessment interviews of psychological functioning, which
      will be conducted at weeks 3 and 6. These assessments will take approximately 30-45 minutes.
