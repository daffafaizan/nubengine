      urinary excretion of oxalate as measured in 24-h urine collections. The investigators further
      hypothesize that the concentration of oxalate in dietary supplements may not be associated
      with urinary oxalate excretion, suggesting that other nutritional components of the
      supplements may be exerting an influence over oxalate biosynthesis, oxalate absorption in the
      gastrointestinal tract, and/or renal oxalate handling. These other factors include the form
      of oxalate in the supplement (water- vs. non water-soluble) and the supplement's
      concentration of ascorbic acid.
