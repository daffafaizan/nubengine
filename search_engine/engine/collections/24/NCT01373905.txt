      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) therapy should be started as early as possible to
      avoid lung damage by high pressures, volumes and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).
      Recruitment is a strategy aiming at re-expanding the collapsed lung tissue and then
      maintaining an adequate level of PEEP to prevent subsequent de-recruitment. The objective of
      this study was to compare safety and efficacy of two lung recruitment maneuvers (RM):
      stepwise PEEP elevation with determination of the alveolar collapsing pressure versus
      sustained lung inflation in ARDS patients
