      abstraction dates may be different across institutions due to contracting and other
      logistical issues, to avoid seeing biased outcomes that may be related to this type of
      heterogeneity, a consistent study end date will be imposed for all patients when conducting
      the analysis. Information before this study end date will be analyzed and used to conduct the
      analysis.
