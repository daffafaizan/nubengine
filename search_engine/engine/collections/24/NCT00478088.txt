      use following a discectomy. Implantation of the device will result in artificial replacement
      of a pathologically damaged or surgically removed cervical disc. Use of the device also
      obviates the need to harvest bone graft from the patient's iliac crest, a common and painful
      part of current surgical techniques.

      The NeoDisc is indicated for cervical spinal arthroplasty in skeletally mature subjects with
      symptomatic cervical disc disease at one level from C3 to C7. Symptomatic cervical disc
      disease is defined as image-confirmed herniated disc, spondylosis, and/or loss of disc
      height, with functional neurological deficit (i.e., exhibits at least one sign associated
      with cervical level to be treated, including abnormal reflex, decreased motor strength,
      abnormal dermatome sensitivity, or pain in a dermatomal distribution).
