      patients with metastatic esophageal cancer, without adding significant toxicity. The
      non-overlapping toxicity profiles may allow the administration of the maximum tolerated doses
      for both agents without additive toxicities with the goal of demonstrating synergistic
      clinical activity. This combination has been previously tested in two studies for other
      malignancies with good tolerance and encouraging results.
