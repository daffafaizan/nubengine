    
      At the Baseline visit (28 ± 7 days prior to Day 1), participants receive a single IV
      injection of prestudy FIX over 10 (±5) minutes in the clinic under medical supervision at a
      dose of 50 IU/kg. A washout period with no FIX treatment is required prior to administration
      of prestudy FIX and prior to rFIXFc. A PK assessment is done with prestudy FIX and also done
      with rFIXFc on Day 1. After completing the PK assessments, participants begin weekly
      prophylactic treatment with rFIXFc for approximately 50 weeks, to obtain 50 EDs. One ED is
      defined as a 24-hour period in which a participant received 1 or more doses of rFIXFc, with
      the time of the first injection of rFIXFc defined as the start of the ED.
