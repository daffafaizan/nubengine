      based on clinical presentation, barium swallow, EGD and a swallow test to rule out other
      possible disorders causing cervical dysphagia. A scoring system (Costamagna, GIE, 2016) is
      used to evaluate severity of the symptoms. Four symptoms are evaluated: 1) dysphagia, 2)
      regurgitation, 3) daytime respiratory symptoms and 4) nighttime respiratory symptoms. These
      are scored based on a solid food diet according to the symptom frequency calculated within 2
      consecutive weeks: 0-never, 1-1day/ week, 2-2~4days/ week, 3-â‰¥5 days/ week. Under EGD and
      barium swallow test, configuration of the diverticulum is documented in detail (Shou-Jiang
      Tang, Laryngoscope, 2008). Quality of life is assessed using the SF-36 form. The pre- and
      post-STESD symptom score, quality of life score, and diverticulum configuration are compared.

      Adverse events are recorded and graded according to the system suggested by the ASGE workshop
      (Cotton, GIE, 2010).
