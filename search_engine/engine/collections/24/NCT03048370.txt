      dysfunction and we are not aware of any data that exists on the range of responses to caloric
      vestibular stimulation (CVS) in persons with schizophrenia. Initial data from another CVS
      study from our group suggests individuals with schizophrenia have greater reactivity to body
      temperature (37°C) CVS, as measured by the peak slow phase velocity of the resulting
      nystagmus (PSPV), than would be expected from individuals without schizophrenia versus
      healthy participants. Intriguingly, CVS at 37°C should not theoretically produce a
      significant vestibulocular reflex response due to the stimulus' approximation to body
      temperature. Hence, the primary aim of this study is to determine if individuals with
      schizophrenia will have greater vestibular reactivity, as measured by nystagmus PSPV, to CVS
      in comparison with healthy participants. The secondary aim is to assess illness awareness pre
      and post CVS administration in attempts to replicate our previous observation. A total of 20
      patients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy control participants will be recruited. All
      participants will receive three conditions bilaterally: (1) body temperature (37°C)
      vestibular stimulation; (2) warm CVS (44°C), and (3) cold CVS (30°C).
