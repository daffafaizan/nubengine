      Caudal block has been described to decrease postoperative pain in this type of surgery.
      Ultrasound is a tool that facilitates its performance and increases the rate of a successful
      block.

      Objective:

      To determine the usefulness of ultrasound guided caudal block in anesthesia and postoperative
      analgesia in patients scheduled for benign anal surgery. Methods : Interventional study in
      adult patients that received ultrasound caudal anesthetic block before benign anal surgery.
      The investigators evaluated analgesic efficacy of this intervention by mean of numeric rating
      scale ( NRS) for pain after 6, 12 and 24 hours of surgery, rescue analgesia, motor block,
      urinary retention, surgical conditions and patient satisfaction in postoperative period.
