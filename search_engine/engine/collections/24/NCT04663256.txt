      short-term and long-term memory; 10 minutes of language skills, including vocabulary,
      comprehension, reading and writing exercises; 10 minutes of calculation, in which arithmetic,
      similar and different operations are carried out; 10 minutes of praxis and gnosis where
      drawing and recognition and auditory, tactile, spatial, visual attention were promoted; 10
      minutes of orientation where knowledge of space, person and place is developed; and 10
      minutes of executive functions in which exercises of organization, planning and problem
