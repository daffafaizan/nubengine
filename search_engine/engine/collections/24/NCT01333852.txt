      paclitaxel in patients that failed to curative-intent treatment for Head-and neck neoplasms.

      Patients eligible for this protocol will be randomized to paclitaxel 175mg/m2 plus metformin
      or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end-point is
      disease control (complete response, partial response or stable disease, according to RECIST
      1.1) in the 12th week. Secondary end-points are PFS, OS, response rate and safety. Molecular
      markers in samples collected before and under treatment will be tested for correlation with
      clinical outcomes.
