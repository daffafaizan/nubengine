      and inter-fraction changes) to be obtained from this study would allow the research team to
      determine how Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) should be performed for a given tumor
      site/type. Radiation oncologists then can choose a proper ART strategy for a given tumor type
      to account for the anatomic/biological intra- and inter-fraction changes, improving accuracy
      of radiation therapy delivery, and in turn reducing treatment related toxicities and/or
      improving tumor local control.
