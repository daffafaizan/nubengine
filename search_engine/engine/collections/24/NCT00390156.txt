      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib when given together with bevacizumab
           and metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with refractory metastatic solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effects of cyclophosphamide and bevacizumab on imatinib pharmacokinetics.

        -  Determine if patients treated with this regimen achieve plasma levels of
           cyclophosphamide that are predicted to be antiangiogenic.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on the number of circulating endothelial cells,
           endothelial progenitor cells, activated endothelial cells, and circulating tumor cells.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on parameters measured by CT scan perfusion (e.g.,
           regional blood flow, blood volume, permeability-surface area product, and mean transit
           time).

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, pilot, dose-escalation study of imatinib.

      Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide and oral imatinib once daily on days 1-28 and
      bevacizumab IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
