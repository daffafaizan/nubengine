    
      For lesions that cannot heal spontaneously, the wound is excised until fascia. Four
      contiguous dermal substrates (uncellularised and cellularised) are randomly grafted on each
      symmetric area.

      A primary siliconized dressing will cover the wound. Secondary dressing: dressing gauze
      impregnated with physiologic serum and/or sterile dried dressing gauze, the whole is
      maintained by a (slightly compressive) tubular or elastic bandage.

      Thin skin meshed autograft will occur 14 to 21 days after dermal substrate cellularised LG002
      or uncellularised LG002 grafting (time frame necessary for the site to vascularize).

      Meshed autograft development must be identical in both symmetric areas, for one single
      patient.
