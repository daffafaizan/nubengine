      treatment of bladder dysfunction in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

      STUDY POPULATION Twenty (20) participants aged 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with
      Multiple Sclerosis and lower urinary tract symptoms will be treated with Alfuzosin.

      DESIGN This is a single institution, non-randomized, non-blinded pilot study of the use of
      Alfuzosin in the treatment of bladder dysfunction in MS patients. After the initial screening
      visit patients will be given 10 mg of Alfuzosin to be taken daily once daily.

      STUDY INSTRUMENTS The primary end points of this study are a reduction in the ICIQ
      questionnaires and improvement in uroflow, post-void residual (PVR) and voiding diaries. All
      patients will have a detailed history and physical examination at the beginning of the study
      and at 12 weeks follow-up. Women will have a pregnancy test at the beginning of the study.
      Participants will be given the ICIQ questionnaires, uroflow and PVR at the screening visit
      and at week 6 and 12. In addition, these patients will be asked to maintain a three day
      voiding diary prior to week 2 and week 12. Assessments for safety (blood pressure and heart
      rate) will be collected at baseline and at the last visit. Blood tests will be performed to
      check for liver, kidney and prostate problems at the baseline visit. Adverse events will be
      recorded at all visits and when spontaneously reported by the study participants.

      DURATION OF STUDY The study will be 12 weeks in duration.
