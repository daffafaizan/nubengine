      irreversible gut failure, especially for those with total parenteral nutrition complications,
      inability to adapt to quality-of-life limitations posed by intestinal failure, and high risk
      of death if the native gut is not removed. Endoscopy provides the quickest method for
      assessing the overall health of graft mucosa and is essential in obtaining specimens from
      large areas for histologic evaluation, which continues to remain the gold standard for a
      diagnosis of rejection. Recently, the use of zoom videoendoscopy has been reported as a
      better evaluation of intestinal mucosa than the use of a standard endoscope. Acute cellular
      rejection in short-term follow-up, appears with acute and dramatic clinical symptoms (fever,
      vomiting, nausea, increased stomal output/diarrhea, abdominal pain, and distension), so that
      it is rarely predictable with surveillance.

      Comparison of endoscopic and histo-pathologic findings should be performed.
