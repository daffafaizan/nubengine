      early clinical data. However, since bone loss typically appears after 5-year follow-up, the
      reduction in the incidence and extent of bone loss among total hip replacement patients with
      crosslinked Marathon liners, compared to those with standard Enduron liners, has not been as
      dramatic as the wear reduction. Despite the substantial reduction in wear that we observed at
      5-year follow-up, the patients' perceptions of their outcomes remained similar among the
      Marathon and Enduron groups. This study will evaluate outcome at a minimum of 10-years after
      surgery among the same group of patients whose outcome was previously reported at 5-year
      follow-up. At 10-year follow-up, we anticipate that the reduction in wear associated with
      Marathon polyethylene will be associated with significant reductions in bone loss when
      compared to the Enduron polyethylene.
