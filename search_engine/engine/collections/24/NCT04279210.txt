      Score (OABSS), International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence
      Short Form (ICIQ-UI), Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory 6 (POPDI-6), Female Sexual

      Questionnaire, Short Form (IIQ-7), pelvic examination, and urodynamic study (UDS) (including

      10 milliliter blood was taken from each participant. The RegenKit-THT (RegenLab SA,
      Switzerland) was used to separation of plasma and blood cells. 3 milliliter PRP was extracted
      from the bottom of the plasma. PRP was injected into anterior vaginal wall, near external
      urethral sphincter, and into endopelvic fascia. The participants received one treatment per
      month for three times. Follow-up schedule is as below: 1st month (transperineal ultrasound
      and questionnaires), 3rd month (UDS and questionnaires), 6th month (questionnaires), and 12th
      month (questionnaires).
