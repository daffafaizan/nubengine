      to assess changes in glycemic control in patients with diabetes who undergo per-oral
      pyloromyotomy (POP) for medically refractory gastroparesis. The study cohort will consist of
      40 patients with poor glycemic control who undergo POP. The investigators propose a
      prospective cohort study using CGM to compare glycemic profiles before and after POP in
      patients with diabetic gastroparesis. The investigators hypothesize that patients will have
      improvement in glycemic control and reduced variation in blood glucose levels (% time in
      hypo/hyperglycemia) after undergoing POP. These results will aid in clinical decision making,
      and may indicate an earlier need for endoscopic intervention in patients with uncontrolled
      diabetes and gastroparesis.
