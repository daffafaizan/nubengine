      The study want to find the determination of precise location of the focus and mechanisms
      involved constitutes a challenge for conventional electrophysiology, even with tridimensional
      systems, because of the time needed for accurate delineation of the location (due to the
      sometimes unfrequent Ventricular Premature Beats (VPB)) and to the insufficient mapping
      density or inadequate signal characteristics. The Rhythmia system could allow better
      determination of the focus location in relation to the anatomical structures, especially with
      unfrequent VPB, because of the available high density mapping due to the number of closed
      high-resolution electrodes located on the Orion catheter. Better delineation of the true
      focus origin and of the mechanisms involved (automaticity vs re-entry) may be of useful help
      for better understanding and efficient therapy.
