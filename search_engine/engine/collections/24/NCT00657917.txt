    
      Up to 10 volunteers, who are military health care beneficiaries, with a diagnosis of Old
      World cutaneous leishmaniasis who have failed pentavalent antimony or are not eligible to be
      treated with pentavalent antimony, will be treated with WR 279,396 (topical
      paromomycin-gentamicin-AQIC) twice a day for 20 days. Primary endpoint will be the appearance
      of complete epithelialization of each skin lesion by Day 50+/-2 weeks, or estimated 50%-99%
      re-epithelialization by Day 50+/-2 weeks followed by complete epithelialization by Day
      100+/-2 weeks,with both categories without relapse by Day 180+/-30 days. Efficacy will be
      evaluated by clinical appearance assessed by study investigator and documented with
      photographs of the treated skin lesions. Toxicity will be evaluated by local adverse
      reactions and by laboratory signs of systemic toxicity.
