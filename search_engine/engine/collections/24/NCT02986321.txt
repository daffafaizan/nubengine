    
      This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo and active controlled
      multinational, multicenter, dose ranging, 6-arm parallel-group study to identify the optimal
      dose of CHF6001, PDE4 inhibitor under development, with respect to lung functions and
      symptoms.

      After a 2-wk run-in period under formoterol (Oxis TurbohalerÂ®) and rescue salbutamol prn,
      patients will be randomized to one of the 6 treatment groups. After the randomization,
      patients will be assessed after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks of treatment at clinic/hospital. A
      follow-up visit will be performed 12 days after the last visit.

      During the study, patients will report daily symptoms with the EXACT-PRO/E-RS questionnaire,
      rescue/background medication use and compliance with the study medications. AEs, SAEs and
      COPD exacerbations will be monitored throughout the study. At randomization and subsequent
      visits, patients will undergo physical and vital signs examinations, spirometry measurement,
      12-lead ECG. Symptoms and Health status will be assessed through validated questionnaires.
      Routine lab analysis and blood biomarkers will be done.
