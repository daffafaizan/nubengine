      comorbidities. Still, there are questions as to the frequency of long-term adverse effects:
      the prevalence and causes of post-operative swallowing disorders and reflux disease are
      uncertain. Recently, independent study groups described a high incidence of Barrett
      oesophagus post LSG. Additional research is urgently needed.

      The goal of this trial is to examine long-term effects of laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB)
      and sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on oesophageal symptoms and disease, including the presence of
      Barrett oesophagus â‰¥ 5 years post-surgery.
