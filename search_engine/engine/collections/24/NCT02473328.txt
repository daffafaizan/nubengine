    
      Protease inhibitors (PIs) are key treatments in the current therapeutic strategy. They have
      major qualities such as their antiviral potency and high genetic barrier.

      However, their long-term use is associated with gastrointestinal side effects, metabolic
      disorders (lipid, carbohydrate, lipohypertrophy) and cardiovascular comorbidities, renal and
      bone. The decrease in IP doses would reduce this predominantly concentration-dependent
      toxicity.

      Atazanavir (Reyataz) was the first protease inhibitor once daily approved in 2003 for the
      treatment of HIV patients. Its favorable safety profile, ease of making and effectiveness
      have made treatment widely used and recommended first line. Atazanavir is recommended in
      Europe in naïve patient at the 300 mg dose once daily boosted with ritonavir 100 mg and in
      the pretreated patient at the 300 mg boosted with 100mg ritonavir or a dose of 400 no boosted
      mg in combination with two other antiretroviral drugs.

      After oral administration, atazanavir is rapidly absorbed with improved variable
      bioavailability with food intake (40% increase in Cmin) and dependent on the gastric
      potential hydrogen (pH). Atazanavir is highly bound to plasma proteins (86%) and is largely
      metabolised by the isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) cytochrome P450. There is great variability in the
      pharmacokinetics of atazanavir between patients due to inter-individual variability in the
      expression and function of CYP3A4. Co-administration of ritonavir increased 11.9 times Cmin
      and decreases the interindividual variability. The major effect of ritonavir is to decrease
      hepatic clearance of atazanavir. Its half-life of elimination is 8.6 hours when administered
      at 300 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir. 90% inhibitory concentration of atazanavir adjusted to
      the plasma protein binding (PBA EC90) is 14ng / ml. At the standard dose of 300 mg taken with
      100 mg ritonavir once daily, the mean trough concentration at steady state is according to
      research from 526 ng / ml and 862 ng / ml in HIV patients. Residual therapeutic levels (Cmin)
      must be greater than 150 ng / ml. The relationship between the residual plasma concentrations
      and virologic response was demonstrated in the naive patient pharmacokinetic substudy BMS
      089.

      If the inhibitor atazanavir is best tolerated on lipid map protease is responsible for
      specific side effects such as hyperbilirubinemia and nephrolithiasis, concentration-dependent
      side effects. Indeed, atazanavir is responsible for a reversible elevation of unconjugated
      bilirubin, inhibiting glucuronide conjugation bilirubin by UGT1A1. This effect, not easily
      concealed by the patient, is an important and annoying side effects that may interfere with
      treatment adherence. This hyperbilirubinemia is concentration-dependent, with elevated
      bilirubin most common grade 3-4, atazanavir C min is greater than 760 ng / ml (600 to 850 ng
      / ml according to studies).

      No boosted atazanavir may be used but with caution. Indeed, its use should be avoided in
      patients with a history of failure or virological resistance mutations in a patient with poor
      adherence and in patients taking other drugs that could interfere with atazanavir.
      Pharmacokinetic studies at a dose of 400 mg without ritonavir showed a concentration below
      the expected minimum concentration of 150 mg / l in 60% of cases. In addition, the use of no
      boosted atazanavir with tenofovir has been little studied and requires close monitoring
      pharmacological given the interaction between these two molecules (decrease of approximately
      25% of the concentration of atazanavir when without ritonavir in combination with tenofovir.
      Finally, in the INDUMA study, there was no virologic rebounds in this strategy.

      Monotherapy atazanavir is not recommended in light of studies showing virological failures
      under this strategy.

      The evaluation of atazanavir / r 200/100 in healthy patient presented at CROI meeting in 2001
      in Phase II studies showed a mean Cmin 378 ng / ml (SD = 286 EC).

      A retrospective cohort study in 14 Thai patients with virologic success in switched to
      atazanavir / r 200/100 showed maintenance of a CV less than 50 copies / ml over a median
      follow-up 68 weeks (range 12-165 weeks). Five of the patients had a dose of atazanavir Cmin
      had greater than 150 ng / ml (mean Cmin = 572 ng / ml). The lipid profile was improved but
      not significantly.

      A pharmacokinetic study of 22 Thai patients on atazanavir / r 300/100 in switched to
      atazanavir / r 200/100 2 NRTIs showed minimum concentrations reduced by 48.6% remaining above
      the minimum therapeutic concentration of 150 ng / ml (mean Cmin = 700 ng / ml EC = 470).

      A case study conducted in 14 Italian patients (10 Caucasian and 4 of African origin) with
      virologic suppression (CV below 50 copies / ml) with atazanavir / r 300/100 mg + 2 NRTI
      showed a maintenance of viral efficacy after the switch to atazanavir / r 200/100 on a 1 year
      average follow-up. Atazanavir C min was above Cmin for all except 2 patients (whose viral
      load remained below 50 copies / ml), with a mean Cmin 713ng / ml. Bilirubin decreased after
      the switch.

      Recently, a pharmacokinetic simulation study was performed in a majority of Caucasian
      patients for atazanavir / r doses at 300/50 mg, 200/50 mg and 200/100 mg. The lowest
      concentrations of atazanavir after dose reduction 200/100 averaged 520 ng / ml (EC = 448) and
      all remained above the recommended Cmin.

      In total, these four dose reduction studies of atazanavir / r 200/100 in
      treatment-experienced patients with virologic average Cmin were between 520 and 713ng / ml,
      well above the therapeutic Cmin.

      The decrease in atazanavir dose showed a significant decrease of serum bilirubin 14.88μmol /
      l after 2 weeks.

      This test is within the overall reflection optimization of antiretroviral therapy.

      In view of the existing data of Pharmacology and few data Italian and Thai in switched
      patients to atazanavir / r 200/100 mg, the ATALOW study hypothesizes that a lower dose of
      atazanavir / r 200 / 100 mg is able to maintain an undetectable viral load in
      treatment-experienced patients with virologic success.

      The expected benefits of the reduction in the dose of atazanavir / r 200/100 mg + would be:

        -  A better tolerance especially in terms of bilirubin

        -  A more robust strategy that using no boosted atazanavir with the possibility of using
           tenofovir in combination NRTI.

        -  The same simplicity taking once a day

        -  Reduced costs (2,730 euros less per patient per year).
