      lower peripheral blood flow and consequently lower walking speed. The main aim of the study
      is to verify if the peripheral muscular blood flow in the elderly is different between
      patients with and without decrease in inspiratory muscle strength. As secondary objectives,
      it will be evaluated the correlation between inspiratory muscle strength and gait speed and
      quality of life, as well as gait speed and peripheral muscle blood flow. Fifty elderly
      patients of both sexes, over 65 years, from Vila Mariana Einstein Outpatient Clinic and Cora
      Residencial Senior, will be included to evaluate Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (Pimáx),
      Maximum Expiratory Pressure (Pemáx), Spirometry (FVC, PF, FEV1), 4.6m Walk Test, Quality of
      life for the elderly (WHOQOL old), Mini Mental Test, Body Mass Index (BMI) and peripheral
      muscle blood flow by venous occlusion plethysmography.
