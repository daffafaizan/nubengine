      disease as no medical treatment for Cushing's disease was approved at the time of the study
      initiation. The study population consisted of patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing's
      disease or patients with de novo Cushing's disease that were not considered candidates for
      pituitary surgery (poor surgery candidates, surgically unapproachable tumor, patients with no
      visible pituitary tumor, patients who refused surgery). A confirmed Cushing's disease
      diagnosis was required.
