      indications from healthy and cooperative children between the ages of 4-15, were included in
      this study. Teeth were divided into three groups according to the materials used for pulp
      capping. Indirect pulp treatment was applied using Dycal for 91 teeth, ProRoot MTA for 89
      teeth and TheraCal LC for 115 teeth. Primary molars were restored with the compomer material,
      and permanent molars were restored with the resin composite material. Restorations were
      evaluated with the Modified United States Public Health Service (modified USPHS) criteria.
      Clinical and radiographic findings were evaluated for 24 months at follow-up.
