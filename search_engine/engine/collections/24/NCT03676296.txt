    
      Objectives: To assess the effect of puerarin supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk
      factors in men.

      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trial of
      12-week puerarin supplementation.

      Study subjects: 234 Hong Kong Chinese men aged 18-50 years without a history of
      cardiovascular disease.

      Intervention: After assessing eligibility, all participants will be randomized to take a
      puerarin supplement in granules (90.2 mg daily) or a placebo, followed by a 4-week wash-out
      period, after which participants will be crossed over to the other intervention.

      Primary outcomes: Lipid profile (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides).

      Secondary outcomes: Cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as blood pressure and fasting
      glucose, as well as some potential mediating pathways, such as testosterone.

      Methods: An intention to treat analysis will be used, assuming no changes in baseline value
      for missing follow up values. Differences in outcomes between supplementation and placebo
      within participants will be compared using a paired t-test, after checking for the
      possibility of a carryover effect.

      Expected results: The short-term effect of puerarin on cardiovascular disease risk factors in
      men will be obtained so as to confirm or refute previous trials usually with small sample
      sizes that suggest puerarin may improve lipid profile and reduce testosterone. The findings
      will also add evidence about the effects of puerarin on other potentially relevant risk
      factors, such as blood pressure, fasting glucose and testosterone, as well as some related
      biomarkers.
