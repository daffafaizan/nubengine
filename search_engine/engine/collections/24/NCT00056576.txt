      synchronous discharges from cerebral neurons. Seizures may be triggered by various causes
      such as CNS infections, fever, tumors, toxins, vascular disease, degenerative disease,
      trauma, or may be idiopathic. The type of seizure is usually defined by the initial event,
      the duration, alterations of consciousness, patterns of motor activity, and post-ictal
      symptoms. In addition, certain seizure types have characteristic EEG patterns. The
      International Classification of Epileptic Seizures classifies seizures as partial or
      generalized. Partial seizures are further classified as simple partial, complex partial
      (impaired consciousness), or partial seizures secondarily generalized. All partial seizures
      have onset in a discrete cortical region. Generalized seizures are bilaterally symmetrical
      and without focal onset and include absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, clonic seizures,
      tonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and atonic seizures. The goals of treatment include
      the prevention of seizures, medical management of seizures, and management of the
      consequences of epilepsy. The study will be conducted with patients who have new onset
      epilepsy characterized by complex partial seizures and will attempt to characterize the
      relationship between zonisamide dose and seizure prevention and demonstrate monotherapy
      efficacy.
