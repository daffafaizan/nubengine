    
      It has been recently shown that respiratory system reactance (Xrs) obtained by the forced
      oscillation technique (FOT) at 5 Hz is more reliable than dynamic compliance for assessing
      lung collapse and the effects of lung RMs in a porcine ALI model ( Ref.1,2).

      Specifically, Xrs (and its derived variable CX5, the oscillatory compliance at 5 Hz)
      identifies the minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level required to maintain
      lung recruitment with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, it has been recently
      demonstrated that Xrs may be used to identify the lowest level of PEEP able to prevent
      atelectasis and that PEEP setting strategy based on maximizing Xrs is able to limit lung
      injury compared to oxygenation-based approach in a porcine lavage model of lung injury. (

      Recently, at the biomedical engineering department of Politecnico di Milano measurements of
      chest wall displacement have been successfully performed by means of an optical sensor
      realized using a laser self-mixing interferometer (LIR). The advantage of this approach is
      that it is contact-less, that by deflecting the laser been it is possible to scan any region
      of the chest wall surface and that it allows to measure also low-frequency vibrations.

      Protocol

        1. The baseline pulmonary function will be assessed by spirometry before surgery.

        2. Just before surgery measurements of oscillatory mechanics will be performed at the
           following stages:

             -  awake patient

             -  spontaneous ventilation through the laryngeal mask after induction of anesthesia

             -  pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) after the administration of neuromuscular
                blocking agent and intubation and PEEP 0 cmH2O

             -  PCV with PEEP 5 cmH2O

             -  Recruitment maneuver (RM) (peak pressure 30 cmH2O and PEEP 15 cmH2O) for 2 minutes

             -  PCV with PEEP 5 cmH2O after RM

      At each stage the following measurements will be performed:

        -  Input impedance at 5-11-19 Hz by FOT

        -  the movements of the chest wall assessed by laser interferometry (LIR) applying two
           different stimulating waveforms: 5-11-19 Hz and 100 Hz

        -  functional residual capacity (FRC)

        -  arterial blood gas measurement (ABG)
