      potential of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes among susceptible youth. Participants will rate
      the flavor intensity, coolness, sweetness, and irritation experienced using validated rating
      scales. Sixty youth (16-20 years of age) who have experimented with e-cigarettes and are not
      regular users will participate in 3 laboratory sessions, separated by at least 24 hrs. They
      will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 nicotine concentrations (0, 3 or 12 mg/ml) during each
      of the three sessions; during each session they will be exposed, in random order, to sweet
      (strawberry, vanilla) and tobacco flavors, with and without menthol, combined with the
      assigned session nicotine concentration.
