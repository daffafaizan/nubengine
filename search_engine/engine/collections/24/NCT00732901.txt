    
      Specific Aim 1: We will test the hypothesis that cocaine-dependent subjects will exhibit
      greater impulsivity than controls as determined by a battery of impulsivity measures and that
      impulsivity will be associated with specific profiles of 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression in
      platelets. We predict that treatment of cocaine-dependent subjects with escitalopram and/or
      mirtazapine will reduce impulsivity and cocaine-positive urines, in concert with a normalized
      balance of platelet 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression.

      Specific Aim 2: We will test the hypothesis that cocaine-dependent subjects will exhibit
      greater cue reactivity than controls as determined by a modified Stroop task, and that cue
      reactivity will be associated with specific profiles of 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression in
      platelets. We predict that treatment of cocaine-dependent subjects with escitalopram and/or
      mirtazapine will reduce cue reactivity and cocaine-positive urines, in concert with a
      normalized balance of platelet 5-HT2AR and/or 5-HT2CR expression.

      Specific Aim 3: We will test the hypothesis that specific polymorphisms in the 5-HT2AR and/or
      5-HT2CR will predict baseline impulsivity and/or cue reactivity as well as treatment response
      to serotonergic medications in cocaine-dependent subjects.
