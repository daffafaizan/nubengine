    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits and the safety of treatment
      with pirfenidone compared to placebo in subjects with FHP.

      STUDY SUMMARY This study will include about 40 subjects at National Jewish Health. This is a
      "double-blind study" which means neither the subject nor the study staff will know if the
      subject is getting pirfenidone or placebo during the study. This is done to be sure that no
      one knows who is getting pirfenidone or placebo and the effects of the treatment can be
      measured objectively, without bias. Subject's that enroll in this study will have an equal
      chance of getting pirfenidone or placebo. The decision about which treatment the subject will
      receive (randomization) is made through a central organization.

      Subjects in the study will receive either pirfenidone (2403 mg every day) or placebo capsules
      (a safe, inactive substance that will look the same as the pirfenidone capsules). Both the
      placebo and pirfenidone will be supplied in opaque, hard, white gelatin capsules and will be
      taken as 3 capsules by mouth, 3 times a day (a total of 9 capsules per day) and should be
      taken with food.

      Subjects who participate in this study will be asked to take the capsules as prescribed every
      day for 52 weeks (12 months).
