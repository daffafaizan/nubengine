      dynamic condition, its monitoring is important to predict long term outcome and to determine
      treatment plan.

      The reference of standard to diagnose hepatic fibrosis is biopsy, but recently non-invasive
      method such as stiffness imaging has been drawing a lot of attention. In this study,
      ultrasound shear wave elastography will be performed and its diagnostic performance to detect
      advanced hepatic fibrosis (= > F2) will be measured using histologic grade as a reference.
