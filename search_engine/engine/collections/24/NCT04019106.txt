    
      Premature infants of gestational age less than 29 weeks with respiratory distress syndrome
      and clinical indication for surfactant administration will be recruited for this Phase I/II
      open-label study.

      A total of 30 subjects will be recruited from 2 neonatal intensive care units:

        1. Children's Hospital-Health Sciences Centre (HSC), Winnipeg

        2. St. Boniface General Hospital, Winnipeg, MB

      3 groups of 10 infants each will receive single dose of intratracheal budesonide (0.0625
      mg/kg, 0.125 mg/kg, and 0.25 mg/kg) with BLES surfactant (5 ml/kg). PK/PD analysis will be
      done using clinical parameters, serum biomarkers, tracheal aspirate biomarkers and plasma
      budesonide levels obtained at fixed intervals.

      The duration of subject participation will involve 12-17 weeks for the clinical intervention,
      depending on gestational age at birth and discharge date. Participants will be followed until
      40 weeks or discharge, whichever comes first.
