    
      This is a prospective, randomized, open label study on the efficacy of octreotide lar as
      maintenance treatment after first-line chemotherapy for patients with unresectable or
      metastatic gastro-entero-pancreatic or esophageal neuroendocrine carcinomas.The patients with
      unresectable or metastatic GEP or esophageal NEC who got CR/PR/SD after chemotherapy with IP
      or EP regimen qualified with the inclusion criteria are enrolled. All the patients enrolled
      in our study will be randomly assigned to receive octreotide LAR (group A) as maintenance
      treatment or follow up (group B) to disease progression. Treatment will be discontinued on
      withdrawal of patient consent, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, a treatment delay
      of >2 weeks, or major protocol violations, after which patients were followed up every 3
      months for a minimum of 12 months.
