      gradually increasing. About 300,000 children aged 0 to 19 are diagnosed with cancer each
      year, according to the international study where the International Agency for Research on
      Cancer collected data on neoplasms (malignant and non-malignant) diagnosed in individuals
      under 20 years of age between 2001-2010.

      Most studies on children who survive cancer show that the disease and its treatment have side
      effects and long-term late effects on the musculoskeletal system, physical function, gait and
      cognitive skills. According to the study of Beulertz et al. (2016), active ankle dorsiflexion
      limitation, gait disturbances and decrease in walking efficiency were observed in all
      pediatric oncology patients, which have an important role in walking, not limited to children
      with bone tumors and central nervous system tumors.Intensive chemotherapy (eg methotrexate)
      and the use of radiation are thought to cause damage to cortical and subcortical white
      matter, resulting in late effects. Symptoms consistent with attention deficit disorder and
      mental processing speed, working memory, executive function and memory deficits put cancer
      survivors at an intellectual and academic disadvantage.

      Therefore, dual task gait performance, in which cognitive and motor tasks are performed
      simultaneously, may be affected in pediatric oncology patients. The aim of this study is to
      compare gait performance in single and dual task conditions in pediatric oncology patients
      with healthy controls.
