      in managing post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the burn patient. Cranial Electrotherapy
      Stimulation (CES) is the delivery of low-level electrical stimulation across the head,
      delivered with ear lobe electrode clips or self-adhesive electrode pads. CES in the current
      form has been used for the past 30 years to successfully treat anxiety, depression, insomnia
      and pain in a variety of patient populations. This FDA approved medical device is
      non-invasive and has no reported significant side effects. It will be used on patients
      undergoing outpatient rehabilitation in our burn center.
