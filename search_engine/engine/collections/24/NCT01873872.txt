      who agree to participate, will be given one of two different probiotics, or placebo. Data
      will be gathered during their hospitalization, and at one and three months following hospital
      discharge. We expect to see a lower incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in
      the probiotic groups when compared to the placebo group. We will also be looking for
      differences between the effects of the two probiotics, which differ in strain types and
      number of colony forming units per dose.
