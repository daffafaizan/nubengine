    
      Subjects from the COPDGene study who have airway-predominant COPD on chest CT scan will be
      enrolled; a total of 40 subjects is planned.

      Subjects will all have background ipratropium-albuterol administered four times daily.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive budesonide (180 ug twice daily) or
      formoterol-budesonide (160/4.5 ug twice daily) for 12 weeks.

      The main objective is to explore novel outcomes: blood biomarkers and chest CT scan. Outcomes
      include lung function, walk distance, respiratory disease-specific health status, and
      expiratory chest CT scan gas trapping as an exploratory outcome.

      The primary outcome measure will be FEV1 pre-bronchodilator 12 hours after the last dose of
      study medication at the end of 12 weeks of treatment. FEV1 will be measured in the morning 6
      hours after the last dose of ipratropium/albuterol and 12 hours after the last dose of
      budesonide and budesonide/formoterol
