      memory, language, executive functions, and attention. However, most of the studies focus on
      one or two domains in a relatively small sample.

      Few studies have investigated the influential factors for the epilepsy-related cognitive
      impairment . However, most of these studies merely focused on one or a few potential factors
      and failed to consider possible distractions from other influential factors. Therefore, it is
      crucial to include more potential factors in the analysis and to rule out possible
      confounding interactions between factors.
