      Primary

        -  Determine the targeting, tissue distribution, and pharmacokinetics of monoclonal
           antibody Hu3S193 in patients with progressive small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 (MOAB Hu3S193) IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of
      weeks 1-4. Patients also receive indium In III MOAB Hu3S193 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of
      weeks 1 and 4 and then undergo gamma camera imaging. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6-12 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
