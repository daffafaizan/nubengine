      anticoagulant: rivaroxaban 1x/day (group 1); dabigatran and apixabana 2x/day (group 2) and
      warfarin (control group). Extraction of one to three teeth will be scheduled, in the valley
      of the new oral anticoagulants' concentration, considered the period of smallest haemorrhagic
      risk without suspension. In group 1 the surgery will be scheduled 14 hours after the last
      intake, in group 2 the surgery will be scheduled 8 hours after the last intake, while the
      control group will undergo the procedure with INR values between 2.0 and 3,0. Hemostatic
      measures with tranexamic acid paste intra alveolar, suture and biological glue GRFÂ® (gelatin,
      resorcinol and formaldehyde) and post operative care will be associated. The patients will be
      contacted after the procedure to inform the presence or absence of late bleeding. The patient
      should return 24 hours later to evaluate the surgical site. This protocol is based on
      Guidelines and scientific articles, pharmacokinetics and clinical experience of the authors.
