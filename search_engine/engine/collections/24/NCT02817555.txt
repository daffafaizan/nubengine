    
      Eligible hemodialysis patients who are currently receiving an erythropoiesis stimulating
      agent (ESA) who enrol and sign consent will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either remain on
      epoetin alfa or switch to darbepoetin alfa as their anemia therapy. Patients will be dosed
      with the assigned drug using a study algorithm to maintain their hemoglobin (Hb) level within
      the currently recommended range (100-120 g/L). There will be an initial "run in" period of a
      minimum of six weeks to ensure the patient's hemoglobin is stable within the target range.
      The trial itself will run for a subsequent twelve months (active phase). Every effort will be
      made to ensure that Hb stays within the target range during the study period. The primary
      outcome will be the total cost of each ESA therapy over the twelve month active phase. Data
      including Hgb, iron indices and dosing, and clinical events will be obtained from electronic
      sources and from the attending physicians and/or the clinical pharmacist.
