      cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), of which intestinal GVHD is a particularly serious one,
      which is the main cause of death after allo-HSCT. Recent studies have demonstrated that
      intestinal flora imbalance is strongly associated with the risk of infection and mortality in
      patients with allo-HSCT. On the basis of this theory, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
      may be an effective method for GVHD, that is, fecal suspension from healthy individuals is
      inputted into the digestive tract of patients through some methods, so as to restore the
      microbial community diversity of patients. In this prospective study, the investigators aimed
      to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment.
