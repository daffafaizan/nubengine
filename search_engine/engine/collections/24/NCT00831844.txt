    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate to IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) administered in various strata of
      recurrent/refractory malignant solid tumors in childhood and young adulthood.

      II. To further define and describe the toxicities of IMC-A12. III. To further characterize
      the pharmacokinetics of IMC-A12.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the relationship between tumor expression of insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF)-I, IGF-II, and IGF-I receptor (IR) and response to IMC-A12.

      II. To determine the human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response after treatment with IMC-A12.

      III. To further evaluate the effect of IMC-A12 on circulating levels of proteins involved in
      linear growth and glucose homeostasis, including IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-BP3, growth hormone,
      insulin, and C-peptide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type.

      Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative laboratory studies.
      Samples are analyzed for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-BP3, growth hormone, insulin, and C-peptide
      levels and for immunogenicity.
