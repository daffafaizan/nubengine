      the primary reason that these patients seek medical care in the acute care setting. This
      complication arises when blood vessels are obstructed by sickled red blood cells resulting in
      ischemic injury.

      The standard management of these painful episodes comprises the administration of opioid
      analgesics, the infusion of intravenous (IV) fluids at room temperature and rest. These
      episodes often last five to seven days and many patients require inpatient management for
      continued administration of intravenous analgesics.

      The public health impact of the disease is large as admissions frequently result in school or
      work absences and can be financially and emotionally taxing.

      It is well established that exposure to cold precipitates VOC. For this reason, management of
      the pain of VOC in some centers includes the use of warming blankets as an adjunct for pain
      relief. It is conceptually appealing to conjecture that warm fluids might have similar
      salutary effects on VOC. This conjecture is bolstered by the physiologic effect of
      temperature on vascular tone. Specifically, it is well established that cold temperatures
      cause vasoconstriction whereas warm temperatures cause vasodilation. We expect that warmed
      fluids will similarly induce vasodilation, improving blood flow to vaso-occluded ischemic
      areas.
