      by large vessel occlusion (LVO) in major clinical trials. Whether the benefit of EVT in
      randomized trials could be generalized to clinical practice, especially in developing
      countries, remains unknown. The Registry was established to evaluate the utilization, and
      subsequent outcomes of EVT treated AIS patients. This study is a multi-center, prospective
      registry study initiated by researchers, to investigate Reco Â® ,the first clot retriever in
      china as the primary therapyand remedies in the real world.
