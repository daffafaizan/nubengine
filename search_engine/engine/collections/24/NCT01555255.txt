      effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, a
      cornerstone in this prevention effort, is declining with increasing parasite resistance. New
      drugs for IPTp are being considered, but there are disadvantages to presumptive use of the
      few remaining efficacious antimalarials. An alternative approach may involve screening with
      diagnostic tests to better target efficacious antimalarial treatment to asymptomatic women
      with laboratory evidence of malaria infection. Light microscopy of peripheral maternal blood
      misses a large proportion of cases, and PCR is unavailable in routine health care settings.
      Preliminary evidence suggests that detection of parasite antigen in peripheral blood may
      provide an accurate indicator of clinically significant infections and predict pregnancy
      outcomes. Therefore, screening with RDTs may offer an accurate and practical way to identify
      pregnant women who will benefit from targeted therapy for placental malaria infection.
      Antigen detection thresholds vary widely among RDTs, and the distribution of target antigens
      in peripheral blood circulation is expected to differ; therefore, the potential value of RDTs
      in this population can best be established by evaluating the detection of placental
      parasitemia for highly-characterized RDTs, enabling results to be extrapolated to other
      products and programs. The study described here is proposed to address this question.
