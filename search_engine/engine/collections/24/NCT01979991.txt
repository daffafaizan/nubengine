      scan. The sinogram will be de-identified and sent to an archive system for storage. It will
      be exported to a computer for processing using MBIR (model based iterative reconstruction).
      MBIR (model based iterative reconstruction) is a new method being developed to process CT
      sinograms. The newly reconstructed images will be reviewed by experts to determine if they
      are as readable and accurate as CT images created with the software that is currently being
      used. Sinogram data and the reconstructed images will be shared with collaborating
      researchers at General Electric Global Research.
