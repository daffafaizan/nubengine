      illnesses, sudden worsening of symptoms, and death. Even so, many people with kidney failure
      do not talk about their preferences for end-of-life care.

      Advance care planning (ACP) can help patients and families think through their preferences
      for future care and discuss these with the professionals looking after them. This may lead to
      care more in keeping with patients' wishes and so reduce distress for patients and families.
      ACP is recommended as good practice for people with kidney failure.

      However, questions remain about the impact of ACP on patients and families; and also about
      the best ways to put ACP into practice. Doing research about ACP is challenging for everyone
      involved, so we need to thoroughly test our research methods in a pilot study before we
      attempt a larger study that would fully answer those questions.

      To test our methods we will carry out a small-scale randomised controlled trial comparing
      those patients who use ACP with those who do not, in terms of: quality of life, anxiety,
      depression, physical functioning, well-being, satisfaction with decision-making and agreement
      between the patient and their nominated carer in terms of the patient's preferences for care
      at the end of life.
