      For the maternal outcome portion of the study, pregnant active duty women who consent to join
      the registry are expected to complete several surveys over the course of their pregnancy,
      including an initial enrollment survey, a follow-up survey at or after the 20th week of
      pregnancy, and a post-delivery survey at two weeks after their delivery due date (unless a
      pregnancy loss is reported in the 20 week survey).

      Outcomes among infants born to women enrolled in the Registry whose pregnancies result in a
      livebirth will be assessed with a survey during the post-delivery contact, again at 4 months
      of age, with a final follow-up when the infant reaches one year of age.
