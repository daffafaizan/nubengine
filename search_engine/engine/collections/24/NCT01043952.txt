      Tonsillectomy, Adenoidectomy, Microlaryngoscopy, Bronchoscopy, Esophagoscopy, Myringoplasty,
      Myringotomy with positioning of a tube.

      All these procedures are performed with the patient receiving a general anesthesia with and
      infusion of Propofol and Remifentanil. Muscle relaxants and inhaled anesthetics are not used.

      The patients undergoing a Tonsillectomy will receive a supplementary opioid analgesic (Inj.
      Fentanyl iv, 3mcg/kg) at the end of the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing the other
      operations receive intraoperative Paracetamol and NSAID for postoperative pain treatment.

      Stratification by age (1-3y, 4-11y, 12-17y, 18-65y) will be performed to ensure balanced
      allocation of age groups and allow for identification of age and weight specific effects.
      Stratification by operation type will be performed to ensure the identification of the
      effects of the duration of anaesthesia and of the use of longer acting opioids (Fentanyl) on
      outcome parameters.
