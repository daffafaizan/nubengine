      influence post-operative outcome (shoulder pain, shoulder function and quality of life) after
      shoulder arthroplasty. Therefore, factors such as patient characteristics, indication for
      procedure, pre-operative shoulder pain, pre-operative shoulder function, patient
      expectations, psychosocial factors, lifestyle factors, length of immobilization and soft
      tissue integrity, are subject to study.

      Secondary aims are to investigate:

        1. the influences of early mobilization vs. delayed mobilization of the shoulder after
           shoulder arthroplasty on post-operative shoulder pain, shoulder function and quality of
           life.

        2. the inter- and intrarater reliability of the test battery used in this project, in the
           shoulder arthroplasty population.

        3. the inter- and intrarater reliability of the shoulder joint position sense (SJPS) test
           and the shoulder joint force sensation (SFS) test.

        4. the routines of the orthopedic shoulder surgeons before, during and after performing a
           shoulder arthroplasty.

        5. the routines of physiotherapists in the post-operative rehabilitation of patients with
           shoulder arthroplasty.

        6. the associations between the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) used in AZ Monica
           and the Constant Murley Score (CS), and the PROMS and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

      and to conduct a questionnaire - and assess its reliability - measuring the expectations of
      the shoulder arthroplasty patients.

      In order to reach the aims of this project, a prospective longitudinal study with randomized
      group allocation will be carried out over 48 months with estimated starting point in January
      2020 and finishing in January 2024.
