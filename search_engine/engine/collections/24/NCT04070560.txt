      cord and move the baby to a designated area for resuscitation, which can include stimulation,
      clearing the airways, administration of oxygen and/or positive pressure ventilation by bag
      and mask och T-piece resuscitator.

      It has been suggested, and pilot studies has shown preliminary results, that keeping the
      umbilical cord intact while performing resuscitation may improve the babies outcome, by
      continued exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide be the placenta and facilitating the neonatal
      pulmonary and circulatory transition.

      Because of the limiting length of the umbilical cord, resuscitation with an intact cord must
      be performed in close proximity to the mother.
