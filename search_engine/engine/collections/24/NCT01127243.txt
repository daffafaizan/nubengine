    
      Objective: To determine whether women having day-case laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy
      (LSH) are as satisfied with the length of stay in hospital as women who stay overnight
      following the procedure.

      Design: randomised controlled trial (RCT).

      Setting: Ulleval university hospital, Oslo, Norway.

      Population: 49 women scheduled for LSH were enrolled and 45 patients completed the study (22
      in the inpatient group and 23 in the day-case group).

      Methods: Women were randomised to either day-case care or overnight hospital stay following a
      routine supracervical hysterectomy. The primary outcome measure was satisfaction with the
      length of stay in the hospital (measured on a 10-point visual analogue scale) and secondary
      measures were health-related quality of life (measured using the EuroQol EQ5D), anxiety
      (measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) and general questions
      about their experiences of having the operation. Readmissions, prolonged hospitalisations,
      complications and any contact with a health professional after discharge were also recorded.
      Measures were taken on the day of surgery (postoperatively), and on days 1, 2, 4 and 7
      following surgery. The data were analysed based on an intention to treat.
