      bioavailability of two IMP4297 formulations (10 mg capsules and 20 mg capsules) after single
      oral administration of 100 mg IMP4297 under fasted condition in healthy male subjects. It
      will be conducted at one site, and approximately a total of 18 subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment sequences according to a
      computer-generated randomization schedule. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods,
      separated by a washout period of at least 7 days between each period.
