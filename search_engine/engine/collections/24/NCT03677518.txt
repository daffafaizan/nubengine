      patients between May 2005 and Novem-ber 2007. During this period, several types of
      semi-constrainedprimary TKA implants were used.The "ball-in-socket" design of the
      Medial-Pivot knee system (MicroPort Orthopedics, Arling-ton, Tennessee, USA) aims to
      reproduce normal knee kinematics by medializing its rotational axis. Thegoal of this study
      was to measure knee range of motion (ROM) with this implant after a mean follow-up of 10
      years and to report the survivorship and long-term clinical and radiological outcomes.
      Wehypothesized the prosthetic knee would have at least 120â—¦flexion at 10 years. This was
      retrospective, single-centre study of 74 Medial-Pivot knees implanted in71 patients (average
      age of 69 years) between May 2005 and November 2007. All patients who receiveda Medial-Pivot
      knee were included consecutively. The mean follow-up was 10 years. Clinical and radio-logical
      assessments were performed using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and Ewald's score.
      Kaplan-Meirsurvival analysis was used to calculate survivorship.
