      and filgrastim (FLAG) in patients with poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
      syndrome, or recurrent or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia. II. Determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of topotecan in the FLAG regimen in these patients. III. Assess the complete
      remission rates in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients with complete response proceed to further therapy according to age. 65 and
      under: Patients receive etoposide by IV continuously for 5 days, cytarabine IV over 2 hours
      every 12 hours for 4 days, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously. Peripheral blood stem cells
      (PBSC) are then harvested. Patients then receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4
      and etoposide IV over 10 hours on day -3. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Over 65: Patients
      receive oral isotretinoin and vitamin E daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every month for 1 year and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.
