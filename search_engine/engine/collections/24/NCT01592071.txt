      role in certain conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, type I diabetes, and
      migraine headaches.

      Using a proprietary blood test, the Immuno Bloodprint, to determine which foods stimulate IgG
      food antibodies in each person, this study detailed a personalized list of reactive foods
      that stimulated such antibodies for each participant. The participant was then advised to
      eliminate as much as possible the reactive foods for 90 days.
