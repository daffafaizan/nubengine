      secondary complications that can occur up to 2 weeks after the initial bleeding.
      Complications can include decrease of consciousness, weakness or paralysis, difficulty with
      speech and language, and worsening of brain damage. These decrease a patient's chances for a
      good recovery. A brain scan will be used to determine the damage caused by the bleeding, and
      the brain's electrical activity will be monitored to detect abnormal activity. These measures
      will be analyzed together with routine medical information to better understand and diagnose
      complications.
