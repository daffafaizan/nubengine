      orthodontic long-term outcomes, such as: 1) Is treating a low tongue position and lip closure
      at rest sufficient for orthodontic short and long-term outcomes? 2) Does treating atypical
      swallowing along with an incorrect tongue position help achieve and maintain higher outcomes
      of the myofucntional and orthodontic treatments?
