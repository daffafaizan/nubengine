      likelihood of hospitalization for heart failure and death in persons with type 2 diabetes, of
      which the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The mechanistic effects of empagliflozin
      on platelet function profiles have not yet been ascertained. It remains unclear if this
      reduction in cardiovascular death is mediated by decreased platelet reactivity.
