      identified the unmet supportive care needs of people with cancer. This research has already
      led to the development of several needs assessment tools that have been used clinically or
      for research purposes. This study is not trying to identify new needs, but investigate which
      of the unmet needs that have already been identified, within the literature, apply to cancer
      patients who are in pain. These needs include psychological needs, such as fears about the
      cancer spreading or for loved ones and health information needs.
