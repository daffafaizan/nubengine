      life in patients with high grade gliomas, receiving focal radiation therapy to the brain
      concurrent with chemotherapy with Temozolomide. Hydrogen has an excellent safety profile, has
      antioxidant properties and reduces inflammatory events in the tissues. It has been postulated
      in previous studies that continuous consumption of hydrogen water reduces oxidative stress in
      the brain by lowering the concentration of the reactive oxygen species, resulting in the
      improvement of adult neurogenesis or the stimulation of neural proliferation, leading to the
      prevention of the decline in the learning and memory.

      This will be a double blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible and willing subjects will
      be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to be treated with either hydrogen or placebo, to receive
      hydrogen or placebo, additionally to all standard-of-care treatments. The treatment with
      hydrogen or placebo will start the day before chemoradiation therapy starts, and continue for
      six weeks. The effects of drinking hydrogen water on the quality of life will be assessed
      using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-BN20 questionnaires at baseline, at 6 weeks, 6
      months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months.
