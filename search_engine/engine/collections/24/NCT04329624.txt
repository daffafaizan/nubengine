      surgery and are even higher in patients with increased preoperative risk factors. N-terminal
      pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) increases in over two third of patients undergoing
      surgery and is a strong predictor for perioperative myocardial complications. Levosimendan is
      a positive inotropic Ca2+ sensitizer and significantly reduces postoperative BNP
      concentration in cardiac surgery. The evidence in the non-cardiac surgery setting, however,
      is weak. Therefore, we will test our primary hypothesis that the perioperative administration
      of levosimendan significantly will reduce postoperative NT-proBNP concentrations in patients
      undergoing moderate- to high-risk non-cardiac surgery. We will also test the secondary
      hypotheses that levosimendan will reduce postoperative maximum troponin T (maxTnT)
      concentration, the incidence of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), myocardial
      infarction and death within 30 days and one year after surgery.
