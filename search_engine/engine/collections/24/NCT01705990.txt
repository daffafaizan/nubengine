    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial assessing
      the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SeV-G(NP) given intranasally by drops and
      Ad35-GRIN administered intramuscularly in each of four prime-boost regimens.

      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before the 1st vaccination and will be followed for
      12 months after the last vaccine administration (16 months after the first vaccination). It
      is anticipated that it will take approximately 6 months to enroll the study. Approximately 64
      volunteers (48 vaccine and 16 placebo recipients) will be included in the study.
