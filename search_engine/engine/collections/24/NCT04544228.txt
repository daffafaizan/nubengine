      each year in Egypt. Modified Radical Mastectomy is considered the main surgical management
      for breast cancer accounting for 31% of all breast surgery cases.

      Ultrasound guided Serratus anterior plane block provides analgesia for breast and lateral
      thoracic wall surgeries by blocking nerves that are located in a compartment between the
      serratus anterior and the latissimus dorsi muscles ( the intercostobrachial nerve, lateral
      cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves (T3-T9), long thoracic nerve and thoracodorsal
      nerve).

      A previous study demonstrated the analgesic efficacy of ketamine in patients undergoing
      modified pectoral nerve block in breast cancer surgery as evidenced by prolonged time to
      first rescue analgesia and reduced total opioid consumption.

      Neostigmine has been used as an additive to local anesthetics to prolong the analgesic
      effect. Although there is good evidence for a spinal action of neostigmine, its analgesic
      efficacy as an adjuvant to local anesthetic is still unclear.

      The aim of this study is to Investigate the analgesic efficacy of adding ketamine compared to
      neostigmine to local anesthetic in Ultrasound guided Serratus anterior plane block for
      patients undergoing Modified Radical Mastectomy.
