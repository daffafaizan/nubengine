    
      Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome characterized by breakdown of
      skeletal muscle, and leakage of intracellular substances such as myoglobin and creatine
      kinase (CK) into the circulation. The aetiological spectrum of rhabdomyolysis is extensive,
      and the clinical spectrum varies from a transient subclinical increase in CK activity to
      acute kidney injury (AKI) as a serious complication. There are no large prospective studies
      and only a few retrospective studies on rhabdomyolysis.

      The project will give much needed information about incidence, aetiologies and the clinical
      course of rhabdomyolysis. The main objective will be to study rhabdomyolysis with focus on
      the development of AKI and how laboratory values can guide treatment, and thus act as basis
      for guidelines. More knowledge is needed about rhabdomyolysis and long-term kidney injury,
      and the study will aim to identify a risk population for later kidney injury, thus being able
      to refer this group to follow-up and prevent further injury. On the other hand,
      exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis patients are probably hospitalized more than necessary these
      days, and over-treatment could be prevented if better guidelines were obtained. The possible
      cardiotoxicity of myoglobin needs further study, and would benefit the patient group but also
      fill a knowledge gap for the clinicians. Therefore, this project will ideally obtain new
      knowledge for the health services, potentially improve existing practice and fill important
      knowledge gaps.
