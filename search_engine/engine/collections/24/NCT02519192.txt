      enterocutaneous fistulae over routine gravity drainage. The investigators' design is a
      randomized controlled trial with two arms. One of the arms (non-VAC) will include patients
      assigned to a system of ECFoutput management which does not involve negative pressure (for
      example, an ostomy bag placed over the fistula, wet to dry dressing changes, etc..), and the
      second arm (VAC) will consist of a group of patients assigned to VAC negative pressure
      therapy with regular sponge irrigation with normal saline (the V.A.C.Ultaâ„¢ Negative Pressure
      Wound Therapy System) .

      The fistula vac is made from standard sponge supplies and negative pressure suction devices.
      Initial placement will be by the bedside physician in the intensive care unit, the ward, or
      in the clinic. The patient will be taught basic wound care, and as is typical for those
      outpatients with wound VACs, a home nursing aide will be arranged. Those randomized to no VAC
      therapy will have ostomy bags or wet to dry dressings placed on the skin with no negative
      pressure applied. Again, initial application will be performed by the bedside physician or a
      wound care nurse. The patient will be taught wound care, with assistance provided as
      necessary.

      Once a fistula is noted to have closed (effluent = 0cc/day) the dressings or VAC will be
      discontinued, and the date of fistula closure noted.
