      pain and dysfunction which does not involved a single organ. The gap between clinical
      symptoms and pathological signs is a constant feature of these pain syndromes. A possible
      explanation for these pain syndromes is central sensitization. This sensitization is defined
      by decrease nociceptive thresholds, a more intense and more prolonged response to nociceptive
      stimulus, and spatial extension of the painful area. It has been defined by international
      expert consensus in 2016 a clinical evaluation tool with 10 criteria for sensitization
      diagnosis: Convergences PP criteria. The aim of this study is to objectivize lower threshold,
      spatial and temporal diffusion of pain in women with chronic pelvic or perineal pain with
      sensitization (Convergences PP criteria > 5) compared to women without sensitization
      (Convergences PP criteria < 5). A sensory testing of lower urinary tract, lower rectal tract,
      vulva and pelvic muscles will be achieved.
