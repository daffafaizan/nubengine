    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. In the first treatment period,
      patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive enteric coated pancrelipase with bicarbonate (PANCRECARB) capsules
      before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days.

      Arm II: Patients receive their usual enteric coated pancreatic enzyme without bicarbonate
      capsule before meals and snacks for 7 consecutive days.

      Patients receive approximately 50% of their usual lipase dose during treatment. Food intake
      is recorded on days 1-3, food intake is weighed and recorded on days 4-7, and stools are
      collected over 72 hours on days 5-7 to determine fecal fat and nitrogen excretion.
      Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and skinfolds are assessed.

      In the second treatment period, patients are switched to the alternate treatment arm after a
      3 day washout period. Patients receive the opposing treatment as per protocol.
