    
      Patients: clinical Stage III gastric cancer patients. Informed consent will be obtained
      before surgery. Eligible patients: surgical Stage II, IIIA and IIIB gastric cancer patients.
      Chemosensitivity test: The surgical specimen will be sent Mitsubishi BCL, Co. Ltd. to be
      tested by CD-DST chemosensitivity test and RT-PCR for thymidylate synthetase and
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase mRNA. The test results will be blinded for the doctors on
      duty.

      Treatment: All the patients will be treated with S-1 at a dose of 80 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 4 weeks
      followed by 2 weeks rest. The treatment will be continued until the recurrence or 1 year
      after operation.

      Primary endpoint: 3-years disease-free survival rate Secondary endpoint: 3-years overall
      survival rate and side effect (CTCAE v3.0) Evaluation of chemosensitivity test: The cutoff
      condition will be determined based on the accumulated data of CD-DST and mRNAs.

      Hypothesis: The responder detected by CD-DST and/or TS, DPD mRNA will have a favorable
      survival outcome comparing with resistant cases.
