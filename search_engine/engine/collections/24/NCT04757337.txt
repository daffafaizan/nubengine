      making prioritizing medical issues necessary. Individualization of cancer treatment by
      integrating a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is frequently considered as essential
      and mandatory for elderly cancer patients. The G8 questionnaire is able to identify patients
      requiring CGA, with a threshold score of â‰¤14/17 and with a strong 1-year prognostic value.

      According to guidelines, the recommended first-line treatment of these patients relies on
      single agent chemotherapy with anthracyclines (including doxorubicin); however,
      anthracycline-based treatments have modest performance in patients with metastatic STS with a
      median progression-free survival of about 4 months and an overall survival of about 12
      months.

      Previous studies have demonstrated promising activity of oral metronomic cyclophosphamide in
      STS patients and its favorable safety profile.

      To evaluate this promising activity we designed a phase III, randomized, open-label,
      multicentric study comparing daily oral cyclophosphamide versus standard 3-week intravenous
      injection of doxorubicin in 65 years or older patients with advanced or metastatic STS.
