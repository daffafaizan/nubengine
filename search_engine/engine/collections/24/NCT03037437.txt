    
      Phase 2 study with two cohorts:

      Cohort 1: As second-line treatment, we will add HCQ to SOR dose the patient was tolerating at
      the time of progression.

      Cohort 2: SOR-na√Øve patients receive SOR 400 mg by PO twice daily on Cycle1 Day1 (C1D1). On
      Cycle 1 Day 15, HCQ 400 mg PO daily will be started. In clinical practice, dose reduction of
      SOR may be required. On C1D15 SOR maybe kept as starting dose or reduced for toxicity. On
      Cycle 2 Day 1 of toxicity of HCQ and SOR will be assessed.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      Blood samples will be collected at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1 to assess
      for biomarkers.

      Disease evaluation every 2 cycles.

      Dose reductions due to adverse events are allowed for both sorafenib per standard of care
      and/or HCQ for grade 3 or more adverse event was related to study medication. Dose reductions
      are also permitted based on investigator clinical decision.
