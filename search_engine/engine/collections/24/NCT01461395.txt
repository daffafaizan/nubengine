        1. Your physician is asking you to provide a semen sample as you already would. The sample
           will be taken to the IVF lab which would occur if you were not involved in this
           research. The part that would be thrown away is then further analyzed under a polarized
           light microscope. The sample is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light for a period of 20
           minutes after which it is analyzed under the microscope again, looking for any changes
           when compared the sample that was not exposed to UV light. The sample is then discarded.

        2. Your name will be removed from the sample after the regular semen analysis is done;
           therefore there will be no way of associating the research results with you. No
           information will be needed from you and you will not be contacted in the future
           regarding this research.
