      higher temperature than it should be.

      The causes can be:

      [I] Physiological: During menarch, puberty, menstruation, lactation and after sexual
      Intercourse.

      [II] Inflammatory: Mastitis and breast Abscess. [III] Endocrinal: any cause of increasing
      Oestrogen, Prolactin and/or Thyroid hormones.

      [IV] Neoplastic: the neo-Vascularisation of the malignant tumors. Radiometer is a machine
      that can detect through its sensitive probe the microwave that radiate from the deep
      structures in the body.

      The main aim of this study, first is to measure the sensitivity of the RTM in detecting the
      hot spots of different breast lesions.

      The second Objective is to study the temperature patter of each disease trying to figure out
      a diagnostic code for the different lesions.

      The tertiary objective is to combine the Echo-Dobbler in studying the hot spots in the
      neoplastic lesions trying to figure out an accurate protocol to early detect the malignant
      hot spots.
