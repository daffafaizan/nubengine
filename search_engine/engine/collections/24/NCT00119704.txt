    
      Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is a common cause of chronic elbow pain and wrist
      extensor dysfunction in adults, affecting 1% to 3% of the general population per year.

      There is currently no consensus on its optimal treatment with wide-ranging options available.
      The best available scientific evidence suggests that only topical non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and possibly, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be
      useful for short term pain relief, while corticosteroid injections presented both benefits
      and harms as a short term measure.

      Botulinum toxin has been reported in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis with promising
      results but these studies lack a control group bringing up the question whether recovery was
      a result of intervention or the natural history of the disease.

      Method:

      A twin-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which all
      patients received either a botulinum injection or a placebo saline injection.

      Consecutive patients over 18 years old with tennis elbow referred to the outpatient clinic at
      the investigators' institution will be screened for this study. Eligible patients will be
      invited to participate in the study.
