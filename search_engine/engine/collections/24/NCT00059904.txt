        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of rituximab and interleukin-2 in patients with relapsed
           or refractory intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate response with natural killer cell numbers and rituximab, interleukin-2 (IL-2),
           and soluble IL-2 receptor levels in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 1-4 and interleukin-2 subcutaneously 3
      times weekly on weeks 2-9. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
