    
      This study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled first-in-human study in
      healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single
      ascending doses of AZD9977. In Part B of this study the regional absorption of AZD9977 along
      the gastro-intestinal tract will be investigated using the IntelliCapÂ® system in a
      non-randomized, open-label, fixed-sequence design with oral solution as reference. The study
      will be performed at a single study centre.
