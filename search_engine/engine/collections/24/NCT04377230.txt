           length of 60cm

        -  Group 100: Patients will undergo a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a Biliopancreatic limb
           length of 100cm Alimentary limb will be constant in both groups (150cm length)

      Bone mineral density will be evaluated before surgery and 2 years after it, by means of X ray
