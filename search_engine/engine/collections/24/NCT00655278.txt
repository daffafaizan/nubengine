      disease. The medications that are currently used to treat ET work in a small proportion of
      patients and provide only partial improvement in symptoms. Use of these current medications
      is also limited by side-effects in many patients.

      T2000 is a medication currently under development for the treatment of essential tremor.
      Although T2000 is a new medication, it belongs to a class of medications that has been used
      for many years for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions. In previous studies,
      T2000 appeared to be effective in controlling symptoms of ET and some patients with severe ET
      had major improvements in tremor. In some patients T2000 was well tolerated for periods up to
      5 months and the minimal side-effects seen were those that would be expected for medications
      in this class.

      The current study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of T2000 in patients with moderate to
      severe essential tremor. Patients will receive doses of T2000 beginning at 600 mg a day,
      followed by 800 mg a day and up to 1000 mg a day. The total duration of treatment will be 18
      months. Patient's tremor and neurological examination will be monitored throughout the study.
