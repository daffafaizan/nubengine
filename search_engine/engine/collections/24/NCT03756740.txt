      period of time and referred for physical therapy treatment. They will undergo a routine
      physical examination and be assigned a personal treatment (manual therapy and electrotherapy)
      and exercise program in accordance with their condition. Participants will receive a total of
      8 treatments over a 4-week period (twice a week).

      The sample will be randomly divided into 2 groups: a. research group A will receive a video
      of the exercises via e-mails or to their cellphones; b. a control group will receive the
      exercises printed on paper.

      The exercises will be recorded and be supplemented by a verbal explanation and instructions
      as to how to correctly perform the exercises. In total, there will be ten videos, found to be
      important and effective for LBP patients. From these videos, a physical therapist will choose
      the most suitable exercises for the patients after each treatment meeting (face to face). The
      patients will be assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment and at a 3 month follow-up
      telephone assessment.
