      biometrics, including spherical equivalent refraction (SER), pupil distance (PD), corneal
      curvature (CC), high order aberration (HOA), and central corneal thickness (CCT) between boys
      and girls. Additionally, we investigate the correlation between the SER in diopters and the
      other biometric parameters, including PD, CC, HOA, CCT, and body mass index (BMI).
