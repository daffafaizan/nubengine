    
      This is a Phase I, three period, two sequence, single-center, open-label, randomized,
      crossover study design. Periods I and II consist of the oral administration of either a
      single dose of aminophylline or ambrisentan alone, followed by a 48 hour wash out interval.
      Subsequently, Period III consists of the simultaneous administration of both drugs. All
      subjects are to be confined to the Duke Clinical Research Unit throughout all treatment
      periods [Study Day -1 to Study Day 6 (discharge)]. A sufficient number of healthy adult
      subjects will be consented in order to enroll 24 and complete 16 subjects who complete all
      three periods. Replacement of subjects is permitted, if necessary.

      Qualified subjects will be randomized into one of two sequences consisting of three Periods
      as indicated below:

      -------------Period 1-----Period 2-----Period 3

      Sequence A: Treatment 1 Treatment 2 Treatment 3

      Sequence B: Treatment 2 Treatment 1 Treatment 3

      TREATMENTS:

      Treatment 1: Aminophylline 500 mg (corresponding to 395 mg theophylline).

      Treatment 2: Ambrisentan 5 mg.

      Treatment 3: Aminophylline, 500 mg plus Ambrisentan, 5 mg.

      After completion of each treatment period, the subjects will proceed to the next period
      provided no Stopping Rules criteria have been met
