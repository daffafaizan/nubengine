      abnormal regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The early administration of calcium
      supplements or vitamin D attenuates the development and progression of hyperparathyroidism,
      preventing or retarding the emergence of many of the serious complications of chronic kidney
      disease. However, these vitamin D derivatives also have serious side effects, including
      hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and, as a result, a high level of the calcium-phosphate
      product. These adverse outcomes have prompted the development of novel, "nonhypercalcemic"
      vitamin D analogues. Three of these analogues have recently been marketed for clinical use in
      patients with chronic kidney disease: 19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (paricalcitol), 1
      -hydroxyvitamin D2 (doxercalciferol), and 22-oxacalcitriol.

      Oral paricalcitol was developed to provide a convenient, alternative therapy, particularly
      for Peritoneal Dialysis patients in whom regular intravenous administration of paricalcitol
      is not practical. This study is designed to determine the proportion of patients with 'End
      stage renal failure' on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and secondary
      hyperparathyroidism who achieved more than 30% reduction in baseline iPTH concentration at 24
      weeks of treatment with Paricalcitol or Calcitriol capsules.
