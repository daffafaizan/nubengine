      inflammation, iatrogeny, and mechanical ventilation, contribute to the overall muscular
      involvement including the diaphragm.

      Assessment of diaphragm dysfunction is a critical issue for patients under mechanical
      ventilation, providing prognosis information and leading to the best therapeutic choices.

      Up to now, for sedated ventilated critical care patient, expensive magnetic phrenic nerve
      stimulation equipment is needed to evaluate diaphragm strength.

      In this study, the investigators aim to develop an affordable easy-to-use phrenic nerve
      stimulation tool, with ultrasonography and a nerve stimulator usually used for neuromuscular
      transmission monitoring. Hypothesis is that phrenic pacing using this new method is
      equivalent to the Gold Standard.
