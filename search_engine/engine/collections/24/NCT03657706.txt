      groups. In the first group, gingival recession will be treated by tunneling technique with
      subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG). the tunnel preparation will be performed in the
      recession site then the sCTG will be harvested from the palate and inserted in the prepared
      tunnel and sutured in a coronally advanced position.

      Equally , the second group will be treated with modified free gingival graft (mFGG).
      Initially, after tunnel preparation in the recession site and harvesting of the free gingival
      graft,the proposed modification is performed by mimicking the recession defect shape and size
      leaving the rest of the free gingival graft deepithelialized and inserted in the prepared
      tunnel. then, suturing will be performed in a coronally advanced position.
