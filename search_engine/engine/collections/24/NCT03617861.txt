      and gamma scintigraphy present in the GI laboratory of the outpatient Clinical Research Unit
      to study fasting gastric volumes and postprandial gastric accommodation responses and gastric
      emptying rates of a standardized meal in patients with functional dyspepsia and healthy
      subjects. Both groups will be studied twice, using crossover design, once with administration
      of secretin and once with placebo.
