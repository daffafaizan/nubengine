      design was employed. All participants were presented with informed consent form beforehand,
      and also verbally informed about the procedure. They were assigned to experimental (E) or
      attention placebo control (C) groups for 2 sessions per week, 8 sessions in total. Before the
      first session (pretest) and after the last session (posttest), participants were asked to
      answer self-report questionnaires, and their attentional and interpretational biases were
      assessed. And finally, participants were asked only to answer to the same questionnaires for
      the follow up measurements after two months.

      Chi square test and independent t-test for dependent variables were run beforehand to check
      if participants were equally distributed to Bias Modification group-E and group-C. No
      statistically significant difference between group-E and group-C was observed with regards to
      gender distribution, social anxiety, anxiety, depression, dysfunctional thoughts, automatic
      thoughts, and attentional and interpretational biases.

      To see the effect of 8 sessions of manipulation on attentional and interpretational bias
      (independent variable) created a significant difference between experimental and control
      groups, 2 (group: experimental [E] and control [C]) × 3 (time: pre [t1] / post [t2] /
      follow-up [t3]) mixed ANOVA was conducted for each dependent variable in self-report
      measurements, and 2 (group: experimental [E] and control [C]) × 2 (time: pre [t1] / post
      [t2]) mixed ANOVA were conducted for attentional and interpretational biases.
