      (HMG-CoA) reductase, known for its hypolipidemic actions, possessing biologically significant
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, exerts anabolic effects on bone through
      expression of BMP - 2, have paved way in periodontal regeneration. The present study aims to
      evaluate and compare the efficacy of subgingivally delivered 1.2% Atorvastatin (ATV) and 1.2%
      Simvastatin (SMV) gel local drug delivery and redelivery systems as an adjunct to scaling and
      root planning (SRP) in chronic periodontitis (CP) subjects with diabetes mellitus(DM). 120
      subjects with intrabony defects were divided into three groups;group 1- SRP plus 1.2% ATV ;
      group 2- SRP PLUS 1.2% SMV; and group 3- SRP plus placebo gel. Clinical and radiographic
      measurements were taken at baseline, at 6 months and respective gels were redelivered
      subgingivally in respective groups . Measurements were repeated again at 3 months i.e. 9
      months from baseline.
