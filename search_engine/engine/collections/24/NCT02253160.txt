    
      This is a prospective, randomized, cross-over, multi-center study to evaluate the performance
      of the Spectra Optia system's CMNC Collection Procedure, compared to the COBE Spectra
      system's MNC Procedure in mobilized healthy donors.

      Up to 60 subject may be consented to meet the the enrollment target of 20 complete subjects.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either the Spectra Optia CMNC or the COBE
      Spectra MNC collection procedure first, followed by the opposite on the following day.

      Study participation will be up to 14 days: a 7-day screening period, four days for
      mobilization, one day for the first MNC collection with additional dose of mobilization, one
      day for the second MNC collection, and safety follow-up the following day.

      Subject safety will be evaluated beginning with mobilization, throughout the collection
      procedure and for the day following the second collection.
