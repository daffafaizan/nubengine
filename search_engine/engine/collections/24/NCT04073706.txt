      (lymphoedema, morbidity, loss of quality of life) and not increase costs compared to patients
      without a retroperitoneal node dissection. The secondary hypothesis is that disease-free
      survival in patients without retroperitoneal node dissection is not inferior to those
      receiving SNB.

      Aims: To determine the value of SNB for patients, the healthcare system and to exclude
      detriment to patients.

      Objectives:

      Primary Stage 1:

      To determine the recovery of participants (defined as incidence of adverse events, lower limb
      lymphoedema and health-related QOL) and to the healthcare system (cost) of Sentinel Node
      Biopsy (SNB) for the surgical treatment of endometrial cancer.

      Primary Stage 2:

      Compare disease-free survival at 4.5 years for participants randomised to receive
      hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with SNB compared to participants randomised to
      hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without retroperitoneal node dissection.

      Secondary:

        -  Compare patterns of recurrence and overall survival (OS) between the groups

        -  Determine the cost-effectiveness of SNB

        -  Compare Patient Reported Outcomes (PROMS) between the groups at 12 months from surgery

        -  Compare Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and Fear of Recurrence between the groups
           at 12 months from surgery

        -  Compare perioperative outcomes (duration of surgery, length of hospital stay,
           intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion requirements) and the incidence of intra-
           and postoperative adverse events within 12 months from surgery between the groups

        -  Compare lower limb lymphoedema at 12 months after surgery

        -  Compare the need for postoperative (adjuvant) treatments between groups

        -  Determine the impact of body composition and frailty on survival, quality of life,
           lymphoedema, peri-, intra- and postoperative outcomes

        -  Compare follow-up strategies (clinical vs symptom checklist)

        -  Translational Research - Trans-ENDO 3 - biobanking strategy - Compare the Molecular
           profile at 12 months from surgery between the groups
