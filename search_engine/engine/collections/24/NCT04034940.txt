    
      Gathered data:

        -  Descriptive general demographic data;

        -  Previous pathologies (ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart
           failure, previous percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting -
           CABG, known renal disease);

        -  Cardiovascular risk factors (age, weight, height, abdominal perimeter, body mass index,
           smoking, sedentariness, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia);

        -  Oxidative Stress biomarkers: Catalase Activity Assay; Lipid Peroxidation Assay; SOD
           Assay; Total Antioxidant Capacity Assay; Glutathione ;

        -  Cardiac necrosis markers: Heart Fatty Acid Binding Protein (H-FABP), TnI, CK, CK-MB, LDH
           and OGT;

        -  Routine biological data;

        -  Metabolic data (obtained from two body composition monitoring evaluations - before and
           12 hours after coronary intervention) - body water, body fat tissue;

        -  Information regarding primary PCI (less than 12 hours of ischemic symptoms);

        -  Coronarographic details, type of used stent, periprocedural specific complications,
           final TIMI - thrombolysis in myocardial infarction - flow);

        -  Echocardiography at admission (LVEF);

        -  Measurement of arterial stiffness through Sphigmocore pulsed-wave-velocity (24 hrs
           post-procedural, 2 velocities: carotid - femoral and carotid - radial);

        -  Calculating of cardiovascular risk scores: Syntax Score, Framingham score, ASSIGN score,
           QRISK2 score, PROCAM score, CRUSADE score, GRACE score, CHADS VASc score, MESA score,
           ASCVD score, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for
           Anxiety;

        -  In-hospital and one month follow-up MACE.
