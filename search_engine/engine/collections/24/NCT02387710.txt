      in patients with moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index measured in supine
      non-REM sleep; hypopneas defined by 3% desaturation or arousal). The investigators test three
      secondary hypotheses that tiagabine:

        1. increases the proportion of total sleep time in slow wave sleep

        2. raises the non-REM arousal threshold (more negative esophageal pressure) via (1).

        3. is preferentially effective in patients whose OSA phenotype predicts that an increase in
           the arousal threshold is sufficient to resolve OSA versus those without such favorable
           physiology. Favorable physiology is defined here as having a low ventilatory drive at
           which stable breathing is theoretically feasible ("stable Vdrive" is <100% above eupneic
           ventilatory drive) due to any combination of a "high" upper airway muscle response,
           "good" passive anatomy (high Vpassive), and "low" steady-state loop gain (see Owens RL
           et al SLEEP 2014; Wellman A et al J Appl Physiol 2011, 2013; Eckert DJ et al 2013
           AJRCCM).
