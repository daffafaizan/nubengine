    
      The study will prospectively study two groups of patients : 1) patients with acute coronary
      syndrome and 2) age and sex matched patients with chronic stable documented atherosclerosis.

      Immune cell populations and immune-related metabolites will be characterized, the genetic
      profile of the main known functional variants will be determined, and the oral,
      gastrointestinal, and blood microbiota will be compared in both groups in a transversal
      observational design.

      In addition, 1-year clinical follow-up will be performed and correlation with the evolution
      of the microbiota and immune response in a longitudinal design will be conducted.

      Besides, an angiographic substudy, for those patients included in the study but that require
      revascularization of culprit artery according to clinical indication, will be 1 year
      follow-up and functional assessment and intravascular imaging and the degree of remodelling
      of the atherosclerotic plaque will be correlated with the evolution of the microbiota and
      immune response in a longitudinal design.
