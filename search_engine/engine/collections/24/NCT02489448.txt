    
      The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the trial is to assess the safety of MEDI4736
      combined with chemotherapy and determine if full dose of MEDI4736 can be administered
      concomitantly with full dose weekly nab-paclitaxel followed by dose-dense AC chemotherapies,
      respectively.

      The primary objective of the Phase II portion of the study is to estimate the pCR rate with
      MEDI4736 in combination with weekly nab-paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by MEDI4736 in
      combination with ddAC x 4 treatments for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)
      and HER2 negative (triple negative, TNBC), clinical stage I-III breast cancer. Pathologic
      complete response is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and
      eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes
      following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e. ypT0/Tis ypN0).

      Secondary objectives include: to assess the safety and toxicity of adding anti-PD-L1
      antibody, MEDI4736 to standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the Phase II portion of
      the trial. The study will also monitor for events of special clinical interest with a
      suspected auto-immunologic etiology including grade â‰¥3 colitis, hyperthyroidism,
      hypophysitis, hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, rash and anti-drug-antibody (ADA) immune complex
      disease (manifested by symptoms of arthralgias, abdominal pain, back pain, and vasculitis).

      Exploratory objectives include: to assess correlation between response to therapy and immune
      parameters of the tumor at baseline and post-treatment in patients who have residual cancer
      after therapy.
