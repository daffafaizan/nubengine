      has been demonstrated and HCV infection transmission shown to be prevented by the protocol,
      the study will expand to 10 additional patients.

      Patients will be selected based on their diminished likelihood of receiving a heart from the
      waitlist within a period during which they would be likely to succumb to severe
      comorbidities. This will be determined in part through use of a patient's listing status (1A,
      1B, 2) and clinical judgment, and the Seattle Heart Failure Model.
