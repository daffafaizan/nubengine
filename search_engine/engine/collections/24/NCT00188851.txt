    
      To prospectively determine the virologic impact of switching treatment-experienced
      HIV-infected patients with virologic failure to a salvage regimen with or without a 12 week
      STI prior to the switch.

      Hypothesis: By withdrawing ARV drug pressure, resistant HIV virus will revert to wild-type.
      In treatment-experienced HIV patients who experience virologic failure, a STI prior to
      starting a salvage regimen will result in an improved virologic response and more prolonged
      vral suppression compared to immediate switching to a new regime.

      Interventions:

      Immediate Switch to Salvage Therapy: Patients randomized to the control arm will be switched
      immediately to a salvage regimen using the information from the treatment history and
      genotype results.

      Structured Treatment Interruption: Patients randomized to the STI arm will have their present
      regimen stopped for 12 weeks and will have a genotype repeated in the 12th week. A salvage
      regimen will be started at week 12 using the information from the treatment history and
      baseline genotype results.
