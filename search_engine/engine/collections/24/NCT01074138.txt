      evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered KX2-391 in adult
      male patients with progressive bone-metastatic CRPC. Patients must have 1) documented
      bone-metastatic prostate cancer, 2) castrate levels of testosterone, 3) not received prior
      chemotherapy, and 4) documented disease progression based on rising PSA, progressive
      measurable visceral disease and/or progressive bone lesions (one criteria is sufficient) as
      per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines (Scher et al 2008).
