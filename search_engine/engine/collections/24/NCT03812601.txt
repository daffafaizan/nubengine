    
      Patients undergoing first time catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation with undergo
      simultaneous bi-atrial mapping using two linked AcQMap imaging and mapping systems from
      Acutus Medical. Mapping will be performed during AF, sinus rhythm and pacing (following
      cardioversion if required). Pacing will be undertaken from 3 sites in order to create
      different vectors of conduction and at varying cycle lengths and coupling intervals in order
      to identify regions of slow and anisotropic conduction. Patients will then undergo pulmonary
      vein isolation by radiofrequency ablation followed by ablation of non-pulmonary vein targets
      at the operators discretion (ablation in line with clinical practice and not as part of the
      study). Regions of focal firing, rotational or slow conduction during AF will be noted and
      the interaction between each atria described.
