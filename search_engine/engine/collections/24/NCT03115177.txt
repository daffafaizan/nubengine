      arthritis will be invited to participate in this study if patients meet inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard perioperative
      antibiotics with cefazolin or to the treatment group to receive doxycycline in addition to
      cefazolin. Patients will then undergo routine surgical treatment. 3 cultures from the
      superficial tissue, dermis, and glenohumeral joint will be taken and cultured for 14 days to
      detect any bacterial growth.
