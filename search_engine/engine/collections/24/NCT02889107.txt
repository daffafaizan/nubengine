      survivors report severe difficulties when listening to speech-in-noise, despite normal
      hearing, attributed to abnormal processing of sounds within the brain, and these individuals
      are more likely to experience communication difficulties in poor acoustic environments, The
      patient with significant auditory deficits and functional limitations may require a range of
      rehabilitation and remediation approaches. Several studies conclusively demonstrate
      substantial improvements in speech recognition in noise when using personal
      frequency-modulated (FM) systems. These devices are used to improve speech perception in
      noise in adults with neurological disorders including stroke with good immediate benefits.
      However, the long-term benefits of FM systems in stroke patients has not been studies. In
      this research study the investigators aimed to investigate the long term benefits in speech
      reception in noise in non-aphasic stroke patients and measure the potential improvement in
      unaided speech in background noise performance after 10 weeks.
