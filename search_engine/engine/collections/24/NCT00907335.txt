    
      Approximately 100 female and male subjects, aged from 9 to 11 years of age, will be enrolled
      in this randomized, double blind, multi-center study.

      Following satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures, subjects will receive
      either RETIN-A MICRO 0.04% or a color matched gel vehicle for once daily use during the
      12-week treatment period. Subjects will be monitored for safety throughout the study and for
      signs and symptoms of local irritation at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and again at
      study completion, week 12.

      Efficacy will be assessed by facial lesion counts and by utilizing scales for Investigator's
      Global Evaluation of Acne Severity (IGA #1 and IGA #2) and Investigator's Global Assessment
      of Improvement (IGA #3). All efficacy parameters with the exception of IGA #3 will be
      measured at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The Investigator's Global Assessment of
      Improvement (IGA #3) will be done at Week 12 only. At selected sites, photographs will be
      taken at Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.
