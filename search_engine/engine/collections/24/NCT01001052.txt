    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability of a single
      dose of Colcrys™ (colchicine) 0.6 mg when administered to a group of young, healthy subjects
      18-30 years of age compared to a group of older, generally healthy subjects 60 years of age
      or older following an overnight fast. On study Day 1 following an overnight fast, twenty
      healthy, non-smoking, non-obese male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 and
      twenty generally healthy, non-smoking, non-obese male and female subjects over 60 years of
      age will be administered one single dose of Colcrys™ (1 x 0.6 mg tablet). Fasting will
      continue for 4 hours after the dose. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before
      dosing and for 24 hours post-dose on a confined basis at times sufficient to adequately
      define the pharmacokinetics of Colcrys. Blood sampling will continue on a non-confined basis
      at 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours post-dose. Subjects will be monitored throughout participation in
      the study for adverse reactions to the study drug and/or procedures. Vitals signs
      (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate and blood pressure) will be measured in the
      sitting position prior to dosing. Seated blood pressure and pulse will be measured at
      approximately 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours after dosing and prior to release from the facility. All
      adverse events whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported, or observed by clinic staff
      will be evaluated by the Investigator and reported in the subject's case report form.
