    
      A randomized clinical trial with a nutrigenetic approach among patients ≥ 40 years diagnosed
      with CAD. Randomization will be made in blocks from a list of random numbers generated by
      site www.randomization.org (sealed opaque envelopes). A questionnaire with demographic and
      clinical data will be applied; systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist, hip and neck
      circumferences, height and weight will be assessed. Nutrients intake will be assessed through
      a food diary. Laboratory evaluation will consist of lipid profile (LDL-cholesterol,
      HDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol, serum triglycerides), glycemic profile (fasting plasma
      glucose, glycated hemoglobin) and inflammatory profile (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
      fibrinogen, TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10). Genotyping will be made by TaqMan
      SNP Genotyping Assay®. Patients will be randomized in three groups: Group 1 Intervention
      [Supplementation with nuts (SN)]: standard dietary guidelines + 30g of nuts a day; Group 2
      Intervention [Supplementation with olive oil (SAO)]: standard dietary guidelines + 30ml of
      olive oil a day; Group 3 [Control diet (CO)]: standard dietary guidelines. Patients will be
      followed for three months (12 weeks) and the primary endpoint will be the change in
      LDL-cholesterol. The follow-up visits will be made at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days (final
      visit).
