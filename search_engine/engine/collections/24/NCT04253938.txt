      infant's regularly scheduled doctor's visit. Study visits will coincide with the American
      Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) recommendations for timing of visits in the first year of life:
      prior to 2 months of age a baby will be scheduled for 2 visits (usually at 1 and 2 weeks of
      life), with subsequent well-child visits scheduled for 2, 4, 6, and 9 months of age. The
      investigators will seek to enroll subjects (Parent/Caregiver of infant less than 1 year of
      age) when the child attends any visit prior to the 9 month visit so that the investigators
      can complete both study visits prior to 1 year of age.

      Visit 1 - Parent/Caregiver will complete a questionnaire about breastfeeding/formula feeding
      practices and food insecurity. The questionnaire includes a nutrition history, asking how
      much formula is consumed, number of times they are breastfed per day, what types and amounts
      of solid foods are consumed, and if vitamins and/or iron drops are given (including frequency
      and amount). After the questionnaire, the participant will be asked to demonstrate how they
      typically prepare infant formula. Finally, the PI or designee will provide a brief education
      about appropriate feeding practices as recommended by the AAP.

      formula preparation methods, use of juice, introduction of cow's milk and solids, as well as
      basic nutrition information.

      Visit 2 - If the family returns for a clinic visit again before the child turns 1 year of
      age, the same procedures as Visit 1 will be performed, including reinforcement of education.

      The infant's anthropometrics and medical history will be obtained from the EMR.

      This pilot data would be the foundation for a larger, more intensive study to determine
      prevalence of inappropriate feeding strategies among Latin American families and best
      strategies to educate and inform.
