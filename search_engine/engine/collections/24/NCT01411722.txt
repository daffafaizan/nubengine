      balanced between the risks associated with failed extubation and those related to prolonged
      mechanical ventilation. Weaning failure is associated with major complications. Even when
      weaning protocols and clinical predictors have been used to improve the weaning outcome,
      there is still a significant proportion of patients who fail to breath spontaneously with
      significant risks of pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased morbidity and
      mortality rate. Electrical activity of the diaphragm, a mirror of the respiratory drive and
      now available on an ICU ventilator may help to predict in a more accurate way the weaning
      outcome. The patients will be ventilated in NAVA with the titration method (1). As soon as
      patients passed successfully a daily screening EAdi will be measured during a spontaneous
      breathing trial.
