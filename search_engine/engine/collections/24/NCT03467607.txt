      ventilation.

      45 patients were recruited - 15 patients in each of three groups, 3ml/kg, 4ml/kg or usual
      care.

      Outcomes studied were length of stay, 30 day mortality, unplanned ICU admission, evidence of
      respiratory failure or requirement for non-invasive ventilation, chest x-ray infiltrates and
      requirement for antibiotics.
