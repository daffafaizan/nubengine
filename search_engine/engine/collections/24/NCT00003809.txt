      with or without monoclonal antibody C225 in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent
      squamous cell head and neck cancer. II. Compare the correlation between epidermal growth
      factor receptor density and response and progression-free survival in these patients. III.
      Determine the steady state serum levels of monoclonal antibody C225 and the frequency of
      human antibody response to this monoclonal antibody in patients treated with the combination
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to disease status (newly diagnosed vs recurrent) and ECOG status (0 vs
      1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal
      antibody C225 IV over 2 hours followed 1 hour later by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 of
      course 1. Monoclonal antibody C225 is administered over 1 hour on subsequent courses. Arm II:
      Patients receive placebo IV over 2 hours followed 1 hour later by cisplatin as in arm I on
      day 1 of course 1. Placebo is administered over 1 hour on subsequent courses. Treatment
      continues every 4 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II patients who develop disease progression may then crossover to
      arm I treatment. Patients are followed at 1 and 3 months and then every 3 months until
      disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 114 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.
