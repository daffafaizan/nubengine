      cardiomyopathy. Also,the marked variation of genes which is still unclear, may influence
      clinical outcomes is determined in part by genetic heterogeneity of the systemic response to
      pathological process.

      Specific aim:

        1. Proteomics, microRNA-seq and metabolomics will be to determine the correlation of
           echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic functional entry with circulating
           molecules

        2. Genomics will be to determine the association of clinical outcome
