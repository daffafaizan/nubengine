      immunologic response to MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic administered by either of two injection
      routes (i.m. or i.d./s.c.). Patients were studied following IRB approval (IRB #15398) and
      documentation of informed consent. The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov
      (NCT01425749), and was performed at the University of Virginia.

      MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic (0.5 ml) was administered five times (weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12) in
      extremities uninvolved with melanoma. Vaccines 1 and 3 were administered at the same site:
      other vaccine sites were rotated among available extremities. Subjects were randomized 1:1,
      within each stratum (AJCC stage II/III or IV), to i.m. (Group A) or i.d./s.c. (Group B)
      administration. The randomization code was generated by the study statistician using varying
      block sizes of 2 to 4. For group B patients, half of the dose was injected s.c., then the
      needle was withdrawn to the dermis, then advanced intradermally from that same puncture site
      and the remaining half dose was injected i.d. Immune responses were evaluated in a SIN and
      PBMC.
