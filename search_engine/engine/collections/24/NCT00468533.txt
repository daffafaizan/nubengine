    
      This is an open-label clinical trial of adult inpatients or outpatients with a diagnosis of
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder as measured by the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision
      (DSM-IV-TR). Eligible patients will have laboratory and clinical assessments completed. All
      procedures in this study are considered standard care and impose no additional risks to the
      patients. Participation is voluntary and recruitment will be on an "as come" basis.

      Discussion of Design and Control

      Because of the ethical concerns regarding withholding medication from seriously ill patients,
      this study does not employ a washout period. Though patients may have their antipsychotic
      drug held for up to 12 hours, this should not present any clinical problems in the majority
      of patients. This one day prevalence trial allows for clinical data to be collected in a
      timely manner.

      Study Population

      Most subjects recruited in this study are originated from a chronic psychiatric residential
      community. They are characterized by a regular medication with reliable drug compliance under
      a well-controlled diet in the unit. The subject of drug na√Øve will be denoted and analyzed
      separately in the later stage.

      Entry Procedures

      The patient and/or the patient's authorized legal representative prior to the patient's
      participation in the study will sign an informed consent document approved by an ethical
      review board, or similar body.

      Inclusion Criteria

      Patients may be included in the study if they meet the following criteria:

        1. Males and females 16-65 years of age

        2. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder

        3. Each individual must have a level of understanding sufficient to perform all tests and
           examinations required

        4. Individuals must be willing to fast after midnight the evening prior to study visit

        5. Individuals must be willing to provide a small sample of blood for evaluation

        6. Individuals must be willing to participate in a short 30-45 minute clinical interview

      Exclusion criteria

      Patients may be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

        1. A current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus

        2. Serious unstable illness such that death is anticipated within 1 year or intensive care
           unit hospitalization for the condition is anticipated within 6 months

        3. Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism

        4. Uncorrected tumor secreting ectopic prolactinemia

      Dosage and Administration The dosage of aripiprazole will be co-administrated since day 1
      with the fixed dosage of 10 mg aripiprazole per day for 1 week with the full dosage of
      previously used antipsychotics. The previous antipsychotics will be removed on day 8, and
      each individual will be assigned to either 10-15 mg aripiprazole per day (A arm) or 20-30 mg
      aripiprazole per day (B arm) or 10mg aripriprazole plus 1mg haldol per day (C arm) via the
      randomized procedure.

      mg haldol) 10mg (+ 1-2 mg haldol) Denotation: C arm is designed for the purpose of evaluation
      on add-on effect from typical antipsychotics with a high potency such as haldol. The
      difference between C arm and the other two might be minimal or significant due to different
      reaction in Asian population or Chinese population.

      In addition to the necessary prescription of antipsychotics described as above listed,
      adequate amount of benzodiazepines and anticholinergics are permitted to give to alleviate
      the possible anxiety, insomnia, and EPS as an adjunctive agent simultaneously.

      Clinical Laboratory Tests Clinical laboratory testing will be performed at Visit 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5, 6. See Table2 for a complete list of tests to be performed. Patients will be asked to fast
      after midnight (at least 8 hours) prior to labwork. If a patient is to take morning
      medications, he/she is asked to hold the morning medications until after the labwork is
      drawn. He or she may take the medication immediately after the labs have been drawn. Note: A
      patient is permitted to go off site to have his/her labs drawn. Labwork must be drawn within
      3 days of time the demographic and other data is/was gathered.
