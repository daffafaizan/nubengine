      investigational drug called ataluren. Evaluation procedures to determine if a participant
      qualifies for the study will be performed within 21 days prior to the start of treatment.
      Eligible participants who elect to enroll in the study will then participate in two 28-day
      treatment and follow-up periods (56 days total). There will be a 2-night stay at the clinical
      research center at the beginning and at the end of each 14 days of ataluren treatment, which
      means that there will be four 2-night stays at the clinical research center during the study.

      One of the measurements for the study is transepithelial potential difference (TEPD), which
      is also known as nasal potential difference and provides a sensitive evaluation of sodium and
      chloride transport directly in secretory epithelial cells. TEPD assessments are made on the
      nasal epithelium cells lining the inferior turbinate because these cells are easier to access
      than the respiratory epithelial cells lining the lower airways and have been shown to have
      the same ion transport characteristics. As an endpoint, TEPD has the advantage that it can
      detect chloride transport changes that are a quantitative integration of the presence,
      functional activity, and apical location of the CFTR in airway cells. Furthermore, it is a
      direct measure of CFTR activity that is not likely to be affected by supportive or palliative
      treatments for CF (with the possible exception of systemically administered aminoglycoside
      antibiotics).
