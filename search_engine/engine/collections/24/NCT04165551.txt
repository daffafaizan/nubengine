      of women without showing signs of infection. However, during delivery, it can be transmitted
      to the baby and, although in most cases it does not lead to disease, in a percentage of 5% of
      babies it causes serious infections that can trigger the death of the baby. In order to avoid
      this risk, a protocol of intra-partum preventive administration of antibiotics was implanted
      decades ago in women with a positive vaginal culture for this species in the weeks before
      birth. Taking into account the high percentage of women who show positive culture, this
      represents a high percentage of women who receive preventive antibiotic treatment with the
      consequences that this has for the mother's and baby's microbiota, as well as contributing to
      the generation of antibiotic resistance, a serious problem for today's society.

      The fecal microbiota is considered a source of bacteria for the vaginal microbiota. In fact,
      women who present S. agalactiae in the vaginal microbiota also have it in stool. Given the
      demonstrated ability of Lactobacillus to control certain bacterial populations, the ability
      of a battery of Lactobacillus strains to inhibit the growth of S. agalactiae in the context
      of the fecal microbiota was analyzed. From these tests the strain Lactobacillus BSL_PS71 was
      selected for its antibacterial capacity against S. agalactiae.
