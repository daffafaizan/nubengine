      i.e.,

      people who are not physicians. All other countries that have adopted aid-in-dying legislation

      require that a physician provides this assistance. This project probes the reasons for
      adopting this policy, and the advantages and the disadvantages of the Swiss model at the end
      of life. Are the Swiss aid-in-dying volunteers able to provide well-informed assistance to
      patients in need? Is the Swiss model one to be followed by other nations? The project will
      focus on the work of the Swiss aid-in-dying societies. The study draws on research in the
      fields of ethics, law and medicine. Its novelty lies in incorporating different methods of
      analysis, reflecting on the right to die with dignity within a liberal framework that aims to
      respect fundamental human rights.
