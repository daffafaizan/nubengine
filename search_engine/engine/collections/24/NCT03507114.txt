      compared with a wait list control group using a randomized control trial (RCT) design in a
      culture where this has not been tested before. The treatment approach was design to
      specifically target repetitive negative thinking (e.g., rumination and worries).
      Specifically, the treatment involves first a functional analysis design to help participants
      identify when rumination starts, distinguish between helpful versus unhelpful repetitive
      thinking, and learn more functional responses, and experiential and imagery exercises design
      to help them shift their thought processing towards concreteness, absorption and compassion.
      The main goal of the study is to test the effectiveness of this transdiagnostic approach in
      reducing symptom of depression and anxiety.
