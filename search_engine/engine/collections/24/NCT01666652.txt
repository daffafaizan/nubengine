    
      The study is designed to afford a safety and immunogenicity assessment of three Tetravalent
      Dengue Virus-Purified Inactivated Vaccine(TDENV-PIV) vaccine candidates, each formulated with
      a different adjuvant: either aluminum hydroxide, AS01E or AS03B (adjuvants used in Glaxo
      Smith Kline (GSK) Biologicals' hepatitis B candidate vaccine, malaria candidate vaccine and
      pandemic flu vaccine, respectively). Each vaccine candidate will contain 1 µg of purified
      virus antigen per each of the four DENV types. Additionally, the study will evaluate an alum
      adjuvanted TDENV-PIV vaccine candidate containing 4 µg of purified virus antigen per each of
      the four DENV types. The control group will receive a saline placebo. All experimental
      vaccinations will be administered according to a 2-dose schedule, 28 days apart.
