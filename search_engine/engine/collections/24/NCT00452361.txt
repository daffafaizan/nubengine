    
      This open-label, randomized, parallel-group, comparative, outpatient study will be conducted
      in multiple centers in Taiwan.

      The study will randomize approximately 120 patients. 80 patients will be randomized to the
      SRL therapy group (conversion from CI- to SRL-based immunosuppression: group A) and 40
      patients to the CI therapy group (continued CI therapy: group B).

      Dosage and Administration

      SRL Therapy: At the time of randomization on day 1, each patient will have been receiving:

        -  triple therapy with a CI (tacrolimus or CsA) that began at the time of transplantation
           or within 2 weeks thereafter AND

        -  corticosteroids corresponding to a dosage range of 2.5 to 15 mg/day for prednisone or
           prednisolone (2 to 12 mg/day for methylprednisolone) or the alternate day equivalent for
           at least 12 weeks before randomization, PLUS

        -  either MMF (minimum dose 500 mg/day)/MPS (minimum dose 360 mg/day) or AZA (minimum dose
           50 mg/day) for at least 12 weeks before randomization.

      SRL will be added to the immunosuppressive regimen for Group A. Group B will continue on this
      CI immunosuppressive regimen.
