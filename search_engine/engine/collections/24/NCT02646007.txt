      probably no single cause of avascular necrosis of the lunate. Its origin may involve multiple
      factors, such as the blood supply (arteries), the blood drainage (veins), and skeletal
      variations.

      Current treatments are: at the early phase only observation. In the more advanced phases
      surgical techniques such as bone decompression.

      A potential therapeutic strategy would be cell therapy, A source of such cells with a
      regenerative potential could be mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

      The investigators will evaluate safety and efficacy of implantation of autologous BM-MSC
      (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in 30 patients with Kienböck's disease in
      combination with bone decompression surgery. These patients will be followed up and data will
      be analyzed with spss(v16).
