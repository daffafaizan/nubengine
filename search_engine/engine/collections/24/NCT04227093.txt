      to AZM (250 mg twice daily) or placebo add-on therapy after surgery. Two surgical procedures
      will be performed throughout the study: barbed reposition pharyngoplasty (BRP) and upper
      airway stimulation (UAS) using electrical neurostimulation of the hypoglossal nerve.

      Treatment allocation will occur after a satisfactory recovery in patients undergoing BRP and
      after titration of the device settings in patients treated with UAS. Treatment outcome will
      be assessed approximately 10 weeks thereafter by in-laboratory polysomnography. Two on-site
      follow-up visits will be scheduled to assess adherence and adverse events. The maximum
      treatment duration per participant will amount to 16 weeks.

      Besides the aforementioned core clinical part, the study protocol will also include an
      optional exploratory part prior to surgery, assessing the physiological OSA traits and
      airflow features by means of polysomnography and drug-induced sleep endoscopy research
      measurements.
