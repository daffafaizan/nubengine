      curcumin in conjunction with an EGFR-TKI in patients with advanced NSCLC. The investigators
      will use an enhanced bioavailable formulation of curcumin (CURCUViva TM at 80 mg/ 1 capsule
      per day) approved and licensed by Health Canada (NPN 80027414) that has been shown to have
      2-3 times higher curcumin concentration in the blood as compared to previous clinical trials.
      As primary objective, the investigators will recruit 20 patients for a duration of 8 weeks to
      monitor adverse effects according to the the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria.Exploratory objectives would include assessing changes in health-related quality of
      life using the standardized FACT-L questionnaire and evaluating anti-inflammatory properties
      of curcumin by measuring CRP. If tolerable safety data is obtained, an expanded phase II
      trial will be designed.
