      patients who will be dosed with SAP-001 or placebo once daily (QD) for 28 days. Dose
      escalation from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 will occur after preliminary data are partially
      unblinded and safety data along with PK and PD parameters are analyzed and reviewed.
      Enrollment in Cohort 3 will begin after the last subject is randomized into Cohort 2.

      Prior to starting enrollment into Cohort 4, a complete safety assessment of Cohorts 1, 2 and
      3 will be performed to select the dose to be used in Cohort 4.
