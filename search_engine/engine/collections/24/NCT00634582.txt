      Primary

        -  To explore the relationship between paricalcitol therapy and markers of bone formation
           in patients with androgen-refractory, advanced prostate cancer with bone metastases.

      Secondary

        -  To explore the relationship between paricalcitol therapy and markers of bone resorption
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral paricalcitol once daily for 10 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically to determine markers of bone formation
      and resorption by ELISA; parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels by immunometric assay;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels by immunoassay; and 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
      1,25(OH)_2D levels by radioimmunoassay.

      Patients also undergo a bone densitometry (DEXA scan) at baseline and at 10 weeks to assess
      changes in bone strength.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to, during, and after completion of treatment.
      Questionnaires include the Pain Inventory, the Brief Pain Inventory, the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-G (FACT-G), and the Analgesic Use Diary (Narcotic Pain
      Medication Logbook).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year.
