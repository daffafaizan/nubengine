      hormone (GH) and insulin-like-growth-factor-1 (IGF-1) levels. Normalization of GH and IGF-1
      levels attenuates the morbidity (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, increased
      cancer risk, arthritis) and increased mortality associated with persistent GH and IGF-1
      elevation. The optimal approach to achieving these goals in patients with pituitary
      macroadenomas remains controversial. Available treatment modalities include transsphenoidal
      hypophysectomy, medical therapy (somatostatin analogues and/or dopaminergic agonists),
      radiotherapy, or a combination or these interventions. No randomized trials have been
      conducted to investigate whether surgical debulking of pituitary macroadenomas enhances the
      efficacy of medical therapy. This study is designed to rigorously investigate whether
      surgical debulking increases the efficacy of a long-acting depot somatostatin preparation,
      Sandostatin LAR, so that evidence-based optimal care may be offered to patients with
      acromegaly.
