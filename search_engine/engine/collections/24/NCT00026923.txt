      surgery is performed through small holes in the abdomen called ports. A camera is passed
      through one port for visualization. Laparoscopic surgery requires an assistant to hold the
      camera and help the operating surgeon view the surgical field. The assistant camera holder
      may be a surgeon or a robotic arm. The robotic arm is usually controlled by the operating
      surgeon. In this study, a robotic arm holding the camera will be used, and will be controlled
      by a surgeon outside the operating room.
