      millions of adults in the United States. Anticholinergic and beta-3 agonist medications are
      commonly used to treat OAB but compliance is low due to variable efficacy and bothersome side
      effects. The existence of a urinary microbiome was recently discovered and early
      investigations have revealed that lower Lactobacillus load is correlated with the presence of
      OAB symptoms and a poorer response to anticholinergic therapy.

      This proposed pilot study is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of
      concomitant probiotic therapy in women initiating medication therapy for OAB to explore how
      probiotics influence response to anticholinergic and beta-3 agonist medications, investigate
      whether probiotic therapy alters the urinary microbiome, and assess for predictors of
      response to therapy.

      Primary Aim: To explore how concomitant probiotic therapy influences response to medication
      for OAB in a RCT

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To investigate whether 4 weeks of probiotic therapy alters the urinary microbiome.

        2. To assess for predictors of response to therapy
