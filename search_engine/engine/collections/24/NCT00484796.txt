      contralateral median nerve are established: A reduction of amplitude and a delay in latency
      may represent a sensible marker of imminent cerebral ischemia. This study will evaluate a new
      concept by using trigeminal nerve evoked somatosensory evoked potentials in comparison to the
      established MED-SEP. Beside the comparison of two methods of neuromonitoring, this study will
      investigate the neurological long-term outcome (90-day evaluation) with different
      neuropsychological tests for the detection of cognitive deficits.
