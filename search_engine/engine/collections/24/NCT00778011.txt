      in nausea and vomiting treatment for patients in the ED with many different causes. We will
      also look for cost effectiveness as well, since Metoclopramide is much less expensive than
      Ondansetron, which is less expensive at lower doses. There is little research about nausea
      medication in the ED literature even though these medications are used frequently in the ED
      for many causes of nausea.
