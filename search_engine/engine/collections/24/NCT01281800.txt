      mesothelioma. Three arguments against such a position are: 1. Pemetrexed in combination with
      cisplatin was registered for mesothelioma on the basis of superiority over cisplatin alone, a
      clearly suboptimal control arm; 2. Several Phase II trials of gemcitabine in standard doses
      or as low-dose in long infusion in combination with cisplatin have shown at least comparable
      activity; 3. Due to high cost, pemetrexed is not available to many patients in countries with
      limited health care resources. During the past five years, our research team in Ljubljana
      conducted a Phase II trial of low-dose gemcitabine (250 mg/m2) in 6-hours infusion and
      cisplatin for patients with mesothelioma. In an unselected population of patients including
      those in poor performance status, elderly, patients with advanced extrathoracic disease and
      patients in progression after previous chemotherapy, the response rate was 54%, and median
      survival was 16.5 months. On the basis of this favourable experience and in search of
      cost-effective treatment for mesothelioma, we here propose a randomised Phase II clinical
      trial to compare efficacy and safety profile of cisplatin and pemetrexed against cisplatin
      and low-dose gemcitabine in long infusion. The primary endpoints are response rate and time
      to progression; secondary endpoints are survival, toxicity and quality of life.
