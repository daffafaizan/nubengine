      magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) to investigate their
      uses for pain relief in humans: healthy human subjects, acute pain patients, and chronic pain
      patients. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings will be
      collected to achieve the following objectives:

      Objective 1 aims to determine the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on the
      pain-related brain activities during pain processing. We hypothesize that noninvasive brain
      stimulation approaches will increase or decrease cortical activity upon processing painful
      input.

      Objective 2 aims to determine the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on pain intensity
      and/or pain-related behavioral assessments. We hypothesize that noninvasive brain stimulation
      will influence pain-intensity and/or pain-related behavioral assessments.

      Objective 3 aims to investigate the correlation between brain activity and pain relief after
      noninvasive brain stimulation. We hypothesize that noninvasive brain stimulation will
      suppress cortical activity in pain-related brain areas, reduce pain intensity, and/or improve
      pain-related behavioral assessments.
