      hemiplegia are eligible for participation. Following an initial screening visit involving a
      history and physical examination, subjects will be entered in to the study if they have
      significant spasticity of shoulder internal rotation/adduction associated with pain rated at
      least a 4 on the VAS for pain. Subjects will also be given a cognitive screening in which
      they will be asked to rate pain in hypothetical situations.

      Shoulder pain is a frequent complication following hemiplegic stroke, and may result in
      further disability. Spasticity is also a complication following stroke . Botulinum toxin is
      used in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity and may also have pain modulating effects.
      Participants in this study will be asked to make total of 6 visits over a period of
      approximately 13 weeks. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 100 to 200 units of botulinum
      toxin type injected into the pectoralis major at the second visit. If there is significant
      spasticity for shoulder extension, subjects will also receive injections into the teres
      major. Subjects will be followed up with assessments of pain, functioning, active and passive
      range of motion and depression following the initial injection. At the 12 weeks post
      injection visit, the blinding will be broken and subjects initially injected with placebo
      will be injected with the active drug. This will be done to give all subjects an opportunity
      to receive the active drug, as well as to assess the effects of any differences with delayed
      treatment. All subjects will return 4 weeks later to repeat the same assessments above.
      Subjects will be called at one year post study enrollment for repeat pain ratings and for
      information regarding subsequent treatments.
