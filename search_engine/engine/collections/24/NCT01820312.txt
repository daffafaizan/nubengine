      be commercially available drug product dispensed by a licensed pharmacist at UAMS.
      Radiotherapy will be delivered using either the TomoTherapy Treatment System (TomoTherapy,
      Inc.) or the Varian High Energy Linear Accelerator (Varian Medical Systems).

      Subjects will undergo CT imaging (to include neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis) as part of the
      standard of care approximately 7 to 21 days prior to initiation of this therapy. Additional
      CT imaging will be done at UAMS approximately 3 months after completion of protocol therapy
      and every 3 months subsequently until progression or completion of the study whichever comes
      first. These CT imaging's will be obtained for recurrent tumor evaluation and determination
      of the presence or absence of distant metastasis, as part of the standard of care.
