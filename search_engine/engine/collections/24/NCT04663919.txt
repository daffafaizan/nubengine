      contrary, in anorexia nervosa, there is a decrease in adipose tissue enough to impair
      neuroendocrine functions. Adipose tissue is formed by loosely binding lipid-filled cells
      called adipocytes and is now considered an important part of energy metabolism. Adipokines it
      secretes play a role in many physiological processes of the body such as nutrition, appetite,
      energy balance, insulin, and glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, regulation of blood
      pressure, vascular remodeling, coagulation, and inflammation.

      Therefore, changes in the amount of body fat in these two patient groups, which are at the
      two ends of the spectrum, affect both the biochemical parameters and physiological functions
      of the patients in different ways. It is expected that both adipokine levels and biochemical
      parameters will approach the values of healthy subjects with a decrease in adipose tissue of
      clinically morbidly obese patients and an increase in adipose tissue of patients with AN.
      However, in some studies comparing the parameters of patients with constitutionally weak
      patients and patients with AN, results contrary to expectations were obtained. In this study,
      we compared the extent to which weight changes changed adipokines and correlated with
      biochemical parameters based on healthy and normal-weight volunteers.
