    
      The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the role of paroxetine in the acute treatment
      of chronic primary insomnia. Paroxetine taken on a nightly basis in combination with sleep
      hygiene therapy will produce a greater number of diagnostic responders in acute treatment,
      compared to a placebo and sleep hygiene control condition, in a randomized, double-blinded,
      six-week acute treatment trial. EEG sleep, sleep quality, and daytime well-being, and daytime
      functioning will also show superior treatment effects during acute treatment with paroxetine
      plus sleep hygiene, as compared with the placebo control condition.

      A total of 66 patients with primary insomnia, as defined by DSM-IV criteria, will be
      randomized (1:1) to receive paroxetine plus sleep hygiene therapy (P+SH-a) or placebo plus
      sleep hygiene therapy (PL+SH-a) in weekly acute treatment sessions evolving over a six-week
      interval in a double-blinded, parallel group design.
