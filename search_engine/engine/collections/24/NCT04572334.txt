      undergone cataract surgery 2 to 12 months prior. A written informed consent will be obtained
      from each patient. Patients with ICB00 or ZCB00 implanted lenses will be included.

      Autorefraction measurements will be performed consecutively, each patient will be measured
      three times with each device. Two independent observers will perform subjective refraction
      and will be masked to the autorefraction outcome.

      We would like to include 50 eyes with ICB00 and 50 eyes with ZCB00 lens implanted. For the
      estimation of sample size, we used data from Wang et al. (Wang L, Misra M, Palikaris IG, Koch
      DD. J Cataract Refract Surg 2002; 28: 276-282) that compared the refractive outcome of
      pseudophakic eyes and determined a mean spherical equivalent of -0.76 + 0.96 D for group I
      and -0.44 + 1.13 for group II, thus leading to an effect size of 0.2. The effect size was
      used for ANOVA test for repeated measurements within factor, with alpha < 0.05, power of 80%
      and a correlation of 0.5 between the two groups gave us an estimated of sample size of 42
      patient. To allow patient drop out a number of 50 eyes will be included per lens group (in
      total 100 eyes).

      When different lenses are implanted (one eye received ZCB00 and the other Eyhance), than both
      eyes of the patient will be included.
