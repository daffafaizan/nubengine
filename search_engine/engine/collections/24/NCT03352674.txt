      Lantus (Sanofi-Aventis) in controlling blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients,
      but the immunogenicity potential of this product has not been known. Therefore, the present
      study is aiming to compare immunogenicity of Insulin Glargine (Kalbe Farma) and Lantus
      (Sanofi-Aventis) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in an open-label randomised multicenter
      clinical study.
