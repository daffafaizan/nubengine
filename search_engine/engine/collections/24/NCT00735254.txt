      examination, and a photograph will be taken at each visit. At the end of the three
      treatments, a final personal interview, clinical evaluation and photograph will be taken to
      document the effects of the laser treatments. At the end of the study, the patient will have
      the option to receive two additional laser treatments four weeks apart, also at no cost, to
      the entire scar.
