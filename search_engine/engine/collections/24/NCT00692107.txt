    
      Patients were stratified by hospital, treatment group, age and (neo)adjuvant hormonal
      therapy. Four treatment groups with specific radiation volumes were defined depending on the
      estimated risk of tumour involvement of the seminal vesicles (based on T-stage, initial PSA
      and Gleason Score or Differentiation Grade).The dose was delivered with daily fractions of 2
      Gy, five times a week. The total duration of the treatment was 7 weeks for patients treated
      to 68 Gy and 8 week for 78 Gy.

      Objectives:

        -  To test in a phase III randomised study the hypothesis that higher radiation doses lead
           to a higher freedom from failure rate for localized prostate cancer.

        -  To test the hypothesis that a higher freedom from failure rate leads to a longer
           disease-free survival and overall survival.

        -  To limit acute and late toxicity with respect to gastro-intestinal and urological
           toxicity.

        -  To evaluate different PSA related endpoints for local failure and distant metastasis.

        -  To establish a database of patients treated to escalated doses with Dose Volume
           Histograms of the normal tissues at risk for each individual patient and common toxicity
           endpoints.

        -  To validate a model to estimate normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) of
           rectum and bladder, based on the above-mentioned database, and to obtain reliable
           parameter values for NTCP estimations.
