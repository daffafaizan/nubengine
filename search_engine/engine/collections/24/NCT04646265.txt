    
      The study is designed as a prospective single center comparative clinical trial to
      investigate the biomechanical properties of the periodontal tissues in 30 patients with
      periodontal disease.

      Success of non-surgical periodontal therapy between baseline and 30 post-op will be assessed
      by general clinical measurements (KT, PD, CAL, BOP) as well as by biomechanical analysis.
      Besides assessment for regular treatment effectiveness, safety parameter such as wound
      healing and adverse events will be assessed.

      Additionally 10 periodontally healthy persons without local inflammation and bone loss shall
      be monitored and used a control group for reference to the test teeth.
