    
      BMN 190 is a recombinant form of human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), the enzyme deficient
      in patients with CLN2 diseases (also known as classical late-infantile CLN2, cLINCL, or
      Jansky-Bielschowsky disease), a form of Batten Disease. As an enzyme replacement therapy
      (ERT), BMN 190 is designed to help restore TPP1 enzyme activity. BMN 190 is designed to
      reduce the progressive, pathologic accumulation of lysosomal storage material. 190-203 is a
      Phase 2 open-label, multicenter study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of BMN 190 in pediatric patients < 18 years of age with CLN2 disease. Study drug
      dosing will be determined by the patient's age and administered via intracerebroventricular
      (ICV) infusion every other week (qow), for a duration of 144 weeks.
