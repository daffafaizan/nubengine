      improve glycemic control for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (ADA). It has been reported that
      metformin decrease plasma concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in patients with type 2
      diabetes which might be associated with the inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue.
      However, the inhibition of lipolysis during physical exercise, would not be probably
      beneficial. Thus, the effect of metformin on lipolysis during exercise is investigated in
      this protocol. As the lipolysis regulation is often impaired in obese and diabetic patients,
      the healthy lean men were chosen for this pilot study. Glycerol will be analyzed as a measure
      of lipolytic rate in adipose tissue and in plasma. Lactate levels will be observed. Our
      findings should provide a new background about the combination of physical activity and
      metformin medication.
