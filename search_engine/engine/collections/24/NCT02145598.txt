    
      Primary objective

      - Estimate the gain in progression-free survival (PFS) by maintenance with Lenalidomide after
      induction with VMP in elderly patients or patients unfit for highdose chemotherapy in
      comparison with placebo after VMP

      Secondary study objectives

        -  To compare response rates of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo

        -  To compare overall survival probabilities between patients treated with Lenalidomide
           maintenance and patients without maintenance treatment

        -  To compare the safety of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo

        -  To compare the QoL of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo

        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of Rd for poor responders on VMP
