      for social phobia (i.e., the iSOFIE) by comparing it to a waitlist control group. iSOFIE was
      derived from a previously tested program (Furmark, Holmstr√∂m, Sparthan, Carlbring, &
      Andersson, 2006) and has been significantly shortened while retaining the most important
      elements. The second aim of the study is to track the potential changes in participants'
      thinking patterns. While this intervention is primarily based on the cognitive-behavioral
      model of SAD (Clark and Wells, 1995), and no specific Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy
      (REBT, Ellis & Dryden, 1997) will be implemented, it is hypothesized that the cognitive
      restructuring and exposure exercises will make participants less prone to irrational thinking
      (as measured by the Attitude and Belief Scale-II (ABS-II, DiGiuseppe, Leaf, Exner, & Robin,
      1988). To our knowledge, no study has investigated whether an iCBT program for SAD has the
      potential to alter participants' irrational thinking patterns. Moreover, because this is
      among the first guided Internet-delivered interventions conducted in Romania, the treatment
      credibility of the program will be investigated. Finally, the predictive power of anxiety
      sensitivity for both SAD symptoms and the treatment effectiveness will be investigated.
