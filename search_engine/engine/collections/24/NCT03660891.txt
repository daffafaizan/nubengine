      methods during clinical practice.

      the first (TOF Watch) measures the musculus adductor pollicis acceleration while the second
      method (TOF Cuff Monitor) uses a blood pressure cuff to measure the pressure changes induced
      by the upper arm muscles.

      During general anesthesia when NMB (neuromuscular block) is required both methods are used.
      Every 5 minutes, if clinical required, the NMB is monitored by TOF-PTC. If the measurement of
      TOF is zero the monitor continues by measuring PTC ( the system will measure TOF followed by
      PTC if TOF is zero) TOF-PTC is recorded and later compared for identity or systematic
      difference in one or the other direction.

      The measured answer can be TOF 4 (4 answers) with a ratio between answer 1 and 4 expressed
      and a percentage, TOF 3 (3 answers), TOF 2, TOF 1, TOF 0 + PTC 20, TOF 0 + PTC 19, up to TOF
      0 + PTC 0
