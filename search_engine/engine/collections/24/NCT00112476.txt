      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of temsirolimus when
      given together with bryostatin 1 in patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate the extent and duration of inhibition of p70^S6kinase phosphorylation in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells with tumor growth or reduction in these patients.

      II. Correlate the phosphorylation total and phospho-AKT and total and phospho ribosomal S6
      protein (indicators of mTOR activation) with antitumor effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      III. Correlate tumor expression of phospho-ERK1 and -ERK2 with antitumor effects of this
      regimen in these patients.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and temsirolimus IV
      over 30 minutes once on days 8, 15, and 22 during course 1. On subsequent courses patients
      receive bryostatin 1 and temsirolimus once on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temsirolimus until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
