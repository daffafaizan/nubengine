    
      This is a prospective, 1-arm, monocenter study designed to evaluate the time course of early
      re-activation of CNV assessed by High Resolution OCT. An OCT-guided high frequency (up to
      2-weekly) intravitreal ranibizumab treatment in CNV due to AMD may prevent further growth and
      early re-growth of CNV as evaluated by OCT at a weekly basis.

      Consenting, enrolled patients will receive one 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injection at
      baseline (month 0). Afterwards all patients will undergo a weekly OCT assessment. Further
      treatments, which can maximally be applied as often as 2-weekly, are triggered by persisting
      or new signs of CNV activity at OCT as defined by intraretinal cysts or subretinal fluid. For
      this study, a month is defined as 28 days, a 2-week period as 14 days. During the 12-month
      study period, a maximum of 24 ranibizumab injections may be administered.

      An interim analysis will not be performed. The study will be conducted in compliance with the
      protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).
