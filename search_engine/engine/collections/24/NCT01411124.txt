      placebo-and active-controlled 3-period crossover study designed to assess the effect of GEn
      600 mg on simulated driving performance. Subjects will receive each of 3 treatments in a
      randomized order: GEn 600 mg, placebo and placebo/diphenhydramine 50 mg. Each treatment
      period will consist of 6 days, with subjects being dosed at approximately 5 pm on each dosing
      day. The placebo /diphenhydramine treatment will consist of placebo on Days 1-4 and 6 and 50
      mg diphenhydramine on Day 5. Placebo will be administered on Day 6 in all treatment periods
      to ensure washout of drug prior to the start of the next treatment period. Simulated driving
      performance will be assessed at baseline (prior to randomization) and on Day 5 in the evening
      (7-9 pm) and on Day 6 between7-9 am and between 11am-1pm for each treatment period.
