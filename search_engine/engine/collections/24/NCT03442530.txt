      intervention (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 5 A's) through use
      of a non-physician healthcare champion from within the clinic's existing infrastructure. This
      Tobacco use in Pregnancy Intervention for Cessation (ToPIC) will involve training the
      identified healthcare provider to become a Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist (CTTS) and
      to administer the 5 A's to pregnant Medicaid patients receiving prenatal care through two
      high-volume Kentucky obstetrics clinics. This trial will provide evidence to evaluate this
      approach to delivering an established intervention in clinical practice.

      The Investigators propose to test the effectiveness of the clinical intervention by using a
      two-armed cluster randomized controlled design. Eligible participants will be randomized to
      the intervention (ToPIC) or standard of care for smoking cessation in pregnancy. This pilot
      project will gather quantitative and qualitative data for a mixed-method, multi-stakeholder
      process evaluation of intervention training and delivery. Furthermore, the Investigators' use
      of Medicaid claims data to examine healthcare utilization outside of maternal and infant
      well-care visits will enhance understanding of the strengths and limitations of these data
      for future evaluations. This study has the potential to significantly impact the most
      vulnerable in Kentucky, where rates of tobacco use among pregnant women are among the highest
      in the nation.
