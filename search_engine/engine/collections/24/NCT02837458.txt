      unmodulated currents about 5 KHz can cause a peripheral nerve block. However electric
      currents with these high frequencies that are usually used for the treatment of pain in
      humans are interrupted or modulated (i.e. interferential currents).

      It has show that the diameter of the nerve it is related with the frequency to produce the
      conduction block. For this reason we decided to applied 30KHz to observe the effects on pain
      in patients with whiplash and to compare versus sham stimulation.

      Only one study has applied 5KHz on experimental pain and they have demonstrated changes in
      somatosensory thresholds.
