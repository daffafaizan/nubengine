      determine the most effective training model: verbal instructions, instructional video, or use
      of a mannequin. Caregivers will undergo a training curriculum, and 60 caregivers (20 assigned
      to each educational model) will be matched into three groups and assigned to participate in
      one of three educational models in the SIM Center. Pre-and post-training questionnaires will
      be distributed to assess provider knowledge and comfort level. Scoring of caregiver technique
      administering rectal diazepam to a mannequin and time to RM administration will be obtained
      to compare between the three educational arms of the study. Thirty additional patients (10
      per group) will not receive an assessment of caregiver technique administering RM to the
      mannequin prior to the educational intervention to control for exposure to the mannequin.
      Ultimately, the most effective educational method in this simulation pilot study will be
      expanded to other RM types (e.g. intranasal midazolam, buccal lorazepam), standardized, and
      brought back to the clinics/bedside throughout the hospital.
