      I. To evaluate the pathological complete response rate in patients with T3 and T4 rectal
      cancers when treated preoperatively with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and
      concurrent radiotherapy (XRT).

      II. To evaluate the resection rate for T3 and T4 rectal cancers and the expected versus
      actual type of resection (abdominoperinal resection [APR] vs. low anterior resection [LAR]
      vs. LAR/coloanal anastomosis).

      III. To make preliminary observations of patient survival and patterns of recurrence for this
      treatment combination.

      IV. To gain additional experience regarding the toxicity and tolerability of this
      preoperative and postoperative regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      PREOPERATIVE CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo radiotherapy (total dose to the tumor bed
      was 5040 cGy) once daily (QD) 5 days a week and receive capecitabine 825 mg/m^2 orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive oxaliplatin 50 mg/m^2
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV over
      30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 during radiotherapy.

      SURGERY: Approximately 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo
      surgical resection. Patients whose tumors are not completely resected or who have metastatic
      disease discontinue protocol therapy.

      POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Approximately 4-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium 400 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab 5
      mg/kg IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil 2400 mg/m^2 IV
      continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 9 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive up to 3
      additional courses of leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and bevacizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.
