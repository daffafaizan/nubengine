    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a great magnitude public health problem with
      an associated increased mortality and a high cost (consumption of health care resources and
      loss of health related quality of life (HRQoL)). The comprehensive approach to this complex
      disease, focusing self-care promotion, improves HRQoL and the patients" clinical status, as
      shown by several studies, although further investigation is needed to confirm these results
      in the field of Primary Care (PC) and to formulate clear recommendations on the more
      effective type of intervention.

      Hypothesis: In (moderate-severe) COPD patients, a structured self-management intervention
      plan in the setting of primary care, is more effective than usual treatment on the main
      outcomes associated with the disease: HRQoL, lung function, exacerbations and hospital
      admissions, at 6, 12 and 24 months of follow-up.

      Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a comprehensive intervention plan to promote self-care
      and improve HRQoL in people with COPD in PC.

      Methods: Multicenter randomized controlled trial, conducted at PC centers in Barcelona.

      Determinations: Specific standardized and validated questionnaires, as the St George's
      Respiratory for the HRQoL. Statistical analysis: Intention to treat analysis. Descriptive
      statistics of the variables of the intervention and the control group to assess their
      homogeneity at the beginning of the study. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to
      assess differences among intervention groups.

      Expected results: A significant improvement in HRQoL attributable to the intervention
      performed in patients with COPD Applicability and Relevance: To implement the intervention
      plan in clinical practice and to standardize its content.
