      to vaccination. The aging process and certain diseases, like type-2 diabetes, have been
      characterized as chronic inflammatory conditions. These individuals have higher rates of
      influenza disease and health care costs; hence, yearly vaccination is recommended. There is a
      paucity of information comparing vaccination in these high-risk groups and identifying
      biomarkers that can predict vaccine efficacy. The investigators hypothesize that elderly and
      diabetic patients have reduced responses to seasonal influenza vaccination that are inversely
      proportional to their level of chronic inflammation. In this pilot proposal, the
      investigators will examine adult and elderly diabetic and non-diabetic adults for markers of
      inflammation and vaccine efficacy before and after influenza vaccination. These studies will
      help our understanding of how chronic inflammatory diseases impact immunologic function and
      future research on mitigation strategies.
