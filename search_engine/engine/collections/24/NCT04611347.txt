    
      Study Population: 40 subjects with presenting with thumb basal joint arthritis over the age
      of 18 will be recruited from the UVA Hand Center.

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: This will be a single-site study
      conducted at the UVA Hand Center at the University of Virginia.

      Description of Study Intervention: The study design will be a double-blind randomized control
      trial with crossover. Treatment will be blinded to the subjects and investigators. Patients
      will be randomly assigned 2 weeks of the case (CBD) or control cream and then crossover to
      the other cream for 2 more weeks. Patients will apply the topical cream at their thumb basal
      joint one time daily for 1 hour. The subjects will be advised to observe for physiologic
      changes, skin changes, or other adverse effects. If mild to serious adverse events are
      noticed, the creams will be removed immediately and appropriate care and observation will be
      taken. Each condition will last for 2 weeks and then subjects will be contacted by the study
      coordinator to facilitate crossover into the other condition. To capture any delayed-onset
      adverse events, including those related to skin changes that might develop after the drug is
      discontinued, subjects will attend a follow-up visit seven (7) days following the last dose
      of investigational cream.

      Study Duration: This study will last one year from the beginning of subject recruitment to
      data analysis.

      Participant Duration: Subjects will be enrolled in this study for approximately five (5)
      weeks from Screening until the final Study Visit.
