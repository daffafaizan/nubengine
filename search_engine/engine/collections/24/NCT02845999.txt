      cyclophosphamide, 25 mg/m2 intravenous fludarabine for 5 consecutive days and cetuximab. A
      lymphapheresis from an haploidentical related donor will be performed and T cells will be
      depleted . Allogenic NK cells will then be adoptively transferred by hepatic intraarterial
      infusion according to a dose escalation protocol (three doses with at least three patients
      per cohort)to define the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Then 10 more patients will receive the
      recommended NK cell dose.

      Dose escalation protocol : 3.10^6 ; 8.10^6 and 12.10^6 cells/kg of recipient body weight.
