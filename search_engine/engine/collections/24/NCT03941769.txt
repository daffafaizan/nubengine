      I. To determine the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting
      toxicities (DLT) of recombinant interleukin-7 (interleukin 7 [IL-7, CYT107]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and BK viral
      infections in cord blood transplant (CBT) patients who receive three doses of IL-7 following
      engraftment.

      II. To calculate the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cumulative
      incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and cumulative incidence of relapse.

      III. To evaluate the effects of CYT107 on the recovery of T, natural killer (NK) and B cell
      populations and their functions in vitro; these data will be used to identify the optimal
      dose to move to a phase II trial.

      IV. To obtain information about the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CYT107 by estimating time
      to maximum concentration (Tmax), concentration maximum (Cmax), half-life, clearance and
      area-under-the-curve (AUC).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Within 60-180 days after CBT, patients receive recombinant interleukin-7 intramuscularly (IM)
      or subcutaneously (SC) once per week for 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 3 years.
