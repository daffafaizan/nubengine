      patients with cystic fibrosis has increased dramatically over the last decade. Epidemiologic
      evidence suggests that persistent infection with MRSA may result in an increased rate of
      decline in FEV1 and shortened survival. Treatment of MRSA is a top priority. Inhaled
      antibiotics offer the advantage of high concentrations of antibiotic at the site of infection
      (the airway) while minimizing systemic side effects. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic
      that has activity against MRSA. Anecdotal and retrospective peer-reviewed studies have
      demonstrated that inhaled vancomycin is safe and potentially effective in patients with
      cystic fibrosis and MRSA airway infection. Data evaluating the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin
      in sputum are needed before pursuing treatment trials.
