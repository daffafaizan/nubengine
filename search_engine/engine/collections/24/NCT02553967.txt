      will address a quality of life questionnaire at baseline. Then the study procedures differ
      depending on which group the patient belongs to.

      Immediate breast reconstruction group : Six months after surgery (or six months after the
      implantation of the definitive prosthesis in case of use of a tissue expander), a
      postoperative fMRI will be performed and patients will be asked to complete a quality of life
      form and a satisfaction form.

      Secondary breast reconstruction group :

        -  In the two months preceding the surgery, a preoperative fMRI will be performed.

        -  Six months after surgery (or six months after the implantation of the definitive
           prosthesis in case of use of a tissue expander), a postoperative fMRI will be performed
           and patients will be asked to complete a quality of life form and a satisfaction form.
