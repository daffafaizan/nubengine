    
      Fluoropyrimidine and/or platinum-based chemotherapy is now regarded as a standard first-line
      treatment in AGC patients because it has shown superiority in terms of response rate and time
      to disease progression compared with 5-FU monotherapy and other combinations in phase III
      trials. Despite the lack of evidence for benefit associated with administering salvage
      chemotherapy, it is a common practice to offer further chemotherapy for AGC patients after
      first-line failure. For patients who failed after fluoropyrimidine and platinum, taxanes
      (paclitaxel or docetaxel) and irinotecan have been evaluated extensively in the second-line
      setting.

      Currently, there is no evidence that SLC in patients with AGC will result in substantial
      prolongation of survival and there is potential for toxicity from the treatment.
