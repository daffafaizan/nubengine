    
      PROCEPT BioRobotics has developed the AquaBeam, a personalized image-guided waterjet
      resection system that utilizes a high-velocity saline stream to resect and remove prostate
      tissue in males suffering from Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH. The AquaBeam
      System is intended for the resection and removal of prostate tissue in patients experiencing
      LUTS. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of
      obtaining hemostasis with commercially approved catheters following prostate resection using
      the AquaBeam. The time frame of the study is 7 days. Up to 30 participants will be included
      in this single-site clinical trial. The trial is a single-arm prospective, interventional
      clinical study. Results will be analyzed to determine the safety and efficacy of commercially
      approved catheters for the achievement of acute hemostasis without the need for
      cauterization.
