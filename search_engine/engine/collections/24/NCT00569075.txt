      on comparisons of clinical measurements made with a calibrated probe and nonstandardized
      radiographs over time. Both methods detect periodontal breakdown only after it has occurred.
      Therefore, considerable emphasis has been placed on identifying more specific and sensitive
      methods to diagnose and detect periodontal disease progression. The overall goal of this
      project is to determine whether specific apoptosis-associated proteins, specifically
      fibronectin (FN) fragments, caspase-3, soluble Fas, and soluble Fas ligand, sampled from
      gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) can be used as markers for periodontal disease progression.
