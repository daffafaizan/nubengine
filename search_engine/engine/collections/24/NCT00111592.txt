      elderly male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Consequently, the group of patients
      diagnosed with LUTS in primary care is very heterogeneous, and daily care varies widely.

      Consequently, efficacy trials of alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and surgery
      performed in selected, well defined homogeneous populations cannot easily be generalised to
      the heterogeneous primary care situation.

      A practical randomised trial enrolling patients on the basis of symptoms have the advantage
      of being of immediate practical value.

      We compare a treatment protocol with clear indications for therapy with current usual care in
      a population selected on symptoms rather than well defined diseases or definite test results.

      Two hundred eight subjects were randomised into intervention (N=104) and control (N=104)
      conditions.

      After two years of follow-up, IPSS scores, bother scores, maximum urinary flow rates and the
      incidence of acute urinary retention and urinary tract infections have been compared.
