    
      VA106483 is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor (V2-receptor) agonist that is being developed
      for the treatment of nocturia.

      The antidiuretic effect of V2-receptor stimulation in the kidneys is well established through
      the use of the peptide agonist, desmopressin, which shows clinical benefit in diabetes
      insipidus, primary nocturnal enuresis and nocturia.

      Nocturia, defined as waking to void at least once per night between periods of sleep, is a
      common complaint and shows an age-dependent increase in both prevalence and severity (number
      of nocturnal voids). It is the most bothersome symptom of benign prostatic hypertrophy and
      has been linked to an age-dependent loss in circadian release of endogenous nocturnal
      vasopressin and consequent over production of urine at night (nocturnal polyuria).

      Correlation between nocturnal urine volume and nocturnal void frequency has been demonstrated
      in previous studies of V2-receptor agonists.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose response relationship of VA106483 and
      nocturnal urine volumes.
