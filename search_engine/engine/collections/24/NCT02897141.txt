      and treatments has significantly altered the course of the disease. While AIDS-related
      illnesses are no longer the primary threat, a new set of HIV-associated complications have
      emerged, resulting in a chronic disease that for many will span several decades of life. The
      ability to self-manage adverse symptoms of HIV illness has been shown to improve
      patient-centered outcomes. In response to this need, a team at University of California, San
      Francisco (UCSF) developed a paper-based symptom management manual with self-management
      strategies for 21 common HIV/AIDS adverse symptoms (PCOR evidence). The efficacy of the
      manual was demonstrated in a 775-person randomized controlled trial (RCT) over three months
      at 12 sites. However, subsequent use of these strategies has been very limited; mHealth
      offers an ideal platform for the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based
      strategies for HIV symptom management. Due to the high incidence of HIV among racial and
      ethnic minority populations, it is appropriate to develop mHealth tools tailored to the needs
      of these populations. mHealth technology has the potential to address many of the healthcare
      needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) including symptom management. In response to
      these current issues, this study seeks to inform the development and testing of a mHealth
      application that will incorporate findings from PCOR studies to improve the outcomes of PLWH.
      To improve outcomes for those most in need, study activities are focused on communities with
      the greatest burden of HIV in the US, including racial and ethnic minorities and those of low
      socioeconomic status.
