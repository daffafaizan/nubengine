      also expressed in skeletal muscle. However, the skeletal phenotype is undetermined. We have
      identified three families in which HCM is caused by an alpha-tropomyosin mutation. Several
      family members of one of these kindreds have also inherited a distinct skeletal myopathy
      called oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) which is caused by mutations of the poly(A)
      binding protein-2 gene (PABP2). The pathologic hallmark of this disease is unique nuclear
      filament inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers. It is possible that the skeletal muscle
      phenotype is more severe when the two diseases occur in the same patient. We wish to perform
      skeletal muscle biopsies to determine the skeletal myopathy in patients with
      alpha-tropomyosin, in patients with PABP2 gene mutation, and in patients who have inherited
      both diseases.
