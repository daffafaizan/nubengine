      and one of the main mechanisms leading to CD4 lymphopenia. This has led to the hypothesis
      that medications that act directly to suppress immune activation and normalize T cell
      turnover, could be used in HIV infection. The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the
      effect of the immunomodulatory agent, leflunomide, on CD4+ T cell proliferation in HIV
      infected adults. HIV infected adults who have stable HIV viral loads and are not taking
      antiretrovirals will receive leflunomide or placebo for 28 days. CD4+ T cell proliferation
      will be measured as percent Ki67 expression, and the change in expression from baseline to
      day 28 will be compared between groups. Various studies measuring immune parameters such as
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells counts and level of activation will be collected as well as safety
      studies and HIV viral loads. The primary study risk is adverse reaction to leflunomide. The
      study will be double-blinded randomized 2:1 (leflunomide versus placebo) and will be reviewed
      by a DSMB. Total enrollment for the study will be 18 patients.
