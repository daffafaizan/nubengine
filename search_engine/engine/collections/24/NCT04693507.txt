      informed consent will undergo an up to 7 day screening period to determine eligibility for
      study entry. On Day 0, patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be enrolled in an
      open-label manner and will receive a loading dose of teverelix TFA (one subcutaneous (SC)
      injection in the abdomen and one intramuscular (IM) injection in the buttock). Patients will
      then receive maintenance doses of teverelix TFA (one SC injection in the abdomen) at 4- or
      6-weekly intervals up to week 24. The patients will return for a final assessment 4 weeks
      after their last maintenance dose injection.

      The initial dosing regimen to be tested (Group 1) is:

      Loading Dose = 120 mg teverelix TFA SC + 120 mg teverelix TFA IM Maintenance Dose = 120 mg
      teverelix TFA SC every 6 weeks

      If this dosing regimen is unsuccessful (more than 2 (of 20) patients fail treatment) then
      recruitment to Group 1 will end and enrollment in Group 2 will open.

      The dosing regimen that may be tested (Group 2) is:

      Loading Dose = 90 mg teverelix TFA SC + 90 mg teverelix TFA IM Maintenance Dose = 90 mg
      teverelix TFA SC every 4 weeks

      If this dosing regimen is unsuccessful (more than 2 (of 20) patients fail treatment) then
      recruitment to Group 2 will end and the study will be terminated.
