      have been associated with a significantly higher morbidity, mortality and costs than
      methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA).1 Selection of these organisms has been greatest in
      the healthcare setting; however, MRSA have also become more prevalent in the community.2 To
      control the transmission of MRSA, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA)
      has recommended guidelines, which include an active surveillance program to identify
      potential reservoirs and a rigorous infection control program to control the spread of MRSA.
      Accurate identification of patients colonized with MRSA is essential in managing the
      transmission of the organism. It is currently unknown whether the currently utilized
      collection rayon swab is the optimal swab in detecting colonized patients The purpose of this
      study is to directly compare whether Eluted (ESwab) swab is superior to the currently
      utilized rayon swab in identifying MRSA/VRE colonized patients.
