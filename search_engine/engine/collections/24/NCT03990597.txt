    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the safety (defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      [CTCAE], version 5.0) of StrataXRT and placebo by assessing gel-associated toxicities among
      pediatric patients, aged 2-17 undergoing proton cerebrospinal irradiation (CSI) for central
      nervous system (CNS) tumors.

      II. To estimate the efficacy of StrataXRT as a preventative agent for radiation-associated
      dermatitis among pediatric patients, aged 2-17 undergoing proton CSI for CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the relationship between dosing and the efficacy of StrataXRT. II. To explore
      the relationship between the use of StrataXRT and parent-reported symptom experience, as
      measured by the Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS).

      III. To explore compliance with the application of treatment as documented in a study log by
      participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning first day of CSI proton radiation therapy, caregivers apply StrataXRT gel to half
      of the patient's forehead and one ear and placebo to the other half of the forehead and the
      other ear twice daily (BID) until the last day of radiation therapy.
