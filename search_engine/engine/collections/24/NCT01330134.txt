    
      This is a single center prospective, randomized, blinded study assessing pain perception
      following 2 different lidocaine administration techniques in subjects who have planned
      medical procedures requiring local injection of lidocaine. Subjects will be approached and
      consented to participate in the study. They will be interviewed after the scheduled medical
      procedure to assess their pain using validated pain scores. An investigator who is not
      present for the procedure and blinded to the randomization will gather data regarding
      perceptions of pain from the entire procedure.
