      development of a highly sensitive and specific droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction
      (PCR) assay, it is hoped to be identified more prevalently and thus can improve risk
      stratification and help produce personalized treatment decisions and may be more
      cost-efficient. Plasma samples and cervical swabs will be collected from patients in
      University of North Carolina (UNC) Gynecology clinics, and some patients will also provide a
      urine sample. Those receiving biopsies or colposcopies and will come back to clinic 2-4 weeks
      post-excision for collection of another blood specimen. Using plasma samples and pathology
      results, we will characterize the relationship between plasma cHPVDNA levels and 1) CIN 1
      versus CIN 2-3 pathology 2) CIN 2-3 pre-excision and 2-4 weeks post-excision. We will accrue
      three cohorts of 25, 30, 30 patients corresponding to 1) Control 2) CIN 1 3) CIN 2-3. The
      control cohort will establish background signal in the assay. We will compare the proportion
      of detectable cHPVDNA levels between CIN 1 and CIN 2-3 cohorts using Fisher's exact test with
      80% power, significance level of 10%. Paired t-test will be used to compare pre- and
      post-excision cHPVDNA levels.
