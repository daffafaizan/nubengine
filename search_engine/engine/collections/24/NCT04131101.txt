      Michael's Hospital Academic Family Health Team (FHT) who are tenants of Toronto Community
      Housing Corporation (TCHC) with health providers, legal service staff at the Health Justice
      Program, social service agencies and advocacy organizations to advocate to improve building
      conditions in three TCHC buildings. The researchers will evaluate the acceptability and
      feasibility of this health promotion campaign as well as changes in the state of housing and
      self rated physical and mental health of tenants.
