      plasmatic cell. It represents the second most common haematological neoplasia, after Non
      Hodgkin Lymphoma. The annual incidence is over 4 cases per 100.000. Multiple Myeloma is an
      invariably mortal disease. When illness advances, the reduction of infections resistance, the
      intense bones destruction (with bone pain, pathological fractures and hypercalcemia),
      anaemia, renal failure and, in a less frequency, neurological complications and
      hyperviscosity provoke severe morbidity and mortality. Five-year survival rate in patients
      with Multiple Myeloma treated with conventional chemotherapy is 29%. There is an urgent need
      of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease
