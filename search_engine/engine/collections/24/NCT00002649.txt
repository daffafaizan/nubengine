      I. To compare the survival and disease-free survival of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      treated with post-transplant therapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or no further treatment.
      Transplant therapy is total body irradiation (TBI), high-dose etoposide, cyclophosphamide and
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).

      II. To assess the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with post-transplant IL-2
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease grade (low vs intermediate vs high), chemosensitive disease (yes vs no), partial or
      complete response after initial induction chemotherapy (yes vs no), and performance status
      (0-1 vs 2).

      Part I: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested before study entry.
      Patients undergo total body irradiation twice a day on days -8 to -5, high-dose etoposide IV
      over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day -2. PBSC are reinfused on
      day 0 and then filgrastim (G-CSF) may be administered subcutaneously or IV on days 0-21.

      Part II: Within 28-80 days after PBSC transplantation and after recovery from any toxic
      effects, patients with no active recurrent or progressive disease are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 IV continuously on days 1-4 and 9-18.

      Arm II: Patients undergo observation only.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 275 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5-5.9
      years.
