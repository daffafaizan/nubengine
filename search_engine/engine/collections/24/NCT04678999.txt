      technology to evaluate how brain function and structure change in response to mind-body
      exercise over time. Tai Chi mind body therapy may work by modulating the interaction among
      cognitive control network, default mode network, descending pain modulation system, limbic
      system, salient network, and sensory motor system through complex mind-body interactions. By
      combining multiple brain imaging modalities measurements, investigators will examine the
      neural substrates of Tai Chi compared with wellness education in adults with knee OA. The
      investigators will compare changes in resting state functional connectivity of the cognitive
      control network, brain morphometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to
      pressure pain, as well as their association with clinical outcomes. Results of this
      innovative mechanistic study will have important therapeutic implications and provide
      critical insight into the clinical, behavioral, and neurobiological mechanisms of the
      potential disease-modifying role of mind-body therapies for knee OA.
