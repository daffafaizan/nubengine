      lobectomy patients after surgery. While the investigators know ambulation improves outcomes
      after surgery, there is no institutional policy, set of patient goals, or method for deciding
      which patients require further resources, such as physical therapy. Data collected will be
      used to set up a hospital-wide strategy for patients to achieve post-operative ambulation
      milestones more readily.
