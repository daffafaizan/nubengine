    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2, proof-of-concept study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV pamrevlumab, a monoclonal antibody, against
      connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF), in participants hospitalized with acute COVID-19
      disease.

      All concomitant medications, including approved and non-approved treatments for COVID-19
      (such as, hydroxychloroquine or interleukin 6 [IL-6] inhibitors), as well as supplemental
      oxygenation needs, will be collected and recorded. In addition, the following will be
      collected and recorded: documentation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-Cov-2) infection, documentation of any other infection(s) prior to or during
      hospitalization, and whether or not aggressive care is withheld or withdrawn, including the
      reason for withholding or withdrawal of care (such as a Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate
      [DNR/DNI] order or a resource limitation).
