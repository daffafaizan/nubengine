    
      A waitlist control, evaluator-blinded, randomized trial (RCT) will be conducted according to
      CONSORT guidelines. Each participant will be randomized to either:

        1. Immediate intervention group (Experimental group). Children will receive immediately the
           system for 3 weeks.

        2. Waitlist delayed intervention (Control group). Children will continue standard care for
           3 weeks and then will receive the system as the Experimental group.

      As such, all participants will receive the AOT training. The system will provide an in-home,
      individualized, intensive treatment based on the AOT. The system will be delivered at home
      and the children will perform a 60-minute training session 5 days a week for 3 consecutive
      weeks. For the Immediate intervention group, follow-up assessment (outcome measures) will be
      conducted before (T0) and post-intervention at 3 weeks (T1), and then 8 and 24 weeks after
      T1(T2 and T3). For the Waitlist group, the assessments will be conducted before T0 and 3
      weeks after (T1) the standard care, then they will follow the same timeline of the first
      group (T1 plus, after the AOT intervention) and 8 and 24 weeks after T1 Puls (T2 and T3). The
      primary endpoint will be T1. Clinical assessments will be administered by a therapist blind
      to group assignment in each center. Scoring of videotaped clinical outcome measures will be
      performed by therapists blind to group allocation and assessment order.
