      in the rotation of persistent foetal occipito-posterior position intrapartum in pregnant
      women with epidural anaesthesia.

      Background: There is a theoretical basis for the possible effects of maternal positions on
      foetal positions. Despite all the studies published in recent years, conclusive trials
      providing significant scientific evidence are lacking.

      Design: An open, randomised, controlled and parallel clinical trial will be conducted at the
      Delivery Room of the Area Materno-Infantil, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona,
      Spain.

      Method: Fifty-six pregnant women with persistent foetal occipito-posterior position will be
      selected. Each woman will be assigned to a control or experimental group via an opaque
      envelope at a 1:1 ratio.

      The control group will deliver in free intrapartum positions, and the experimental group in a
      modified Sims position. Correction of foetal position is the key study variable, and delivery
      type the secondary variable. Statistical analyses will be made with the SPSS v.20 program.

      Discussion: If the modified maternal Sims position proved to correct persistent foetal
      occipito-posterior positions and being a non-invasive, low-cost, non-prejudicial method for
      both mother and foetus, maternal and foetal morbidity problem would be reduced
