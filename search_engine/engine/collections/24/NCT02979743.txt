    
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the commonest cause of neurological disability in children. The upper
      limbs are often affected, with significant hand involvement from an early age.There are
      various methods of treatment for CP children with hand function disability. However, there is
      a lack of effective methods to predict the prognosis.

      This prospective cohort study will include children with occupational therapy (OT) or OT plus
      acupuncture and massage methods. Children with CP will be evaluated in terms of upper limb
      motor function using the manual ability classification system (MACS), fine motor function
      measure (FMFM). The Brain injuries of Children will be evaluated by MRI.

      The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between brain MRI-metrics and hand
      function, compared between baseline and the third month, and thus determine the early
      MRI-based neuroimaging predictors of clinical improvements following therapy in children with
      CP.
