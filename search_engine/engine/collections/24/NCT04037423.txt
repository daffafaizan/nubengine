      non-interventional, multicenter study. We intend to obtain data on basic patients
      characteristics, pulmonary embolism severity, catheter-directed treatment procedures and
      short term outcome. We are planning to include approximately 150-200 patients suitable for
      analysis by the end of 2020. Anonymized data of consecutive PE patients treated with CTD in
      European centers will be collected in the database.
