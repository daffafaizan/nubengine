      deficient sites in the central nervous system (CNS) of a Type 2 Gaucher disease patient, we
      will investigate the use of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to perfuse specific sites
      within the CNS with glucocerebrosidase in an effort to ameliorate that patient's neurologic
      symptomatology and prolong his life.

      Study population. This is a single patient study that includes a male infant (8 months of
      age) with Type 2 Gaucher disease that has been diagnosed by clinical, laboratory and genetic
      testing. The natural history of acute neuronopathic (Type 2) Gaucher disease is progressive
      neurological decline that is rapidly fatal.

      Design. We propose using CED of glucocerebrosidase to the CNS to treat the neurologic signs
      and symptoms in this Type 2 Gaucher patient. Regions of infusion within the CNS will be
      targeted based on neurologic findings.

      Outcome measures. Detailed clinical and neurologic examinations will be performed pre- (3
      days before infusion) and post-infusion (1, 14, 30, and 90 days after infusion then every 3
      months until study completion) to determine stabilization or improvement in neurologic signs
      and symptoms. Survival will also be used to determine the efficacy of this treatment.
