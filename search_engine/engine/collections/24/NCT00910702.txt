      treating a number of blinding diseases by removing and replacing the diseased vitreous body.
      Current clinic vitreous substitute cannot mimic the natural vitreous which is unable to
      regenerate after surgery. We have devised a novel foldable capsular vitreous body (FCVB)
      consisting of a vitreous-like capsule with a tube-valve system, and demonstrated it could
      finely mimic the morphology and restore main physiological function of the natural vitreous
      body in our previous study.
