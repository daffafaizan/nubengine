      regimens, have increased the resectability of malignant hepatobiliary and pancreatic tumors
      when associated with vascular invasion. Therefore, simultaneous vascular resection is
      increasingly required to obtain an adequate resection margin and improve patient definite
      survival. Although most vascular resection associated with pancreatectomy can be
      reconstructed by simple venorraphy or end-to-end anastomosis, a segmental or lateral vacular
      graft (VG) can be necessary in 8-12 % of cases. Vascular reconstruction can be planned
      preoperatively if the vascular invasion is evident and an appropriate VG can be prepared.
      Differents sources of VG are available including autogenous veins , synthetic such as
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) , cryopreserved and veins from the resected liver. However the
      decision to perform vascular resection may be made during dissection due to vascular invasion
      or injury and even occasionnally taken while the mesentericoportal vein (MPV) or vena cava
      (VC) are occluded. In this emergency situation, an urgent and easily available graft is
      necessary to prevent prolonged ischemia. The difficulty of anticipating the need for these
      vascular resections during HPB surgery, has lead certain authors including those in our group
      to use either the veins from the resected liver, the umbilical vein or the parietal
      peritoneum (PP) for vena cava reconstruction. The aim of our study is to evaluate the safety
      and outcome of the parietal peritoneum as a substitute patch for venous reconstruction during
      HPB surgery in emergency and elective situations.
