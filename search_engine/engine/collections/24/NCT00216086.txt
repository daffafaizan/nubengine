    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Biopsy per EUS

        -  Irinotecan 200 mg/m2 IV, day 1

        -  Capecitabine 1000* mg/m2 PO BID day 1-14 Repeat every three weeks for two cycles* For
           calculated creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min or patients > 70years old, capecitabine
           starting dose is 825 mg/m2 PO BID

      Beginning at week 7 or following recovery from chemotherapy:

        -  Pelvic XRT 45 Gy/1.8 Gy/fx/qd+5.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/fx/qd for T3+9 Gy/1.8 Gy/fx/qd for T4

        -  Capecitabine 825* mg/m2 PO BID, 5 days/week, throughout XRT* For calculated creatinine
           clearance of 30-50 mL/min or patients > 70years old, capecitabine starting dose is 650
           mg/m2 PO BID

        -  Surgery within 8weeks following chemoradiotherapy

        -  Adjuvant Chemotherapy at investigator's discretion
