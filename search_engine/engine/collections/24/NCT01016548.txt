      (H1N1(2009)) is expected to cause a second wave of infection during the 2009/10 winter
      season. Vaccines against H1N1(2009) will be available in early November, 2009. Adults with
      hematologic disorders are at high risk of influenza-related complications, including death.
      Given that the vaccination dosing for the pandemic vaccine has been developed on healthy
      individuals, it is unknown whether this subgroup of patients will respond similarly. We will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine in patients with lymphoid
      malignancies receiving active systemic treatment, or who have recently undergone stem cell
      transplantation. Patients will be randomized to one or two doses of the approved adjuvanted
      vaccine; immune responses will be measured to identify the optimal regimen. Also, we will
      look for an association between biomarkers of the immune system and a response to the
      vaccine; this will be done by measuring baseline CD3, 4, 8, 19, and 56 cells by flow
      cytometry.
