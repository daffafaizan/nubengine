      derived mononuclear cells procedure appear well documented, a number of critical question
      regarding application of BM-MNC for peripheral vascular disease remain to be answered. First,
      although the original study has been partially performed as semi-blinded study (patients with
      double sided claudication were recruited and blindly treated with BM-MNC in one leg and
      peripheral blood injections in the other leg), this approach does exclude a placebo effect.
      Second, although patients with mild diabetes were included in the protocol, the results for
      diabetic patients were not analyzed separately. Diabetic disease is characterized by monocyte
      and endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction and it is still unclear whether this approach is
      also effective in diabetic patients. Third, although six-month results are reported long-term
      efficacy has not been established yet.

      To address these issues, the investigators now propose confirm and extend the findings from
      open studies in a randomized double-blind study in patients with severe claudication or
      critical leg ischemia and pay special attention to the influence of diabetic disease on the
      outcome of the study and to the possible pro-atherogenic/ pro-inflammatory effects of BM-MNC
      injections.
