      lack of identified measurable parameters one can use to predict the risk of future metabolic
      disease in women diagnosed with PCOS.The chosen approach is the standardised collection of
      phenome and metabolome data and their unbiased integration by machine learning analysis.
      Utilising the detailed results of the clinical phenome and metabolome analysis in the
      DAISy-PCOS Phenome Study cohort, The study will aim to identify distinct subsets (=clusters)
      of PCOS patients that share similar characteristics. This approach has previously been used
      by the team to successfully identify distinct steroid markers that can serve as a "malignant
      steroid fingerprint" in urine to distinguish benign from malignant tumours in patients with
      incidentally discovered adrenal masses. Similarly, The investigator have used unbiased
      analysis of steroid metabolome data to reveal that patients with aldosterone excess also
      overproduce glucocorticoids and that the latter explains the majority of metabolic disease
      risk observed in affected patients.

      In the integrated analysis of the DAISy-PCOS phenome and metabolome data, The investigator
      will apply a variety of methods in the context of connectivity or centroid-based clustering
      and density estimation. Supervised relevance learning will give insight into markers, e.g.
      steroids, that are most decisive for the determination of cluster memberships. In addition,
      The investigator will use state-of-the-art visualisation and machine learning techniques
      based on adaptive similarity measures.the investigator will use integrative approaches,
      addressing the heterogeneous data from different sources as a whole, whilst considering
      data-driven adaptation of generative models for the underlying biological processes. The
      investigator will employ these approaches to characterise central phenotype clusters
      affecting large numbers of patients as the basis of personalised management including outcome
      prediction.
