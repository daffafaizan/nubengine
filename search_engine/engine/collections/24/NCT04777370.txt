    
      Forty individuals with a loss of internal rotation (IR) ROM will be recruited and randomized
      to one of two interventions at the first session: either posterior glenohumeral mobilization
      or internal rotation "sleeper" stretching. At the second visit, all participants will undergo
      a thoracic manipulation (T3-4 segment) followed by a repeat of either the sleeper stretch or
      glenohumeral mobilization.
