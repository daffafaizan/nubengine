      visual loss older than 50 in the world.1 The incidence and progression of all the features of
      AMD are known to increase significantly with age.2-4 In a recent study, Klein et al. reported
      that approximately 15.6% of the US population aged 60 years and older in 2005-2008 had signs
      of AMD.5 In a study in Iceland, the prevalence of early AMD was 12.4% for those aged 66 to 74
      years and 36% for those aged 85 years and older.6 Currently in the United States, advanced
      AMD affects more than 1.75 million people and the number will increase to 2.95 million by the
      year 2020.7

      Epidemiological studies of genome wide association study (GWAS), candidate gene association,
      and linkage disequilibrium suggest that AMD has a significant genetic component.7-10 Ample
      evidence supports the hypothesis that variance of genes involved in DNA repair,11-13
      oxidative stress14, 15 and inflammation16-20 play a role in aging and age-related diseases.
      Many studies have documented the association between polymorphisms in complement factors
      (CF), oxidative stress, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), mitochondria and chaperone proteins genes
      and AMD.21-23 Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ApoE, ApoE or C2/BF may protect AMD. On
      the other hand, SNP in CFH, AMRS2/HTRA-1 or CX3CR1 gene may increase AMD risk.24 In this
      study, we would like to test whether the variations of biologically plausible genes (or the
      modifying genes) listed above are differentially distributed in AMD patients and normal
      populations. To this end, we choose genes that are believed to play a crucial role in the
      aging process and will analyze the frequency of SNPs specifically within the coding frames of
      biologically plausible genes responsible for aging and age-related diseases.

      Our aim will be to compare the allelic frequencies of candidate genes listed above in cohorts
      with AMD to the frequency in normal control subjects without AMD. With this study we hope to
      identify genetic risk factors that could have functional implications for understanding and
      treating AMD.
