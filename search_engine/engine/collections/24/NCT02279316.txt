    
      Primary objective To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for
      12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) will
      decrease rate of falls in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group.

      Secondary objectives Objective 1: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1
      hour a week for 12 months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12
      months) decreases 12-month risk of falling at least once in seniors with MCI or mild dementia
      compared with the control group.

      Objective 2: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12
      months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) improves
      cognitive func-tion and alertness in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the
      control group.

      Objective 3: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12
      months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) decreases
      gait variability in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group.

      Objective 4: To test whether the Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program (1 hour a week for 12
      months) and/or the simple home exercise program (3 × 30 min a week for 12 months) improves
      quality of life in seniors with MCI or mild dementia compared with the control group.
