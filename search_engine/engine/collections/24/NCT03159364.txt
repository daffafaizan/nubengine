      Opportunistic infections are major causes of transplant-related morbidity and mortality in
      immunosuppressed patients, especially in the early post-transplant period. CMV, EBV,
      adenovirus (AdV), BK virus (BKV) and other viruses or non-viral pathogens may lead to
      life-threatening infections after transplantation.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with specific microbial
      antigens has proven to be effective without stimulating acute graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD) owing to the significantly reduced nonspecific alloreactivity. This study aims to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating opportunistic infections with microbial-specific
      CTLs in immune compromised patients.

      Objective:

      Primary study objectives: Infusion of autologous or allogenic pathogen-specific CTL to
      patients by I.V., to evaluate the safety.

      Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti-microbial efficacy of IV-infused autologous
      or allogenic pathogen-specific CTLs.

      Design:

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained through apheresis. T cells from
      PBMC will be activated and enriched by dendritic cells with pathogen specific antigens. Cell
      preparation time is approximately 12-17 days. Subject will receive infusions of 1x105~1x106
      cells/kg body weight of CTLs via IV infusion. Patients are followed weekly for one month
      after the infusion, monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months until the trial ends.
