    
      Background:

        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is the leading cause of late morbidity and
           non-relapse mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
           (alloHSCT), occurring in 40-60% long-term survivors.

        -  Chronic GvHD occurs due to the dysfunctional peripheral tolerance during post-transplant
           hematopoietic reconstitution that allows the development and persistence of alloreactive
           donor-derived T and B cells.

        -  Prednisone is the front-line therapy; however, about 50% of participants have
           steroid-refractory disease and there is no standard second-line therapy.

        -  The most attractive approach for controlling chronic GvHD would be early therapy
           intervention which could prevent the most severe and irreversible clinical
           manifestations.

        -  Anti-B-cell therapy delivered early in chronic GvHD could be effective and
           steroid-sparing.

        -  Ibrutinib, reversible small molecule inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase, has been
           shown to be well-tolerated and effective in phase 1b/2 trial for steroid refractory
           chronic GvHD.

      Objective:

      -To evaluate efficacy of ibrutinib as a first-line treatment for persons with newly diagnosed
      chronic GvHD by measuring the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial
      response [PR]) at 6 months, according to the 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria

      Eligibility:

        -  Newly diagnosed, moderate or severe chronic GvHD according to the 2014 NIH Consensus
           Criteria, requiring systemic immunosuppression

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%

        -  History of prior alloHSCT; any donors, conditioning regimens and graft sources are
           allowed

        -  Adequate cardiac, hepatic and other organ function

        -  Adequate laboratory parameters

      Design:

        -  Multi-center, non-randomized, phase II study

        -  Two-stage design will be used to determine the overall response rate (CR + PR) at 6
           months

        -  Continuous daily dose of ibrutinib 420 mg by mouth, with the potential for dose
           reductions to 280 mg and 140 mg

        -  The accrual ceiling will be set at 40 participants, allowing for a total of up to 28
           evaluable subjects.
