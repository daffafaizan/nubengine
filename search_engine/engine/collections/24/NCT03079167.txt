      cells in a newborn baby's brain. The damage caused by the lack of oxygen continues for some
      time afterwards. One way to try to reduce this damage is to induce hypothermia cooling the
      baby or just the baby's head for hours to days. Erythropoietin (Epo) given in the first week
      after birth shows promise as a treatment that may also help. This study is to find out
      whether Epo plus induced hypothermia (cooling) of near-term newborn babies who have suffered
      from low blood or oxygen supply to the brain at birth reduces death and disability in
      survivors at two years of age.

      The target population is 300 newborn term or near term infants (greater than or equal to 35+0
      weeks gestation) with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy who are receiving, or planned to
      receive hypothermia and who are able to be recruited in time to allow study treatment to
      commence before 24 hours of age.

      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, 2 arm randomised, phase III multicentre
      trial, stratified by study site and by severity of encephalopathy at study entry.

      The treatment group of 150 infants will receive human recombinant Epo, 1000 IU/kg IV on days
      1, 2, 3, 5 & 7 of life. The control group will receive 0.9% sodium chloride as a placebo on
      days 1, 2, 3, 5 & 7 of life.

      Families will be followed up every 6 months until the primary assessment of death and
      disability at 2 years of age.
