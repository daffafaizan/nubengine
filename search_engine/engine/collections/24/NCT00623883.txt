      have any ACF removed or merely observed. Subjects are evenly divided into those with and
      those without a personal history of colon cancer. ACF are tabulated by an observer blinded to
      the subject's personal history. All subjects are then re-evaluated after one year by an
      observer blinded to the original procedure.
