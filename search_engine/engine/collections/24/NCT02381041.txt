      rhinoplasty are included in the study.

      All procedures are performed by two surgeons, both with more than ten years of experience in
      cosmetic rhinoplasties. One surgeon uses cocaine as the vasoconstrictor agent of choice in
      his daily practice, whilst adrenaline is the preferred option for the other. Both
      practitioners participate in all surgeries, one of them as main surgeon and the other as
      assistant alternatively until the study is concluded.

      Vasoconstrictor effect of cocaine and adrenaline will be assessed by quantitative and
      qualitative evaluation. Blood loss is quantified by measuring blood aspiration during surgery
      and gauze weighing. Aspiration is collected in a graduated bottle; at the end of surgery
      fourty cc of saline is flushed through the suction system. Difference of ribbon gauze weights
      before and after the procedure is also measured. Adding the previous measurements gives an
      estimate in blood loss. Qualitative analysis of vasoconstrictive effect is based on
      evaluation of surgical field by each surgeon using a linear scale of 1 to 5 (1 poor, 5
      excellent).

      Systemic effect of vasoconstrictor drugs is assessed by heart rate (HR) and
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) variations during the procedure. Patients are
      monitored with continuous electrocardiogram tracing and automated blood pressure. Once
      cocaine or adrenaline packs are placed, measurements are taken every two and a half minutes
      during the first ten minutes and thereafter every five minutes until the end of the
      procedure.
