    
      The investigator's primary objective is to generate iPS lines from 3 CF patients and from 3
      healthy subjects.

      Secondary objectives include verification that cell lines express the CFTR gene according to
      their genotype, verification or relative production of the CFTR protein for each iPS line,
      and amplification of obtain iPS lines for aliquot creation to facilitate sharing.
