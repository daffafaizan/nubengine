      patients had of culprit coronary lesion, a significant proportion of them had no any
      angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary arteries. Exact mechanism of the myocardial
      infarction remains unclear of these patients. However, MI registries have reported that the
      5% to %10 of MI patients have no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease.

      There is lack of any data regarding prevalence, demographics, patients' profile, management,
      and outcome of this clinical entity in Turkish population. This registry aims to obtain these
      data in Myocardial Infarction with Non-obstructive Coronary Artery Disease patients in
      Turkish population.

      Although there are huge data in this issue from different country and geographic areas, to
      date no any national data about prevalence, demographics, management and in-hospital outcomes
      of AF patients who admitting with cute coronary syndrome. With this rationale the registry
      also aims to obtain demographics, clinical profile, management, and in-hospital outcome of AF
      in Turkish Acute coronary syndrome population.
