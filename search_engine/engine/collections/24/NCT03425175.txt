      routine a Lindesbergs hospital. One single observer not working at the department observed
      consecutive operations before and after the introduction of audio recordings. All elective
      laparoscopic procedures were included. There was no available data to support a
      Power-calculation why we intended to include 20 patients in each arm of the study. Exclusion
      criteria were refusal of operating team or patient to participate in the study, or planned
      open surgery. Potential disturbances were recorded by the observer. The main outcome was time
      with non-relevant conversation (for the operation or as part of education).
