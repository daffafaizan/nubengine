      spraying (IRS), together with the use of artemisinin combination treatments, have led to
      major changes in malaria epidemiology and vector biology. Along with the significant
      reduction in overall malaria prevalence and incidence, extensive use of insecticides has
      created large selection pressures for resistance in the malaria vector populations and for
      potential outdoor transmission, which appears to be limiting the success of ITNs and IRS.
      Because IRS and ITN have little impact on outdoor resting and early biting vectors, outdoor
      transmission represents one of the most important challenges in malaria control. Therefore,
      new interventions that can augment the current public health measures to reduce outdoor
      transmission are urgently needed. Larval control has historically been very successful and is
      widely used for mosquito control in many parts of the world, except in Africa. Factors
      limiting the use of larvicides include high costs associated with frequent habitat
      re-treatment. Now a new US EPA-approved long-lasting formulation, potentially effective for 6
      months is available. The central objective of this study is to determine the effect of
      long-lasting microbial larviciding on the incidence of clinical malaria and reduction of
      transmission intensity. Our hypothesis is that addition of long-lasting microbial larviciding
      to ongoing ITN and IRS programs will lead to significant reductions in both indoor and
      outdoor malaria transmission and malaria incidence.
