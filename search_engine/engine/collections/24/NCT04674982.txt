    
      Methods: This randomized, controlled, experimental study. The study sample consisted of 56
      newborns determined using power analysis (vibration: 28, control:28). Newborns who underwent
      a heel lance procedure at the specified center, whose parents agreed to participate in the
      study and who had reached gestational age 38 and older were enrolled in the study. In the
      vibration group, a vibrating device was used for approximately 30 seconds before the heel
      lance procedure and continued throughout the procedure. No interventions were made on the
      newborns in the control group. Two nurses were employed for the heel lance procedure both for
      the experimental and control groups. One nurse performed the heel lance procedure for all
      newborns and the other nurse recorded the procedure. Pain in newborns was evaluated by the
      nurse who performed the heel lance procedure before the procedure, and 15-20 seconds and five
      minutes after the procedure, as well as by two specialists through observation of the video
      footage of the procedures using the NIPS. The heel lance procedure was performed by the same
      nurse both in the vibration and control groups.
