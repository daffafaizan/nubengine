      effective treatment for live cancers. The system (Emprint Microwave Ablation system) with
      2.45 GHz microwave generator the investigators will use has been approved as safe by the
      European Union (EU) in 2009 and received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2014.
      However, there are still few experiences in using MWA for tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this
      study, we will perform MWA for 40 inoperable patients with liver cancers adjacent to vessels
      who are suitable to receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in our hospital. The investigators
      will evaluate the potential side effect and ablate effect of tumors by abdominal computed
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the investigators will also
      follow-up this patients for 1 years to evaluate the overall survival and local recurrence
      rate. The investigators will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of the system
      by this study.
