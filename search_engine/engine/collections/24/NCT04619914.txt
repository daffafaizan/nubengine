    
      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in infertile women.
      Infertility affects 40% of women with PCOS. Understanding the main causes of infertility and
      selecting an appropriate treatment plan is a diagnostic and therapeutic priority The aim of
      this work was to compare the effect of Clomiphene citrate plus Estradiol Valerate versus
      Letrozole on endometrial thickness and pregnancy rate in infertile PCOS women underwent
      ovulation induction

      The study was designed as a randomized double blind study using a computer-generated
      randomization list and sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes, each containing the
      allocation information written on a card. Envelopes were opened sequentially by a study nurse
      to allocate patients to the assigned group. These patients were divided into two groups:

        1. Group A (clomiphene citrate & estradiol group): included 35 anovulatory PCO patients who
           received clomiphene citrate (Clomid; Aventis pharma S.AE, Global Napi pharmaceuticals,
           Cairo, Egypt) 100 mg daily from cycle day 3 to 7 with estradiol valerate 4-mg (two white
           tablets of cyclopregynova) from cycle day 8 to 14.

        2. Group B (Letrozole group): included 35 anovulatory PCO patients who received letrozole
           (Femara; Novartis pharma AG, Basle, Switzerland) 5 mg daily from cycle day 3 to day 7.
