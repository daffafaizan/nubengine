      combination of Trastuzumab and Docetaxel with or without capecitabine as first-line therapy
      for HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      The study also aims to gain information on the additional treatments and sequencing used in
      patients that have progressed following the combination of Trastuzumab and Docetaxel with or
      without capecitabine as first-line therapy for HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer.

      Overall Survival data on patients who have progressed following the combination of
      Trastuzumab and Docetaxel with or without capecitabine as first-line therapy for HER2
      positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer will also be analysed and reported.
