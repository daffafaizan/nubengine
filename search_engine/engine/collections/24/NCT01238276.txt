      already FDA approved for intramuscular (IM) administration. However, the CONCENTRATION in the
      target area is much higher than what can be achieved through intravenous (IV) administration,
      while still being far less than what is approved for IM administration.

      Previous to this study, cefazolin was considered to be ineffective in treating
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as it had only been tested at the
      concentrations that were attainable by traditional methods. Through our study and laboratory
      tests conducted at the Harford Hospital, Connecticut, we have confirmed that cefazolin can be
      effective against even the most resistant strains of MRSA if a high enough concentration is
      obtained.

      Under this study, treatment is only available to subjects that have already undergone
      standard therapy, but were not able to resolve the infection.
