      child has not eaten enough, or how to get them to eat more. There is a need to understand the
      child characteristics that predispose to undereating and the how these operate, in order to
      design more effective treatment and prevention programmes. The Glasgow feeding clinic (GFC)
      looks after a range of children with severe feeding problems who commonly have low appetite
      and extreme thinness.

      A Ghanaian student will come to Glasgow, funded by the Glasgow University /Scottish funding
      council Global Challenges Research fund, to learn these techniques to use in future PhD
      research. The student will conduct a pilot study of children attending the GFC. The student
      will invite 40 families to complete our standardised online questionnaire (ICFET) about their
      child's eating behaviour and collate existing growth measurements as well as their feeding
      history.

      A standardised energy compensation study will then be undertaken in 20 of the thinnest
      children. At two visits at least a week apart, the children will be given one of two similar
      tasting drinks in random order, one with very few calories and another with extra, without
      them knowing which is which. After 30 minutes they will eat as much as they want of a
      standardized lunch. All foods and drinks offered will be weighed before and after, to
      calculate the amount of energy eaten in total after the low energy drink, compared to the
      high energy drink.
