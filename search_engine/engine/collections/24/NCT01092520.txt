      with brachioradial pruritus, uraemic pruritus and pruritus of unknown origin. Although the
      specific mechanism is unknown, the end result is the downregulation of excitatory
      neurotransmitter release and decrease in neuronal hyperexcitability.

      The primary objective of this study is evaluating the effectiveness of gabapentin in reducing
      the severity of pruritus in children with burn injuries.
