      NEMEX program combined with a CNS-focused protocol or the NEMEX program alone.

      The NEMEX program will consist of 12-weeks of individualized and supervised exercise sessions
      applied twice weekly (n=24 sessions). Each exercise session will last approximately 60minutes
      and include three parts: warming up, a circuit program and cooling down.

      The CNS-targeted treatment will consist of 12-week individualized and supervised sessions
      applied twice weekly. Each training session will last approximately 30 minutes and include
      three parts, which are further explained below: 1) discussion of the participant's knee pain
      experience from a pain neuroscience perspective, 2) graded SDT and 3) GMI training.
