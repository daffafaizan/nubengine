      Novo Nordisk) on rebleeding after surgery for primary supratentorial ICH. All patients
      included in the study will perform a CT scan within 3 hours before surgery, then immediately
      after surgery, and 18-30 hours after surgery. The hematoma volume will be evaluated by a
      multi-slice CT scan. All CT scan images will be sent to the Coordinating Center where the
      hematoma volume will be evaluated by a dedicated software by the same investigator who will
      be unaware of the treatment (investigator- blinded study).

      SAFETY EVALUATION:

      Seventeen episodes of thrombotic spontaneous adverse events have been reported after
      administration of 480,000 standard doses of Eptacog alfa in hemophilic patients. These
      episodes include myocardial infarction, acute cerebrovascular thrombosis, disseminated
      intravascular coagulation (DIC), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism.

      Before and after hematoma removal will be evaluated ECG, myocardiac enzymes, coagulation
      profile, CT scan (looking for ischemic events) and venous echodoppler ultrasound of lower
      extremities.
