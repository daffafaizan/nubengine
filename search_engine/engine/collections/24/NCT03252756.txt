      processes and behavioral domains relevant to addiction. The non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid
      cannabidiol (CBD) has attracted considerable attention due to its lack of abuse potential,
      its excellent safety profile, its unique and complex pharmacology, and evidence that it
      affects anxiety and stress response in animal models and humans. There is a growing body of
      preclinical data demonstrating that CBD produces marked and persisting decreases in alcohol
      self-administration and preference for alcohol, and alcohol-, cue- and stress-induced
      reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior, yet there are few studies of the effects of CBD in
      humans with addictive disorders, and none in alcohol dependent patients.
