      surgical ICU between april 2013 and august 2013.

      The included patients were assessed independently by trained ICU nurses using the confusion
      Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The patients were recorded general characteristics,
      disease-related factors, and treatment and environment-related factors. Data were analyzed by
      SPSS 12.0 software, using t-test, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression.
