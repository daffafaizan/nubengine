      arm will be the telemonitoring group and one arm will be the standard of care group.
      Participants will be in the study for 30 days. Participants in the telemonitoring group will
      receive a Telestation, blood pressure monitor, and pulse oximeter. If the participant also
      has congestive heart failure, they will receive a scale. All of these vital measurements are
      to be taken on a daily basis along with survey questions on how the patient feels. If set
      parameters are out of the normal range, a flag will trigger that requires follow
      up/intervention from a nurse by telephone. In some cases, the participant might need to come
      back in to see a physician through the outpatient clinic. The participant in the standard of
      care group will be contacted via phone 30 days after discharge to learn if they were
      readmitted to any hospitals or had any emergency room visits during the past 30 days. This
      data will be collected via Philips software and also entered into the RedCap database here at
      Mayo Clinic.
