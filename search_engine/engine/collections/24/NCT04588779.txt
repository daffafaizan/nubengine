      Myofascial release in improving Piriformis flexibility in females. They reported that
      myofascial release was more valuable than passive stretching exercises in enhancing
      piriformis flexibility in patients with piriformis tightness.

      According to another study in 2018, after a single treatment, compressive myofascial release
      showed more improvement in ankle dorsiflexion than Graston technique, in participants with
      decrease dorsiflexion range.

      In 2016, a study reported the effects of the Graston technique and general exercise in
      patients with chronic low back pain. Graston group showed greater improvement in pain and
      range of motion in patients with chronic low back pain.

      According to a study conducted in 2014, self-myofascial release was more effective than
      Graston technique in improving knee joint flexibility, hamstring, and quadriceps strength.

      In 2011, a study evaluated the effectiveness of deep soft tissue mobilization techniques and
      stretching exercises in piriformis syndrome and found that the deep soft tissue mobilization
      techniques along with stretching exercises significantly improved the piriformis syndrome.
