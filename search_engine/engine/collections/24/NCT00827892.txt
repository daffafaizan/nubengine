      lag far behind those for ischemic stroke. Current treatment efforts for ICH are targeted
      towards the primary brain injury caused by the hemorrhage and growth of the hematoma. This
      research targets the secondary injury caused by the persistence of toxic blood degradation
      products in the brain parenchyma.

      Based on preclinical work in our lab, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma
      (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, represents a possible target for the
      treatment of ICH aimed at promoting hematoma absorption, limiting the pro-inflammatory
      response, and protecting salvageable tissue from the damage produced by the persistence of
      toxic blood degradation products.

      Our primary specific aim is to assess the safety of the PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone (PIO) in
      increasing doses for 3 days, when administered to patients with ICH within 24 hrs of symptom
      onset. Secondarily, we aim to determine the duration of treatment of PIO for hematoma/edema
      resolution in ICH. Lastly, we aim to determine whether speed of hematoma/edema resolution in
      ICH represents a radiographic biological marker of activity which can be correlated with
      clinical outcome and treatment effect of PIO. The ultimate purpose is to provide baseline
      data on an aspect of ICH which has not been previously targeted for treatment in an effort to
      develop a safe and effective treatment strategy that may be practical and applicable for both
      specialized stroke centers and community hospitals.
