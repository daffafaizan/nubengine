      risk factors known to enhance atherosclerosis, damage the endothelium of the arterial wall.
      Dysfunction of the endothelium leads into loss of elasticity of the artery. Especially a
      reduction in the elasticity of small arteries has been found prominent in atherosclerosis and
      is believed to serve as a marker for early stages of atherosclerosis.

      In this study, we investigate whether the levels of oxidized LDL and arterial elasticity
      differ between patients with metabolic syndrome and their physically active controls.
      Oxidized LDL is assessed by a two-site ELISA immunoassay (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The
      capacitive elasticity of large arteries (C1) and the reflective elasticity of small arteries
      (C2) are automatically assessed by the CR-2000 as a mean of five most similar pulse waves
      appearing during the measurement. C1 identifies the elastic properties of aorta and other
      large arteries, C2 the endothelial function of the microvascular circulation. Proper
      statistical methods are used to reveal possible differences and their significance between
      the patients and controls.
