      regulated in several cancers. It has been estimated that approximately 250,000 or 15% of new
      cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) that arise in the UK and USA combined will
      overexpress αvβ6 (2-4). αvβ6 plays a key role in tumour invasion and carcinogenesis. Strong
      expression of αvβ6 is associated with significant reduction in life expectancy in patients
      with colon, cervical, breast or non-small cell lung cancer (3-5). Recently, it has been shown
      in preclinical studies that antibody targeting of αvβ6 could suppress the growth of oral and
      breast cancer human xenografts and suppress breast cancer metastasis (6). Thus αvβ6
      represents a biologically relevant target for anti-cancer therapy.

      The proposal is to conduct this study in patients with solid tumours as αvβ6 is expressed
      exclusively by carcinomas, which are all solid tumours. As the utility of [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2
      in patients with cancer has not been evaluated a particular challenge with evaluation of this
      radiotracer in patients with cancer include potential metabolism and excretion of this
      radiotracer by the liver and kidney confounding the image quality for lower thoracic and
      abdominal tumours requiring optimisation of the imaging protocol. In addition, as the
      patients are likely to be unwell, it is imperative an imaging protocol that is
      patient-friendly in terms of the scan duration is developed. Additionally it would be ideal
      to confirm that the uptake of the radiotracer is indeed due to αvβ6 expression on the cancer
      cells. Therefore in this study, it is planned to evaluate the feasibility of performing such
      a study in patients with a variety of solid tumours.
