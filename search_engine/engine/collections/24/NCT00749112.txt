      first line, but there is a considerable percentage of patients who relapse, become refractory
      or dependant on steroids to maintain an acceptable level of hemoglobin or platelets, and the
      treatment becomes more difficult increasing the secondary effects. The current study
      evaluates the safety and efficacy of the combination of low doses of alemtuzumab (anti CD52)
      and Rituximab (anti CD 20) as a second line treatment option for this subset of patients
      improving the cytopenias without increasing the adverse effects.
