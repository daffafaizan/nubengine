      intervention group or placebo. Volunteers in the intervention group will be immunized three
      times with 50 L3 larvae of Necator americanus with three-week intervals. Two weeks after each
      immunization, volunteers will be treated with albendazole. Four weeks after the last
      treatment all volunteers are challenged with controlled human hookworm infection consisting
      of two doses of 50 L3 larvae with a two week interval. 16 weeks after the first challenge all
      volunteers will be treated with albendazole, except up to four volunteers who will be asked
      to remain as chronic donors for future hookworm studies.
