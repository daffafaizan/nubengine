      reduction techniques for patients with chronic pain. The Pain Centre has arranged for a local
      certified yoga instructor to lead a 6-week course that she has developed for our specific
      patient population. The course will include self-management strategies for pain control, such
      as breathing exercises, yoga poses, and mindfulness meditation. Standardized questionnaires
      and a semi-structured interview to record baseline and post-course outcomes. The study will
      involve the following questionnaires/surveys/interviews: 1) Canadian Occupational Performance
      Measure, 2) Perceived Stress Scale, 3) Burckhardt Quality of Life Scale, 4) Visual Analog
      Score, and 5) written questions concerning patient demographics, the patient's chronic pain
      condition, and their satisfaction with the course. The participants would be asked to fill
      out questionnaires at three different times: 1) baseline data collected within two weeks of
      starting course, 2) short-term outcome data within two weeks of completing course, and 3)
      long-term outcome data four to six months after the course.
