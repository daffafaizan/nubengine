      morbidity and mortality with devastating effects on cardio-cerebrovascular system and on
      tumor onset. After years of scientific doubts, today the scientific world agrees to define
      cigarette smoking not a "vice" but a disease.

      The aim is to evaluate the effect of no nicotine electronic cigarette use in patients with
      cancer or myocardial infarction, smoking at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least 10
      years, in addition to counselling activity performed by specialised dedicated medical
      doctors.

      If patient is eligible for this trial, he will be enrolled in this trial and randomized.
      Randomization will be performed using a web-based procedure. Study participants will be
      randomized to electronic cigarette added to standard counselling or only standard
      counselling. A calendar will be given to the patient to remember the dates of visits or
      telephone counselling. After the first visit patient will be followed every ten days for the
      first two month through outpatient clinic visits and telephone counselling. After the first
      two months patient will return at institute for a last outpatient clinic visit at sixth
      month.
