      significant anticancer effects in animal models and tissue culture investigations including
      cytotoxic effects in certain cancer cell lines at micromolar to millimolar concentrations.

      Early clinical studies have shown that intravenous and oral doses of vitamin C may improve
      symptoms and prolong survival in terminal cancer patients. More recent double-blind
      placebo-controlled studies have shown that oral adminstration of vitamin C provides no
      benefit to cancer patients. Conversely, intravenous vitamin C administration raises plasma
      concentrations as high as 14 mM/L, and concentrations of 1-5 mM/L have been found to be
      selectively cytoxic to tumor cells in vitro.

      The proposed Phase I trial with vitamin C should achieve millimolar concentrations of vitamin
      C that have been shown to kill tumor cells in vitro. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), PK,
      possible drug accumulation with repeated dosing, quality of life, pain response, fatigue
      status, and hints of efficacy in patients with advanced cancer will be examined.
