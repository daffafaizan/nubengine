      metastatic soft tissue sarcoma treated with either of two different regimens of ifosfamide or
      doxorubicin. II. Assess the toxic effects of these therapies and response rate in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized into one of 3 arms
      (continuous ifosfamide, ifosfamide daily for 3 days, or doxorubicin). Patients are stratified
      by performance status (0 vs 1), liver involvement (no vs yes), histological type
      (leiomyosarcoma vs synovial sarcoma vs other), and histological grade (1 vs 2 vs 3). Arm I:
      Patients receive doxorubicin by bolus infusion for 5-20 minutes once every 3 weeks. Arm II:
      Patients receive ifosfamide by intravenous infusion for 4 hours on days 1, 2, and 3 every
      three weeks. Arm III: Patients receive ifosfamide by intravenous infusion for 72 hours every
      3 weeks. Patients are assessed after every 2 courses of therapy. Each course of therapy
      consists of 3 weeks of treatment. Patients may receive a maximum of 6 courses of therapy in
      the absence of toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed every 12 weeks for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 780 patients (260 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
