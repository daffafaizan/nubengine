      skin cancers (NMSC) annually, with the incidence increasing over time. Twenty-five percent
      are cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC), which affect up to 1,350,000 individuals and
      result in up to 12,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Immunosuppressed patients are
      particularly vulnerable to the development of highly aggressive or catastrophic cSCC.
      Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, such as solid organ transplant recipients
      (SOTRs), and HIV/AIDS patients have an estimated 60 to 250-fold increased risk of cSCC
      development. In renal SOTRs, cSCC represents over 70% of all malignancies that develop, with
      an incidence up to 200 times that of the general population. Post-transplant cSCC occurs at a
      younger age and is more aggressive than in non-transplant cohorts, with 30% of cSCC recurring
      within 1 year and up to 8% of disease associated with metastasis. The median survival from
      diagnosis of metastasis is 3 years.5 Cemiplimab, an anti-PD1 antibody, recently became the
      first agent to achieve regulatory approval for the treatment of advanced cSCC; however, due
      to the risk of graft rejection, the role of immunological checkpoint blockade in the SOTR
      population is extremely limited. Thus, although surgical excision is effective for sporadic
      cSCC, there remains a large unmet medical need for novel strategies for treatment and/or
      prevention of multiply recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic cSCC, particularly in
      immunosuppressed patients.
