      dry skin, sunken eyes, no tears) will be evaluated. Weight, noninvasive blood pressure
      measurement, pulse rate will be recorded. Measurements would be performed with an ultrasound
      probe with a low frequency (2-5 MHz), a curved array transducer will be used. In the supine
      position, the ultrasound probe will be placed in the substernal area, in the longitudinal and
      transversal plane, 1 cm caudal to the confluence of the hepatic veins, and it will be
      operated in M-mode. The largest (VCImax) and smallest (VCImin) diameters will be measured and
      the collapsibility index will be calculated (according to the formula: VCImax - VCI min / VCI
      max x100). Immediately after this examination measurement of the right VJImax, min and the
      left VJImax, min will be measured again in the supine position, then after passive leg raise
      (lifting the lower limbs 45st. for at least 1minute ) VJImax, min. and left VJImax, min will
      be measured. The collapsibility index for right and left VJI would be calculated according to
      the formula: VJImax - VJI min / VJI max x100. After a defined fluid infusion (20ml/kg, but
      the maximum volume will be limited to 500ml, this means that over 25kg weight we would apply
      not more than 500ml) within 60 minutes. A control examination of VCI, right VJI, and left VJI
      will be evaluated the same way as first and compared with the previous one.
