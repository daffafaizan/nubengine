      patients taking standard, FDA approved, CDC recommended doses of acyclovir (400 mg PO BID)
      for HSV-2 suppression compared to taking no medication to better define the effect of
      acyclovir on short bursts of rapidly cleared HSV-2 shedding. This study will be a randomized,
      open label, cross-over trial.

      We propose to perform this study in two study populations. Cohort 1 will be comprised of 25
      HSV-2 seropositive, HIV seronegative adults, and Cohort 2 will be comprised of 25 HSV-2
      seropositive, HIV seropositive adults with a CD4 count>250 cells/mm3. As suppression of HSV-2
      using acyclovir is currently being studied in large, multi-center, international clinical
      trials as an HIV prevention strategy, these results will have broad implications for public
      health around the world.
