      or space (neglect). Stroke survivors with neglect not only demonstrate impairments in
      attention but they also experience motor impairment. These individuals also have an imbalance
      in excitation in the brain. This study will examine the preliminary effects of non-invasive
      brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) combined with arm
      rehabilitation training (repetitive task-specific practice, RTP) for individuals with neglect
      following stroke. The investigators will examine the effects of the intervention on brain
      excitability, upper extremity motor impairment, and attentional impairment. This study will
      also examine assessment of neglect. There are many clinical assessments designed to assess
      neglect; however, it is unknown whether items from some of the most commonly used assessments
      are able to effectively measure neglect or whether items from these assessments can be
      combined. Clinicians rely on clinical assessments to inform treatment and document patient
      progress. Therefore, it is important that investigators more closely examine these existing
      assessments.
