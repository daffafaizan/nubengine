      six week of acupuncture treatment (either early within the first six week, or delayed after
      the first six week of observation and assessment of primary outcome).

      Primary outcome measures:

      Clinical outcome at the end of week 6 acupuncture treatment: Glasgow Outcome Score extended.

      Secondary outcome measures:

      Modified Rankin Score, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score, Modified Aschoff Score,
      Neurocognitive State Examination (NCSE) score, Barthel index, Modified Rivermead Mobility
      Index (MRMI), Modified Functional Ambulation Category (MFAC) and motor scores of upper limb
      and lower limb with Fugl-Meyer Scale at the end of week six acupuncture treatment.
