      increasing, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. There is no
      effective treatment for AD. Most interventions can only alleviate the condition and delay the
      development. Therefore, early diagnosis and prevention of AD are extremely important.
      However, the current diagnostic measures are not suitable for clinical promotion due to their
      traumatic nature, so there is an urgent need for a more suitable clinical early
      identification and diagnosis method. Proteomics research technology is the leading research
      technology in China. It can be applied to research on disease markers, pathogenesis, and drug
      target discovery.

      Therefore, this study intends to adopt standardized and rigorous cross-sectional research,
      collect biological specimens (including blood, feces, urine, saliva and tongue coating) from
      eligible subjects, and use liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology to
      explore early warning indicators of protein in patients with mild cognitive impairment and
      Alzheimer's disease
