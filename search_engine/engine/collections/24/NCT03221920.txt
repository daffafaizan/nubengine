      requirements are mostly from fat) to the level of systemic inflammation (measured by Glasgow
      Prognostic Score), serum lactate and TNF Alpha levels. The subjects are colorectal
      adenocarcinoma patients who were decided by experts to be managed by best supportive care.
      These patients are not deemed to be suitable for surgical intervention , chemotherapy or
      radiotherapy anymore. The main treatment is supportive. We would like to examined the effect
      of very low carbohydrate diet on these patients, in which theoretically tumtor cells of the
      colorectal adenocarcinoma needed glucose to replicate and increases the systemic inflammation
      response.
