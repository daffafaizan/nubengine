    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the overall response rates of olaparib in subjects with recurrent/progressive
      IDH1/2-mutant solid tumors, who will be recruited to 3 cohorts: a. glioma, b.
      cholangiocarcinoma, c. other solid malignant tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the distribution of progression free survival (PFS) of olaparib in adults with
      recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant glioma and cholangiocarcinoma.

      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2- mutant
      glioma and cholangiocarcinoma.

      III. To determine the duration of response in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant
      glioma, cholangiocarcinoma or other solid malignant tumors.

      IV. To confirm the safety and tolerability of olaparib monotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe 2HG concentration in plasma by mass spectrometry at baseline and at specific
      timepoints and correlate with treatment response.

      II. To describe 2HG levels in tumor biopsies from prior to the beginning of treatment and at
      specific timepoints and correlate with treatment response.

      III. To evaluate in tumor biopsies and in liquid biopsies performed at baseline and at
      specific timepoints if co-occurring alterations detected via multiplexed immunofluorescence,
      mass cytometry (CyTOF)-imaging mass cytometry (IMC), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and/or
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing can be associated with differential levels of 2HG
      production, treatment response and resistance.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
