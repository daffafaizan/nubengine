      Primary

        -  Compare the safety and efficacy of docetaxel with vs without PI-88 in patients with
           stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy markers of docetaxel and PI-88 in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and potential efficacy of PI-88 alone as maintenance therapy in
           patients whose disease has been controlled with docetaxel and PI-88 combination therapy.

        -  Determine the safety and potential efficacy of PI-88 alone as third-line therapy in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I. Patients also receive PI-88
           subcutaneously once daily on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arm II with stable or responding disease
      after 6 courses may continue to receive PI-88 alone as maintenance therapy. Patients in arm I
      with progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity before the completion of 6 courses may
      receive PI-88 alone as third-line therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
