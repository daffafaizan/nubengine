      older have multimorbidities. To improve services, information about health care provision
      should be complemented with knowledge about the health situation and functioning in a
      community-based setting.

      The main objectives of this study are to describe health indicators in a Norwegian population
      of youths and adults with IDs in relation to age, and to assess the associations between the
      health determinant physical activity and body mass index, physical function, activities and
      social participation in youths and adults with IDs.

      Assessments of physical and mental health indicators, and aspects of activities and social
      participation according to International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
      (ICF), in relation to health determinants and unmet healthcare needs in a cross-sectional
      health screening survey.

      The prevalence of suitable health indicators will be compared to studies in this area and
      from the following Norwegians population based studies: the "Troms√∏-study", the "HUNT" study
      and the "NORSE study".

      The following articles will be published as part of this project:

        1. A feasibility study of the use of tests like the Short Physical Performance Battery.

        2. An overview of the health indicators among youths and adults with intellectual
           disabilities in Norway, in relation to age groups.

        3. Presentation of levels and predictors for physical activity, as well as body mass index,
           in youths and adults with IDs.

        4. Presentation of functioning (daily activities and work) in association to levels of
           physical activity.
