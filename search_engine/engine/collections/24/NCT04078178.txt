      weeks each and complete research visits ever 4 or 8 weeks. Most research visits will involve
      a blood draw, cognitive testing, and mood questionnaires. Most study activities will take
      place via Zoom videoconferencing. We will ask you to come to our center 4-5 times to complete
      some study activities in-person. There will be an option to participate in a lumbar puncture
      sub-study, in which participants would have up to 3 lumbar punctures. There will also be an
      option to participate in an MRI sub-study, in which participants would have up to 3 MRIs over
      the course of the study. In between research visits, we will also ask the participants to
      wear a Fitbit activity tracker and play computerized brain games a few times a week. This
      will enable us to get a snapshot of each subject's functioning levels day to day and better
      determine whether or not the supplement is having an effect on the participant.
