        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerance of sequential therapy with prolonged

        -  Determine the response rate and time to progression in this patient

        -  Determine the relative pharmacokinetics of IV and prolonged oral administration of
           topotecan in the same patients and compare the pharmacodynamics of topo-1 inhibition
           when given by IV or oral route.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Regimen A: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1 of each course.
           Topotecan IV is administered continuously on days 1-14 of course 1. Oral topotecan is
           administered twice daily on days 1-14 for courses 2, 3, and 4. Treatment repeats every
           28 days for 4 courses.

        -  Regimen B: After completion of regimen A, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
           followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
           4 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (15 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
