      females who are able to walk independently at least 10 meters. Most of them will be recruited
      from the Srinagarind hospital and communities in the Northeast area of Thailand. Subjects
      have to participate in STS and stepping training with and without using the external feedback
      for 1 time/condition with a wash-out period for 2 weeks (crossover design). The outcomes will
      be measured in terms of the amount of LLSA on the affected side during STS and stepping,
      walking speed, level walking symmetry, dynamic balance control.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare immediate effects of amount and duration of
      LLSA of STS and stepping training with and without the use of external feedback in ambulatory
      patients with stroke. Secondary objective of study are to compare immediate changes after STS
      and stepping training with the use of external feedback relating to amount of LLSA in
      ambulatory patients with stroke, to compare immediate changes after STS and stepping training
      without the use of external feedback relating to amount of LLSA in ambulatory patients with
      stroke and to investigate amount of LLSA of the affected leg during STS and stepping in
      ambulatory patients with stroke as compare to healthy individuals.
