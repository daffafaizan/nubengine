      walkers (Functional Ambulatory Category interval <1,3>) will be enrolled in the randomized
      blinded single center prospective clinical trial GAITFAST with a randomization either for
      robot-mediated gait training (RGT) or therapist-assisted gait training (TGT) after acute
      phase (5-10 days after stroke onset). All enrolled patients will undergo a 2-week intensive
      inpatient rehabilitation including randomly assigned TGT or RGT followed with clinical visits
      (at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation, at discharge, and three and six months after
      enrollment in the study). Each clinical visit will include detailed clinical functional
      assessments, assessment of spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters, assessment of
      neurological impairment, assessment of quality of life, cognition and depression. In 60
      randomly selected enrolled IS patients, a repeated multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) including functional MRI (fMRI) will be performed during the study follow-up to
      identify brain structures with possible impact on gait recovery.
