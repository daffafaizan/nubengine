      thyroidectomy alone and groups A-C underwent total thyroidectomy plus CND. The latter were
      randomized to oral calcium (3 g/day) plus vitamin D (1 mcg/day) (group A, n = 49), calcium
      alone (group B, n = 49), or no supplements (group C, n = 50). Hypocalcemic symptoms, serum
      calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were compared among the groups.
