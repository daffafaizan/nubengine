      conversion in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and positive peritoneal cytology as a
      sole metastatic site following gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel.

      Subjects must have a newly diagnosed stage 4 untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer
      with positive peritoneal cytology as a sole metastatic site and meet all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria.

      Treatment consists of 4 week treatment cycles. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be
      administered on days 1,8, and 15.
