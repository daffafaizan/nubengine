      I. To measure the change in melanoma literacy in Oregon, Washington, and Utah over five years
      (relative to baseline) and determine if there is a statistically significant difference in
      literacy in Oregon (where the educational campaign occurred) as compared to the
      non-participating states (Washington and Utah).

      II. To determine if there is an association between melanoma literacy and 1) stage at
      diagnosis, 2) tumor depth, 3) incidence, and 4) mortality rates in Oregon, Washington, and
      Utah.

      III. To determine if the cost of care for melanoma in Oregon is impacted by melanoma literacy
      and/or tumor stage.

      OUTLINE:

      MEDIA CAMPAIGN: Participants view digital media strategies.

      PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND PROFESSIONALS: Primary care providers and professionals who see
      skin and potential melanomas receive online based curriculum on melanoma. Participants also
      complete a survey to assess knowledge and confidence before and after receiving the
      curriculum.

      MELANOMA COMMUNITY REGISTRY VOLUNTEERS: Melanoma Community Registry volunteers in Oregon
      receive educational and training materials on melanoma. Participants also complete a survey
      before and after receiving educational material.

      HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: High school students receive an educational lecture over 1 hour on
      sun-safety and early detection of melanoma practices. Participants also complete a survey
      before and after the educational lecture.
