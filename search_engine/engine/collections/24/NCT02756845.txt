      subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection in the clinical
      setting. Approximately 18 - 24 pediatric subjects are expected to be enrolled and treated
      with at least 1 dose of talimogene laherparepvec into 2 cohorts stratified by age. DLT will
      be evaluated based on at least 9 DLT-evaluable subjects in cohort A1. The DLT evaluation
      period is 35 days from the initial administration of talimogene laherparepvec.
