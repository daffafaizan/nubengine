      receiving scoliosis specific exercise approach, such as SEAS exercises, in accordance with
      the bracing approach for moderate curves would have greater improvement in curve progression,
      trunk deformity, body symmetry and quality of life than adolescent receiving exercise therapy
      based on the general core stabilization approach with similar intensity. Thirty female
      patients with AIS aged 12 to16 years, who have moderate curves (20 to 45 degree) randomly
      divided into two groups. One group received CS exercise, while other received SEAS exercise
      for forty-min once weekly for four months. Both groups underwent full-time bracing (23 hours
      per day) intervention. Outcome was based on Cobb angle, angle of trunk rotation, body
      symmetry (Posterior Trunk Symmetry Index), cosmetic trunk deformity (Walter Reed Visual
      Assessment Scale) and quality of life (Scoliosis Research Society - 22 Questionnaire)
      measured at baseline and after intervention period. Results were analyzed using the paired
      sample t-test to compare repeated measurements and independent sample t-test to compare the
      groups.
