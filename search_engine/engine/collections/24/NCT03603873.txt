      Teaching Hospital) from March 2017 to May 2017. Selected patients will be over the age of 18,
      among those receiving general anaesthesia for surgery. Demographic data and medical history
      will be collected after written consent. Before the anaesthetic procedure, an APAIS
      questionnaire (Anxiety evaluation form) will be filled out by each patient.

      The medical, anaesthetic and surgical care will not be changed. In the operating room, we
      will proceed with anaesthetic induction following a medical protocol according to the
      practice of our hospital (TCI Target Controlled Infusion or manual induction): the propofol
      infusion or injection is started with an initial effect-site concentration or dose and
      increased step by step until patients present the clinical en points defined as LOC (loss of
      consciousness, i.e. no response to a verbal command).

      The effect-site concentration of propofol, induction time required for a loss of
      consciousness (LOC), and preoperative incidents will be recorded by an anaesthetist student
      nurse and will be recorded in a data book.

      After surgery, we will record any secondary effect attributable to premedication.

      The day after surgery, patients will be assessed with the EVAN-G questionnaire. Statistical
      analysis will be done in sub-groups with variance analysis. We will also do multivariate
      regression analysis according to the type of premedication, demographic data, preoperative
      variable and preoperative anxiety level. If the number of included patients allows it, we
      will do propensity score matching for premedication.
