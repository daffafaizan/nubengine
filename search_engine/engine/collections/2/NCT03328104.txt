    
      T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) has an
      increase in proteins in a specific pathway called the mTOR pathway within the cancer cells.
      In cancer cells it can encourage untimely cell growth, cell production, and cell survival.
      Everolimus is an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and can decrease the growth and survival of
      cancer cells. It also prevents communication within cells and stops proteins from being made
      that may contribute to leukemia.

      Two to six participants will receive the starting dose of everolimus. If the side effects are
      not too severe, the next group of participants will take the study drug at a higher dose
      level. Up to two dose levels of the study drug will be tested. The main purpose of the study
      is to find the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus when used together with standard
      chemotherapy. Everolimus has been found to be safe and effective in adults and children for
      treatment of T- and B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.
