      common and significant cause of morbidity and mortality in young children living in Maela
      refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border, and that this is reflective of the general situation
      in the developing world. Therefore, we aim to define the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of
      acute lower respiratory infections in this population. This will focus on Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and the factors associated with colonisation and invasive disease.

      Additional objectives are to:

        1. Characterise the interaction between bacterial and viral pathogens and disease.

        2. Examine the dynamics of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, including transmission of
           strains between infants and their mothers.

        3. Determine the effect of the non-pathogenic members of the nasopharyngeal flora on
           colonisation with potential pathogens.

        4. Examine the role of passively transferred maternal pneumococcal antibodies in subsequent
           pneumococcal colonisation and disease in the infant.

        5. Document the development of pneumococcal antibodies in the infants over time and
           correlate these with pneumococcal carriage and infection episodes.

        6. Determine the risk factors associated with respiratory infection.

        7. Characterise the bacteria causing invasive non-respiratory infections.

        8. Conduct surveillance for influenza and in particular avian influenza A (H5N1) infection.
