      the exact cause is unknown, studies have shown that weight loss at high altitude is
      associated with the amount of time and severity of the altitude exposure. Upon arrival to
      high altitude (â‰¥ 5000 feet), numerous physiological adaptations occur that may promote weight
      loss, such as increased energy expenditure and reduced appetite. The breadth of current
      altitude research is limited by the logistical and monetary constraints of traveling to
      remote locations or access to an altitude chamber. A more logistically feasible alternative
      is the simulation of low oxygen conditions at sea level, using a commercially available tent
      and generator system to reduce ambient oxygen concentrations. The current research study will
      evaluate changes in resting metabolic rate, appetite, and heart rate variability following
      overnight exposure (8 h/night) to normobaric hypoxia (NH) or normobaric normoxic (NN). In
      randomized order, participants will sleep one night in NH conditions (~15% oxygen; achieved
      with nitrogen dilution, equivalent to ~8500 feet elevation) and another night in NN (control)
      conditions (~20% oxygen; achieved with nitrogen dilution, equivalent to ~1000 feet
      elevation). In the morning, following NH or NN exposure, resting metabolic rate will be
      measured using indirect calorimetry, appetite using an ad libitum buffet meal protocol, and
      heart rate variability by electrocardiogram. It is hypothesized that exposure to overnight NH
      will result in increased resting metabolic rate, decreased appetite, and decreased heart rate
      variability.
