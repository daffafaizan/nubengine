      their macrophage oxidative stress and attenuated the development of their atherosclerosis.
      Further research in hypertensive humans demonstrated that pomegranate juice had an
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect and significantly decreased systolic
      blood pressure.

      This study will use a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with eight clinic
      visits (one screening visit [week -4 to -1], one baseline visit [week 0], and six treatment
      visits [weeks 13, 26, 38, 52, 65, and 78]).
