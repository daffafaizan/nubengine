    
      This is a first in human, multinational, phase 1, open-label study of TAS3681 in patients
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)evaluating safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with mCRPC for which there is
      no standard therapy. Eligible patients will either be enrolled in the dose escalation phase
      to evaluate safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose for TAS3681, including a
      preliminary evaluation of food effect, or the expansion phase in which additional cohorts of
      patients may be enrolled to further evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of TAS3681 at
      the MTD or at a lower dose.

      Approximately 100 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase and
      approximately 100 patients will be enrolled in the Expansion Phase.
