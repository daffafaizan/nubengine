      surgical access trauma leading to a more painless surgery and enhancing a fast postoperative
      recovery. Experience with transanal minimal invasive surgery(TAMIS) for rectal cancer show
      that such NOTES procedures are feasible and safe. And also, lots of experimental studies and
      small case series reporting the feasibility of transanal anterior resection with single
      incision laparoscopic surgery(SILS) port or other devices. However any prospective
      feasibility study demonstrating the safety of the procedure and functional outcomes
      (sphincter function, sexual function, QOF) are missing. This study investigates the
      feasibility, practicability, safety and subjective as well as functional outcome of transanal
      minimal invasive total mesentery excision for rectal cancer.
