      evaluation in patients with pulmonary disease, pre-flight arterial oxygen saturation or lung
      function tests do not discriminate sufficiently between those who need supplemental oxygen
      during flights, and those who can do without.Therefore, more extensively use of Hypoxia
      Altitude Simulation test (HAST) has been advocated. However, this test is not widely
      available. Previous studies have shown that exercise testing is useful for the prediction of
      in-flight hypoxemia. The investigators have previously developed a pre-flight algorithm for
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), based on oxygen saturation
      measured by pulse oximetry at rest and during exercise (six minute walking test (6MWT)). It
      remains unknown as to whether these results are applicable to the CF population.

      The current study aims to validate the pre-flight algorithm for patients with CF. Since a
      maximum cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is recommended in the routine CF-control, the
      investigators also aim to evaluate whether the use of CPET predicts in-flight hypoxemia with
      greater accuracy than 6MWT, and whether CPET may replace HAST.
