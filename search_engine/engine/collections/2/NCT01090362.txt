      all possible care settings, the registry will help to characterize real-life anticoagulant
      treatment patterns and outcomes, including rates of stroke and bleeding complications, as
      well as provide data on other important issues, such as physicians' compliance with
      guidelines and patients' adherence to therapy. This is particularly timely as standard
      practice moves away from vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-dominated therapy and towards a new era
      of novel oral anticoagulants (OACs), i.e. direct Factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin
      inhibitors.

      To ensure a dataset that truly reflects current practice, the investigators are requested to
      prospectively enrol all newly diagnosed patients with non-valvular AF who have at least one
      additional investigator-determined risk factor for stroke. Patients are consecutively
      recruited into one of five cohorts and followed up for at least 2 years.

      With 3 cohorts complete and 36,000 enrolled GARFIELD-AF continues to recruit patients and, in
      conjunction with other registries and non-interventional studies, will be the source of
      further informative and useful data in the coming years. The findings will serve to increase
      our understanding of the management of patients with AF and improve our practice for their
      benefit.
