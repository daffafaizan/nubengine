      children (perinatally HIV infected, perinatally HIV-exposed but not infected, and
      unexposed/uninfected children) to one of two intervention arms. They are randomized to either
      the Brain Powered Games (BPG) intervention arm of 12 sessions of hour-long training (twice a
      day for several days weekly at the study clinic), or to the "wait-listed" arm of no BPG
      training sessions. In phase II of the protocol (after pretesting, 2 months of waiting
      followed by post-training testing and then 6-month follow-up testing for both immediate and
      wait-listed BPG training arms - the wait-listed children will all undergo 12 sessions of
      village Builder which is a pro-social reasoning/planning strategy game newly developed by our
      Games for Entertainment and Learning (GEL) lab at Michigan State University (MSU). In Phase
      II for the Village Builder children, all children will also undergo neuropsychological
      testing before and after the 12 training sessions, as well as neuropsychological assessment
      at six-month follow-up post training.
