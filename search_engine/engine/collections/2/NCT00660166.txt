      especially when there are only a few. It has been shown that NK cells coming from a
      "mismatched" person (a relative) have a better chance than the patient's own NK cells to
      recognize and kill cancer cells. These cells will be collected from the blood of a parent,
      child or sibling and after preparation in the laboratory, will be given to the patient early
      after an autologous stem cell transplantation like a blood or platelet transfusion. A person
      who has been diagnosed with a blood tumor and received an autologous stem cell transplant has
      the chance of his/her cancer coming back. This study uses NK cells obtained from a relative
      to prevent disease recurrence by potentially eliminating and eradicating any residual
      cancerous cells.
