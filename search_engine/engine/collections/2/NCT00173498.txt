      Traditionally, we use serum specific IgE, skin prick test or intradermal test to verify the
      possible causative allergens in patients with atopic dermatitis. This study will evaluate the
      correlation between serum specific IgE, skin prick test, intradermal test, and patch test for
      common allergens in adult patients with atopic dermatitis.
