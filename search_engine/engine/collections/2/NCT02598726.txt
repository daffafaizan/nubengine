      I. To conduct a dose-escalation study with curcumin and piperine to derive a safe, optimal
      biological dose of this combination in cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the grade 2+ toxicities associated with curcumin and piperine. II. To evaluate
      quality of life associated with this combination by means of the Mayo Modified Urinary Stent
      Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the change in urinary prostaglandin E2 concentrations that occur at
      baseline and then after one week of curcumin + piperine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of curcumin.

      Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or thrice daily (TID) and piperine
      extract (standardized) PO on days 1-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
