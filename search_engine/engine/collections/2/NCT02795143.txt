    
      Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a potentially life-threatening skin disorder
      characterized by widespread redness, blistering and peeling of skin.

      Currently, supportive care in the standard treatment for patients with TEN. Isotretinoin, an
      FDA-approved medication commonly used for treating severe acne induces differentiation of
      certain inflammatory cells and thus may potentially be helpful in treating patients with TEN.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study comparing the efficacy
      and safety of isotretinoin versus placebo in treating subjects with toxic epidermal
      necrolysis (TEN).

      Approximately 40 subjects who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either isotretinoin or placebo which they will take for up to 14
      days. The end of the study is defined as the time the subject is discharged from the
      hospital. Participants will primarily be assessed for percent body surface affected (BSA) and
      number of days of hospitalization.
