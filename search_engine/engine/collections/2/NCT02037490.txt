      promote behavior change through peer and self-modeling photo/video activities.

      In this study, investigators will implement the intervention with small peer groups of 6-12
      mothers, beginning during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Investigators will assess
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and explore its impact on outcomes,
      particularly behaviors associated with healthy growth.
