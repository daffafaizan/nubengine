      addition to bisoprolol is effective in lowering heart rate before coronary computer
      tomographic angiography (CCTA) if administered orally one hour before the scan.

      Out-patients of a single radiology center are included in this retrospective analysis. All
      patients are referred to an ambulant CCTA. All scans are performed with a Siemens Somatom
      Sensation Cardiac 64 Computer Tomograph and analyzed with Siemens Syngo Plaza software.
      Patients with an initial heart rate of â‰¥ 75 bpm are either pretreated with bisoprolol 10mg
      p.o. alone (group 1) or a combination of bisoprolol 10mg and ivabradine 7.5mg p.o. (group 2)
      one hour before the CT scan.

      The change in treatment from bisoprolol only to the combination of bisoprolol and ivabradine
      was introduced as a change in standard treatment independent of the study. The study was only
      plannend and performed as a retrospective analysis after the last patient included into the
      analysis was already treated.

      Additional betablocker is administered intravenously right before the scan if heart rate
      remains elevated.

      The hypothesis is that the addition of ivabradine to bisoprolol results in a pronounced heart
      rate reduction. This heart rate reduction will lead to a reduced need of i.v. bradicardic
      drug use, a reduction in motion artifacts and a reduced radiation dose to to a higher rate of
      flash sequences.
