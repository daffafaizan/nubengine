      for oral sucrose to leave the lumen of their upper gastrointestinal tract, enter the blood,
      and be filtered into urine. Normally the disaccharide sucrose cannot leave the lumen of the
      gastrointestinal tract without being first hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose. Appearance of
      the disaccharide in the bloodstream suggests a paracellular leak of some type in the upper
      gastrointestinal tract. Once in the blood, sucrose is likewise not taken up or metabolized by
      the kidney but simply filtered into the urine. The amount of sucrose appearing in an
      overnight urine sample can be used to indicate the presence of Barrett's esophagus and/or
      esophagitis in a patient reporting with reflux (GERD) symptoms. The leak is presumably in the
      Barrett's epithelium itself. This phenomenon will be used to test if a standard 8 week
      therapy of Nexium in a first-time-presenting GERD patient can reduce the leak as a means of
      assessing the efficacy of the drug in that patient. We predict that Nexium will reduce leak
      in esophagitis but not Barrett's patients.

      In this study, patients over 18 years of age presenting with GERD symptoms to a primary care
      physician, will be recruited after providing informed consent. Patients will perform a
      sucrose leak test the evening after their recruitment by drinking a solution of 100 gms of
      sucrose in 200 cc of water at bedtime, then collecting an overnight urine sample (8 hrs).
      Within 5 days the patient will undergo an upper endoscopy exam. The patient will then begin
      Nexium therapy (40 mg/day of Esomeprazole) for 8 weeks, taking the dose each morning before
      breakfast. After 8 weeks the patient will undergo a second sucrose leak test as described
      above. Urine sucrose will be determined by HPLC.
