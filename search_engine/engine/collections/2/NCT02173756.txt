      versus placebo gel in the pediatric oncohaematology oral mucositis induced by chemotherapy in
      children treated with systemic opioids.

      To confirm these results, we propose to conduct a randomized double-blinded study designed to
      compare the analgesic efficacy of morphine oral topical gel versus placebo gel in children
      over 5 years with mucositis induced by chemotherapy and treated with systemic opioids. This
      analgesic effect should reduce persistent pain to maintain oral feeding and thus delay the
      implementation of parenteral nutrition, and hence reduce the dose of systemic morphine and
      also reduce the adverse effects of opioids
