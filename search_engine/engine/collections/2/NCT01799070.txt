      power of VSI with CHS, and which is an observational analytic clinical study. The
      investigative parameters of patients will be collected prospectively by the designed case
      report form. According to the incidence of CHS, the estimated enrollment amount is set as
      200. Patients will be recruited by the inclusion and exclusion criteria below. All the
      patients included will accept the standard CEA surgery treatment in the department of
      vascular surgery of PUMCH. MCAV and systolic BP data will be recorded cross CEA.
      Post-operatively the CHS patients will be identified according to the golden standard. The
      golden standard is the clinical diagnose of CHS (the detailed diagnostic criteria will be
      stated in the methodology part). The TCD operator is blind to the patients. The predictive
      power of VSI will be identified by the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
      negative predictive value and ROC plot comparing with the golden standard. The study start
      date is March 2013, the estimated study completion date is December 2014 and the primary
      completion date is September 2014 (final data collection date for primary outcome measure).
