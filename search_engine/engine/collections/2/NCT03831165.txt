      reduced levels of melatonin. It is speculated that the indoleamine can be classified as
      anti-estrogenic drug, both by its action on estrogen synthesis with aromatase inhibition and
      by its interference with estrogen receptors. Experimentally melatonin prevents promotion and
      growth of mammary tumors in rodents, probably by interacting with epithelial cell receptor;
      increasing local immunity by acting as an antioxidant agent and by inhibiting telomerase
      activity intumor cells .
