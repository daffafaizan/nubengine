      feeding is considered standard practice for preterm neonates in neonatal intensive care
      units. It is believed useful to confirm correct placement of the orogastric or nasogastric
      tube and thought of as necessary to aid the decision of enteral feeding advancement by
      informing about possible remains of contents from previous feeding. Furthermore, evaluation
      of gastric residuals is routinely performed in order to assess for feeding intolerance and
      used as a possible indicator of risk for development of necrotizing enterocolitis.

      However there is conflicting evidence to support the approach of routine gastric residuals
      assessment and it seems unclear whether it confers any clinical benefit. Withholding of
      enteral feeding or cessation of advancement in the amounts given due to misinterpretation of
      routine gastric aspirates may have a negative impact on the preterm neonate. This can
      potentially involve prolonged indwelling of venous catheters, higher risk of infection and
      growth restriction with potentially worse developmental outcome in particular for very low
      birth weight infants.

      This randomized controlled clinical study aims to compare a control group with regular
      assessment and evaluation of gastric residuals and an intervention group with no routine
      assessment of residuals prior to feeding advancement, for the time taken to reach full
      enteral feeding and for occurrence of any observed complications including necrotizing
      enterocolitis.
