    
      Specific Aim #1: To study the epidemiology of shock in the emergency department Hypothesis 1:
      We will better understand shock states if we determine shock etiology among patients
      presenting to the emergency department in a carefully conducted observational prospective
      study.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine the accuracy of physician diagnosis for the underlying etiology
      of shock.

      Hypothesis 2: Physician assessment of the underlying cause of shock is challenging and often
      inaccurate in the early stages of care in the emergency department.

      Specific Aim #3: To optimize the evidence-based approach to assist in the diagnosis of shock
      etiology from elements readily available when a patient demonstrates shock physiology in the
      Emergency Department.

      Hypothesis 3: An evidenced-based, standardized approach to clinical decision making
      integrating elements of the history, physical exam, and early testing will improve a
      physician's ability to accurately differentiate etiologies of shock.
