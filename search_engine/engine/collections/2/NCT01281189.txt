    
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive, degenerative disease of motor
      neurons in the brain and spinal cord that leads to muscle atrophy and spasticity in limb and
      bulbar muscles resulting in weakness and loss of ambulation, oropharyngeal dysfunction,
      weight loss, and ultimately respiratory failure. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether dexpramipexole (150 mg twice daily) is safe and effective in the treatment of ALS.
