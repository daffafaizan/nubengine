      sampling interval of 24 hours. Although the predictive value of individual variables may be
      limited, a proper combination of more variables and their 24-hour sampling may allow
      developing a HM diagnostic algorithm to accurately predict HF worsening within given time
      windows.

      The objective of this Study is to select the predictive variables which are most likely to be
      effectively included in a future algorithm.

      This is a multicentre, exploratory Study with the objective to prospectively collect
      follow-up and Home Monitoring data from a population of subjects with indication for ICD
      and/or CRT-D implantation, to document HF hospitalizations and deaths and to correlate these
      events with HM data to identify the combination of HM data with the greatest sensitivity and
      specificity in predicting HF events.

      Fifty first hospitalizations for worsening HF (adjudicated by an independent board) are
      necessary to reach the study objective (Event driven study), which were initially assumed to
      be generated by 650 patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sample size
      estimation has been reviewed after an interim analysis.
