      Primary

        -  Assess whether there is a difference in overall survival between intermediate and
           high-risk localized GIST patients undergoing complete surgery alone and those undergoing
           complete surgery plus adjuvant imatinib mesylate 400 mg daily for two years Secondary

        -  Assess whether there is a difference in relapse-free survival and relapse-free interval
           between GIST undergoing complete surgery alone and those undergoing surgery + adjuvant
           Imatinib mesylate 400 mg daily for two years.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, risk category (high vs intermediate), tumor site (gastric
      vs other), and resection level (R0 vs R1).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant oral imatinib mesylate once daily for 2 years in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients are observed (without receiving further antitumoral therapy) every 3
           months for 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in arm I are followed every 3 months for 2
      years. All patients are then followed every 4 months for 3 years and at least annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 900 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
