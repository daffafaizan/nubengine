      disease, were unable to tolerate panitumumab, or discontinued treatment for other reasons
      (eg, administrative decision). Participants then attended a safety follow-up visit 4 weeks
      from the last panitumumab infusion. Participants were subsequently contacted every 3 months
      from the last panitumumab infusion through month 24 to assess disease status and survival.
