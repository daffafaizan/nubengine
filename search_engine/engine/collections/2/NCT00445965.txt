        -  Determine if intrathecal iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 activity in patients with
           GD2-expressing central nervous system or leptomeningeal neoplasms is sufficiently
           promising (i.e., 6-month overall survival rate â‰¥ 25%) to warrant further study.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the cumulative toxicities of this drug in these patients.

        -  Describe the effects of human-antimouse antibody on cerebrospinal fluid and serum
           pharmacokinetics in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive intrathecal iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 for dosimetry. Beginning
      approximately 1 week later, patients receive intrathecal iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8
      on day 1. Treatment intrathecal iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 repeats weekly for up to
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected prior to and after administration of each
      course of study drug. Samples are analyzed to assess the intrathecal and blood
      pharmacokinetics of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 and serum human antimouse
      antibodies. Samples are also analyzed in tumor genetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 months.
