      I. To determine the association of baseline FMISO PET uptake (hypoxic volume [HV]), highest
      tumor:blood ratio [T/Bmax]) and MRI parameters (Ktrans, CBV) with overall survival (OS) in
      participants with newly diagnosed GBM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association of baseline FMISO PET uptake (HV, T/Bmax) and MRI parameters
      (Ktrans, CBV) with time to progression (TTP) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS-6) in
      participants with newly diagnosed GBM.

      II. To assess the reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET uptake parameters by implementing
      baseline "test" and "retest" PET scans (performed within 1 to 7 days of each other).

      III. To assess the correlation between highest tissue:cerebellum ratio [T/Cmax] and T/Bmax at
      baseline.

      IV. To assess the correlation between other MRI parameters (for example Gadolinium-enhanced
      T1-weighted (T1Gd), vessel caliber index (VCI), , CBV-S, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
      , N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to choline (Cho) ratio, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD),
      T2) and OS, TTP, and PFS-6.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Two weeks before initiation of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide, patients undergo MRI and
      PET scan using FMISO. A subset of 15 patients undergo FMISO PET scans approximately 1 week
      before chemoradiotherapy. Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during
      study to compare image measures of tissue uptake of FMISO to blood concentrations. Tumor
      samples are collected from diagnostic biopsy or surgery for analysis of tumor hypoxic markers
      and methylguanine methyl transferase by immunohistochemical and Polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) assays.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5 years.
