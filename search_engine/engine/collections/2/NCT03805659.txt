      neurodegenerative disorder that is often referred to as the 'language form' of Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD). Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a safe and
      potentially effective tool that appears to enhance language production when delivered during
      language training. This technology provides a critical opportunity to conduct disease
      intervention.

      In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS)
      will improve performance on language tasks by increasing functional connectivity and by
      regulating abnormal neuronal oscillatory patterns. The rationale for this project is that a
      determination of the therapeutic efficacy and the associated neural mechanisms of HD-tDCS in
      lvPPA is likely to offer a scientific framework whereby new stimulation parameters,
      conditions, and target sites can be deciphered.

      This study will test the hypothesis that HD-tDCS will improve performance on language tasks
      by increasing functional connectivity and by regulating abnormal neuronal oscillatory
      patterns. The language performance and functional connectivity changes will be determined in
      a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover manner, in which a stimulation of up to
      2mA in the targeted cortical tissue or sham is administered to 20 lvPPA subjects age 45 years
      and older. The order of treatments is counterbalanced in a within-subject crossover design.
      In brief, study participants will receive sham during one treatment period and stimulation
      during the other treatment period.
