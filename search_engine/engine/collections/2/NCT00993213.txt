        1. To determine if suction lipectomy fails to modify regional and/or total body fat over
           three years.

        2. To determine if the expression of candidate genes predicts and/or relates to
           subcutaneous adipose tissue growth or depletion in subcutaneous adipose tissue after
           suction lipectomy.

        3. To examine adipose tissue before and after suction lipectomy to uncover novel genes
           where expression predicts and/or relates to subcutaneous adipose tissue growth or
           depletion after subcutaneous suction lipectomy.
