      placed in parallel at T8-T9 vertebral levels. A common problem after surgery is the migration
      of leads from the initial implanted site, the consequence of which is inadequate pain relief.
      Anecdotal reports suggest that the paddle electrode can eliminate some of the problems
      associated with lead migration by providing a constant distance between the parallel
      electrodes. Furthermore, it has been reported to provide superior pain relief and paresthesia
      coverage.

      This study aims to evaluate pain and paresthesia coverage by placing a paddle lead. Patients
      invited to participate in this study will be eligible for SCS therapy and will have already
      selected therapy with the Advanced Bionics Precision system, independent of possible
      inclusion in this study.
