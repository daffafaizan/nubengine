      requiring administration of iodinated contrast media and is associated with the need for
      dialysis, prolonged hospitalization, increased costs, and mortality.

      Contrast-induced nephropathy is defined as an increase of 25% in serum creatinine before the
      procedure.

      Iodixanol, a nonionic, dimeric, iso-osmolar contrast medium may be less nephrotoxic than
      low-osmolar contrast media in high-risk patients.

      The purpose of this study is to compare iodixanol versus ioxaglate in high risk patients
      between 48 and 96 hours after procedures that use contrast.
