      intramedullary nailing in the already traumatized and inflammatory activated patient was
      analyzed in the present study with the attention to survey the additional burden of this
      operative treatment. The patients are monitored with a pulmonary catheter, and blood samples
      for coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement and cytokine response are withdrawn pre-, per- and
      postoperatively. The study is partly randomized 1)where delayed intramedullary nailing is
      compared with primary nailing of the femur, and 2) a new reaming technique (RIA) is compared
      with a standard reaming technique (TR).
