      I. To evaluate 68Ga-RM2 (formerly known as DOTA bombesin or BAY 86-7548) PET/MRI for
      detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients with elevated
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and non-contributory computed tomography (CT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-RM2 intravenously (IV) and beginning 45 minutes later undergoing
      PET/MRI scan. The 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI may be repeated at the completion of treatment to evaluate
      response to therapy, if requested by the treating physician.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours and then at 1 year.
