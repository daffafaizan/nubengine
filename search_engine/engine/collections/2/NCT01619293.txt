      brain injury (TBI)in Europe. In many hospitals S-100B is used routinely as a part of a set of
      high- and medium risk factors aiding the decision to perform a cranial computed tomography
      (CCT) in patients with minor head injury (MHI). In patients with severe head injury Raabe et
      al. found a significant correlation between the S-100B levels and unfavourable outcome in
      patients with severe brain injury with serum levels higher than 0.50 μg/l measured 24h after
      injury. The average level of the neuromarker, compared with other studies. The study of
      Biberthaler et al. showed highest levels in patients with epidural hematomas, followed by
      subdural, subarachnoidal and intracerebral hematomas. On the contrary the average S-100B
      levels of patients with epidural hematomas featured in a study by Unden et al. published in
      2005 displayed normal levels (<0.2 μg/L). They concluded that S-100B was unreliable as a
      marker for epidural hematomas.

      Aim of the study Validation of S-100B in patients with intracerebral, epidural, subdural, and
      subarachnoidal hematoma, brain edema and concussion (Group 1-6), to find evidence which kind
      of injury leads to which level of elevation of the neuromarker measured in peripheral blood.
