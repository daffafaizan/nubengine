    
      This will be a single-dose, open-label, randomised, two-period crossover study with orally
      administered 1 x 5mL (50 mg) of Jayempi™ Oral Suspension 10mg/mL versus oral azathioprine
      tablet 50mg (Imurek®, Aspen Pharma Trading Limited, Dublin, Ireland) on two separate
      occasions conducted under fasting conditions in healthy male and female subjects at a single
      study centre.

      The study will comprise:

        -  Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) testing;

        -  Screening period of maximum 28 days

        -  Two treatment periods (each of which will include a PK profile period of 12 hours)
           separated by a wash-out period of at least 3 calendar days (minimum number of days based
           on half-life of the analyte) and maximum of 14 calendar days between consecutive
           administrations of the IMP

        -  A post-study visit 7-10 days after the last dose of the last treatment period of the
           study.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment sequence, prior to the first administration
      of IMP.
