    
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of a multiple subcutaneous injection of
      PolyPEPI1018 as an add-on immunotherapy to the standard-of-care maintenance therapy in
      approximately 15 subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      The first part of the study investigates the administration of a single vaccine dose during
      12-week follow-up period on an outpatient basis. Screening is performed in parallel with the
      subject's completion of the standard-of-care first-line treatment and initiation of the
      standard-of-care maintenance treatment. A single dose of PolyPEPI1018 is administered after
      the subject initiates the maintenance regimen, and within 3 weeks after the eligibility CT
      scan was performed. Subjects are monitored every 3 weeks for 12 weeks.

      The second part of the study investigates the administration of 3 vaccine doses (Weeks 0, 13,
      26) then 12 weeks follow-up on an outpatient basis.
