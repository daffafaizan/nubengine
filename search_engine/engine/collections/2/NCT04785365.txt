      enrolled after either: completing 2 years of follow-up visits in study ATX-NS-001 or study
      ATX-ME-001; or voluntary withdrawal from these studies prior to the completion of the 2 year
      of follow-up period.

      Each patient will be followed up for a minimum period of 5 years, or until death if sooner,
      in this Long-Term Follow Up Protocol.

      For patients who are still alive after 5 years of follow-up, survival data will continue to
      be collected until the end of the study, which will occur when the last patient has completed
      5 years of follow-up withdraws from study or has died.
