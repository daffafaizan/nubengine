      receiving peripheral blood stem cells supported by high dose carmustine and melphalan
      followed by consolidation therapy with cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone/etoposide/cisplatin
      (DCEP) and paclitaxel/cisplatin. II. Evaluate the incidence of early death in comparison with
      historical data in this patient population. III. Evaluate the feasibility of chemotherapy
      with DCEP and paclitaxel/cisplatin following autotransplantation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2, followed by melphalan IV over
      20 minutes on day -1. Patients receive intravenous CD34 peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.
      At 3 months and 9 months, patients with adequate hematologic counts receive cyclophosphamide
      IV, oral dexamethasone, etoposide IV, and cisplatin IV for 4 days. At 6 and 12 months after
      autotransplantation, patients with adequate peripheral blood counts and creatinine receive
      oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, paclitaxel IV over 6 hours on day 2, and cisplatin IV over 24
      hours on day 3. Patients are followed every 6 weeks to 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-63 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5
      years.
