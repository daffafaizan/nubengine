      1975, the therapeutic efficacy has been widely accepted and now AB medication is considered
      the first-line choice worldwide among pharmacologic options for BPH-related LUTS.

      Previous studies usually focused on the treatment efficacy or preventive role of AB for
      clinical progression of BPH and AB therapy in real-life practice improved BPH/LUTS and
      reduced the risk of overall clinical progression. However, the correlation between the change
      of serum PSA or PSAV and severity of LUTS has been poorly understood. Some studies showed
      follow-up data of PSA during the study period, and they failed to show a significant change
      of PSA in the group of AB. In contrast, some other studies demonstrated that the possibility
      of PSA change with the presence of LUTS and it is early to tell conclusively that there would
      be no relationship between PSA values and LUTS severity. Because a PSA value is considered an
      important factor to determine whether transrectal prostate biopsy should be performed, We
      hypothesized that the change of PSA and PSAV would be correlated to LUTS severity in the
      groups of BPH and prostate cancer.
