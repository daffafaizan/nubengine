      I. Determine the objective response rate (complete response plus partial response) of
      dasatinib in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).

      II. Determine the progression-free survival of dasatinib in ACC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of response. II. Determine the stable disease rate and duration of
      stable disease. III. Determine progression-free survival. IV. Determine the median survival.
      V. Determine the overall survival. VI. Determine the safety and tolerability.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine biomarkers that relate to SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase
      (Src) signal transduction and to correlate these biomarkers with clinical response to
      dasatinib in ACC and non-ACC malignant salivary gland tumors (MSGT).

      II. Determine if activating mutations in platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide
      (PDGFA) and KIT are associated with response in ACC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 8 weeks.
