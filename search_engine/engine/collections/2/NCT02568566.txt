      I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic geometric mean titer (GMT) of HPV
      16/18 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the prime dose and prior to the administration
      of the second dose.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic GMT of HPV types
      6/11/31/33/45/52/58 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after prime dose and prior to the
      administration of the second dose.

      II. To assess safety and reactogenicity to each vaccine dose.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly (IM)
      at baseline (priming injection) and at 24 and 30 months (booster injections).

      After completion of study, participants are followed up for 2 weeks.
