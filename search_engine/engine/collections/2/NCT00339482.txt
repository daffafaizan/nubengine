      investigation of the etiology and determinants of type 2 diabetes (and its complications) and
      formerly arthritis. The original baseline observations were made on the residents of the Gila
      Indian Reservation, predominantly Pima Indians, in 1965. We attempt to reexamine the
      population at two-yearly intervals, and have continued to recruit new respondents who,
      because of age and residence or familial relationships, become eligible for entry into the
      project. Eligible persons receive a battery of standardized examinations related to diabetes
      and its complications at two-yearly intervals, including a glucose tolerance test,
      biochemical determinations, such as serum cholesterol and creatinine, insulin, etc., a
      physical examination, and in those aged 15 years and above, retinal photographs, and an
      electrocardiogram. Persons known to have diabetes will be asked to undergo the examination at
      annual intervals to enable more complete and accurate documentation of their health status
      and to identify the development and progression of complications of the disease.

      The data collected have been used to describe the natural history and determinants of
      diabetes and its complications, to investigate factors relating to the etiology of these
      diseases and investigate the genetics of diabetes, its complications and other phenotypes. In
      addition, the project serves to identify subjects with specific characteristics for the
      clinical research projects carried out by the Obesity and Diabetes Clinical Research Section
      and the Diabetes Epidemiology and Clinical Research Section of the Branch.
