      with recent-onset schizophrenia. All participants will undergo baseline assessments that will
      include an interview, written tests, blood draws, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants will then be assigned randomly to receive
      treatment with either computerized neuroadaptive cognitive training or commercially available
      computer games. Participants will be asked to complete 60-minute sessions of their assigned
      treatments 5 days per week for 8 weeks. For participants receiving cognitive training,
      exercises will focus on improving speed and accuracy in the perception of and response to
      verbal and visuospatial targets. The 8 weeks of treatment will focus on targeted cognitive
      training (TCT). Participants assigned to practice computer games will play standard
      commercially available games, with no targeted response.

      Participants will repeat baseline assessments after the computer training and Month 6 of
      follow-up. The EEG and MRI will be repeated only at post training assessment visit. There
      will be a blood draw at Week 2 of treatment as well. After the Month 6 assessment,
      participants in the control condition will be offered an opportunity to complete an
      additional 8 weeks of computer training with different modules.
