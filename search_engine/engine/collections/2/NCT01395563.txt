      of recent declines in overall mortality from cardiovascular disease. Existing methods of
      emergency resuscitation are inadequate due to time delays inherent in the transport of a
      trained responder with defibrillation capabilities to the side of the OOH-CA victim. Existing
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems typically combine paramedic Emergency Medical
      Technician (EMT) services with some level of community involvement, such as bystander
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. Some communities include automated external
      defibrillators (AEDs) at isolated sites or in mobile police or fire vehicles. A
      comprehensive, integrated community approach to treatment with AEDs would have community
      units served by these volunteer non-medical responders who can quickly identify and treat a
      patient with OOH-CA. Such an approach is termed Public Access Defibrillation (PAD).
