      test the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at reducing risky behavior by
      teenagers. Two intervention groups will each receive a training intervention to reduce the
      chances of teen pregnancy, contraction of STIs, and abusive relationships among high risk
      youth in the Louisville community. The wait-list control group will receive training on the
      unrelated topic of community building at the same time. According to the Centers for Disease
      Control (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), 50% of Kentucky high school
      students have participated in sexual intercourse, 37% report currently being sexually active,
      and 14% have reported having sexual intercourse with four or more sexual partners.
      Furthermore, only 41% of sexually active students reported using a condom the last time they
      had sex. These are risky sexual practices that may lead to HIV/STI infection, as well as
      unintended pregnancy, within the adolescent population. Understanding the pregnancy
      intentions of these adolescents is not only important with regards to adolescent pregnancy,
      but it is also important in light of HIV and STI infection when 6% of adolescents and young
      adults (<20 years of age) in Kentucky have been reported as HIV positive since 2009. As of
      January 2009, Kentucky ranked 42nd for teenage births (where 1 is best) with a teenage birth
      rate of 56 per 1,000 girls ages 15-19 years of age. Kentucky was only slightly above
      Mississippi, which ranked 50th with a teenage birth rate of 68.4 per 1,000. Kentucky's
      teenage birth rate is higher than the national rate which is currently 41.9 per 1,000 girls
      ages 15-19 years of age. The most recent Kentucky teen birth rates in 2007 show that
      Jefferson County (52.34 per 1,000 ages 15-19) exceeds the birth rate of the nation. To
      address these issues, 1450 Louisville youth were given the opportunity to participate in one
      of two intervention curricula: called Reducing the Risk and Love Notes, or a waiting list
      control condition.
