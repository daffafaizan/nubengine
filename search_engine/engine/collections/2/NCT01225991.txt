      arthritis in older adults. The investigators are interested in the relationship of chronic
      pain to inflammation, resilience, fatigue, and physical and mental functioning. The
      investigators anticipate that effective pain reduction will result in improved fatigue,
      resilience, physical and mental functioning and reduced levels of inflammation. The
      investigators are seeking to examine this directly in 30 older adults (55 years of age or
      older) with rheumatoid arthritis who will be using milnacipran for treatment of pain in the
      absence of clinical major depression. This proposed trial will serve as a pilot study to
      estimate the effect of the drug on pain and functional outcomes, as well as aid in
      dose-finding in this population.
