      than women with low mammographic density. At the same time, the sensitivity of mammography is
      seriously impaired in women with high mammographic density, leading to many missed cases.
      Nevertheless, in the Netherlands this high risk group is currently screened between the age
      of 50 and 75 years with mammography only. MRI is likely to lead to better detection of breast
      tumors in women with high mammographic density, because it has a much higher sensitivity than
      mammography. The DENSE trial investigates the additional value of MRI for breast cancer
      screening in this risk group. Participants with extremely dense breasts (ACR4) and a negative
      mammogram are randomized to 'additional MRI' (n=7,237) versus 'current practice' (n=28,948).
