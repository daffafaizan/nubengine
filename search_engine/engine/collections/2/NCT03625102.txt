      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Those carriers in China account for 33% of all chronic
      carriers globally. A big epidemiological study of patients with chronic hepatitis B has
      revealed that baseline HBV DNA level or cirrhosis is an independent predictor for the
      occurrence of HCC.

      Antroquinonol is a new chemical entity isolated from the mycelium of Antrodia camphorata,
      which showed interesting anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.Previous studies have
      indicated that signaling molecules, such as PI3K, AMPK, and mTOR, participate in
      Antroquinonol-induced cancer cell death, whereas Nrf2 and NF-kB are involved in the
      anti-inflammatory effects of Antroquinonol. Moreover, we also found the administration of
      Antroquinonol also differentially modulated T cell activity and reduced IL-18 production, but
      enhanced the activation of Nrf2 and, thus, suppressed oxidative stress by animal studies.
      These results demonstrate the potential applications of Antroquinonol in treating hepatitis
      B.
