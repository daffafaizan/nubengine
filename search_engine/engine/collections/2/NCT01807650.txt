    
      Oleogel-S10 has shown efficacy and was well tolerated in previous clinical trials in
      participants with skin lesions. Especially the results in a previous study with STSG donor
      sites suggested that Oleogel-S10 should be efficacious and safe in the treatment of
      superficial wounds.

      The present phase III clinical trial in STSG donor sites was initiated to demonstrate wound
      healing progress, i.e., the time to healing and the grade of epithelialization of the wound.

      In this study, STSG donor sites were separated into 2 wound halves. Randomly assigned, 1
      wound half was treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing, the other wound half
      with non-adhesive wound dressing only (standard of care).

      Wound healing progress was documented by photos which were assessed by expert reviewers
      blinded to the treatment of the wound halves.
