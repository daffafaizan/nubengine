      effects of ME-609, acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle, and vehicle alone. Treatment was
      subject-initiated within 1 hour of experiencing the first signs or symptoms of a herpes
      recurrence. The subject visited a study clinic as soon as possible after treatment
      initiation, but no later than midnight of the following day, for evaluation.
