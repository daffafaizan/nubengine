    
      More than a decade ago, uterus transplantation (UTx) as a highly experimental procedure was
      the treatment which had been developed for women suffering from absolute uterine factor
      infertility (AUFI) [uterus absence (congenital and surgical), or an abnormality (anatomic and
      functional)].

      In Egypt, People's religions, current ethical and legal backgrounds make the option of
      live-donor uterus transplantation appealing rather than alternative pathways to parenthood.
      Thus, its clinical application for the first time in Egypt should be initiated after an
      extensive review and analysis of literature for UTx technology development in the world, and
      for further possible contributions to future prospects by Egypt proposed UTx project team
      which will participate in our study.

      The study protocol includes live-donor UTx (mother, relative, friend) into women with AUFI.
      The recipient will be treated by standard immunosuppression and transfer of embryos (acquired
      by IVF before surgery) will be attempted after 8-12 months have passed from transplantation.
      Two official approvals must be obtained before starting recruitment process; from both
      (Higher Committee of Human Organ Transplantation of Egyptian Ministry of Health and
      Population, and Al-Azhar University Council).
