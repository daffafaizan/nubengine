      short-and long-term outcomes of robot-assisted thoraco- laparoscopic minimally invasive
      esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Patients will registered preoperatively. The planned
      sample size was 51. Preoperative endoscopic biopsy was performed in all patients to confirm
      the histological diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Staging workup included thorough history and
      physical examination, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and integrated
      positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Patients with histologically proven
      malignancy were candidates for surgical procedures. Operability criteria were defined
      according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. All patients were within
      the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I to III. In general, neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy was offered to patients with T2-3 or N1-2 disease. The primary endpoint in
      the first stage is the short-term postoperative complications, and that in the second stage
      is overall survival; patients continue to be followed up for this endpoint.
