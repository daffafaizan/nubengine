      reported that quality of life have to be measured irrespective with the severity of
      depression because quality of life has some other aspect to depression.The investigators have
      designed a 6-week single blinded study with flexible dose aripiprazole augmentation, ranging
      from 2.5mg to maximum 20 mg (15mg for patients on fluoxetine or paroxetine), in patients who
      responded inadequately (a score of >18 on the MADRS) to first-line antidepressant
