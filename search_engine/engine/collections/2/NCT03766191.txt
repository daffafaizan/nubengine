      neural reactivity, eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) in response to food cues, and
      adiposity gain in children. They will also determine whether self-regulatory capacity
      modifies these associations. The genetic factors explored specifically include FTO, MC4R,
      polymorphisms in genes involved in dopaminergic pathways, and a composite genetic risk score
      built from genome-wide obesity-related loci.
