      collected through the electrical medical records. The major endpoints are the high risk
      patients and 30-days mortality which defined cases of including any of one among the death,
      re-bleeding, and received the intervention (such as blood transfusion, endoscopic therapy and
      operation).

      Investigators assessed the relationship between initial RDW level and high risk patients and
      30-days mortality. In addition, investigators compare the dicrimination power for predicting
      outcomes between the UGIB scoring system and RDW level.

      Univariate and multivariate logistic regression testing and a Cox hazard regression model
      were used to determine the factors associated with outcome variables. In addition,
      investigators constructed receiver operating characteristic curves, and the areas under the
      curves and confidence intervals were calculated to compare the discriminatory power for
      outcomes.
