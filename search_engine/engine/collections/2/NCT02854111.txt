      individuals than does fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Hence OGTT is the method that has high
      sensitivity compared to other methods for diagnosis of IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) and
      diabetes. However, standard OGTT with 75-g glucose has poor patient tolerance and might cause
      reactive hypoglycemia. The alternatives for 75-g glucose would help for screening of DM with
      better tolerance. There were previous studies investigated substitutes for oral glucose
      solution with cookies and muffin. In the present study we hypothesized that an alternative
      food such as ice cream, a favorite dessert, can use for evaluation of the diagnosis of DM and
      IGT instead of standard 75-g glucose.
