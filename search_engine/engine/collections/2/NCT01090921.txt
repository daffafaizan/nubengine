    
      This study is a multi-site study which will enroll up to 50 patients with multiple myeloma
      who have not had prior treatment.

      Prior to starting treatment individuals will be evaluated to determine if they are eligible
      to participate in the study. There are certain prestudy test that are required: physical
      exam, blood tests, ECG, chest x-ray, skeletal survey, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to
      confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma and to determine baseline health status.

      Before beginning each treatment cycle and at the end of the study, patients will have protein
      studies (including blood and urine) to see if they are responding to the treatment. Before
      each weekly treatment cycle patients will also have blood tests for red and white blood cells
      and platelets, and blood chemistry tests for electrolytes, kidney and liver function, calcium
      and blood sugar.

      Patients may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. At the end of the study, individuals who
      have responded to treatment will be seen every two months to check for disease progression.
