      a cause of remarkable morbidity, individual suffering and costs. The effect of calcium and
      vitamin-D in fracture prevention have been tested in elderly patients mostly over 70-75 years
      of age and results with low dose intervention have been controversial. The aim of this study
      is to determine the effects of calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin-D (800 IU/d) in 65-71 year-old
      postmenopausal women in a clinical trial on two levels: a) a randomized postal interview
      trial (n=3432) and b) a randomized clinical trial (n=606). 5407 women of the OSTPRE-cohort
      received a postal enquiry with questions of health related issues and willingness to
      participate a calcium and vitamin-D survey. 4706 enquiries were returned. 3432 eligible women
      were randomised to the active treatment group (n=1718) to receive the intervention and
      control group (n=1714), that did not receive placebo, they were told to go on as before in
      terms of calcium or vitamin-D substitution. On the level of the interview trial end point
      variables, falls and fractures, are collected by telephone interviews annually and on the
      level of the clinical trial every four months. In clinically examined subset of 606 subjects
      axial and heel bone mineral density (BMD), heel quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement,
      anthropometric measurements, a comprehensive set of clinical (muscle strength, balance,
      functional capacity) and laboratory tests (serum calcium, phosphate, AFOS, creatinine,
      cholesterol, triglycerides, complete blood count, 25-OH-D-vitamin, PTH, osteocalcin and
      Trap5B and reserve, serum and urine samples) will be performed and food diary will be
      obtained at baseline and after 3 years follow-up and baseline blood samples will be taken for
      DNA-analyses.
