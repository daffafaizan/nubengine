    
      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Lucemyra™ (lofexidine; LFX), an
      alpha-2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) agonist, as a medication for the prevention of opiate
      relapse and the alleviation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in
      opiate-dependent veterans.

      Primary Endpoints :

      For OUD:

      Drug-Taking Behavior (% abstinent from illicit opioid use from Week 5 to Week 12 of the
      active treatment phase) is the primary efficacy endpoint for monitoring the effects of
      treatment on OUD, which is measured by both urine drug screen (UDS; opioids are detectable
      for 1-4 days) and timeline follow-back (TLFB) interviews of drug/alcohol use.

      For PTSD:

      The primary efficacy endpoint for monitoring the effects of treatment on PTSD symptoms is
      mean change scores on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders (DSM-5) (PCL-5), which is recommended by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the
      Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline as a quantitative measure of a
      patient's PTSD symptoms and response to treatment over time.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      For OUD:

      Drug-Taking Behavior (≥ 80% abstinent between Week 5 to Week 12), treatment duration (days in
      treatment), and scores on the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), the Clinical Opiate
      Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale (OC-VAS) are secondary
      efficacy endpoints for monitoring the effects of treatment on symptoms on OUD.

      For PTSD:

      The secondary efficacy endpoints for monitoring the effects of treatment on core symptoms of
      PTSD are CAPS-5 change score (between screening and Week 12).

      Population:

      120 veteran participants will be recruited from within the MEDVAMC. The study population will
      consist of veterans diagnosed with OUD and potential or provisional PTSD who are seeking
      treatment.

      Phase:

      This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site, parallel groups,
      12-week treatment study

      Duration:

      Enrollment period of 24 months. Participant duration is 18 weeks (consisting of 4 weeks
      screening, a 12-week treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up).
