      have gained considerable attention from the media, members of Congress, and the Department of
      Defense. Identifying and intervening with individuals thinking of suicide (as well as those
      engaging in suicidal behavior) is key to preventing suicide in Service Members. Intervention
      through caring contacts (e.g., letters, phone calls) have efficacy showing they may be an
      important adjunct or alternative to outpatient care. Caring contact interventions have been
      shown in previous studies to decrease suicidal ideation and attempts and initial pilot data
      have shown positive results in military populations.

      Text messaging, a low-cost means of sending brief messages (160 characters) to any owner of a
      mobile phone, has been investigated as an intervention for improving attendance to medical
      appointments and adherence to treatment in medical populations. As our current military
      population is a young, mobile, and increasingly technologically savvy population, and with
      the growing support behind text messaging as a feasible and effective mode of behavioral
      intervention, the pairing of text messaging and caring contact interventions warrants further
      research.

      The investigators plan to randomize 800 participating Service Members to one of the two
      treatment conditions (i.e., CCVT+TAU or TAU alone) to test the efficacy of this intervention.
      Measured endpoints will include suicide risk incident requiring medical evacuation or
      hospitalization, suicidal ideation as identified by the follow-up assessment battery,
      "thwarted belongingness" as identified by The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, outpatient
      behavioral health care utilization, and death.
