      and effectiveness of the Babylog VN500 device in high frequency oscillatory ventilation
      (HFOV) mode in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates of 23 to 30 weeks' gestational age (400
      g to 1200 g, inclusive) with documented respiratory distress requiring invasive respiratory
      support. The safety will be determined by evaluating the rate of subjects alive at Day 32 and
      free of Grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or cystic periventricular
      leukomalacia. Evaluation of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient 12 hours after start of
      ventilation will account for the effectiveness.
