      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral/interstitial therapy with TransMID compared to best
      standard of care in patients with progressive and/or recurrent, non-resectable glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the safety of intratumoral/interstitial therapy with TransMID compared to best
      standard of care in patients with progressive and/or recurrent, non-resectable glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      To evaluate possible differences in efficacy and/or safety with TransMID associated with
      differing degrees of transferrin receptor expression in tumor tissue and serum
      anti-diphtheria toxin antibody titer levels.

      Study Design:

      Multicenter, open label, randomized study comparing TransMID with a chemotherapeutic regimen
      considered to be best standard of care and consisting of either nitrosureas, platinum
      compounds, temozolomide, procarbazine or PCV (procarbazine, lomustine (CCNU) & vincristine).
      A planned interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted after
      approximately 50 percent of the required events have been observed.
