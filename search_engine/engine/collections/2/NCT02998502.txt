    
      The Freespira Breathing System (FBS; www.freespira.com) developed by Palo Alto Health
      Sciences, Inc, is a portable home device , and has been employed in breathing biofeedback in
      adults with panic disorder (PD). The FBS has now received FDA clearance for the treatment of
      PD adults and is currently commercially available and more than 150 therapist have provided
      the service nationally. However, FBS has not yet been tested for efficacy in a pediatric
      populations. Due to its portability, FBS may pose an advantage for use in younger age groups,
      compared to multiple therapy sessions required for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or
      lower acceptability for long-term medication use for adolescent PD.

      In this pilot intervention study, the efficacy of the FBS system in youth will be tested. In
      children adolescents, PD itself is less common than in adults, but when present, PD is
      commonly associated with and/or preceded by other anxiety conditions, including generalized
      anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SoP) and separation anxiety (SAD). Thus, in children
      and adolescents, the breathing biofeedback intervention for panic, should include other
      anxiety disorders.
