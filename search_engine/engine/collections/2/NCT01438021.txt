      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of continuous intraventricular methotrexate
      infusion in the treatment of leptomeningeal disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the dose limiting toxicities. II. Describe the pharmacodynamics of continuously
      delivered intraventricular methotrexate.

      III. Assess for response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive intraventricular methotrexate continuously on days 1-14. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
