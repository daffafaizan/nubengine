      adaptive ski/snowboarding program on parent perceived and child self-reported health related
      quality of life. To this effect, the study will assess children's self-perception of
      psychological, emotional, physical health of participants as well as their parents perception
      of the same, through the use of a validated self reported quality of life questionnaire,
      KIDSCREEN-52, before and after participating in an adaptive ski/snowboarding program every
      year.

      Primary Aims:

        1. To determine the level of subject and parent satisfaction and happiness, through a
           composite of 10 aspects in a quality of life questionnaire, following participation in
           the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital Sports Program (HSP) for one winter season.

        2. To determine the long-term impact of repeated participation in an adapted
           ski/snowboarding program through a composite of 10 aspects in a quality of life
           questionnaire, following participation in the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital
           Sports Program (HSP) for consistent winter seasons.
