      Nowadays ENT surgeons are offered a wide variety of endoscopy methods. The methods that
      caused revolution in early diagnostics of head and neck cancer were advanced imagining
      endoscopy methods such as NBI or IMAGE1S.

      The new only recently introduced method is enhanced contact endoscopy, which uses a
      combination of advanced imagining, such as NBI or IMAGE1S, with rigid microlaryngoscope. It
      is believed that this technology has the potential to visualise vascular patterns of
      precancerous and malignant mucosal changes even better than narrow-band imaging (NBI) and
      IMAGE1S. This improvement in diagnostics helps with early identification of high-risk lesions
      and moves us closer to the concept of pre-histological diagnostics, which helps to accelerate
      making final diagnosis, which leads to prompt treatment.

      Study protocol:
