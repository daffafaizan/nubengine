    
      This prospective data collection is made up of an all-comers design, including all eligible
      consecutive patients receiving an Impella (2.5, 5, CP, or RP) or VA-ECMO device via femoral
      access who gave their consent (or, if not possible, their relative).

      The project's main goal is to collect baseline clinical and procedural data as well as to
      assess clinical outcomes for all patients undergoing ECMO or Impella implantation at all
      included sites. All patients undergoing ECMO and/or IMPELLA implantation will be
      prospectively registered. Device use is according to the decision of the treating physician
      and independent of this registry.
