      standard protocol. Two sonographers acquire images and measure IMT for 100 vessels. IMT
      technique standard deviation (SD) is determined by assuming normally distributed
      measurements, and dividing the SD of the 100 (paired) IMT differences by sqrt(2). This SD
      will be taken as measures of precision of the IMT technique.
