      content different fractions (containing soluble bacterial fractions and membrane bound
      bacterial fractions) will be processed. These bacterial fractions (also termed as bacterial
      secretome) will be tested for proinflammatory potential in tissue culture assays including
      epithelial colonic cell lines and dendritic/monocytic cell lines. The main outcome parameter
      will be the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from the tissue culture.

      For this purpose the investigators will test different groups of patients including patients
      with active/inactive Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, patients with other inflammatory
      conditions of the colon, patients with colorectal carcinoma and healthy controls undergoing
      colonoscopy.
