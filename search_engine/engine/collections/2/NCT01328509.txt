      near relative. Successive patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Aberdeen Royal
      Infirmary who fulfil the following criteria for sepsis, given below, within a 24h time
      window, will be included.

        -  Clinical suspicion or evidence of acute infection

        -  SIRS defined by two or more of the following:

             1. Core temperature <36 degrees C or >38 degrees C

             2. Tachycardia; heart rate > 90 beats/min.

             3. Tachypnoea; respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min or mechanical ventilation

             4. White blood count >12 x 109/l or <4 x 109/l

      In this pilot study we will recruit 20 patients with sepsis and 20 critically ill patients
      with no clinical suspicion of sepsis. Patients will be excluded if they are <16 years,
      pregnant or lactating, HIV positive, receiving corticosteroids or other known
      immuno-modulatory drugs (including statins), have cancer or autoimmune disorders or if
      consent/assent is refused.

      Blood samples will be obtained on Days 1,2, 5, 10 and 14 of the ICU stay. Peripheral whole
      blood will be sampled from an indwelling arterial line and plasma will be separated for
      analysis of plasma zinc using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      pentraxin-3 (PTX3) will be measured using enzyme immunoassay and total antioxidant capacity
      and lipid hydroperoxides will be measured colourimetrically [17]. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (MNC) will be separated using single density gradient centrifugation, RNA
      extracted and metallothionein mRNA measured using qPCR [21]. Nuclear extracts of MNC will be
      prepared and nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB)activation measured using an enzyme immunoassay
      [17].
