      patients. Two crystalloid iv. solutions namely 0.9% saline and balanced crystalloid are the
      most commonly administrated. However, early literature suggests that 0.9% saline is
      associated with hyperchloremic acidosis, which affects cellular metabolism and may result in
      worse prognosis among acute or critically ill patients. However, recent literature in 2018,
      including a meta-analysis and a large randomized controlled trial published in the New
      England Journal of Medicine revealed neutral or merely slight different clinical outcomes
      between 0.9% saline and balanced crystalloids. Therefore, the metabolic differences between
      these two fluids may only exist in specific metabolic pathway which may be easily masked by
      the complex pathophysiological changes in acute and critically ill patients. These metabolic
      alteration may be only identified by precise research t the technology such as liquid
      chromatography mass spectrometry, which provides more comprehensive metabolomics profiles. By
      comparison, surgical patients undergoing major spine surgery receive a relatively large
      amount of intravenous infusion during surgery, and there is not complicated with complex
      pathophysiological alteration of cormorbid diseases. Accordingly, this study aim to identify
      the metabolomic differences between 0.9% saline and balanced crystalloid among patients
      undergoing major spine surgery by using the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
      technique.
