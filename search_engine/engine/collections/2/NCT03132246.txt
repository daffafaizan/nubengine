      issue. Wound infections result in both increased length of hospital stay and total cost of
      care.

      Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common preventable adverse outcome after a major
      operation. The economic costs to the US healthcare system are enormous estimated to be in
      excess of $1.8 billion per year. For patients who develop an SSI, the cost may be even higher
      with length of stay and risk of death doubled. Thus the benefits of any intervention
      decreasing the risk of SSI are very tangible.

      A biofilm is a layer of bacteria that adheres to a surface; in Orthopaedics, this often means
      adherence to implanted metal after fracture surgery. The test that has been designed by one
      of the investigators on the study has been shown in an animal model to detect the formation
      of a biofilm up to 1 month prior to clinical detection. Having a blood assay such as this
      would allow earlier antibiotics and potentially prevent the need for further surgeries to
      remove metal implants and clean out the biofilm.
