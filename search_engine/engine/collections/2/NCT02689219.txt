    
      Primary Objective To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in relapsed/
      refractory NSGCT.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine the progression free survival in patients with relapsed/ refractory NSGCT
           treated with brentuximab vedotin.

        2. To determine the overall survival of patients with relapsed/ refractory NSGCT treated
           with brentuximab vedotin.

        3. To determine the safety and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin in this patient
           population.

      Eligible patients will be divided into two cohorts, those who are CD30 positive and those who
      are CD30 negative/unknown. Both groups will be treated similarly and in parallel but analyzed
      separately. CD30 status may be unknown in the unlikely case of tumor-marker-only relapse or
      when a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible, and archival tumor tissue is not obtainable
      despite efforts to do so. These patients will be included in the CD30 negative cohort for
      analysis purposes, since statistically NSGCT are more likely to be CD30 negative. The number
      of such patients with unknown CD30 status should not exceed 5 patients.

      Eligible patients will be treated with brentuximab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks
      (maximum dose of 180 mg) indefinitely until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      study closure.Eligible patients with grade 2 peripheral neuropathy at enrollment will be
      treated with brentuximab vedotin at 1.2 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (maximum dose of 180 mg)
      indefinitely until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study closure. Response to
      treatment will be assessed clinically with history, physical exam and tumor markers
      measurement (BHCG and AFP) on day 1 of each cycle and with CT scans after cycle 2, 4, and
      every 4 cycles thereafter while receiving treatment.
