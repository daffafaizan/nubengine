    
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single-center, controlled study of patients with
      AF referred for ablation after failing one or more Class I-IV antiarrhythmic drugs used in
      the treatment of AF.

      • All study subjects will undergo cryoablation.

      Subjects will be followed for 12 months to assess the chronic impact of ablation with the
      Medtronic CryoCath Arctic Front™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System on LA and LV mechanical
      function. In addition, patients will undergo scheduled and symptom-driven assessments to
      detect recurrent AF and adverse events (AEs).

      We will evaluate the effect of ablation with the Medtronic Arctic Front™ Cardiac CryoAblation
      Catheter System on the atrial myocardium, with respect to LA (and LV) mechanical function, by
      assessing images acquired using TTE and CT in adult patients with atrial fibrillation who
      have failed at least one anti-arrhythmic drug. The efficacy of the Arctic Front™ Cardiac
      CryoAblation Catheter System will be assessed by ambulatory continuous ECG monitoring
