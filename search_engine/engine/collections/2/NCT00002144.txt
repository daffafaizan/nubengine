      to 6 weeks; those who show no evidence of epithelialization of the index lesion after 3 or
      more weeks are removed from study and offered intravenous foscarnet. Patients who show a good
      response to topical foscarnet cream at the end of 6 weeks may continue receiving treatment at
      the discretion of the investigator.
