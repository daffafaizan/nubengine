      containing estrogen and progesterone (NuvaRing) on vaginal bacteria, HIV shedding, and local
      immunity in women. The investigators will build on data that support a favorable effect of
      CVR on vaginal bacteria. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is found in >50% of women in sub-Saharan
      Africa. BV significantly increases risk of HIV acquisition in, and HIV transmission to male
      partners from, HIV-infected women, genital HIV shedding, and viral set point in infected male
      partners. Pregnancy is also an independent risk for HIV acquisition and transmission.
      Contraception comprises critical biomedical prevention for women with or at risk for HIV.
      Systemic depot progesterone-commonly used throughout Africa-may independently increase risk
      of HIV acquisition and transmission. Hormonal interventions preventing unintended pregnancy
      and promoting a protective vaginal microenvironment could synergistically reduce HIV risk
      especially combined with topical antiretrovirals (ARV). The investigators propose NuvaRing
      use may contribute to reduction in BV, pregnancy prevention, and decreased rates of HIV
      shedding in HIV-infected women. Sustained vaginal delivery of contraceptive and ARV PrEP as
      "multicomponent prevention" is a major focus for scientists but effects on the vaginal
      environment need careful definition before broad implementation.

      Total duration of follow up is no more than 8 months, with 5 months of CVR usage.
