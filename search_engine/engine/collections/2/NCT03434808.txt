      world can use for many different purposes. Some examples of such uses include basic research,
      discovery of new medicines, developing new products and services useful for studying human
      disease, and developing new cell-based products useful for treating people that have
      diseases. The idea of using cells made from human iPS cells to treat human diseases is of
      great interest in medicine. In this bank, a single donor's cells could be used to treat many
      people.

      The iPS cells that are made as part of this study will be included in a bank owned by CDI.
      The iPS cells and the cells made from them will be available for laboratory research or for
      clinical use in patients. It is possible that the iPS cells made from the blood donated and
      cells made from the iPS cells could be beneficial to many different patients and be used for
      many different research projects to understand human biology and disease.
