    
      Objective: The primary objective of the proposed studies is to utilize neuroimaging
      (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging [fMRI], structural MRI [sMRI], Magnetoencephalography
      [MEG]) and neuropsychological tools (eye-tracking, cognitive experiments, clinical
      neuropsychological measures, questionnaires, etc.) to identify cognitive idiosyncrasies
      (e.g., social-cognitive deficits, visual perceptual assets, and savant skills) characteristic
      of individuals on the autism spectrum and their neural underpinnings across childhood and
      adulthood.

      Study Population: Children, adolescents, and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),
      controls (i.e., typically developing children, adolescents, and adults and those with mild to
      moderate mental retardation), as well as caregivers/legal guardians/parents of these
      individuals.

      Design: Descriptive/Characterization/Observational studies using primarily neuropsychological
      and neuroimaging methodologies.

      Outcome Measures: Behavioral (reaction time, accuracy, eye movements, etc.) and neuroimaging
      (brain morphometry, BOLD, electrophysiology, etc.).
