    
      This is a non-randomized pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of an exercise
      program in hospitalized infants with single ventricle physiology. Following the Norwood
      procedure, the intervention will be administered for up to 21 days or until discharge,
      whichever comes first. Data will be collected daily during hospitalization and at a follow-up
      visit at 3 months of age. Sources of data will include medical record review. Twenty subjects
      will be enrolled at three Pediatric Heart Network study sites (Utah Primary Children's
      Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Texas Children's Hospital). Subjects will
      be recruited following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at each institution and
      parental/legal guardian consent.
