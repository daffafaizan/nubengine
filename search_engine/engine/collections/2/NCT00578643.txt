      chemotherapy to kill or destroy most of the blood forming and immune cells in the bone
      marrow. This is necessary to allow the donor stem cells to live and grow (engraft) in the
      bone marrow space. After the drug treatment is completed, the patient will be given the stem
      cells from the donor. The drug treatment is as follows:

      Day -9 Busulfan

      Day -8 Busulfan

      Day -7 Busulfan

      Day -6 Busulfan

      Day -5 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -4 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -3 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -2 Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, Cyclosporine, Cyclophosphamide

      Day -1 REST

      Day 0 Stem cell infusion

      The day after the chemotherapy treatment is completed, the patient will receive the healthy
      stem cells by vein, like a blood transfusion. Once in the bloodstream, the marrow cells will
      go to the bone marrow and grow.

      It is also possible that if the marrow takes, it will cause a disease known as
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To prevent GVHD, we will give the patient cyclosporine and
      Methotrexate. Methotrexate will be administered on Days 1, 3, 6 and 11 after the transplant.
      The cyclosporine therapy will continue for a longer period of time, however if the patient
      does not develop GVHD, it will be discontinued by 6 months after the stem cell transplant.
