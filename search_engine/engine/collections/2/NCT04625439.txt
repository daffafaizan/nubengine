      intervention can improve three outcomes in an online sample of adults with cancer: 1)
      self-awareness, 2) self-efficacy for managing aspects of their illness, and 3) mood. The
      study will occur in a single 30-minute online session conducted in Qualtrics, with a pre-post
      randomized design. Participants will respond to a baseline survey including a measurement of
      the Five-Factor Personality Model and measures of the 3 outcomes of interest, followed by
      random assignment to either an intervention group or control group. Both groups will read a
      brief description of the Five-Factor Model of Personality. Those randomized to the
      intervention group will also receive an individualized feedback report containing their
      personality results on each of the five personality factors and recommendations for cancer
      self-management based on these results. After reading the personality information,
      participants will respond to the outcome measures again in a post-intervention survey.
      Control participants will receive their individualized personality feedback reports after the
      study is complete.
