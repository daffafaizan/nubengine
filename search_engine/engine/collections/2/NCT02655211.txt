      types of laser treatment (PDL and CO2), which the investigators hypothesize to be beneficial.
      The timing and sequence of therapy will be randomized, but all patients will receive some
      form of laser treatment. If the investigators simply stopped at the end of Aim 1, the
      investigators would complete a traditional randomized control trial (RCT), with some patients
      potentially receiving laser treatment. However, the investigators are interested in
      determining whether the sequence of laser treatments is beneficial; therefore, the
      investigators will be employing a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART)
      design. Because of the nature of the study and SMART design, the investigators will offer all
      patients some form of laser therapy.
