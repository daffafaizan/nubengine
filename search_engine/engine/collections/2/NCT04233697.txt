      leading cause of cancer death. In 2015, there were an estimated 71,850 cases in the United
      States, and approximately 19,790 deaths. An evaluation of the distribution of NHL sub-types
      was performed on 114,548 cases of lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed between 1992-2001 and reported
      to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry. Of all NHL, 87,666 were
      B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, and 6,228 were considered T/Natural Killer (NK) cell neoplasms.

      The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive lymphoid
      neoplasms and account for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed cases of NHL. The current prevalence
      of PTCL in the United States is estimated to be approximately 9,500 patients. PTCL-Not
      Otherwise Specified (NOS), a nodal subtype, is the most common T-cell lymphoma in the United
      States and Europe. PTCL is associated with a significantly worse prognosis compared to its
      B-cell counterparts. Treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) PTCL have
      been limited. The addition of novel drugs to conventional chemotherapy has largely proven
      unsuccessful. Since 2009, new drugs have entered the therapeutic field for patients with R/R
      PTCL.

      Pralatrexate was the first drug approved for patients with R/R PTCL. Other drugs approved for
      patients with R/R PTCL include romidepsin and belinostat. These agents appear to exhibit
      lineage-specific activity in PTCL. Over the past few years, the investigators have focused on
      exploring rational combinations of these T-cell active agents in an effort to develop novel
      treatment platforms. Early clinical studies of these combinations have shown very promising
      activity.
