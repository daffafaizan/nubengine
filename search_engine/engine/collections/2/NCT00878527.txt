      mixed-flow blood pump designed o provide partial left ventricular support in patients with
      advanced heart failure. Treatment for this patient population currently include lifestyle
      changes, medicines, transcatheter interventions and surgery, including implantation of
      mechanical ventricular assist devices (VADs); most of the currently available VADs require
      highly invasive, high-risk surgical procedures to implant due to large device size, and are
      therefore generally limited to use in patients with terminal heart failure. The Synergy pump
      is intended for treatment of patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV
      heart failure; it is expected that the pump will provide these patients with 2-3 L/min of
      additional blood flow, giving adequate cardiac support to increase exercise tolerance and
      improve patients' quality of life. The pump's small size will allow it to be implanted in a
      less surgically invasive procedure than used with previous VADs, which should result in a
      reduction of perioperative morbidity. The device wil be implanted in a left atrial to
      subclavian artery bypass with the pump being located in the infraclavicular fossa like a
      pacemaker.
