      of whom will receive "SNK01" without placebo control. There are three (3) subjects in each of
      the three (3) cohorts. The SNK01 study product will be administered at the following doses
      using dose escalating rules: Cohort 1 will receive 4 weekly infusions of 1 billion cells,
      Cohort 2 will receive 4 weekly infusions of 2 billion cells, and Cohort 3 will receive 4
      weekly infusions of 4 billion cells. Length of participation, per subject, is approximately
      12 weeks. The primary endpoint for safety is dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) which is defined as
      TEAE of grade â‰¥ 3 considered related to SNK01. Secondary safety endpoints include other
      adverse events (graded according to National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for
      Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE v 5.0]), vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests and
      physical examination. Preliminary efficacy will be measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index
      (PASI) and by the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA.
