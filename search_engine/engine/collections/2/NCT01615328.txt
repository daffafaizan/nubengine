      synthetic materials and graft substitutes have been developed to maximize fusion outcomes
      while avoiding complications of harvesting autograft. Mixture of hydroxyapatite (HA) and
      β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), have been widely utilized for bony regeneration. On the other
      hand, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been utilized as a graft substitute with mainly its
      osteoinductive ability. While HA and β-TCP have osteoinductive osteoconductive properties and
      DBM has osteoconductive osteoinductive properties, a graft material fully incorporating both
      properties has not been developed. We hypothesize that an interbody graft material equipped
      simultaneously with osteoinductivity and osteoconductivity would enhance fusion achievement;
      however, clinical trials with mixture materials within a PEEK cage in ACDF surgery have
      rarely been performed.
