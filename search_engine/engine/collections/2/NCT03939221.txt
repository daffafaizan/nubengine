      discomfort related to terminal disease. It may be caused by cancer or multiple kinds of organ
      failure. The terminal hospital patients have symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, fatigue, nausea,
      vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, ileus or edema…, etc. Investigators want to use an
      objective measure instrument to monitor the effects of complementary and alternative
      medicine.

      First, investigators use the Meridian Energy Analysis Device (MEAD) to measure the bilateral
      12 Yuan points (primary points) of terminal hospice patients (divided to cancer, multiple
      kinds of organ failure). It provides the prediction value between terminal disease and the
      change of different meridian energy. Besides, the meridian energy value maybe predict the
      survival period. Then, investigators use the intervention of complementary and alternative
      medicine (like infrared lamp and acupressure…, etc.) to improve the quality of life in the
      terminal hospice patients. Also, investigators will use the Meridian Energy Analysis Device,
      pain scale, vital signs and quality of life scale (SF-36) to evaluate the effects of
      complementary and alternative medicine.
