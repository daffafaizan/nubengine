      participation of patients. Occupational Therapy aims to optimise functional performance and
      engagement in meaningful roles and activities. The lack of scientific evidence for the
      effectiveness of Occupational Therapy (OT) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) highlights the urgent
      need for high quality intervention studies. The Dutch clinical practice guideline for OT in
      PD (2008)offers a good basis for conducting an intervention study. The completed OTiP pilot
      underscored the feasibility and the need for a large scale trial.

      The OTiP study evaluates the effectiveness of OT in improving daily functioning of patients
      with PD.
