    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Induction of compensatory signaling/feedback loop signaling after one week of BKM120 (PI3K
      inhibitor BKM120) (run-in) compared to patients not treated with BKM120.

      II. Safety and tolerability of combined treatment with BKM120 and cetuximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Induction of apoptosis after one week of BKM120 (run-in) compared to patients not treated
      with BKM.

      II. Tumor shrinkage (based Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1
      [V1.1] measurements) in patients treated with combination.

      III. Response rate (based RECIST V1.1 measurements) in patients treated with combination.

      IV. Overall survival. V. Progression free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120, followed by a
      phase II study.

      RUN-IN-PERIOD: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to 0.
      Patients complete 1 week washout before dose escalation.

      ARM II: Patients receive no treatment on days -7 to 0.

      All patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 PO QD on days 1-28 and cetuximab intravenously
      (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
