      countries. So-called "common mental disorders" and their mostly pharmacological treatment
      are, in no small part, responsible for this situation. The cost that these disorders generate
      to the public health service is very high and they are usually associated with other issues
      like hyperfrequentation and side effects. However, research indicates that psychological
      treatment should be the first step when caring for these types of problems. We expect that
      the results show that extensive psychological therapy and combined treatment were the most
      effective. Nevertheless, brief psychological treatment is expected to be the most efficient
      in cost-benefit terms.
