      correlated with the severity of disease or the long-term sequelae. Such information is
      necessary to understand how to most logically intervene with directly acting antiviral agents
      and immunologic response modifiers. The variability of the clinical course of patients who
      may be asymptomatic throughout their clinical course to those patients who develop
      progressive multisystem organ failure represents a challenge to understand the host and viral
      factors that result in these dramatically different outcomes.

      This protocol will enroll patients to the Clinical Center in a longitudinal study using
      granular clinical, laboratory, and imaging data including extensive pulmonary and cardiac
      functional assessments, neurologic evaluation, comprehensive immunologic evaluations, and
      innovative imaging. In patients with COVID-19 infection, linking sequential analysis of
      blood, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage with simultaneous cardiopulmonary imaging can provide
      novel insights into mechanisms associated with the initiation, progression and resolution of
      lung, cardiac and systemic inflammation. These mechanisms are presumed to be essential in the
      pathogenesis and survival from this infection. This information will help guide diagnostic
      and therapeutic innovation and assess long-term consequences of this infection.
