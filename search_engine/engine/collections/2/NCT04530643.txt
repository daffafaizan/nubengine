      thereof is found to have a considerable effect in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and is
      proposed as a pharmaceutical ingredient for prevention, treatment and improvement of atopic
      dermatitis. The GPCR19 agonist, HY209, is superior to conventional steroid ointment and
      immunosuppressant ointment in the treatment and improvement of allergic dermatitis. It
      directly reduces the amount of serum immunoglobulin E, which is a major factor of allergic
      dermatitis, It increases the T helper type 1(TH1) cytokines that alleviate allergic
      dermatitis pathologies, reduces the T helper type 2(TH2) cytokines that aggravate allergic
      dermatitis pathologies, and reduces the infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils and
      neutrophils into the dermal cells. Thus it can be utilized as a therapeutic drug composition
      for atopic dermatitis.
