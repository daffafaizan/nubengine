      patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on 1) patients' comprehension of
      procedural risks/benefits and participation in shared decision-making; and 2) upon
      clinicians' use of effective strategies to minimize the risk of bleeding at the time of PCI.
      To facilitate these goals, we will prospectively provide each patients' risks for bleeding at
      the time that the informed consent document is generated. This will be accomplished by
      transforming the infrastructure of the informed consent process at participating study
      centers using a novel, web-based system - the Personalized Risk Information Services Manager
      (PRISM) - to generate individualized consent forms with estimates of risks and outcomes using
      validated multivariable models from the American College of Cardiology's NCDR. The goals of
      this study are to 1) identify barriers in implementing individualized consent forms in
      clinical care and to test whether this novel consent process 2) improves the quality of the
      informed consent process, 3) supports the more rational use of Bleeding Avoidance Therapies
      (BATs), 4) reduces bleeding events after PCI, and 5) supports a more cost-effective PCI
      procedure. This will be done using a pre-post design at 6 enrolling hospitals and comparing
      changes in practice with contemporaneous controls matched from the broader NCDR Cath/PCI
      registry.
