      single agent in an orthopotic neuroblastoma mouse model and our unpublished data support a
      VBL in vitro pro-apoptotic plasma concentration of 1-2 nM range and an anti angiogenic
      concentration of 2pM. These plasma concentrations are achievable with a 6 mg/m2 (apoptosis)
      and 1 mg/m2 VBL regimen (anti-angiogenesis) weekly regimen. We expect that vinblastine
      delivered at any given dose, as described in the protocol, will carry both anti-apoptotic and
      antiangiogenic activity. Safety and preliminary efficacy of both drugs in pediatric tumors
      support the development of a clinical trial.
