      therapy noninvasively at an earlier time point than currently detectable with standard MR
      imaging. This utility of 2HG can be used for improving the patient care in a more effective
      manner when the 2HG imaging is incorporated in regular clinical MR scans in brain tumor
      patients. We aim to translate the 2HG MRS protocol into two clinical MR centers at
      UTSouthwestern Medical Center: The Mary Nell and Ralph B. Rogers Magnetic Resonance Center
      with Philips 1.5Tesla and 3Tesla scanners and The Algur H. Meadows Diagnostic Imaging Center
      with a GE 3Tesla scanner. In addition, we will perform Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans in
      patients with neurological diseases that can mimic gliomas, including stroke, epilepsy,
      encephalitis, and brain metastases in order to establish the specificity of 2HG to malignant
      gliomas.
