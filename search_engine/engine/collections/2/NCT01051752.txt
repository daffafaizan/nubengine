      sources. These bacteria a very similar to tuberculosis bacteria. We are not that long aware
      that these bacteria can cause illness. Especially in patients with a chronic lung disease are
      sensitive to these bacteria and are susceptible to develop an infection. A lot of ambiguity
      consists about the best treatment of these infections. Up till now mainly the normal
      treatment for tuberculosis is used, however, the time period during which these medicines
      should be used and what dose should be used is mainly unknown.

      To investigate whether the dose used at this moment is right a pharmacokinetic curve will be
      taken at steady-state.
