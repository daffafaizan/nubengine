      when survivors encounter new environmental barriers due to the cognitive and sensorimotor
      sequelae of stroke. Resolving these barriers and improving independence in the community have
      potential to significantly improve stroke survivors' long-term morbidity. The proposed study
      investigates the efficacy and safety of a novel enhanced rehabilitation-transition program to
      reduce environmental barriers and improve daily activity performance and community
      participation.
