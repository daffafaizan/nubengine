    
      Weekly measurement of catheter resistance will be determined using the AlarisÂ® Syringe Module
      (Carefusion Inc., San Diego, USA), a commercially available, FDA-approved intravenous (IV)
      pump which is able to deliver accurate flow-rates and obtain accurate pressure measurements.
      The inline pressure will be measured at multiple flow-rates and resistance will be estimated
      from the gradient of the pressure-flow curve.

      Primary Objective

        -  To describe the feasibility of weekly CRM in children and adolescents treated at St.
           Jude.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe patient and caregiver adherence with weekly CRM in children and adolescents
           treated at St. Jude.

        -  To explore the correlation between results of CRM and catheter occlusion or dysfunction.
