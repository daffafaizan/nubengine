    
      Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Setting: Ambulatory
      care and home training Participants: Volunteer sample of glaucoma patients (25-80 yrs old)
      with stable visual fields and well controlled intraocular pressure (IOP).

      Intervention: Computer-based home training with VRT (n=15) or placebo discrimination training
      (n=15).

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint is change in detection performance in High
      Resolution Perimetry (HRP). Secondary endpoints are 30° white/white and 30° blue/yellow
      near-threshold perimetry. Further measures are eye movements, vision-related quality of life
      (vQoL) as assessed with (NEI-VFQ) and health-related quality of life (hQoL) using SF-36
      Health Survey-Short Form.

      Investigators hypothesize that VRT will improve visual performance in glaucoma
