      of coadministration of KL1333 on the PK of repaglinide, caffeine, omeprazole, midazolam,
      bupropion, dextromethorphan, and flurbiprofen in healthy male and female subjects. Potential
      subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28 days prior
      to the first dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the clinical research unit
      (CRU) on Day -1 and be confined to the CRU until discharge on Day 19. Subjects will return to
      the CRU for a follow-up visit 5 to 7 days after the last dose.
