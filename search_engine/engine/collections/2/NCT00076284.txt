      observed and is a major reason for failure of therapy. In particular, there is a great need
      for drugs against new targets and having novel mechanisms of action against new targets. Most
      of the currently approved drugs are targeted toward the inhibition of viral enzymes. However,
      the process of viral entry and fusion has become an active area of research. Among the steps
      involved in viral entry, binding of HIV to CD4 co-receptors on the cell surface is an
      important and promising target for new drug development.

      GW873140 is a CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I clinical development as a viral entry
      inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. GW873140 has demonstrated in vitro antiviral
      activity with an IC50 against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of 1nM equals about 0.5ng/mL), that is
      shifted 8-10 fold (10nM equals about 0.5ng/mL) in the presence of physiological
      concentrations of human plasma proteins. A study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating single (50-1200mg) and repeat (200-800mg BID) doses of
      GW873140 has been conducted in 70 healthy volunteers (GW873140/001). Preliminary results
      indicate that GW873140 is well-tolerated up to a dose of 1200 mg following single dose and
      800 mg BID following multiple-dose. Additionally, food was shown to increase the AUC and Cmax
      of a 400 mg single dose by 1.7-and 2.2-fold, respectively.

      Concentrations above the protein binding corrected IC90 are achieved following oral dosing
      and in vivo binding studies in healthy subjects demonstrate greater than 97% receptor
      occupancy 2 and 12 hours after multiple doses and 68-88% receptor occupancy 24 hours after a
      single dose, despite plasma concentrations below or near detectable limits.
