    
      30 patients with type 1 diabetes will be recruited for a one-year observational study
      employing CGM (Continuous glucose monitor) and ILR (Implantable loop recorder). Patients will
      be scheduled for a three-week run-in period to ensure that the implanted ILR provides
      reliable data. Patient visits are planned for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and will include
      clinical examination, blood and urine samples, echocardiography (only first and last visit)
      and implant/explant of CGM. After 12 months, the participants will continue with an extended
      observation period of 2 years employing ILR and clinical examination.
