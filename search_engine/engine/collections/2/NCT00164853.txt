      stone removal during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. However, complete
      sphincter ablation by endoscopic sphincterotomy is not always possible. Also, due to the
      tapering end of the distal duct, standard sphincterotomy may not be adequate for removal of
      particularly large stones. In a retrospective series by Ersoz et al, the addition of balloon
      dilation after sphincterotomy achieves a high stone clearance rate (89-95%). The
      investigators postulate that the combination of endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by balloon
      dilation may allow easier stone retrieval with acceptable complication rate.
