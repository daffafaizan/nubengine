      with late intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation in the capsular complex, after cataract surgery.

      different methods used for this condition; scleral suturing of the capsular complex or
      exchange of IOL to an iris-fixated IOL (Verisyse). In this study the investigators will look
      for advantages and dis-advantages for these two methods.
