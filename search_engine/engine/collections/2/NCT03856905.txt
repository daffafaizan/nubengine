      participate in this study. They will be selected from the out-patient clinic of Obstetric and
      Pediatric Hospital, Comprehensive Rehabilitation Center, King Khalid Hospital and Najran
      Generalized Hospital, Najran, KSA, according to inclusive criteria including, children who
      demonstrate unilateral dynamic equinus deformity, all children must be ambulant independently
      and they will classified at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I or
      II. They must be free from any skeletal abnormalities other than spasticity and the degree of
      spasticity according to the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) within the range of 1+ and 2
      grades. Moreover, all children must have a minimum five degrees of passive ankle dorsiflexion
      with knee joint extended. Exclusion criteria including, the use of botulinum toxin injection
      of the planter flexor muscles within the 4 months before the study and orthopedic surgery to
      the ankle joint in the previous 6 months before or during the study.

      Children will be assigned randomly using opaque envelopes into three intervention groups (A,
      B and C). Group A will receive the conventional physical therapy program (CPTP) in addition
      to ankle foot orthosis (AFO). Group B will receive the CPTP, AFO in addition to
      Extra-corporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), whereas group C will receive CPTP, AFO in addition
      to functional electrical stimulation (FES). All groups will receive the treatment program 3
      sessions/week for 12 weeks. Evaluation of spasticity by using the MAS, function by using the
      pediatric functional independence scale and gait parameters by using the 3-dimensional gait
      analysis will be conducted before and after 12 weeks of the treatment program.
