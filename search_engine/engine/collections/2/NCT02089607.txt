      efficacy information that may be used to plan an appropriate future study, or to inform
      further product development.

      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded, single-arm, single-center study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes and quality of life measures in a
      consecutive cohort of patients treated by endovascular aortic repair of aortic arch and
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (types I to IV) using a Zenith t-Branch or a customized
      physician-specified stent-graft with a combination of fenestrations and/or branches.
