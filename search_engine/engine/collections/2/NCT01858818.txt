      Alcohol Dependence (LeAD). Project 4 aims to investigate how dysfunctional learning and
      habitization are affected by acute alcohol exposure, and whether individual differences in
      such alcohol effects can predict later development of AUDs. The project investigates eighty
      18-year-old healthy male subjects, a subsample of LeAD project 1 that were already tested in
      Dresden using fMRI(Clinical Trials.govID: NCT01744834). Participants are tested on two days
      in a within-subjects design with blinded administration of alcohol or placebo. On 2 days
      participants are performing three behavioral and learning tasks measuring: 1. conditioning of
      money vs. drink stimuli 2. habitization vs. instrumental learning and 3. approach and
      avoidance behavior towards money and drink stimuli. The investigators investigate how alcohol
      influences the performance during these tasks, whether alcohol effects differ between high-
      and low-risk subjects, and whether task performance under alcohol predicts future AUDs.
      Participants will be followed up after three years. The project investigates whether single
      doses of alcohol affect the conditioning of monetary reward or alcoholic stimuli, impair
      instrumental learning, and enhance stimulus-response associations. The investigators want to
      test whether individual performance parameters are related to other risk factors for AUDs,
      e.g. family history of alcoholism or impulsivity.
