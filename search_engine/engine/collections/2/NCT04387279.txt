      than COVID-19 can be limited. Therefore, it is important to reduce the risk of exposure to
      COVID-19 in patients with chronic immune diseases such as IBD, but it is most important to
      manage well so that the underlying diseases are not exacerbated at times when emergency
      medical treatment may be difficult. However, there is a lack of evidence on the management
      policy of chronic immune diseases in the current epidemic, and only expert opinions are being
      presented.

      Aim: To investigate the current status of hospital utilization of IBD patients in Daegu, the
      epidemic area of COVID-19, and to investigate the effect of patient perception of COVID-19 on
      hospital utilization.

      Material and method: This study is a multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional survey which
      will be consulted in Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center and Yeungnam University
      Hospital. Patients with IBD aged above 18 will enrolled and surveyed about their perception
      about COVID-19 and status of hospital utilization during pandemic period. Patients'
      demographics and disease-related variables will be evaluated to identify clinical
      significances.
