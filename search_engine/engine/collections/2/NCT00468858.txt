      allocated to receive one of two T-DEN formulations or placebo. Subjects will be stratified by
      age group (a specific number of subjects in each of 4 age groups [12 months to 50 years of
      age] will be enrolled). The study includes 6 scheduled visits and 4 scheduled venipunctures.
      Safety follow-up for dengue may require unscheduled visits and venipunctures.> Multiple DEN
      virus serotypes are endemic in Puerto Rico and all residents are considered to be at risk for
      dengue. The results of this phase II study will provide a basis for identifying the vaccine
      formulations which elicit neutralizing antibodies to all four dengue virus serotypes in a
      high proportion of vaccine recipients. The most immunogenic and well tolerated candidate
      formulation identified in this study will be considered for advancement to phase III
      development.>
