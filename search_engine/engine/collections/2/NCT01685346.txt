      reactions which their own bodies have to stressful situations (increased heart rate,
      increased skin conductance, increased muscle tension, decreased digital peripheral
      temperature, decreased heart rate variability) and then teaching them to control these
      reactions, using standard stress management and relaxation techniques, coupled with
      computerized physiological feedback. The feedback helps patients to understand that deep
      relaxation is helping their bodies as well as their minds. Several small studies of BFSM
      training in cancer populations have been successful at helping with side effects of
      chemotherapy and radiation, but the effects of BFSM on distress and quality of life (QOL),
      particularly in NSCLC patients, have not been studied.
