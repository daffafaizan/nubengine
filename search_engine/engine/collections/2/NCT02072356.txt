      I. Provide oversight to treatment with TheraSphere to eligible patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) of the liver who are not surgical resection candidates.

      II. Evaluate patient experience, toxicities and overall survival associated with TheraSphere
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres intra-arterially (IA) on day 0, and may
      receive a second dose within 30-90 days of initial treatment. Patients may receive additional
      treatment 4-12 weeks after initial treatment at the discretion of the study physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6 weeks and annually for 2
      years.
