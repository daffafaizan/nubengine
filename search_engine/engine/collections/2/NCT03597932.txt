      complete handover of intraoperative anesthesia care compared with no handover was associated
      with a higher risk of adverse postoperative outcomes. Anesthesiologists keeping on working
      without handovers may experience symptoms of burnout which do not only pose a threat to the
      mental and physical health of the anesthesiologist, but also result in sub-optimal safety
      care of patients. Poor-quality handover without standardized processes can lead to diagnostic
      and therapeutic delays and precipitate adverse events. An improved system of anesthesia
      standardized handovers using a checklist would improve transfer of information and
      professional responsibility and therefore lead to the improvement of patient safety as well
      as burnout among anesthesiologists. Thus it is urgent to develop a standardized handover
      checklist for intraoperative anesthesia care to improve postoperative outcome of patients.
