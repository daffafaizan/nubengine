      risk of developing hyperkalaemia will be enrolled. Patients signing informed consent will be
      screened for up to 14 days. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria, but not the exclusion
      criteria, are then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ZS or placebo for 3 months while
      titrating RAASi therapies. Approximately 280 patients will be randomized in the study. Study
      treatment in this study refers to ZS or placebo, while RAASi therapies are considered
      background therapy and will not be provided by the study sponsor. Patients will participate
      in the study for approximately 16 to 18 weeks in total, depending on the duration of the
      screening period. A Safety Review Committee will be established to review emerging safety
      data
