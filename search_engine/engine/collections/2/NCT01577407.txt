      defined in pain research as the attenuation of one pain by another pain. Dyspnea induced with
      inspiratory threshold loading (increased sense of work/effort ) has been shown to attenuate
      electrical pain as shown through nociceptive flexion reflex inhibition, or thermal pain, as
      measured with cortical evoked responses (laser evoked potentials-LEP).

      The investigators will study whether nefopam modulates the counterirritation of laboratory
      induced dyspnea in healthy subjects. The effect of nefopam on experimental dyspnea will be
      measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) and a validated multidimensional dyspnea profile
      (MDP). The effect of treatment on counterirritation will be measured by recording LEP
      obtained using a CO2 laser system. The amplitude of the N2-P2 component of the LEP is the
      main study outcome.
