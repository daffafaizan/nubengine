      I. Observe longitudinal changes in structural connectivity using T1-weighted and diffusion
      tensor MRI in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer on current ADT versus those who were
      not.

      II. Observe longitudinal changes in brain functional connectivity using resting-state
      functional (rsf) MRI.

      III. Observe longitudinal changes in brain metabolic profiles evaluated by MR spectroscopy
      (MRS).

      IV. Exploratory assessment of correlation between testosterone and prostate specific antigen
      (PSA) levels with MRI measures and cognitive measures.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach using sequential 7T MRI in
      prostate cancer patients either receiving ADT or not.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 7 Tesla MRI over 30-90 minutes at baseline and at 6-9 months.
