    
      Adult patients with centre-involving diabetic macular oedema will be recruited to this
      single-centre study. Patients will undergo detailed baseline evaluation which will include:

        -  vision testing

        -  optical coherence tomography scanning

        -  fundus fluorescein angiography

        -  microperimetry

        -  colour contrast sensitivity testing

        -  electrophysiological testing

      Patients will be randomised 2:1 to receive either ranibizumab intravitreal injection 4-weekly
      for 48 weeks or modified ETDRS macular laser therapy 12-weekly for 48 weeks.

      Both groups of patients will return at 12, 24 and 48 weeks for repeat testing of the
      parameters evaluated at baseline.
