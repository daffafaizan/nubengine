    
      Thirty children (2-6 years of age), who require antibiotic treatment assessed by a doctor,
      will be enrolled in the study. The children will be randomized to receive either the
      prebiotic product or placebo during the course of antibiotic treatment.

      The children will give a faecal sample in the beginning and at the end of the study. The
      samples will be used for the analysis of microbiota and differences in the microbiota between
      the groups.
