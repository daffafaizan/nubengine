      glucose monitoring (CGM) for 3 consecutive days, given a standard meal containing 50g
      carbohydrates and foods to be tested for GI. The purpose of this study was to explore the
      fluctuation of blood glucose, the time and range of blood glucose peak after eating different
      diets, and to guide the individual dietary choices of the subjects. And try to find the best
      time and dose of hypoglycemic strategy for subjects during meals. At the same time, during
      the follow-up period, we observed whether the subjects could achieve better blood glucose
      control after adjusting their diet according to the GI of different foods. At the same time,
      the GI results of the same food were compared between people with normal glucose metabolism
      and those with abnormal glucose metabolism.
