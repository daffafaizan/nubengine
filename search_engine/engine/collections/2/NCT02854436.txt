    
      This is a multicenter and open-label (participants and researchers are aware of the treatment
      that participants are receiving) study that consists of 4 phases: a Prescreening Phase for
      biomarker evaluation only, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase (Cycle 1 Day 1 and will
      continue until the study drug is discontinued), a Follow-up Phase (every 3 months after end
      of treatment visit), and a Long-term Extension Phase (until participants no longer derive
      benefit from treatment or until further notification on different means of study treatment).
      Participants will be monitored for safety during the study period, and up to 30 days after
      the last dose of study drug.
