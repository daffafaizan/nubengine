      programs in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at a regional teaching
      hospital in Taiwan. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: the splint group
      and the control group. The subjects in the splint group received 1-hour task-oriented
      training with wearing a customized dynamic hand splint, totally 15 times in a duration of one
      month plus conventional rehabilitation programs. The subjects in the control group received
      the same treatments but without splint used. Evaluations including Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS), active range of motion (AROM), grip strength, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Motor
      Activity Log 30(MAL), and F/M ratio were performed at baseline, post-training, and 2 months
      later after the intervention finished, and the evaluators were blinded to the grouping of the
      subjects.
