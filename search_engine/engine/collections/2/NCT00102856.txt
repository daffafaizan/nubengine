      word learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind clinical trial, we probe whether a selective d2/d3 dopamine agonist
      (pramipexole) or cholinergic neuromodulation (rivastigmine), after a titration period of five
      days, will yield a learning enhancement comparable to using levodopa in healthy subjects. The
      expected scientific results will strengthen the basis for transferring neuromodulatory
      interventions from the laboratory to stroke patients with language dysfunctions.
