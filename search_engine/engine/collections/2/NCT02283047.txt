      before, after 16-week of follow-up, and after 6-month detraining period (with no intervention
      only recommendations). After inclusion criteria they will be randomized to four parallel
      groups: 1) control group with only hypocaloric diet intervention and lifestyle
      recommendations; 2) Moderate (HR values between VT1 and VT2 or 50-75% of HR reserve)
      continuous exercise and high volume (from 20 to 45min) group and hypocaloric diet
      intervention; 3) high intensity (HR values up to VT2 to peak intensity or â‰¥76% to <100 % of
      HR reserve) interval training and high-volume (from 20 to 45min) group alternating high and
      moderate intensities at different protocols and hypocaloric diet intervention; and 4)
      high-intensity interval training and low-volume (20min) group alternating high and moderate
      intensities at different protocolsand hypocaloric diet intervention.
