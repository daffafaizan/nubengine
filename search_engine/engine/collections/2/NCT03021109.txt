      Research Hospital. Patients referred to acute gastroenteritis will be included to the study.
      After initial evaluation, the clinician will inform the principal investigator about the
      patient. The principal investigator will record the patient's demographic data, contact
      information, vital signs, history, physical examination findings, and weight. Than expirium
      and inspirium diameters of vena cava inferior will be measured with the bedside ultrasound
      and caval index will be calculated. An investigator who have had an ultrasound certification
      by Emergency Medicine Association of Turkey for six years will make the measurements. After 1
      week the patient will called up for re-evaluation. Applicants' weights will be measured again
      with the same weighing machine. The differences between initial and after one week weight
      measurement will be accepted as the gold standard method for volume loss. The weight loss of
      the patient, the dehydration findings detected on physical examination and the caval index
      will be compared.

      Data will be collected on predesigned data sheets, by an investigator and subsequently will
      be entered into a spreadsheet (Excel 2007; Microsoft, Redmond, WA). All recorded data will be
      checked by an another investigator to identify possible errors. Results will be submitted at
      least every two months.

      Linear regression will be performed with dehydration as the dependent variable and the caval
      index as the independent variable.
