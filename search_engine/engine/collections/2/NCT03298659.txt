    
      Study design:

      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled, multicentre study.

      Study population:

      The research population will be recruited from the general patient population presenting with
      an acute STEMI. Patients treated with successful primary PCI and one or more additional
      significant coronary lesions in another coronary artery will be enrolled in the study. A
      total of 1,146 consecutive patients will be included.

      Intervention:

      The patients will be randomized 1:1, to (A) an active treatment arm with complete, iFR-guided
      revascularization of every noninfarct coronary lesion >50% and iFR â‰¤0.89; (B) a deferred
      treatment arm, in which patients will undergo an adenosine stress perfusion CMR scan within 6
      weeks after STEMI, with revascularization of the noninfarct coronary lesions with associated
      perfusion defects.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The primary end point consists of a combined outcome, including all-cause death, recurrent MI
      and hospitalization for heart failure at 12 months follow-up.

      Duration:

      Anticipated recruitment is 2 years. Follow-up will be performed at 6 months, 12 months, 3
      years and 5 years.
