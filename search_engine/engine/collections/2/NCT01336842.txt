    
      The purpose of this phase I study of oral panobinostat plus cisplatin and pemetrexed is to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients
      with advanced solid tumors, with an emphasis in non-small cell lung cancer. Another purpose
      of this study is to find out if oral panobinostat in combination with cisplatin and
      pemetrexed can be administered safely without significant increase in toxicity and that the
      combination will increase efficacy compared to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy alone.
