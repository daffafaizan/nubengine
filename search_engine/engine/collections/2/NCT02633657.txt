    
      One-treatment, 1-period study in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) diagnosed with
      moderate-to-severe primary RLS. Patients will check-in at the clinical site in the evening of
      Day -1 or the morning of Day 0, and baseline safety assessments will be performed. On Day 0,
      after the review of these safety assessments and confirmation of eligibility, patients will
      receive a single oral 300 mg dose of HORIZANT with a meal (at approximately 6 AM). Study
      assessments will continue until approximately 14 hours (h) post dose, at which time patients
      will be discharged. Prior to discharge, patients will be advised not to drive a car or
      operate other complex machinery for at least 30 h after dosing; therefore, patients can
      remain at the clinical site overnight or can be escorted home. Patients will return to the
      clinical site for a follow-up visit 7 days (Â± 1 day) post dose.
