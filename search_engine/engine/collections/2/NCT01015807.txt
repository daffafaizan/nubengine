      the women having a cesarean section develop chronic pain (Kehlet et al. 2006). With over 1.3
      million cesarean deliveries per year in the US, this is bound to create a significant health
      problem. One way to address this health burden is to refine techniques that may help control
      the pain women experience after CS and ultimately reduce the potential to develop chronic
      pain.

      The purpose of this randomized, double-blinded study is to evaluate the ability of an
      established anesthetic technique called the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block to reduce
      the amount of hyperalgesia women develop around their incision after CS. Measuring the amount
      of punctuate mechanical hyperalgesia is used as a tool to assess postoperative central
      sensitization (Lavand'homme et al. 2005), which contributes to postoperative acute pain.
      Since postoperative acute pain has been shown to be predictive of developing postoperative
      chronic pain (Eisenach et al. 2008; Yarnitsky et al. 2008), an effective TAP block could help
      diminish the incidence of chronic pain after CS. In addition, blood samples will be collected
      for future genetic analysis and we will test preoperatively for mechanical temporal summation
      (mTS) to evaluate CNS (central nervous system) sensitization and nociceptive system
      hyperexcitability and see if this correlates with the amount of hyperalgesia women develop
      around their incision after surgery.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits of two different solutions injected
      by TAP block technique on postoperative peri-incisional hyperalgesia.
