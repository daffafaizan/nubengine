      Additional visits at least yearly encouraged. During the week we measure such things as
      cholesterol absorption, sterol and bile acid synthesis, mevalonate and mevalonate shunt
      products, isoprenoids, fatty acids, leukotrienes, plasma cholesterol and other sterol levels.
      Also, the effects of altering dietary cholesterol on plasma 24-S OH-cholesterol, a measure of
      brain cholesterol turnover, will be evaluated. Studies of body composition/ metabolism/
      growth, development, behavior, sleep, feeding, hearing and vision will be carried out to
      document the phenotype and determine if dietary intervention may be helpful.

      The objective of the study is to characterize the metabolic and phenotypic consequences of
      MKD and study the effects of altering dietary cholesterol in MKD. We hypothesize that some of
      the phenotypic effects of MKD are due to altered cholesterol metabolism, but that the
      phenotype is predominantly due to derangements in isoprenoid metabolism.
