      human lifespan. Effective vaccines stimulate the cells of the immune system to activate genes
      and associated functions that bring about protective immunity. Knowledge of those genes and
      cellular functions activated by effective vaccination can improve our understanding of how
      the immune system works and define the features necessary for a successful vaccine response.
      This study aims to define cellular functions important for the hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine
      immune response in healthy individuals. The investigators will identify those genes that are
      activated or suppressed in immune cells at various times after each dose of the HBV vaccine.
      The investigators will explore these vaccine-induced "gene signatures" to characterize the
      cellular functions associated with an effective immune response to HBV vaccination. The
      investigators hypothesize that many genes associated with innate and adaptive immune
      functions are important for an effective HBV vaccine response.
