      assessed by absolute changes in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24
      hours and by the improvement of modified Rankin Scale score at discharge or 6-month
      follow-up. The safety of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was assessed by
      the rate of mortality, intracerebral hemorrhage and other common complications. Multivariate
      logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with favorable clinical
      outcome.
