      left lobe of the liver. An effective liver retraction is important for good vision and safety
      during operation. In this study, 120 patients who are over 18 years old with laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy will be included. 4 groups will be formed and each group will be planned
      to include 30 patients. In group 1, a 5 mm incision was made under xiphoid during the
      operation, and Nathanson retractor was placed and liver left lobe retraction would be
      achieved. In the second group, a snake retractor with a 5 mm incision under the xiphoid will
      be used. In the 3rd group, liver retraction will be provided by using a 5 mm trocar from the
      intersection of the right midclavicular line. In the group, liver retraction through a 5 mm
      trocar entrained from the intersection of the right midclavicular line and a 4 cm superior
      umbilicus will be provided with the aid of laparoscopic grasper without any special tools. In
      these patients, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and Bilirubin levels
      will be examined on the postoperative 1st, 2nd and 3rd days and the patients will be examined
      with postoperative first day abdominal abdomen magnetic resonance imaging and the liver
      injury will be evaluated by the radiologist. Patients will not know which liver excision
      method is used during surgery. The radiologist who will perform damage assessment on imaging
      will not know which type of liver dislocation is used. Therefore, the study will be planned
      as double blind. The liver excision method will be applied sequentially. Randomization will
      be done in this way.
