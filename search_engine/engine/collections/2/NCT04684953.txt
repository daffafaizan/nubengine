      choice for treatment of benign thyroid disorders that require surgical excision. The goal of
      post-thyroidectomy management is to reach a "safe physiological status" of thyroid hormonal
      profile. Although exogenous levothyroxine replacement has long been safely used as a
      replacement after total thyroidectomy, it is not considered optimal, as it is bounded by
      patient's compliance with the treatment and follow-up schedule, effect of mal-absorption, and
      the inability to compensate for daily physiological alterations.

      The concept of endocrinal tissue auto-transplantation has been largely investigated in the
      case of parathyroid gland, and to a lesser extent for pancreatic islets. Although both the
      experimental studies of thyroid autotransplantation and the early case reports of lingual
      thyroid autotransplantations have shown encouraging results, a very limited number of
      clinical studies investigated thyroid autotransplantation in adult patients with benign
      thyroid disorders. Moreover, the discrepancy in the patients' characteristics and thyroid
      autotransplantation technique in these studies hinders the standardization of thyroid
      autotransplantation for clinical practice. Hypothetically, thyroid autotransplantation offers
      and attractive alternative for subtotal thyroidectomy, as it enables the preservation of
      native responsive thyroid tissue in an accessible location, and, thus, evades the risk of
      possible regrowth in the neck region. The present preliminary clinical study is conducted to
      investigate the feasibility and outcome of thyroid autotransplantation after total
      thyroidectomy for patients with benign thyroid disorders (other than thyroiditis).
