      including, particulate and block grafting materials, Guided Bone Regeneration with or without
      growth and differentiation factors, ridge splitting, expansion and distraction osteogenesis,
      either alone or in combination. These techniques may be used for horizontal/vertical ridge
      augmentation

      Autograft is considered as the Gold Standard for bone transplantation and various studies
      have shown efficacy for it. It is osteogenic, osteoconductive and osteoinductive. Autografts
      can be derived from extra oral source (iliac crest, ribs) or intraoral source (chin, ramus).
      They can be used in block or particulate form. Corticocancellous block grafts are preferred
      because of enhanced revascularization of the cancellous portion, and mechanical support and
      rigidity of the cortical portion, which ensures optimal ridge augmentation.

      Fouad Khoury presented a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique for atrophic ridges
      and complicated vertical bone defects using mandibular bone block graft "the Gold standard".
      There are several possibilities for augmentation of bone volume depending on situation,
      indication and adequate diagnosis; the treatment options can be extended from minimally
      invasive procedures with locally harvested bone grafts in local anesthesia, to very
      sophisticated grafting techniques for 3D bone reconstruction with extra oral harvested bone
      grafts. Khoury reported that his ascending ramus grafts is almost 5 times more than chin
      grafts
