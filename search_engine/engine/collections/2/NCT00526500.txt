    
      Design: Prospective controlled non-randomized study. Materials and methods: 45 patients with
      severe brain injury and 15 healthy volunteers will be included in this study.

      The study design is illustrated below:

        1. Baseline measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERP)

        2. Gait training in the tilt table with integrated stepping system(20 min).

        3. Control measurement of EEG and ERP Effect parameters: se outcome measures. Statistical
           evaluation: All collected data will be tested with reference to normal distribution. If
           the data is not distributed normally, then we will use either a logarithmic
           transformation before we use parametric statistics, or we will use non-parametric
           statistics for further calculations.

      Further analysis of the data will be done with the help of variance analysis with an
      inter-individually factor as a group (patients vs control persons) and intra-individually
      factors as: 1) experimental condition (before vs after training), 2) topographic distribution
      (anterior vs central vs posterior).

      Significance level is set to 0.05 for all effect parameters.
