438. lag period characterizing the entry of transforming deoxyribonucleic acidinto bacillus subtilisthe kinetics of appearance of transformantsas a function of time of exposure todna has been studied.  a short lag periodof approximately 1 min at 37 c is evi-dent when the transformation is terminatedwith deoxyribonuclease.  the length ofthis lag is independent of the genetic traittransferred.  moreover, the lag is unaf-fected by transforming dna concentration,by the presence of homologous unmarkeddna, and by shearing and cross-linking ofthe transforming dna.  the lag showsa strong inverse temperature dependence.the energy of activation is 13.9 kcal.the lag is abolished when the transformationis terminated by washing instead ofby addition of deoxyribonuclease.  these resultsare taken to indicate an immediateadsorption of dna to cells, followed by adeoxyribonuclease-sensitive period of1 min, during which time the genetic traitis entering the cell.  these results makefeasible an investigation of the configurationassumed by the dna molecule duringentry into the cell.
