      maximum voluntary contraction (MVCF) force between proximal (Hamstrings) and distal group
      (Calf) of muscles.

      DESIGN: Two-group pretest-posttest experimental design. METHODS: Each subject visited the
      Rehabilitation center on three days: On day-I for static stretching for 2 minutes (SS2),
      day-II for 4 minutes (SS4), and day-III for 8 minutes (SS8). Isometric Maximum Voluntary
      Contraction Force (MVCF) measurement was done prior (Pre), 0-min, 10-min, and 20-min
      post-intervention (i.e. stretching). Each visit was separated by a gap of at least 3-4 days.
      On each visit, each subject underwent (a). Pre-intervention evaluation, (b). Intervention,
      (c). Post-intervention evaluation. Subjects performed stretching exercises under the
      supervision of expert Physical Therapist. The outcome assessor who was kept blind to study
      protocol did all measurements.
