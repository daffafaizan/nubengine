    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of a combination of FOLFIRI
      chemotherapy, and intravenous yttrium-90 (90Y) M5A anti-CEA antibody.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To study the progression free survival and response rate of this
      combined treatment in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.II. To evaluate the
      biodistribution, clearance and metabolism of 90Y and 111In (indium-111) M5A administered
      intravenously.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody
      M5A. Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over
      2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      once every 2 weeks. Patients also receive yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A
      IV over 25 minutes once in weeks 3 and 9. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
