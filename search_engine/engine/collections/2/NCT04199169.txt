    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, phase 1 trial in healthy male and
      non-pregnant female adults 18 through 49 years of age designed to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity of three ascending doses of HeV-sG-V. Different dosing regimens and number of
      doses will also be explored.

      The study plans to accrue eligible subjects into three successive dosage escalation cohorts
      consisting of 12, 72, and 108 subjects, respectively (total of 192 subjects). The three
      HeV-sG-V dosages will be 10 mcg, 30 mcg, and 100 mcg.

      In the first cohort, subjects will receive two doses of the investigational product (IP) at
      28-day intervals. Subjects will be randomized in a 5:1 ratio, with 10 receiving two doses of
      HeV-sG-V (10 mcg dosage) and two subjects will receive placebo.

      In the second cohort, subjects will be randomized in a 5:5:2 ratio with 30 receiving a 30 mcg
      dosage of HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 2 (Days 1 and 8) with placebo on Visit 3 (Day 29), 30
      receiving a 30 mcg dosage of HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 3 (Days 1 and 29) with placebo on Visit
      2 (Day 8), while 12 subjects will receive placebo at each of the same visits.

      The third cohort will be randomized in a 5:5:5:3 ratio so that 30 subjects are assigned to
      each of three different regimens consisting of a 100 mcg dosage of HeV-sG-V and placebo
      administered as three doses, HeV-sG-V on Visit 1 (Day 1) with placebo on Visits 2 and 3 (Days
      8 and 29), or HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 2 (Days 1 and 8) with placebo on Visit 3 (Day 29), or
      HeV-sG-V on Visits 1 and 3 (Days 1 and 29) with placebo on Visit 2 (Day 8), while the
      remaining 18 will receive a dose of placebo at each of the same visits.
