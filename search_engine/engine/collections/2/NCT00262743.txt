      Phase I

        -  Determine the maximally tolerated dose of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) in patients
           with previously untreated stage 0-II chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Describe the dose-limiting toxicity of green tea extract (Polyphenon E).

      Phase II

        -  Evaluate the response rate and response duration of patients with previously untreated,
           asymptomatic Rai stage 0-II chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with green tea extract
           (Polyphenon E) for 6 months at the MTD.

        -  Further characterize toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of green tea extract (Polyphenon E)
      followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral green tea extract (Polyphenon E) once or twice daily for
           4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive green tea extract (Polyphenon E) as in the phase I portion of
           the study at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 73 patients will be accrued for this study.
