    
      IBD patients attending the Stanford Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) clinic and age-matched
      healthy controls are screened for eligibility. Informed consent is obtained for eligible
      subjects. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire is administered to assess risk factors
      for HPV. For IBD patients, information regarding IBD diagnosis and treatment is obtained.

      An anal pap smear is performed at the time of a clinic visit or at the time of an already
      scheduled colonoscopy. Samples are collected and processed at Stanford pathology where a
      blinded pathologist reads all specimens. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is performed
      on all specimens. All patients with anal squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASIL) are referred
      to a colorectal surgeon for further recommendations or treatment, which includes a
      high-resolution anoscopy.
