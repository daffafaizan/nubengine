    
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center intervention study. 400 maintenance
      hemodialysis patients with twice dialysis sessions per week will be enrolled into the study.
      All the patients have their baseline Kt/V between 1.2 and 1.7 (1.2 ≤ Kt/V < 1.7). After
      treatment intervention, the patients will be randomized to two groups according to their
      different Kt/V (1.2 ≤ Kt/V < 1.7 vs. Kt/V ≥ 1.7), then the patients will be regularly
      followed up at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 48 weeks, 72 weeks and 96 weeks. Clinical
      outcomes such as mortality, complications and life quality between the two groups will be
      investigated.
