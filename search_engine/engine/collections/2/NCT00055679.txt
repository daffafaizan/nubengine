        -  Compare the efficacy of 4 vs 6 courses of adjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin, and
           cyclophosphamide, in terms of 5-year survival, in women with stage I breast cancer.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the correlation of length of survival with biological factors in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine biological factors significant for prognosis and prediction of survival of
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV, epirubicin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day
           1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive the same regimen as in arm I for up to 4 courses. After
           completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
           Patients who are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive also receive oral tamoxifen
           daily for 5 years, beginning after completion of chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,512 patients (756 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
