      ProTECT III study just prior to the initiation of the study drug infusion and 24 and 48 hours
      from the time they are enrolled in the study to test for biomarkers that may help predict how
      severe the injury is and how well they improve. The investigators will also test to see if
      the study medication is being absorbed and is staying at a consistent level in the blood
      stream.
