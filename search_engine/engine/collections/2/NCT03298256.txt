      The efficacy of bracing in correcting the frontal deformity is now well-accepted after the
      Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial (BRAIST). Restoration of the sagittal
      alignment is one of the fundamental goals in scoliosis treatment. The investigators have
      previously demonstrated on fulcrum bending radiographs that there is coupling between the
      frontal deformity, thoracic kyphosis and apical vertebral derotation. The investigators'
      findings suggest that there may be natural coupling of the frontal and sagittal deformities
      towards "self-normalisation" during correction of the curves. The effect of bracing on the
      sagittal alignment and 3D deformity in scoliosis is currently not well-understood. If there
      is a tendency for the natural curve behaviour to return towards a more normal sagittal
      alignment, then bracing may exert a similar effect on the 3D profile. Understanding how the
      3D deformity is affected by bracing allows further insight into curve progression and brace
      effectiveness.

      Few studies in the literature have addressed the sagittal profile and 3D correction by
      bracing. Of those, the findings were based on vertebral reconstructions obtained from
      CT-scan, finite element analysis modelling, or studying the changes in the rib cage rotation.
      However, the investigators propose to measure the 3D profile using the modern EOS Â® system,
      which allows biplanar radiography and 3D calculations and a more accurate measurement of
      vertebral wedging.
