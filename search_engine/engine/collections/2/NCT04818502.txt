    
      The Tendyne RESOLVE-MR study (Real World Study of the Tendyneâ„¢ Mitral Valve System to Treat
      Mitral Regurgitation) is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, PMCF study, which will be
      used to support the CE Mark requirement of monitoring safety and performance for any
      complications or issues arising in a post-market setting.

      The objective of the Tendyne RESOLVE-MR study is to confirm the safety and performance of the
      Tendyne Mitral Valve System in patients with symptomatic, moderate-to-severe or severe mitral
      regurgitation (MR) who are considered by the local heart team as eligible for a transapical
      transcatheter mitral valve implantation in a real-world setting. This clinical study is
      intended to satisfy post-market clinical follow-up requirements of CE Mark.
