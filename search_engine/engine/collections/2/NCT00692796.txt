      patients with IPF. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will complete a battery of
      questionnaires and tests that assess symptoms, quality of life, cognition, and mental health,
      and then subjects will complete a six week outpatient PR program (at National Jewish Medical
      and Research Center or other PR programs). Subjects will complete the same battery of
      questionnaires and tests immediately after completion of the PR program and again six months
      later.
