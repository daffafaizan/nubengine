      the NK cells in vivo, the investigators performed a lead in cohort with ALT-803 replacing
      IL-2 at a dose of 10 mcg/kg SQ administered q5 days starting on the date of NK cell infusion.
      The first two patients treated in the ALT-803 lead in cohort experienced a set of symptoms
      consistent with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) including fevers, elevated markers of
      inflammation between days 10-14 after ML NK cell infusion.

      Based on the evidence of increased CD8 T cell activation, the in vitro data indicating that
      ALT-803 promoted recipient CD8 T cell expansion and killing of donor ML NK cells, and the
      lack of clinical responses using ALT-803, the lead in cohort was closed, and a decision was
      made to return to rhIL-2 support, mimicking the cytokine support utilized in the phase 2
      portion of the trial.

      PLEASE NOTE: THE PEDIATRIC PORTION OF THE STUDY IS CLOSED TO FURTHER ENROLLMENT.
