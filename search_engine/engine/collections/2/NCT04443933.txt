      Elderly patients often have more cardiovascular disease and brain vulnerability and tend to
      experience more perioperative complications. Perioperative covert stroke is one of those that
      can been neglected for a long time and is associated with long-term cognitive impairment.
      While CSVD is an insidious disease mainly affecting small blood vessels in the brain with
      variable symptoms including dementia, cognitive decline, gait impairment, mood disturbance
      and stroke. According to the etiopathology of CSVD, there's a possibility that CSVD is a
      potential risk factor for covert stroke and it may serve as a predictive marker for cognitive
      decline after surgery.

      In this multicenter prospective clinical cohort study, the investigators aim to investigate
      the correlation between the MRI manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease and
      perioperative covert stroke.

      Patients aged between 65 to 85 who are scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgeries will be
      enrolled.The primary outcome is the incidence of perioperative covert stroke diagnosed by
      MRI. Secondary outcomes include incidence of delirium (using ICU-CAM) within 3 days after
      surgery and cognitive function tests (using Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment), physical function test (using ADL, Activities of Daily Living) and
      dependence test (using modified Rankin Scale) at 3 months, 6 months and 12months after
      surgery.
