      estradiol (E2) therapy for Postpartum Major Depression (PPMD), which has received minimal
      research attention in America. The design of the proposed study is an 8 week randomized
      double-blind clinical trial of SERT vs. E2 vs. Placebo. Responders enter a continuation phase
      with the blind intact through 6.5 months postpartum. The primary aims of this investigation
      are to: 1) Test the efficacy of E2 compared to placebo for the treatment of PPMD. Sertraline
      will be included as an active comparator. We have powered the study to test for differences
      among the three groups and also test for differences between the E2 and placebo group. We
      will test the hypothesis that E2 will be significantly more effective than placebo and that
      SERT will be significantly more effective than placebo. 2) Evaluate developmental outcomes in
      infants exposed to the disorder, PPMD, and the medications (SERT, exogenous E2 or Placebo)
      which may be transmitted to the infants through breastfeeding. All infants in this study will
      have exposure to mothers with depression. We will assess maternal depression, mother-infant
      serum SERT and E2 levels and relate them to mother-infant interactional quality and infant
      developmental outcomes on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. These data will enhance
      the sophistication of risk-benefit analyses for pharmacotherapy during lactation.
