        -  Determine the frequency of hematologic response in patients with intermediate-2 or
           high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated with arsenic trioxide and etanercept.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients with intermediate-1 or low-risk MDS
           that was refractory to anti-thymocyte globulin and etanercept on protocol FHCRC-1872.

        -  Correlate results of ex vivo and in vitro studies of phenotypic, cytogenetic, and
           functional disease characteristics with in vivo treatment response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine parameters that are associated with a high probability of disease response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5 of week 1 and then twice
      weekly on weeks 2-12 during course 1 (twice weekly on weeks 1-12 during course 2). Patients
      also receive etanercept subcutaneously twice weekly during weeks 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10.
      Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-18
      months.
