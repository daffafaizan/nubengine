      consequence, difficulties for establishing an adequate parental-infant bonding arise causing
      a substantial parental stress manifested as anxiety and depression, and increasing the risk
      of short and longterm consequences (neglect, abuse, maltreatment, abandonment). In addition,
      prolonged hospital stay will increase the probability of having medical complications
      (infections, excessive blood tests or image studies) and the cost of staying. Once the baby
      has improved sufficiently early discharge may be given independently of the baby's weight. In
      order to be successful, caregivers, psychologist and parents have to put forward an
      established protocol to be able to face satisfactorily this situation. We hypothesize that,
      with an adequate Early Discharge Program, we could substantially reduce length of
      hospitalization, cost, and reduce parental stress.
