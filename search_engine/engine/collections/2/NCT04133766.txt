      facilities eligible to implement the CBNP in their catchment areas will serve as the unit of
      implementation and be randomly allocated to treatment or control groups. For each health
      facility, up to four health posts, among the 6-10 health posts typically attached to a health
      facility, will be randomly selected. Households in communities served by selected health
      posts will be mapped and a list of households with eligible participants will generated from
      which a random sample will be selected. Structured questionnaires will be administered to
      separate samples of women with children 6-23 months of age at baseline then approximately 18
      months later. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews will also be conducted with a sub-set of
      selected women and samples of their husbands and mothers-in-law at baseline and endline.
