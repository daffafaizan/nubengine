    
      This is a randomized study which will compare three femoral nerve catheter insertion
      techniques. Subjects will be randomized into one of thee groups, Group 1: ultrasound guided
      femoral nerve catheter using a stimulation needle and stimulating catheter, .Group 2:
      ultrasound guided femoral nerve catheter using a stimulation needle, but non-stimulating
      catheter, or Group 3: ultrasound guided femoral nerve block without stimulation.

        -  Pain Scores after surgery with be measured using the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale).
           Subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a scale of 1-10.

        -  Block Performance time is the time from starting the block (after prepping and draping)
           until catheter is placed.

        -  Opioid requirements will be measured as the total amount of opioids (converted to
           morphine sulfate equivalents) used both during surgery, and during the first 48 hours
           after surgery.

        -  Block failure rate will be calculated as the rate of cases that requires repeating the
           block after surgery.
