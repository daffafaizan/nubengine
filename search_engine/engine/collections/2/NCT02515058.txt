      cancellous bone allograft that has been prepared either by freeze-drying (FDBA) or by a
      solvent-based processing method (PUROS). This entire protocol involves procedures that are
      standard care. All materials are FDA-approved materials being used in an FDA-approved manner.
      The test group subjects will have extraction sockets grafted with a cancellous
      non-freeze-dried bone allograft (called PUROS graft). This test group will be compared to an
      active control group using cancellous freeze-dried bone allograft (called FDBA). The null
      hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference in formation of new vital bone
      between treatment groups (primary outcome).

      Each subject will provide a single non-molar tooth site for study treatment. After tooth
      extraction, the graft material will be placed and covered by a resorbable collagen membrane.
      Following 3 months of healing, the dental implant will be place, at which time a core of bone
      will be removed from the site as part of the preparation for the implant. The core biopsy
      will then be evaluated for the primary histologic outcome of % vital bone formation and
      secondary histologic outcome of % residual graft material.
