      in organ transplantation. They are at the origin of a brutal CD4 lymphocyte depletion
      followed by a gradual recovery of the lymphocyte pool. Nevertheless, CD4 lymphopenia can
      persist in some patients.

      SIGAL study aims to characterize the immune responses of lymphopenic patients (after
      administration of ATG) in order to identify possible similarities with immunosenescence.The
      immunosenescence is a complex and profound remodeling of the immune system during life. It is
      mainly due to thymic involution and repeated antigenic stimulation.
