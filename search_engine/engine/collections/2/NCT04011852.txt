      criteria for suggesting it are often subjective and poorly defined. Electrical impedance
      tomography (EIT) has been developed and used clinically for more than 30 years. Interest in
      this technology arose from the need to monitor ventilation and pulmonary perfusion at the
      bedside. Because it is a non-invasive and non-radiation technology, EIT is very promising in
      the pediatric population. Objectives: To correlate the data obtained by the EIT during the
      spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) on a T-piece with failure in the trial and Extubation
      failure and to observe if the EIT is able to detect the children that will fail earlier than
      the SBT performed alone. Method: A cross-sectional, prospective study to explore the
      potential benefits of monitoring with EIT during weaning. Qualitative characteristics will be
      described using absolute and relative frequencies and the quantitative characteristics will
      be described using summary measures (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum).
      Bivariate and later multiple logistic regression analyzes will be performed to evaluate the
      influence of characteristics assessed on weaning failure, mainly the reduction in functional
      residual capacity during and after the weaning trial. For the analysis will be used the
      software IBM-SPSS for Windows version 20.0 and tabulation of the data will be used Microsoft
      Excel 2010 software. The tests will be performed with significance level of 5%.
