      remain suboptimal. Accurate diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes, bone invasion, or
      tumour relapse in a previously irradiated or operated field remains challenging.
      Technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable to quantify diffusion and
      perfusion of the tumour and its surrounding tissues, which could improve diagnostic
      performance. Moreover, they could provide additional information about radiation and/or
      chemotherapeutic efficiency in an individual patient.

      Objectives: The investigators aim to validate specific MRI parameters that could improve
      diagnostic accuracy of metastatic cervical lymph nodes in patients with a squamous cell
      carcinoma in the head and neck region. Moreover, we aim to explore specific MRI parameters
      that could improve diagnostic accuracy of bone invasion and tumour relapse, as well as
      predict treatment response and survival in this target population.

      Methods: In this trial, a validation cohort will be recruited in a prospective manner, to
      validate the MRI parameters that showed clinically acceptable discriminant value based on the
      retrospective study. The values of the selected MRI parameters will be calculated in
      metastatic lymph nodes of the affected group, for comparison with their values measured in
      the lymph nodes of a prospectively recruited control group, comprising patients who require
      the same standardized MRI protocol for evaluation of a Whartin tumour or pleomorphic adenoma
      of the parotid gland without malignant transformation, and in whom both the parotid gland
      lesion and the cervical lymph node are surgically removed for histological confirmation. All
      included patients of the 'affected group' will also undergo a preoperative positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), according to international guidelines, and will
      preferably receive a multiparametric MRI at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post treatment
      as part of routine follow-up.
