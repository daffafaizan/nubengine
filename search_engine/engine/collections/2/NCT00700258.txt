      within a very short period of time. In the past few years, introduction of various new
      substances for the treatment of mRCC has therefore resulted in new scientific research
      questions. Temsirolimus and sunitinib are current standard therapies in the first-line
      treatment of mRCC. Inlyta® is a new substance that was developed for the treatment of mRCC
      after failure of sunitinib or cytokines.

      Since August 2009, Torisel® is available as another treatment option for patients with mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL). In addition, Sutent® is used for patients with non-resectable /
      metastatic gastro-intestinal stroma tumors (GIST) after failure or intolerability of
      imatinib.

      The routine use of drugs in the usual clinical setting faces additional challenges that
      generally cannot be completely reflected by clinical trials. Therefore, the purpose of this
      registry is to obtain a general view as regards efficacy, tolerability and safety issues of
      the Torisel®, Sutent®, and/or Inlyta® therapies in patients with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma, recurrent / refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and gastro-intestinal stroma
      tumors (GIST) under the conditions of routine use.

      Therefore, the following information is of particular interest in the course of the
      investigation:

        -  Efficacy (best response, overall survival, progression-free survival)

        -  Tolerability of the therapy (assessed by the physician)

        -  Safety profile (overall incidence of adverse events as well as side-effect rate) of
           subjects with mRCC, rMCL, and GIST under treatment with Torisel®, Sutent®, and/or
           Inlyta®

        -  Profile, comorbidities, and characteristics of subjects treated with Torisel® Sutent®,
           and/or Inlyta®

        -  The sequence of using the systemic therapies for RCC, MCL, and GIST

        -  Patient survey on the quality of life of mRCC patients
