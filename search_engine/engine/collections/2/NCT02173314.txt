      evaluate an intervention known as SAFE-FC. The intervention aims to prevent long term foster
      care by providing tailored services and intensive engagement with all new families with
      children identified as unsafe (Population 1) and for cases that are currently in care and at
      risk of LTFC where reunification is the case goal (Population 2). Family Search and
      Engagement (FSE) is the intervention for Population 3; it involves intense search practices
      to identify possible permanency resources. For Populations 1 and 2 the study is a randomized,
      intent-to-treat design to measure safety and permanency outcomes. For Population 3 the
      evaluation will be a descriptive study to analyze relationships between the intervention
      approach and outcomes. Both studies aim to examine how the interventions (SAFE- FC and FSE)
      impact or relate to permanency outcomes for children most at risk for long term foster care.
