      health treatment and are often un- or undertreated, as the demand for mental health services
      is greater than the supply of trained providers. Technology is one method to improve access
      to care by making evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) readily accessible. A
      second method comes from global mental health research, demonstrating that task-sharing can
      equip non-specialists to provide effective mental health care. This study combines these two
      approaches, exploring how technology-enhanced EBPI could be used by frontline primary care
      staff (e.g., nurses, medical assistants) to expand workforce capacity to deliver acceptable,
      sustainable, and effective treatment for depression. Specifically, we will use task-sharing
      to deliver a mobile Motivational Physical Activity Targeted Intervention (MPATI), which is
      based on behavioral activation for depression and uses wearable accelerometer technology to
      trigger personalized activity goal monitoring. This proposal uses the Discover, Design/Build,
      Test (DDBT) framework, which leverages user-centered design and implementation science to
      discover implementation barriers to using task-sharing to deliver MPATI in primary care, to
      design an implementation strategy to support MPATI delivery, and to conduct a pilot usability
      trial to test the implementation strategy with the most suitable frontline staff.
