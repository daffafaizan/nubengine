      after concussion. This research is being done because, currently, there is no effective
      treatment for concussion. Physical activity (for example; running, playing sports) and brain
      activity (for example; homework and tests) may make concussion symptoms worse. We are
      studying whether strict rest after concussion may help improve symptoms. About 110 children,
      ages 11-22 years old will take part in this study at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.
      This study is being funded by the Injury Research Center. The research grant pays for study
      procedures, follow-up testing, and patient reimbursement. Research staff is not being
      provided incentives to enroll subjects.
