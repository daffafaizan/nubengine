      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults and adolescents with
      severe, uncontrolled asthma on medium to high-dose ICS and at least one additional asthma
      controller medication with or without OCS. Approximately 1060 subjects will be randomized
      globally. Subjects will receive tezepelumab, or placebo, administered via subcutaneous
      injection at the study site, over a 52-week treatment period. The study also includes a
      post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks.
