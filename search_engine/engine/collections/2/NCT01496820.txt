    
      In the detailed description we believe that it will be wise to discuss about the long-term
      study of the effect of GO2KA1(Chitosan oligosaccharide: oligosaccharides derived from
      chitosan) on pre-diabetic individuals (in addition to the postprandial blood glucose levels).
      In the present study, we will investigate the effects of GO2KA1 on the level of postprandial
      blood glucose in adult Koreans with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.
      Postprandial blood glucose levels will be tested for 2 hours at every 30 min interval after
      75g-OGTT and the experimental group will be pre-fed with 500 mg of GO2KA1. Primary outcomes
      will be included change in HbA1c, insulin, glycemic AUC, and lipids(total cholesterol,
      triglyceride, and HDL).

      This clinical study will be conducted with 60 subjects after explanation and accommodation
      about experimental protocols and model. To test under same condition, smoking and drinking
      water will be completely prohibit from 1 hour before and during the experiment. At first day,
      control experiment will be conducted without oral take of GO2KA1 or placebo.
