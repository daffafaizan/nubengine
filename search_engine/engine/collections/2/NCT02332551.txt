      patients are unsuitable for tumor resection because of factors such as poor hepatic
      reserve(cirrhosis), multicentric tumors or near vital structures such as vessels,
      diaphragmatic dome and gallbladder. Direct ablative treatments include radiofrequency
      ablation, microwave (MW) ablation and cryotherapy and irreversible electroporation had been
      used successful as a therapeutic choice for unresectable patients. At the same
      time，Irreversible electroporation(IRE)，which was applied with a novel ablation technology,
      can induce tissue necrosis by utilizing short pulses of high-voltage electrical energy. The
      technique also had many advantages, including Short ablation time, preservation of vital
      structures within IRE-ablated zone, avoidance of heat/cold-sink effect, complete ablation
      with well-demarcated margin and real-time monitoring of IRE ablation.
