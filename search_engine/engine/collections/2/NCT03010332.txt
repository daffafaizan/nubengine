    
      ATA230 (third-party donor-derived CMV-CTLs) are cytotoxic T lymphocytes that specifically
      kill cells presenting CMV protein antigens.

      This is an expanded access protocol designed to provide access of ATA230 to subjects with CMV
      viremia or disease, who are intolerant to, or failed, standard antiviral therapy and have no
      comparable treatment options. This study will enroll subjects regardless of the underlying
      susceptibility to CMV, including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT), solid
      organ transplant (SOT), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), other immunocompromised states,
      and immune competent subjects who require therapy. Subjects must have active CMV viremia or
      disease for ≥ 2 weeks despite treatment with antiviral therapy or must be intolerant to
      antiviral therapy due to treatment-related toxicity or comorbidities such as renal
      insufficiency or myelosuppression.

      ATA230 will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle, subjects
      will receive intravenous (IV) ATA230 at a dose of 1×10^6 cells/kg (with an acceptable range
      of 0.8-1.0×10^6 cells/kg) on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.
