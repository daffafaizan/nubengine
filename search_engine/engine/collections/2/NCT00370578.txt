    
      ADMIT-Randomized Single Center Study with two arms:

      Standard PCI versus Primary PCI, using thrombus aspiration device after ever step of the
      procedure.

      Issues to be examined are:

        1. Immediate angiographic differences between the study arms. By evaluation of: TIMI FLOW
           GRADE,TIMI FRAME COUNT,MYOCARDIAL BLUSH GRADE. No reflow phenomenae,

        2. Infarc size evaluated by serum markers and non invasive parameters

        3. In hospital major adverse cardiac events

        4. Major adverse cardiac events during 30& 180 days of follow up
