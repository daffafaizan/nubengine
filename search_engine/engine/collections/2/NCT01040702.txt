      computerized tasks assessing sustained attention,working-memory,non-verbal IQ,and
      decision-making ability. In each group,half of the participants will perform the tasks after
      receiving a capsule containing methylphenidate (MPH), and the other half will perform the
      tasks after receiving placebo. Task performance measures will then be compared in order to
      assess the effect of MPH on these domains.
