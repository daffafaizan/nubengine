      various conditions in the GI tract, including Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility and performance of cryoablation
      system (the C2 Focal Cryoablation Device in patients with BE and esophageal squamous
      dysplasia who need ablation therapy for clinical standard care. The new cryoablation
      treatment will be offered as an alternative to standard ablation therapies already in place
      (radiofrequency ablation, carbon dioxide cryotherapy).
