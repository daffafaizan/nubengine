      VR Mind. The software utilizes the concept of virtual reality exposure therapy to treat
      social anxiety disorder. The pilot investigators will be tested for the feasibility,
      usability and safety of the system in order to obtain information useful in further designs
      for the clinical trial. The research consists of four laboratory sessions. The first and the
      last session will be dedicated to participant assessment. During the second and third session
      the virtual reality scenarios (2 x 10 minutes for each session) will be presented to
      participants. The participants will be playing a role of someone who is giving a speech
      (Public speaking scenario) and someone who is speaking on a phone in public (Telephoning in
      public scenario).
