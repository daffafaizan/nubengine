        -  Provide antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 as treatment for patients with incurable
           adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

        -  Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 by
      intravenous injection 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment
      continues for at least 2 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) continue treatment for at least 8
      months beyond CR. Patients achieving a partial response or stable disease continue treatment
      until disease progression.

      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the second year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
