      local anesthetic administered is lower than that of epidural anesthesia, resulting in less
      systemic toxicity and superior block effect.

      However, there are disadvantage that it is difficult to control the block height and the
      incidence of hypotension is high.

      On the other hand, epidural anesthesia has the advantages of less sudden hypotension due to
      slow autonomic blockade, but it has a disadvantage that sensory nerve and motor nerve block
      time is delayed compared to spinal anesthesia.

      The degree of nerve block for cesarean section surgery requires a high level of anesthesia
      above the T6 level, so the frequency of hypotension is high due to rapid sympathetic block
      after spinal anesthesia.

      In this respect, hemodynamically stable epidural anesthesia is preferred when performing
      anesthesia for cesarean section.

      The investigators are going to compare the onset and duration of nerve blockage with the use
      of pre-warmed (38°C) and room temperature (20°C) local anesthetic solutions (ropivacaine and
      fentanyl) on epidural anesthesia for cesarean section, and compare the incidence of
      complications such as hypotension, nausea and vomiting.
