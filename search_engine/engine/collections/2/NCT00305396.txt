      and reduce long-term kidney graft survival. Complete avoidance of calcineurin inhibitors may
      improve graft function as measured by serum creatinine and calculated GFR and improve
      long-term outcomes following kidney transplantation. We conducted a prospective, randomized,
      single-center study comparing sirolimus versus tacrolimus in kidney transplantation. Primary
      cadaver of non-HLA identical living donor recipients are randomized to received either
      sirolimus 5 mg QD (target level 8-12 ng/ml) or tacrolimus 0.075 mg/kg BID (target level 8-12
      ng/ml). All patients also received Thymoglobulin 1.5 mg/kg x 4 doses, mycophenolate 1 gm BID,
      and prednisone. Main outcome measures are patient and graft survival, biopsy-proven acute
      rejection, serum creatinine, hyperlipidemia, post-transplant diabetes, and surgical and wound
      complications.
