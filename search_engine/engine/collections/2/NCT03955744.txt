    
      Patients who are currently using a pessary for management of pelvic organ prolapse and who
      are able to remove/replace the pessary themselves will be approached for recruitment. The
      pessary will be removed two days prior to 3D translabial ultrasound. The vagina will be
      distended with a pressurized compliant bag with concurrent pressure and volume measurements.
      Translabial ultrasound will be used to measure structural parameters within the vagina at
      varying pressures/volumes. The volume, pressure and structural parameters measured will be
      compared to dimensions of the patient's own pessary to develop mathematical models to predict
      the best available pessary choice for the patient.
