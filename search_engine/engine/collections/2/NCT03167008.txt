      indicates that the men have an unexplained reduction of semen quality.

      In contrast, unexplained male infertility is defined as infertility of unknown origin with
      normal sperm parameters.

      Furthermore, optimal strategies for treating idiopathic male infertility have also remained
      unclear.

        -  Data from studies in humans suggest that vitamin D receptors are present in testis,
           epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicles. The level of expression varies, being higher
           in epididymis and seminal vesicles.

        -  Vitamin D receptors expression was also evident in Leydig cells, as well as in normal
           and abnormal sperm, with the acrosomal region and the neck being the sites with the most
           abundant messenger ribonucleic acid expression.

        -  The 1,25(OH)2 D3 molecule increases intracellular calcium concentrations, sperm motility
           and acrosin activity, and reduces triglyceride content in sperm, actions that
           significantly contribute to fertilising capacity within the female reproductive tract.
