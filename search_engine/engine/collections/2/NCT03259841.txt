      fluid using Perlas grade by ultrasound in the supine and right lateral position of fasted
      patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Full stomach is regarded if solid gastric contents are
      detected or clear fluid is more than 1.5 ml/kg. The frequency of full stomach will be
      analyzed.
