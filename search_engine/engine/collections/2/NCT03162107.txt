      living with HIV. Globally, incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and
      extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the most drug-resistant forms of TB, has
      approximately doubled over the past fifteen years. Nowhere has this increased incidence
      generated more concern than in South Africa where interactions between TB and generalized HIV
      epidemics are causing 'explosive' TB incidence and case-fatality threatening to undermine the
      progress reached with antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      Medication adherence, a key predictor of outcomes in multi-and extensively drug-resistant
      tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) and HIV treatment, is understudied in high burden TB/HIV settings.
      Patient losses during transitions in the care continuum are frequent, increase mortality and
      limit control of the linked epidemics. Demands of M/XDR-TB HIV treatment are severe including
      extraordinary pill burden, severe adverse effects, lengthy treatment, isolation and stigma
      with few parallels in modern medicine.

      This is a prospective observational cohort study for patients newly diagnosed with M/XDR-TB
      initiating treatment. A mixed method approach will be employed to address the complex
      research questions of distilling determinants of barriers and facilitators to both TB
      medications and ART; this study will employ complementary qualitative and quantitative
      methodologies for assessing differential adherence to TB medications and ART.

      A sub-set of patients and health care workers will be approached for participation in focus
      group discussions.
