    
      This is a cross-over intervention assessing the effect of PEP on IC and dyspnea in patients
      with COPD performing an interval training (IT) session.

      IC will be measured before, during and immediately after the IT session. Each participant
      will receive perform IT sessions including either the use of a PEP of 10 cmH2O or a PEP of 1
      cmH2O. The effects on IC and dyspnea on both PEP levels will be assessed.
