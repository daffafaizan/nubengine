    
      This study is a first-in-human study of TRK-950 in patients with advanced solid tumors and is
      primarily designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of TRK-950 administered via intravenous (IV) infusion once weekly for 3 weeks every 28
      days in Arm 1.

      Once enrollment in Arm 1 was completed, two dose schedules will be evaluated in Arm 2 to
      determine the dosing schedule. Up to six (6) patients will be enrolled respectively.

      In parallel, to determine anti-tumor activity up to twelve (12) patients will be enrolled in
      Arm 3.
