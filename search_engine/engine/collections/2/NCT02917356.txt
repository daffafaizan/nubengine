      the main cause of pain and disability in older persons worldwide. The limited results of the
      medical and physical therapy approach in the OA treatment make patients with such disorder
      into possible candidates for complementary and alternative therapies (CAT) aiming to obtain a
      relieve in their symptoms. Given the importance of providing alternative scientific
      evidence-based, painless and low cost treatments, it is necessary to carry out studies in
      order to investigate the impact of CAT in culturally accepted contexts, such as laying on of
      hands with spiritual or non-spiritual contexts. The present study aims to investigate the
      effect of Laying on of Hands on the Pain, Joint Stiffness and Functional Capacity of Elderly
      Women With Knee Osteoarthritis. This is a randomized controlled trial with three allocation
      groups: spiritual laying on of hands ("passe espir√≠ta" - Spiritist passe/spiritual healing)
      (SP), non-spiritual laying on of hands (LH) and Control Group without laying on of hands
      (CG). All subjects will participate in a 45-minute kinesiotherapy program. After that, groups
      will be directed to the 5-minute session of laying on of hands according to their groups.
      During the application of SP, LH and CG, the subjects will remain in a sitting position,
      blindfolded with dark goggles, and receive the following verbal command: "Relax and calm your
      mind." The intervention will happen twice a week for eight weeks and a blinded physical
      therapist will assess the pre and post scores of pain, functionality, joint stiffness
      (through WOMAC and visual analogic scale), anxiety and depression (HADS), religiosity (DUREL)
      and spirituality (FACIT Sp12) and quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), among other secondary
      outcomes.
