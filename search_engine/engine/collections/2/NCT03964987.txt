      Sáenz" Maternal-Perinatal Hospital, were invited to participate. Those with autoimmune
      diseases, heart disease, nephropathy, liver disease or any other chronic condition were
      excluded and those with incomplete clinical files were discarded from the final analysis. Two
      groups were integrated: a) patients with a healthy gestation and b) patients with GDM.

      Mass Index, blood pressure, albumin, creatinine, electrolytes, glucose, total cholesterol,
      triglycerides, transaminases and relative expression of PDX-1 and NGN-3.
