      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when
           given in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide on days 1-14 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
