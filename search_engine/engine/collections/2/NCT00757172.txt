    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the pathologic complete response rate in patients with newly diagnosed,
           locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junction
           treated with neoadjuvant panitumumab and combination chemoradiotherapy followed by
           surgery.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the near-complete pathologic response rate in the primary tumor (â‰¤ 10%
           residual viable cancer).

        -  To determine the overall survival and disease-free survival rates of these patients.

        -  To determine the safety profile of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour, docetaxel IV over 1 hour, and cisplatin
      IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Patients also undergo radiotherapy
      once daily 5 days a week beginning in week 5 and continuing for 5.5 weeks. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 6-9 weeks
      after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with no evidence of metastatic disease
      undergo esophagectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year OR every 6 months for 3 years.
