      reaction (PCR) were randomized to receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and three daily doses of
      artesunate (SP+AS) or SP+AS and a dose of primaquine (SP+AS+PQ), and were followed up for 14
      days during the transmission-free season in Eastern Sudan. Subjects were visited on days 3, 7
      and 14 after the start of treatment to record any adverse events and to detect P.falciparum
      using PCR. PCR positive samples were tested for gametocytes using RT-PCR. Packed cell volume
      was measured on days 7 and 14.
