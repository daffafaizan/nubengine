      approaches in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Due to methodological shortcomings
      of previous randomized controlled studies, controversy persists whether the observed effects
      are specific to acupuncture or non-specific consequences of needling.

      Objective: To compare classical Chinese acupuncture, semi-standardized modern acupuncture and
      non-specific needling by means of a double-blinded repeated measures cross-over design.

      Intervention: Within three weeks all patients receive three treatment modalities in a random
      order in a double-blind study design.

      Main outcome measures: Improvement in knee flexibility according to the neutral-zero method,
      defining a success as improvement by 10 degrees or more.

      Secondary parameter: improvement in pain according to the reduced WOMAC score by 50 percent
      or more.
