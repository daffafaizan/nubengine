      administration of single ascending doses of GCC4401C in healthy male subjects; and the
      secondary objective of this study is to characterize the single-dose PK profile after oral
      administration of GCC-4401C, and to determine an appropriate dose range and dosing regimen of
      oral GCC-4401C for subsequent clinical trials.
