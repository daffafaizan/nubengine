      its effective fight against a variety of disease conditions related to inflammation,
      including: viral infections, allergies, asthma, hay fever, arthritis, respiratory diseases,
      "hardening of the arteries" (atherosclerosis), high cholesterol, heart disease and
      circulation problems, insulin resistance and diabetes, eye-related disorders, including
      cataracts, stomach ulcers, cognitive impairment, gout, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome,
      inflammation of the prostate, bladder, and ovaries, chronic infections of the prostate, skin
      disorders, including dermatitis and hives. Quercetin can help stop damaging particles in the
      body known as free radicals, which damages the cells by natural oxidation processes. It can
      also reduce the expression of inflammatory genes in the cells.

      Quercetin has been shown to be effective against broad range of viruses including human
      respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), rhinovirus, echovirus, coxsackievirus, poliovirus,
      parainfluenza type 3, Herpes Simplex Virus-1, cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-1, dengue virus, and
      Hepatitis C virus.

      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the potential benefits of quercetin for
      preventing COVID-19 disease progression and improving symptoms in the early stage of
      infection.
