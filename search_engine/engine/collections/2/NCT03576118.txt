      increased permeability, a hallmark of experimental ventilator-induced lung injury. These
      mechanical forces also induce an increase in the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines.

      The benefits of deep neuromuscular blocks for laparoscopic procedures are controversial and
      most of the studies undertaken have only sought to improve surgical conditions.
      Theoretically, deep neuromuscular block permits a lower abdominal insufflation pressure,
      which leads to better respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. The investigators examined the
      effects of moderate vs. deep neuromuscular block on respiratory mechanics and biotrauma in
      patients with intraoperative protective lung ventilation for laparoscopy. The investigators
      hypothesized that deep neuromuscular block (PTC 1 or 2) and low pressure pneumoperitoneum (8
      mmHg) would improve respiratory mechanics and reduce inflammatory processes associated with
      biotrama during mechanical ventilation compared with moderate neuromuscular block (TOF count
      1 or 2 ) and standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (12-15 mmHg).
