      responsiveness to initial chemotherapy, its high relapse rate makes the treatment of SCLC is
      challenging. With platinum plus etoposide or irinotecan, overall response rate is as high as
      85%, however, the median duration of response is short (approximately 4 months), and median
      survival times are 9 to 11 months, with a 2-year survival rate of less than 10% [J Clin
      oncology. 2009 Oct 1;27(28):4787-92]. New and more effective agents are clearly needed
      against SCLC. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitors acting on pathways involved in tumour
      progression and angiogenesis, and is undergoing investigation for the treatment of SCLC in
      either the first- or second-line setting. The only data available so far are on sorafenib,
      which seems to be a promising agent with a median survival of 7 and 5 months in
      platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory patients, respectively (2008 J Clin oncology 26.
      Abstract 8039). This compared favourably with historical controls receiving salvage
      chemotherapy.
