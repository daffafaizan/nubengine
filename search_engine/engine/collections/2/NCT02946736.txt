      health and well-being of service members in the Oregon National Guard and their families. The
      MESH Study seeks to do this by training supervisors to support Oregon National Guard service
      members by focusing on a reduction in work-life stress while increasing sleep health.

      The Oregon MESH Study proposes that leadership can influence a fundamental change in the
      recognition of sleep health and service members' overall well-being and the well-being of
      their family members. With the support of the Oregon National Guard, the MESH Study will
      provide family-support and sleep leadership training for supervisors while raising awareness
      of sleep through daily non-invasive sleep measurements.

      The investigators of the Oregon MESH Study expect positive results for study participants,
      including reduced stress and increased social support. Longer term, these effects are
      expected to create a more supportive work environment, which has positive effects on safety,
      health, well-being, family, and organizational outcomes. The investigators also expect that
      providing service members with individual sleep feedback will reduce sleep problems and
      improve sleep awareness.
