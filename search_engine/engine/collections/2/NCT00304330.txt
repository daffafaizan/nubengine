      transplant types and immunosuppression, in-hospital antibiotic management and clinical
      outcomes so that the effect of antibiotic resistance on patient outcome can be measured. We
      also need to collect microbiology and pathology data to determine the antibiotic
      susceptibility profile of the involved organisms. The following variables will be followed:
      time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness,
      prophylactic antimicrobials, physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data,
      empiric antimicrobial usage, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of
      antibiotic once organism identified, suspected source of infection, microbiological and
      clinical outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information, medications, gender, weight,
      ethnicity, and past medical history
