      domestic TPS to outline the contours of crisis organs, the selected organs are: bilateral
      eyeballs, bilateral crystals, bilateral optic nerves, bilateral parotid glands, oral cavity,
      spinal cord, brainstem, The brain has a total of 12 organs; verify that 3DV+TPS is superior
      to domestic TPS, and has non-inferiority compared with imported TPS, Ming software can
      improve the accuracy and speed of contour sketching, reduce the burden on doctors, and
      improve medical efficiency.
