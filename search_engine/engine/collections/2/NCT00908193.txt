      The main judgement criterion is post operative pain reflected by morphine consumption during
      the first 48 hours. Secondary criteria are morbidity, quality of life, duration of surgery,
      conversion rate, complications, the the length of stay and hospital costs.

      In this single centre study, inclusion criteria are age above 18, no previous repair of the
      hernia with a mesh and a diameter of the parietal defect of less than 10 cm.
      Contraindications are chronic use of pain drugs of level II or above and renal insufficiency
      (clearance <30ml/min).

      The robotic repair was described in a previous paper of our group and will be compared to our
      classical laparoscopic repair technique, and in both cases with the use of the same
      prosthetic mesh.

      A total of 70 patients to be included in an 18 months period was calculated to prove a 40%
      reduction in morphine consumption during the postoperative 48h (α=5% and β=10%).

      The total duration of the study is 30 months (12 months of follow-up for each patient).
