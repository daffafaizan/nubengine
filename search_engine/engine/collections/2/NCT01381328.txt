    
      The secondary objectives are, as follows:

        -  to establish standardised genotypic assay for the HIV-1 pol gene region (region of
           interest, sensitivity, mutations involved as primary or compensatory changes, role of
           polymorphism present at baseline).

        -  to reach consensus on the algorithm interpretation of in house ex-vivo genotypic
           evaluations.

        -  to assess the genetic changes in RAL-failing patients under continuous drug pressure or
           drug discontinuation (dynamics of the reversion of resistance mutations).

        -  to evaluate in RAL resistant HIV-1 variants the changes in replication capacity (RC)
           (baseline vs. following-timepoints).

        -  to evaluate the immunological and virological trend associated with a
           raltegravir-regimen failure.
