      an increase of PUFA intake with/without a reduction of saturated fatty acid intake.

      Two different types of intervention are scheduled:

        -  Supplementation to western style diet with food naturally rich in PUFA

        -  Diet modification, increasing intake of PUFA naturally rich foods and cutting the
           consumption of saturated fats.

      The supplementation is obtained adding 7 nuts a day to regular diet. The diet modification is
      obtained by increasing intake of nuts and seeds (walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, peanuts,
      sesame, sunflower, flaxseed) and derived oils, fish and vegetables; cutting the consumption
      of processed meat and dairy products is required as well.

      The type of diet or supplementation is supported by oral and written information. The
      compliance to diet will be followed by administration of validated questionnaires.

      The effect of the diet modifications will be followed by a number of plasma biomarkers we
      plan to compare at baseline and post intervention. The body weight and BMI will be checked,
      as both types of intervention are intended to not affect significantly mean body weight.
