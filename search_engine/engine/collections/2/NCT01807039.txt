    
      We evaluate relationship between the monitored parameters and 30 day survival.

      Observed parameters:

        -  age of the patient

        -  sex of the patient

        -  90 days mortality rate

        -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score

        -  time since injury and surgery (hours)

        -  whether surgery was initiated during the day (7:00 - 20:00) or at night (20:00-07:00)

        -  type of administered anesthesia (GA, epidural anaesthesia, Subarachnoid (spinal) block)

        -  hemoglobin level prior to surgery

        -  haemotransfusion administration during surgery

        -  perioperative administration of vasopressors

        -  anesthetist erudition (with / without accomplished residency)

        -  surgeon erudition (with / without accomplished residency)
