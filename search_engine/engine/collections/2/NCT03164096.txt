      lateral position, which suggests direct compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid
      uterus. Second, an increase in intraabdominal pressure may affect the retroperitoneal area
      and may cause inward movement of soft tissue in the intervertebral foramina. Recent magnetic
      resonance imaging studies in pregnant patients, although without intraabdominal pressure
      measurements, suggested the latter because they showed limited contact of engorged veins
      along the dural sac which may therefore not be responsible for compression of the dura.

      If elevated intraabdominal pressure contributes to high anesthetic spread during pregnancy,
      one would expect a relationship between intraabdominal pressure and maximum sensory block
      level.
