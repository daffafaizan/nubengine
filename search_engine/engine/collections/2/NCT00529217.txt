    
      This study is a research trial of an outpatient, non-medication, non-invasive investigational
      treatment called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS applies a magnetic field to the
      brain for a brief period of time. TMS is a procedure that involves 30 minute-long daily
      sessions every weekday for a series of weeks. The investigators are testing whether TMS can
      treat Depersonalization Disorder (DPD).

      This is an open-label study. All patients will receive active treatment. DPD symptoms will be
      monitored through weekly self-report questionnaires as well clinical ratings with a doctor.
