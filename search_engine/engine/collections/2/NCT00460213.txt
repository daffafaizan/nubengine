      of death in Japanese population. Numerous mega trials have shown that strict
      anti-hypertensive therapy could reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive
      patients.

      It is reported, however, over 50% hypertensive patients have not been controlled below
      therapeutic target blood pressure that the JSH2004 guideline recommends.

      Recently use of Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is increasing progressively for their
      pharmacological action on organ protection as well as potent reduction in blood pressure.
      However, usual dosage of ARB in Japan is almost half of that in the mega trials executed in
      Europe and America. Lower dosage compared to western countries might be a reason why
      cardiovascular events are not fully reduced in Japan.

      Valsartan optimal therapy against elevated home blood pressure research (VOYAGER) study will
      be a multi-center, open-label, randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the following;
      improvement percentage of urinary albumin exception, home blood pressure, hospital blood
      pressure, incidence of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and microangiopathy with valsartan 80
      mg- or valsartan 160 mg based therapy in patients with elevated morning home blood pressure.
