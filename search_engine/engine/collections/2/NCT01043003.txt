      I. Test the effects of the Bilingual Breast Cancer Education Intervention (BBCEI) on outcomes
      of breast cancer survivors (BCS) and family caregivers at 1, 3, and 6 months post
      intervention.

      II. Test the effect of influencing demographic and treatment variables on outcomes of the
      BBCEI at 1, 3, and 6 months post intervention.

      III. Examine the perceived quality of the BBCEI.

      OUTLINE: Patients and caregivers are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

      ARM I: Patients and caregivers undergo the Bilingual Breast Cancer Educational Intervention
      (BBCEI) comprising teaching sessions over 50-65 minutes about 4 specific domains (i.e.,
      physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well being) once weekly during month 1 and
      also undergo evaluation sessions at months 1, 4, and 7.

      ARM II: Patients and caregivers undergo usual care comprising evaluation sessions at months
      1, 4, and 7. Patients and caregivers may undergo the 4 BBCEI teaching sessions during month
      7.

      All patients and caregivers receive reinforcement telephone calls every other week.
