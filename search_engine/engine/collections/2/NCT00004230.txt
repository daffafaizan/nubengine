      autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation following cyclophosphamide and total body
      radiotherapy or high dose chemotherapy. II. Determine a series of surrogate lung injury
      prediction markers for monitoring patients undergoing therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to preparative regimen
      (high dose chemotherapy versus cyclophosphamide and total body radiotherapy). Patients are
      randomized into one of two treatment arms. All patients undergo a conditioning regimen
      consisting of cyclophosphamide daily on days -6 and -5 and total body radiotherapy on day -4
      through -1, or high dose chemotherapy per transplantation protocol. Arm I: Patients receive
      oral captopril 2 to 3 times daily beginning on the first day of the conditioning regimen and
      continuing until day 100 post autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Arm II:
      Patients receive no captopril while undergoing conditioning therapy. Patients are followed at
      6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
