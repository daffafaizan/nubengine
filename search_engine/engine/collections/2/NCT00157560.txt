    
      Objective: To evaluate a novel regimen in ovarian carcinoma with an aim of demonstrating a
      higher than 50% laparotomy defined response rate. This rate is defined as the proportion of
      patients achieving either a pathologic complete response or a microscopic positive second
      look at the conclusion of therapy.

      Primary study goals:

      Â· To determine the efficacy of a triple doublet regimen in carefully defined cohorts of
      patients as defined by the surgical defined response rate

      Secondary study goals:

        -  To evaluate incidence of tubulin mutations in primary and secondary surgical specimens.

        -  To evaluate changes in IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and FGF, at primary diagnosis, during and at
           the conclusion of therapy.

        -  To describe initial IL-6, IL-8, and FGF levels in patients who ultimately achieve
           pathologic remission vs those with gross residual disease.

      Patients will recieve 3 cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by 3 cycles of taxol
      and carboplatin and then three cycles of adriamycin and topotecan. All patients with a
      clinically complete response will then undergo second look operation to determine
      pathologically defined response.
