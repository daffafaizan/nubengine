      complete a 30-hour constant routine protocol. Participants will undergo baseline testing that
      includes anthropometric measurements, clinic blood pressure measurements, completion of
      self-report questionnaires on sleep and mood, be fitted with an ambulatory blood pressure
      monitor and actigraphy watch, and be provided with home sleep testing (HST) equipment.

      Following completion of baseline assessment, eligible participants will be scheduled for the
      30-hour constant routine protocol. The 30-hour constant routine protocol will allow for the
      hourly collection of saliva, collection of buccal cells every 4 hours, and constant
      monitoring of core body temperature, all of which are primary outcomes in the assessment of
      central and peripheral circadian clock markers. Amplitude and phase of these outcomes will be
      assessed in non-dippers versus dippers.
