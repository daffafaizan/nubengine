      (IV) opioids from 2016 to 2018. IV opioids are used in the hospital setting ranging from the
      Emergency Department to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to the Operating room. This study will
      look at the usage of IV opioids in the operating room setting and determine how practice has
      change in the setting of drug shortage. The study team hypothesizes that the average monthly
      consumption of fentanyl and hydrophone would have been decreased for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy intraoperatively during the opioid shortage period as compared to before the
      shortage period.
