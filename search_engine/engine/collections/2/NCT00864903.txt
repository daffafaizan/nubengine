      detection of its enzymatic reaction. The detection of a specific enzymatic reaction is
      indicative to the presence of the specific virus in a biological specimen. This study will
      compare this diagnostic assay to RT-PCR for diagnosis of enteroviral infection in
      cerebrospinal fluid. CSF samples will be taken from children undergoing a spinal tap at the
      pediatric ER due to a suspicion of meningitis. A total of 100 samples will be collected, from
      children 0-16 years old who's parents agreed on participation in the study. A comparison of
      the enzymatic assay to RT-PCR as well as calibration and validation of the new assay will be
      done with the harvested samples, for a rapid and accurate identification of Enterovirus in
      human cerebrospinal fluid.
