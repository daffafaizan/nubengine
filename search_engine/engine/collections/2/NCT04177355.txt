    
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HIV-1 BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 with
      TLR agonist and/or alum adjuvants in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part A and B). Part A will include two groups
      (Groups 1 and 2) and Part B will include four groups (Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6).

      Participants in Part A will be randomly assigned to receive the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 vaccine
      admixed with 3M-052-AF and alum adjuvant or to receive placebo. Part A participants will be
      enrolled sequentially in Groups 1 and 2 for dose escalation.

      Participants in Part B will be randomly assigned to Groups 3, 4, 5, or 6, to receive the
      BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 vaccine with an adjuvant (the specific adjuvant will vary by group) or
      to receive placebo.

      Participants in Part A will attend 8 months of scheduled clinic visits, and they will be
      contacted by study staff at Month 14 for follow-up health monitoring. Participants in Part B
      will attend 18 months of scheduled clinic visits.
