      as nail changes, which do not require treatment cessation, can limit the use of isotretinoin
      by impairing the patient's quality of life. Although it is known that isotretinoin has
      various effects on the nails, there is very limited data on effects of isotretinoin on the
      nails. Therefore, it was aimed to investigate the effect of isotretinoin on the morphology,
      growth rate, and thickness of the nail plate. The patients aged 18-45 that were planned to
      begin treatment with isotretinoin for acne in the outpatient clinic and a control group
      consisting of healthy volunteers are planned to be included in the study. A dermatological
      examination of skin and nails is conducted in all participants. Isotretinoin treatment at 0.5
      mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses will be started to patients with acne. The length and
      thickness of nail plate are measured by digital caliper before isotretinoin treatment, and
      repeated during the control visits of the participants at 30 day intervals for 6 months. All
      the examination and measurements are carried out in both groups.
