      have to perform before beginning a medical treatment. However, patients often experience the
      informed consent taking as not satisfying. In the past, several approaches were used to try
      to improve the informed consent taking, such as printed information sheets and multimedia
      tools.

      A novel concept introduced several years ago is to use a multimedia tool including a
      so-called traffic light system. The patient sees and hears information concerning cataract
      surgery on a touch screen and after each short chapter a traffic light is shown on the touch
      screen. At this point the patient has to decide, whether everything is clear and he wants to
      continue (green light), if he has further questions for the ophthalmologist (yellow light),
      or if he wants to repeat the chapter (red light). The patient's feedback for each chapter is
      then printed and guides the ophthalmologist during the face to face interview. This approach
      is called "CatInfo tool".

      The German version of the CatInfo tool has been developed and evaluated in a previous study.
      In short, the CatInfo tool was developed as a multidisciplinary project including patients,
      graphic designers and ophthalmologists. The first version of the tool was evaluated in
      patient focus-groups. Afterwards, an evaluation study including 60 patients was performed.
      Main outcome was the following: patients who used the CatInfo tool were significantly better
      informed than patients only having a face to face interview with an ophthalmologist and the
      feedback concerning the CatInfo tool was good. Meanwhile the German version of the CatInfo
      tool is part of our daily routine and thousands of patients profited from the CatInfo tool
      consent always additional to the face to face interview with an ophthalmologist. However,
      some patients are not able to use the CatInfo tool. One reason is that they are not literate
      in German. Aim of this study is to translate and evaluate a Serbian and Turkish version of
      the CatInfo tool to allow better access.
