      leading indication for valve surgery. Histological studies have suggested similarities with
      atherosclerosis including inflammation, lipid deposition, increased macrophage activity and
      calcification. However, recent randomised controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a
      reduction in the rate of disease progression with statin therapy and the investigators
      believe there is now a need to re-evaluate the underlying factors involved in the initiation
      and progression of aortic stenosis. The investigators propose to assess the role of
      inflammation and calcification in the pathogenesis and progression of aortic stenosis by
      using positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and [18F-]-fluoride in
      patients with a range of aortic valve disease. The investigators hypothesise that increasing
      severity of valvular inflammation and calcification will correlate with disease severity and
      rate of disease progression. This work will lay the foundation for the subsequent application
      of interventions targeted at inflammation and calcification.
