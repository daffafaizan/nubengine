    
      The aim of this study is to determine the local prevalence of critical illness-associated
      hyperglycaemia (CIAH) and recognised and unrecognised diabetes, as well as to evaluate how
      premorbid glycaemia impacts the relationship between three glycaemic domains and mortality.

      The investigators will calculate the Time In Range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dl) and evaluate
      distribution of percentage time in range for non-diabetics and diabetics patients, in order
      to understand the association between TIR and survival in both groups of patients (patients
      with diabetes and patients without diabetes).

      In view of the potential adverse effects of hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia and glycaemic
      variability on the brain, the investigators will dose Neuron Specific Enolase in critically
      ill patients.

      The aim is to define if a biochemical correlation does exist between critically ill
      dysglycaemia and NSE plasma concentration.
