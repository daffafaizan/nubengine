      The current recommended treatment of acute pain in the ED setting is administration of an
      initial bolus of morphine followed by titration until adequate analgesia is achieved. Several
      studies have shown that even 0.1 mg/kg IV morphine (7-10 mg administered to the average
      70-100 kg patient) inadequately treats many patients' acute pain. In spite of this, it has
      been observed that many emergency physicians and nurses are hesitant to give 7-10 mg of
      morphine as an initial IV dose. In contrast, it has been observed that these same healthcare
      providers were not similarly reluctant to administer a roughly equianalgesic dose of
      hydromorphone (1-1.5 mg), perhaps because the more potent hydromorphone is given in much
      smaller milligram quantities than morphine, thus providing the illusion of substantially less
      opioid administered to the patient. Having repeatedly observed this phenomenon, it is
      reasonable that if a smaller milligram dose of hydromorphone were shown to provide an
      efficacy, safety, and side-effect profile comparable or superior to a larger milligram dose
      of morphine, it would provide evidence supporting use of hydromorphone as an alternative
      first line opioid in the treatment of acute pain presenting to the ED. As a practical
      corollary to this, it is reasoned further that the increased willingness of healthcare
      providers to use hydromorphone might contribute to reducing one component of the multifaceted
      problem of oligoanalgesia in the ED.
