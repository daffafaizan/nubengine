           identify lung nodules smaller than 3 cm in diameter. However, it's still a clinical
           challenge to differentiate between malignant and benign nodules.

        -  This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the MDA TEST to detect
           Targeted chromosomal aberrations in circulating abnormal cells by FISH analysis that
           might be an early indicator of lung cancer. Approximately 200 Pre-surgery adult patients
           with single pulmonary nodule found by CT scan, will be enrolled in the study. The sample
           type of MDA test is Peripheral Blood. This study will compare the results of the
           pre-surgery MDA Test with the post-surgery pathology to determine if the test can detect
           lung cancer or the lack of lung cancer .

        -  The results of the test will not be provided to the subject, the investigator and will
           not be used to diagnose or treat the subject.
