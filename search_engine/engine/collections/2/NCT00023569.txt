      technique, electromyography (EMG) triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation NMES) known
      as EMG-Stim., on brain reorganization. Clinically EMG-Stim. is thought to improve a chronic
      hemiparetic hand [1-3], but its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We plan to
      determine: (1) if EMG-Stim. on a chronic hemiparetic hand as a result of stroke enhances
      improved hand motor function; and (2) whether any clinical improvement is related to brain
      reorganization.
