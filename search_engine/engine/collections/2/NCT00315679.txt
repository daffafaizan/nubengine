      mouth ulcers). Most existing treatments are palliative topical treatments. Some systemic
      drugs e.g. steroids and thalidomide can suppress the recurrence of mouth ulcers but have
      serious long term side effects. Pentoxifylline (also known as oxpentifylline) has been used
      systemically for many years to treat peripheral vascular disease and has a good side effect
      profile. It shares several actions with thalidomide but does not share its serious side
      effects. Furthermore, some small scale, open label clinical studies have indicated it may be
      very effective in treating recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). This study enrolled patients
      with RAS for which no underlying cause could be identified. Patients kept a diary of the
      pattern of their mouth ulcers for 60 days to confirm the pattern of ulceration and provide
      baseline data. Those still qualified for the study were then randomized to treatment with
      pentoxifylline 400mg three times daily or an identical placebo tablet three times daily for a
      further 60 days during which they continued to keep a daily ulcer diary. At the end of this
      period, treatment was stopped and they kept the daily ulcer diary for a further 60 days to
      identify if any benefit from the treatment was continued after ceasing treatment.
