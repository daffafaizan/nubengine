      in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and reduced left ventricular function Phase:
      Pilot study Study Duration: 4 years with up to 5 additional years of follow up Study
      Center(s): 3 centers will be participating: MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC),
      MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
      (MSKCC) Primary Objective: To evaluate the cardiac safety of HER2 targeted therapy
      (non-lapatinib) in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and reduced left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) when given concomitantly with cardiac treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate time to development of cardiac event or asymptomatic worsening of cardiac
           function

        -  Absolute changes in LVEF

        -  Delays in HER2 therapy attributed to cardiac causes

        -  Correlations between echocardiographic myocardial strain

        -  cTnI and hs-cTnT at baseline and over time with cardiac events and asymptomatic
           worsening of cardiac function Sample size: 30 patients

      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:

        -  HER2 positive breast cancer, stage I-IV.

        -  Mildly decreased cardiac function (LVEF between 40 and 49%) prior to or while receiving
           non-lapatinib HER2 targeted therapy

      Cardiac Intervention:

      - Beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors titrated to the maximum tolerated doses

      Oncology study Products, Doses, Routes, Regimens:

        -  Trastuzumab: loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV, followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg every
           3 weeks, or a loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg every
           week.

        -  Pertuzumab: loading dose of 840 mg IV, followed by 420 mg IV every 3 weeks, administered
           concomitantly with trastuzumab.

        -  Ado-trastuzumab emtansine: 3.6mg/kg IV every three weeks. Note: both trastuzumab and
           pertuzumab may be administered alone or in combination with other systemic or radiation
           therapy.

      Duration of drug administration: Maximum of 12 months.
