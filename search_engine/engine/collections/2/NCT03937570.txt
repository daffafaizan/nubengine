      survival and quality of life of patients with advanced and refractory heart failure (HF).
      However, after the implantation of an LVAD, patients' functional capacity (FC) is still
      reduced with maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) values calculated at the cardiopulmonary
      exercise test (CPET) ranging from 11 to 20 ml/kg/min. LVAD echo guided optimization (EO)
      determines a more favorable hemodynamic profile, in particular for the right ventricle, and
      could provide an improvement on FC. VAFRACT is a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the
      additional benefit of an EO approach on FC, measured by CPET in LVAD optimization free
      population.

      The optimal device speed is defined as the one that allows an intermittent aortic valve
      opening and a neutral position of the interventricular septum without increasing aortic or
      tricuspid regurgitation associated or not to a dilatation of the right ventricle (RV). In
      this condition it is reasonable to expect a more favorable hemodynamic profile for the RV and
      a better response in terms of functional capacity.

      Subjects studied are HF patients supported with a continuous-flow LVAD: HeartMate II
      (Thoratec Inc., Pleasanton, CA) and HeartMate 3 (HM 3, Abbott, North Chicago, IL). Patients
      are recruited from our Day Hospital of the Cardiac Surgery Department at the University
      Hospital of Verona.
