        1. To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without the addition of
           exercise on mitochondrial biogenesis and energetic capacity, cellular redox state and
           insulin resistance.

        2. To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without the addition of
           exercise on intramyocellular lipid profiles.

        3. To determine the effects of diet-induced weight loss with and without exercise on
           skeletal muscle proteins mediating a program of autophagy and either loss or maintenance
           of muscle mass.
