      will be used to direct targeted agents only to those patients deemed most likely to respond.
      This "personalized cancer medicine" requires two critical steps: first, a comprehensive
      assessment of the biological characteristics of tumors from each individual, and second,
      validated biomarkers to identify the subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit
      from a given therapy and the next-generation sequencing provides unprecedented opportunities
      to draw a comprehensive picture of genetic aberrations involve in immunotherapy sensitivity
      and ultimately enable individualized treatment.

      The main objective of this study is to use next generation sequencing technologies to
      identify actionable molecular alterations in cancer patients with advanced disease included
      in the study. This study will provide a fully integrated view of the molecular profile of the
      tumor for each patient included in the study. Such tumor profile will be used by clinicians
      to tailor therapies of patients in specific early phase clinical trials.
