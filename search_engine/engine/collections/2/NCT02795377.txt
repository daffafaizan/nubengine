      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) (n=50) will be recruited. MP subpopulations will be
      discriminated by flow cytometry according to the expression of established surface antigens
      including CD31+/41-, CD144+, and CD62e+. Besides office and ambulatory 24h blood pressure
      measurements, pulse wave analysis will be performed to determine central blood pressure,
      augmentation index (AIX), and pulse wave velocity. Endothelial function (Flow-mediated
      dilation, FMD), arterial pulsatile stretch (fractional diameter changes, FDC), and
      wall-shear-stress (WSS) will be measured in the same segment of the brachial artery (BA) by
      ultrasound. In a second series, the investigators will take measurements in subjects with
      hypertensive crises (SBP>180 mmHg) (n=20) before and after 4h and normalization of arterial
      BP by urapidil. In a third series, the investigators will take measurement in subjects with
      stable CAD (n=10) before and after transfemoral coronary diagnostic angiography.
