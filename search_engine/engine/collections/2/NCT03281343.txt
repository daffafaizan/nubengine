      risk for HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious means of reducing HIV
      acquisition. There is a general lack of knowledge regarding PrEP among women at elevated
      risk, and only a small percentage of at-risk women are currently engaged in PrEP care. The
      period of incarceration represents an opportunity to identify at-risk women, initiate PrEP
      during incarceration, and establish linkage to community-based PrEP care upon release from
      incarceration. Further, post-release is a time period that is particularly risky, and there
      are numerous barriers that may impede linkage to community-based care in the absence of
      intervention.

      To date, very little research has been done to improve linkage to PrEP care among US women.
      The proposed study will examine the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a
      psychoeducation and motivational interviewing intervention to promote PrEP initiation during
      incarceration, followed by a patient navigator intervention to facilitate linkage to
      community-based PrEP care upon release from incarceration. The long-term goal of this line of
      research is to disseminate an efficacious PrEP Care linkage intervention for at-risk women
      post-release from incarceration. The present proposal seeks to develop intervention materials
      and conduct a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention.
