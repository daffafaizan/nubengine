        -  0.01% atropine one drop nightly reduces the progression of childhood myopia in Danish
           children.

        -  0.01% atropine one drop nightly is safe and with no significant side effects.

        -  A 6-month loading dose of 0.1% atropine followed by a 0.01% atropine maintenance dose is
           superior to single 0.01% atropine.

        -  0.1% atropine one drop nightly is safe and has tolerable side effects.

        -  The rebound effect after stopping both atropine regimens is limited.

        -  Choroidal thickness is a predictor for the progression of childhood myopia.
