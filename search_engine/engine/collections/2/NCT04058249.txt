      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been
      very successful in real-world situations. The limitations of this approach include the
      duration of the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session over 4-6 weeks).
      Recently, researchers have modified the treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with
      some preliminary success. In a recent study, an accelerated paradigm showed a significant
      antidepressant effect (90% remission rate) in individuals with treatment-resistant depression
      (TRD), in only 5 days. Additionally, 5 participants from this study carried a bipolar
      diagnosis and responded similarly, with no adverse events experienced or manic/hypomanic
      conversion observed during the treatment series. In parallel to this, evidence in the
      literature shows that right prefrontal rapid TMS is safe and efficacious in the treatment of
      bipolar mania showing laterality opposed to the proposed effect of rapid TMS in depression.

      The current trial intends to utilise this modified design, i.e., an accelerated theta burst
      stimulation treatment over the right prefrontal cortex, for manic episodes in bipolar
      disorder. The trial also aims to look at the change in clinical measures and neuroimaging
      biomarkers.
