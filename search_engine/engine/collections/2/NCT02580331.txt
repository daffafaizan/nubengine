      osteoblasts differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro, thus may exhibit
      a favourable effect on alveolar bone. The present study aims to explore the efficacy of 1% MF
      gel as a local drug delivery system in adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the
      treatment of Class II furcation defects in comparison with placebo gel.

      Methods: Sixty four patients with single mandibular buccal class II furcation defects were
      categorized into two treatment groups: SRP plus 1% MF (group 1) and SRP plus placebo (group
      2). Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months, and
      radiographic parameters were recorded at baseline, 6 months, and 9 months. Defect fill at
      baseline, 6 months, and 9 months was calculated on standardized radiographs using image
      analysis software.
