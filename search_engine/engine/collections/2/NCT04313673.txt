      and mortality. Preterm birth accounts for about 12% of all births. Early screening and
      correct management of pregnant women at risk of preterm birth is essential in reducing
      perinatal mortality and morbidity associated with prematurity. But the precise prediction and
      prevention of preterm birth is still an important research topic.

      Transabdominal ultrasonography, which provides a non-invasive evaluation, is more preferred
      by some patients than transvaginal.The aim of this study was to investigate the value of the
      cervical length measured by transabdominal route, which is a more acceptable method for
      pregnant women, in predicting preterm birth.
