    
      Patients scheduled for cerebral aneurysm clipping surgery or arteriovenous malformation
      surgery(ASA 1to 3 over 18years) receive standard care general anesthesia including central
      venous line for rapid ventricular pacing technique. A contralateral Foresight sensor is
      placed on the forehead of the patient at induction. After the craniotomy two micro
      electrodes(PBtO2 and cerebral blood flow) are placed in the brain and fixated. A subdural
      strip electrode is placed on the surface of the brain to record the electrical activity.
      Effect of mild hyperventilation and oxygenation with 100% O2 is evaluated.
