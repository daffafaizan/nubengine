      adenomas can reduce the incidence and mortality of CRC. However, there is evidence that some
      patients may develop interval cancers-cancers developed within 3-5 years following
      colonoscopy and polypectomy. The overall rate of interval cancer was 1.1-2.7 per 1000
      person-years. Several studies have suggested that patients who develop interval cancers are
      more likely to have proximal compared than distal cancers.

      One hypothesis is that adenomas may be more likely to be missed in the proximal colon
      compared with the distal colon. Serrated polyps and some adenomas in the proximal colon may
      be difficult to detect if they are flat, covered with mucus, or behind folds. A second
      hypothesis is that neoplastic lesions of the proximal colon may biologically differ from
      distal lesions and progress to malignancy with a short dwell time.

      Several tandem back to back colonoscopy studies have demonstrated that up to 27% adenomas in
      the proximal colon are missed during routine screening colonoscopy. Hover, examining the
      colon twice as that in the back to back studies is difficult to be performed in clinical
      practice. Thus, we developed a novel colonoscopy technique, segmental examination twice of
      the proximal colon, that is simple and easy to be performed. The current study aims to
      examine the efficacy of segmental examination twice of the proximal colon on adenoma
      detection rate (ADR) during routine screening and surveillance colonoscopy.
