      effectiveness trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a quit vaping text message program in
      promoting abstinence from e-cigarettes among young users aged 18-24. This study is a 2-arm
      randomized controlled trial conducted among young users aged 18-24 recruited through online
      channels. Participants will be randomized to a quit vaping text message intervention or to an
      assessment-only control condition and followed for 7 months to roughly correspond to 6-months
      post-treatment. The secondary aim is to examine potential mediators of program effectiveness,
      including treatment engagement and changes in self-efficacy and perceived social support for
      quitting.
