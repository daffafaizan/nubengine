      ultraviolet absorbing optical implant designed for the replacement of the human crystalline
      lens following phacoemulsification cataract removal. The TetraFlex Accommodating Posterior
      Chamber IOL is designed for treatment of aphakia. The lens is indicated for primary
      implantation when a cataractous lens has been removed by phacoemulsification with circular
      tear capsulotomy and the posterior capsule intact. The intended benefit of the TetraFlex
      Accommodating Posterior Chamber IOL is to provide enhanced distance and near vision with an
      increased independence from corrective lens wear.
