    
      One hundred RA patients with active disease (DAS28 >/=3.2), duration of symptoms less than 2
      years, and are disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug naive will participate in this 5-year
      prospective, hospital-based, open-label, randomized, controlled trial.

      All participants will receive 1-year tight-control treatment. One hundred patients will be
      randomly assigned to two arms. Treatment will be adjusted according to a standardized
      protocol every 3-monthly aiming at remission defined by the 2011 ACR/EULAR definition (Group
      1, n=50, simplified disease activity score [SDAI] â‰¤3.3) or minimal disease activity (Group 2,
      n=50, DAS28<2.6). A follow up visit will be conducted at the 5th year to evulate long term
      effect on vascular outcomes between the two groups.
