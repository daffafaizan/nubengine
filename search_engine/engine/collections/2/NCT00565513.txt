      reproduction, such exposure could be harmful to human fetus as well. Data are scarce on human
      exposure and the occurrence of cryptorchidism.

      DESIGN: From 2002 to 2005, we performed a prospective case-control study to assess the
      incidence of cryptorchidism and fetal exposure to selected chemicals in newborn boys in Nice
      area. This study was approved by the ethical board of our institution. Out of 6246 live
      births at or after 34 weeks of gestational age and born at 2 maternity wards (University
      hospital of Nice and General Hospital of Grasse), 102 boys were diagnosed with
      cryptorchidism. After informed parental consent, 95 were included in this study, along with
      188 tightly matched controls. Cord blood was collected at birth, as well as maternal milk
      from nursing mothers. Lifestyle and job questionnaires were filled by parents. Children were
      re-examined at 3 and 12 months of age to assess possible secondary testis migration, or
      confirm their control status.

      151 cord bloods (67 cryptorchid, 84 controls) and 125 maternal milks (56 for cryptorchid boys
      and 69 for controls) were collected and screened for xenobiotics, including DDE, PCBs, and
      dibutylphthalate (and metabolite monobutylphthalate -mBP). We established scores of exposure
      in colostrum and studied possible relationships between exposure and cryptorchidism. We also
      measured hormonal status on cord blood including AMH and inhibin concentrations.

      RESULTS: The incidence of cryptorchidism was 1.6% at birth, similar in Nice and Grasse, and
      0.8% at 3 months of age. Xenobiotic measurements in cord blood and milk showed universal
      exposure in our population. Median concentrations in maternal milk were higher though not
      significantly in cryptorchid vs controls: DDE 119.4 vs 80 ng/g of fat, ΣPCB 206.3 vs 166.8
      ng/g of fat, mBP 17.3 vs 10.3 ng/g of milk. Cryptorchid boys were more likely to be
      classified in the most contaminated groups for ΣPCBs (57.1% vs 39.1% p=0.045), DDE (53.6 vs
      36.2% p=0.037) and to a lesser degree mBP (58.1 vs 40%, p=0.13). This was also true for the
      composite score using DDE and ΣPCBs (30.4 vs 21.7%, p=0.05). Last, the odds ratio for
      cryptorchidism at birth was increased for the highest score of: DDE: 2.03 (p=0.05, 95%CI
      0.99-4.17); ΣPCB 2.07 (p=0.046, 95%CI 1.01-4.25); composite score without phthalates 2.41
      (p=0.06, 95%CI 0.96-6.1) vs the lowest score of those components.

      CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cryptorchidism at birth of 1.6% is similar to other
      populations. Our results support an association between fetal exposure to DDE, PCBs and
      possibly mBP, and the occurrence of cryptorchidism at birth. Higher concentrations in milk
      could be a marker of higher exposure or for an impaired detoxification pattern in genetically
      predisposed individuals. Long term follow up of our cohort is planned to screen cryptorchid
      and control boys for low sperm count, infertility and testis cancer.
