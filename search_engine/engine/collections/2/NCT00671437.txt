    
      Primary Endpoint

      To compare the SUV (standardized uptake value) at up to three target tumor sites as assessed
      by FDG-PET/CT of eligible patients at baseline and then after eight weeks of treatment with
      cetuximab.

      Secondary Endpoints

        -  To determine the overall tumor metabolic response (complete metabolic response, partial
           metabolic response, stable metabolic disease or progressive metabolic disease [CMR, PMR,
           SMD, or PMD]) to eight weeks of scheduled weekly doses of cetuximab as assessed by
           FDG-PET/CT performed at baseline and then after therapy.

        -  To correlate the overall tumor metabolic response (CMR, PMR, SMD, or PMD) as assessed by
           FDG-PET/CT with the anatomic tumor response rate (complete response, partial response,
           stable disease or progressive disease [CR, PR, SD, or PD]) by RECIST criteria as
           assessed by CT and clinical examination performed after eight weeks of scheduled weekly
           doses of cetuximab.

        -  To correlate the overall tumor metabolic response (CMR, PMR, SMD, or PMD) as assessed by
           FDG-PET/CT and to correlate the overall anatomic tumor response (CR, PR, SD, or PD) by
           RECIST criteria as assessed by CT and clinical examination obtained at baseline and
           after eight weeks of treatment with weekly scheduled doses of cetuximab to TTP (time to
           progression) and OS (overall survival) with cetuximab therapy.

        -  To determine the overall best anatomic tumor response rate (CR, PR, SD, or PD) to
           cetuximab given until disease progression as assessed by RECIST criteria using CT and
           clinical examination.

        -  To determine the overall disease control rate (CR, PR, and SD) by RECIST criteria as
           assessed by CT and clinical examination and to determine the TTP and the OS with
           cetuximab therapy.

        -  To assess the toxicity profile for standard of care cetuximab given to patients with
           metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
