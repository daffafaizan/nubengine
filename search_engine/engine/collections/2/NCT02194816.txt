      change, quality of life, diet and lifestyle habits among patients with Parkinson's disease
      (PD). This study will identify and describe those individuals with the highest quality of
      life and least amount of disease activity, in order to describe medication, diet, and
      lifestyle patterns associated with a lack of PD disease progression and high quality of life.

      Participants will be asked to complete online surveys every six months for five years. The
      time requirement is about an hour to an hour and a half every six months. Participants do not
      need to answer questions if they do not feel comfortable answering.

      At each six month time point we will send participants an email with the link to the CAM Care
      in PD survey, a questionnaire about health and wellbeing (completed in REDCap). After
      participants have completed this survey we will send participants a link to the second
      survey, about dietary intake (completed on ASA24.gov). Because there is a designated window
      of time during which surveys must be completed, participants may receive a gentle reminder
      from us if time is running out.

      This study is not designed to provide care. Participants are encouraged to consult with any
      providers you wish. Participants will not directly benefit from the study, but information
      gathered during the course of this study may help us begin to assess the longer-term effects
      of complementary and integrative care on health, disease progression and quality of life in
      PD patients.
