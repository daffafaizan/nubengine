    
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. All patients receive 1 of 3 conditioning regimens.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN A: Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on
      days -10 to -7, then receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 3 hours once daily (QD) on days
      -6 and -5, and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes once daily on days -6 to -2.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN B: Patients undergo TBI BID on days -8 to -5, then receive fludarabine
      IV over 30 minutes QD on days -4 to -2, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour QD on days -3 and
      -2.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN C: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes QD on days -6 to -2,
      busulfan IV over 180 minutes QD on days -5 to -2, and undergo total body irradiation BID on
      day -1.

      ARM I: Patients receive naive T-cell depleted PBSCs on day 0.

      ARM II: Patients receive unmanipulated T cell-replete BM on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: All patients receive tacrolimus IV on days -1 to +50 followed by a taper in
      the absence of grade II-IV aGVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days +1, +3, +6,
      and +11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
