    
      This is a single center case-control study based on routine care, designed to recruit
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus free from any other myocardiopathy. The inclusion will
      take place over a period of 24 months. No monitoring of patients (no follow-up) is provided
      under this protocol. The analysis will focus on the combination of the left ventricle
      myocardial deformations alteration revealed by the echocardiographic 2D strain analysis (<
      18% in absolute value), with the existence of micro-angiopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus
      patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction ( ≥ 60%).

      Two hundred subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus will be recruited: 100 subjects with
      impaired left ventricular myocardial deformation by 2D strain analysis (< 18% in absolute
      value), constituting the 'cases' group and 100 subjects without alteration in myocardial
      deformation (global strain ≥ 18%).
