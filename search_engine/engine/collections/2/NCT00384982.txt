      and beneficially affect the postinfarction remodeling.

      The MYocardial STem cell Administration after acute myocardial infaRction (MYSTAR) study is a
      multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial designed to compare the
      early and late intracoronary or combined (percutaneous intramyocardial and intracoronary)
      administration of BM-SCs to patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with reopened
      infarct-related artery.

      The primary endpoints are the changes in resting myocardial perfusion defect size and left
      ventricular ejection fraction (gated SPECT scintigraphy) 3 months after BM-SCs therapy.

      The secondary endpoints relate to evaluation of 1) the safety and feasibility of the
      application modes, 2) the changes in left ventricular wall motion score index (transthoracic
      echocardiography), 3) myocardial voltage and segmental wall motion (NOGA mapping), 4) left
      ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (contrast ventriculography), and 5) the
      clinical symptoms (CCS and NYHA) at follow-up.

      Patients are randomly assigned into one of four groups, Group A: early treatment (21-42 days
      after AMI) with intracoronary injection; Group B: early treatment (21-42 days after AMI) with
      combined (intramyocardial and intracoronary) application; Group C: late treatment (3 months
      after AMI) with intracoronary delivery; and Group D: late treatment (3 months after AMI) with
      combined (intramyocardial and intracoronary) administration of BM-SCs. Besides the BM-SCs
      therapy, the standardized treatment of AMI is applied in all patients.

      The MYSTAR trial is the first randomized trial to investigate the effects of the combined
      (intramyocardial and intracoronary) and the intracoronary mode of delivery of BM-SCs therapy
      in the early and late periods after AMI.
