      prophylactic pulmonary rehabilitation prior to bronchoscopic lung volume reduction will be
      recorded prospectively. Two parallel groups will be formed from patients with hospital-based
      pulmonary rehabilitation (Group 1) and those with home-based pulmonary rehabilitation (Group
      2). The patient will receive an 8-week Pulmonary Rehabilitation Exercise Program and will be
      reevaluated after 8 weeks. The differences in the parameters of initial and rehabilitation
      end-tracing and the differences between the groups will be examined.
