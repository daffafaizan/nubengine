      support their efficacy and safety. Despite its widespread use for more than 30 years, the
      Atkins diet has never been evaluated in a large, randomized, controlled trial. This study
      will assess the short-term and long-term clinical effects of a low-carbohydrate diet and a
      high-carbohydrate diet in overweight and obese men and women.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to the Atkins diet (low-carbohydrate,
      unlimited fat and protein) or a conventional USDA diet (high-carbohydrate, low fat). The
      study will evaluate the effects of each dietary approach on changes in: 1) weight and body
      composition, 2) metabolic and organ function, 3) exercise tolerance. Each participant will be
      enrolled in the study for 2 years.
