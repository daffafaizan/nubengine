    
      To evaluate the efficacy of end-effector RAGT in subacute stroke patients in terms of
      clinical outcomes and gait kinematics, comparing them with conventional gait rehabilitation
      program, patients following first ever stroke in sub-acute phase will be recruited and
      assessed both clinically and instrumentally (Gait Analysis) at baseline (T0) and at the end
      of training program (T1). The patients will be divided into 2 groups and will conduct two
      different types of gait training: one group will be recruited by IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana of
      Rome and will perform, in addition to conventional therapy, gait training using an
      end-effector robotic device for RAGT(Robotic Group, RG); and another group will be recruited
      by the Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation Onlus of Rome, and will perform conventional gait
      rehabilitation program(Conventional Group, CG).
