      there is no accepted national standard or recommendations from the American Academy of
      Orthopaedic Surgeons or the Orthopaedic Trauma Association for what level of anemia is
      appropriate in an asymptomatic patient. Individual practitioners typically make this decision
      based on anecdotal experiences and expert opinion. No prospective study has been performed to
      date to answer this question in this patient population.

      The null hypothesis of this proposed pilot study is that no difference will be seen with a
      liberal transfusion strategy to keep a patient's hemoglobin above 7 g/dL versus a
      conservative strategy to keep the patient's hemoglobin above 5.5 g/dL in patients
      asymptomatic at rest. The primary outcome of this pilot study will be infection; defined as
      postoperative wound infection (superficial or deep) or other perioperative infection but not
      surgical site (urinary tract infection or pneumonia). Deep infection is defined as the need
      for intravenous antibiotics or a return to surgery for debridement. Superficial infection is
      defined as the use of oral antibiotics only successfully treat a surgical site infection.
      Secondary outcomes will include pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, acute renal
      failure or insufficiency, nonunion, delayed union, compartment syndrome, osteomyelitis, nerve
      palsy, anoxic brain injury, cardiac ischemia or infarct, pancreatitis, or death, and the
      musculoskeletal functional assessment.
