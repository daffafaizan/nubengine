    
      Four parts included in our study:

      Part 1:The research, development and verification of indicators based on biomarkers and
      clinical characteristics to guide the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders

        1. to screen biomarkers, to explore its pathophysiology, and to analyze the correlation
           between clinical subtypes/characteristics and biomarkers.

        2. To differentiate the subtypes of depressive disorder（depression/underload, atypical,
           anxiety/somatization) based on clinical symptoms and clinical assessement.

        3. To establish personalized therapy strategies,and to explore tool kits for diagnosis and
           treatment based on biomarkers and clinical characteristics.

        4. to choose appropriate indicators to monitor therapy and side effect by collecting and
           analyzing blood/imaging/neuropsychological data.

      Part 2: The development,transition and application of hierarchical model diagnostic technique
      for physical diseases combined with depressive disorder.

        1. to recruit patients with physical diseases combined with depressive disorder, and
           explore potential biomarkers.

        2. To chose appropriate therapy strategies based on measurement based care（MBC）, providing
           hierarchical model diagnostic technique for patients.

        3. To weigh therapy efficiency and adverse effect among different medicine therapy groups.

      Part3: The development and application of comprehensive prevention， diagnosis,and
      intervention model of depressive disorder.

        1. To explore and establish online screening and assistant diagnosis system for patients
           with depressive disorder.

        2. research ,development and application of intelligent e-MBC. Part 4: The
           development,transition and application of e-MBC sharing platform.
