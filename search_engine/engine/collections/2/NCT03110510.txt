      in Asia and Latin America. The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree
      within the liver (intrahepatic), the extrahepatic ducts (extrahepatic), or the gallbladder.
      Intrahepatic cancer is steadily increasing in the Western world. BTCs carry a poor prognosis
      with 1-year survival rate of 25%. Although surgery remains the only curative treatment for
      BTC, most patients present with advanced disease and die within a few months of diagnosis.
      While a combination of gemcitabine and platinum agents seems to be a conclusive treatment
      option as first-line treatment until now, the role or the optimal regimen for second-line
      treatment has not been established.

      Few articles about second line treatment in advanced BTC were reported. French group recently
      reported the retrospective analysis of FOLFIRI regimen in advanced BTC patients. However,
      there is no prospective trial of FOLFIRI regimen to evaluate the efficacy and safety in
      advanced BTC patients.

      So we plan this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI regimen as a second line
      treatment in biliary tract cancer.
