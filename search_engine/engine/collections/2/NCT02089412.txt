      will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline (Baseline Period 1), during which each
      subjectï¿½s study eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be conducted.
      During this phase, each eligible subject will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences to
      receive single oral doses of E2006 10 mg under fasted and fed conditions. The Randomization
      Phase will consist of 3 periods: administration of the first randomized dose (Treatment
      Period 1), baseline for the second randomized dose (Baseline Period 2), and administration of
      the second randomized dose (Treatment Period 2).
