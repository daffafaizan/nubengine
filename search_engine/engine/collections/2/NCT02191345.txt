    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the change in stress levels of employees who listen
      to prerecorded guided imagery to employees who take breaks, and to determine if employees are
      likely to adopt prerecorded guided imagery as a self-care tool.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the guided imagery group or the control
      group. Members of the control group will be asked to take a 10 minute break 3 times per week
      for 4 weeks. Members of the guided imagery group will be asked to listen to one prerecorded
      guided imagery track 3 times per week for 4 weeks. All participants will fill out
      questionnaires before and after the 4 week period. All participants will fill out a short
      form before and after listening to each guided imagery, or before and after taking each
      break.

      Phase 2: After phase 1 is complete, all participants will have the option to participate in
      phase 2 of the study. During phase 2, participants will receive a calendar and put a mark on
      every day that they listen to a guided imagery track. At the end of 4 weeks, participants
      will turn in the calendar.
