      Lab, L V Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad and the study protocol will adhere to the tenets of
      the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants will be recruited through advertisements in local
      print media (newspaper), approaching schools, through clinical referrals. Children will be
      assigned to either the control group or intervention group randomly based on
      computer-generated random numbers operated by the investigator. All participants will undergo
      a cycloplegic refractive error assessment after the instillation of tropicamide 1% eye drops
      (or cyclopentolate 1% eye drops in case of varying refractive error between objective and
      subjective values). Axial length and cycloplegic refractive measurements will be taken with
      using Lenstar LS900 biometer and Shin- Nippon autorefractor respectively for scheduled follow
      up and will be compared with the baseline parameters.
