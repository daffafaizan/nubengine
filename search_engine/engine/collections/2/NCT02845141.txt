    
      * Study design: Monocentric, prospective, randomised study. Patients who need revision
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and show a tunnel enlargement of >10mm will have a
      first operation filling the tibial/femoral tunnel either with bone graft substitute
      (Actifuse) or autologous spongiosa.

      5 - 6 months after this first operation a CT will be performed to assess the bony
      consolidation of the former tibial/femoral tunnel. An MRI will be performed to assess
      vitality of the bone substitute.

      An osseous biopsy will be taken from the tibial/femoral tunnel at the revision anterior
      cruciate ligament reconstruction approximately 6 months after bone grafting.

      Clinical evaluation will be performed 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postoperative. At 6
      months postoperative additional radiological evaluation and clinical assessment using the
      SF36 questionnaire will be performed.

        -  Treatment: Either autologous spongiosa or Actifuse (MIS applicator) will be administered
           by the investigator as a bone graft substitute for tunnel enlargement in patients
           undergoing revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

        -  Duration of Participation: The participation of each subject will be approximately 12
           months.

      Each subject will undergo revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction approximately 6
      months after bone grafting. A biopsy will be taken at this operation. A clinical and
      radiological follow up is planned for further 6 months.

      * Subjects: Male and female patients â‰¥ 18 years. Approximately 40 patients who undergo
      revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction will be included in the study.

      Inclusion criteria: Patients in need of revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
      Exclusion criteria: Infection, wound healing complications
