      participate in a 9-month exercise intervention. The exercise program will start with a
      6-month period, where patients participate in a supervised multimodal exercise program twice
      a week supplemented with unsupervised exercises. The multimodal exercise program comprises
      aerobic-, resistance- and balance components. After completing the initial six-month period,
      one supervised session will be replaced by one unsupervised session until month nine.

      Unsupervised exercises will be supported by an activity tracker (FitBit) and an exercise App
      specifically designed for the EFFECT trial. Patients randomized to the control group will
      also receive an activity tracker (like the intervention group). The investigators will advice
      control patients to avoid inactivity and be as physically active as current abilities and
      conditions allow, with the aim to progress towards being physically active for 150min/week in
      line with the current exercise guidelines.
