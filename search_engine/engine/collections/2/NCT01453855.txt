      Screening/Eligibility phase included one screening visit and two eligibility visits. A
      washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit 1. Subjects who
      met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were randomized (1:1) at the
      second eligibility visit. The Treatment phase consisted of three on-therapy visits (Week 2,
      Week 6, and Month 3).
