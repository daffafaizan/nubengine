    
      Open-label, ascending-exposure-time, single center trial in which a total of 36 subjects will
      be enrolled. The time to remove the vitreous will be recorded and a vitreous sample will be
      obtained at the beginning of vitrectomy for determination of ocriplasmin activity; 32
      subjects will receive 125 Î¼g ocriplasmin intravitreal injection prior to vitrectomy and 4
      subjects will not receive ocriplasmin intravitreal injection prior to vitrectomy (control
      arm).

      Study drug will be administered in the mid-vitreous by injection. The study eye will be
      examined after study drug injection to exclude retinal non-perfusion or other complications.
