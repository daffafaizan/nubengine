      laboratory evaluations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, 24-hour telemetry
      monitoring, and physical exams. Specific study withdrawal criteria during washout periods of
      metformin have been established for loss of glycemic control, i.e., glucose monitoring.
      Pharmacokinetic assessments of monotherapy cohort versus add-on therapy will be performed
