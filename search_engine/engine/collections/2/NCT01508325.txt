      To demonstrate that bisoprolol is superior in mean ambulatory heart rate and/or non-inferior
      in mean ambulatory DBP as compared with metoprolol SR in the last 4 hours after 12-week
      active treatment in subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH).

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To compare the efficacy of the 2 study drugs by 24h ambulatory monitoring by several
           parameters at different times (Example: blood pressure, heart rate, their variability,
           etc...) after 12-week treatment from baseline among subjects with mild to moderate EH

        2. To evaluate safety of the two drugs

        3. To evaluate the treatment compliance of the two drugs
