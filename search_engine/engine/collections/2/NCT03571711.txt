      common disease, which is associated with high morbidity, mortality and high costs for the
      investigator's health care system. In addition to age and severity of comorbidities, female
      sex is associated with detrimental outcome. Delayed diagnosis and therapy of SBP may lead to
      a higher mortality in this patient population. Therefore, an early diagnosis and adequate
      anti-infective therapy is essential. Due to the accumulation of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR)
      pathogens, especially in nosocomial SBP, empirical application of broad-spectrum antibiotics
      is recommended in the therapy of SBP.During the use of antibiotic drugs in general,
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets, as the achieved time period over the minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC), should be evaluated to increase drug efficacy and reduce AMR
      development. Pharmacokinetic studies of meropenem concentrations at the infection site in
      this particular group of patients are rare in the literature. Recent studies in critically
      ill patients showed highly variable meropenem concentrations in peritoneal fluid after iv
      administration. The aim of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of meropenem
      during SBP in female and male patients with liver cirrhosis to investigate whether
      pharmacodynamics therapy goals are met.
