      any measures that can be used to treat this illness or reduce its transmission from person to
      person. Povidone-iodine has been shown to have virucidal properties against multiple viruses
      including against the virus that causes SARS which is very similar in makeup to the virus
      causing COVID-19.

      The investigators hypothesize that 4x daily use of oral gargles and nasal rinses using a
      povidone iodine solution will help to reduce the viral load in the nasopharynx and oropharynx
      in patients who are COVID-19+. If this hypothesis is shown to be true this could potentially
      have an impact on time to recovery of clinical symptoms as well as reduce shedding of the
      virus by infected patients. A time course of 7 days was chosen in order to recognize a trend
      in the viral load over time for patients receiving each of the interventions. Chlorhexidine
      gluconate and saline rinses were chosen as additional treatment arms as these are frequently
      used for oral and nasal hygiene and their role in affecting viral load is currently unknown.
