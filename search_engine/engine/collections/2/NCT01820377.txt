      mentoring in an after school physical activity program (AYMP), the investigators are
      evaluating a peer-led approach for diabetes prevention. High school students volunteer as
      mentors, and develop an after-school program that they then deliver to children in grade 4.
      The mentors meet twice a week. The first day, they develop an activity plan and decide roles
      and responsibilities to ensure successful delivery of each activity. The second day, they
      deliver the program to the grade 4s, which incorporates a healthy snack, 45-minutes of
      physical activity, and educational games/activities. Our primary goal is to determine the
      health benefits of AYMP; guided by our youth mentors and community advisors, the
      investigators will also develop a number of research questions that will help us to better
      understand the social, emotional, physical and spiritual outcomes of the peer-led mentor
      program. To answer these questions, the investigators will train community members in both
      qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative outcomes of this study include
      physical activity, waist circumference, obesity rates, and self-esteem. Qualitative methods
      may include photovoice and focus group interviews. All of these will be used to assess the
      social determinants of health and contextual features of the program.
