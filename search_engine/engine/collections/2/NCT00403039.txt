      subjects with macular edema associated with CRVO. Patients will be evaluated at baseline with
      ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and color
      photography. Subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab
      administered every 28 Â± 2 days for a total of 3 injections. Thereafter they are to be
      evaluated every month until month 12. If the patients have signs of increased intraretinal
      hemorrhage or a persistence / increase in central macular edema as determined by optical
      coherence tomography when compared to their last visit, are eligible for re-injection at that
      monthly visit.
