      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nasal, non-inhaled administration of carbon dioxide
      (CO2) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. An estimated 500 patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled into this study at approximately 25 sites to ensure
      that approximately 400 patients are randomized and complete the study.
