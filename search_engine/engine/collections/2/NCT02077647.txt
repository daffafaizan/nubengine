      analysis for the Tomofix Small size study.

      The incidence of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is higher in Japan than in other populations.
      Respective prevalences of 47.0 and 70.2% in men and women for Kellgren-Lawrence Grades 2-4
      knee OA are reported in Japanese patients aged 60 years and over.

      First treatment options are pharmacological (i.e. NSAIDs) and non-pharmacological therapies
      (i.e. use of assistive devices, exercises, osteopathy, physical therapy), followed by
      injections of hyaluronic acid and other substances. If no such therapies are successful,
      surgical treatment options as unicompartmental knee replacement, total knee arthroplasty and
      high tibial osteotomy (HTO) are recognized. The discussion of which is the best therapy is
      still controversial. HTO may decrease the number of complications compared to total knee
      replacement or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and leave the option for later replacement
      surgery.

      In this project, patients are included who would be surgically treated with HTO with Tomofix
      small based on the investigator's assessment but refuse to have surgical treatment. They will
      be treated conservatively and are investigated to serve as reference to an ongoing clinical
      study investigating invasive treatment modalities.
