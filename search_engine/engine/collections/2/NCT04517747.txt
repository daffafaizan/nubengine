    
      This is an interventional, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter single-arm
      pilot study of ramucirumab plus TAS-102 in patients with advanced or metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the stomach or the gastroesophageal junction, after treatment failure on a
      ramucirumab based therapy.

      A total number of 20 patients will be enrolled. Potential study participants will be assessed
      for eligibility during one or several screening visits. The patient has to provide a signed
      informed consent form prior to any study-specific screening evaluations. Once the patient
      provides a signed informed consent form and eligibility is confirmed (all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria have been verified), the patient can be enrolled.

      All screening procedures must be completed during the 14-day screening period. All patients
      must have had disease status confirmed as per CT or MRI scan of the tumor(s) within ≤ 4 weeks
      prior to the first dose. Other screening assessments include blood sampling, performance
      status (ECOG) and ECG according to clinical routine. Study treatment will be continued until
      progression or intolerable toxicity, but for a maximum of 4 months. Further treatment after
      progression will be at the investigator's discretion.

      Tumor assessment will be performed according to clinical routine at screening and every 8
      weeks (±7 days) during the treatment phase of the study and every 12 weeks (±14 days) during
      follow-up.

      The expected duration of the active study phase (FPI - LPO) is 18 months. The active phase
      per individual patient is approximately 6 months.
