        1. to develop a time-and-attention control condition to better assess the direct and
           mediational effect of PSST independent of social support (placebo);

        2. to develop a personal digital assistant hand-held supplement to standard PSST to provide
           real-time training, reinforcement, and on-the-spot documentation of PSST usage;

        3. to develop independent measures of the application of problem-solving strategies in
           everyday life; and

        4. to measure utilization of and satisfaction with other resources accessed by mothers as
           independent indicators of the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of PSST.
