      number of radiographs ordered, while detecting patients with important pathology or injuries.
      The Ottawa Ankle and Knee Rules were developed from a series of studies, and have
      successfully reduced the number of radiographs ordered by physicians without missing serious
      ankle fractures (1-4). Likewise, the NEXUS group developed a clinical decision rule for the
      selection of blunt trauma patients who are appropriate for imaging, based on clinical
      features (5).

      Drs. Hendey and Emond have separately developed similar algorithms for selective radiography
      in patients with a suspected shoulder dislocation (6-10). The goal of the current study is to
      compare and validate the two clinical algorithms.

      Both approaches examine clinical features that are readily accessible to the physician at the
      time of ED evaluation. In the pre-reduction assessment, both algorithms included the
      mechanism of injury and whether the patient had experienced a previous shoulder dislocation.
      Hendey additionally assessed whether the physician was clinically confident of the
      dislocation (8). Emond additionally included the age of the patient, and the presence or
      absence of humeral ecchymosis (9). In the post-reduction assessment, both algorithms
      emphasize the importance of clinical certainty of reduction, as well as the presence of a
      fracture dislocation.
