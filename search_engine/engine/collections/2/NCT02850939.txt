    
      The proposed two-year study involves a 2-group randomized control trial with 3-time
      assessments (baseline, 3 and 6 months) and will enroll 120 breast cancer patients who are
      prescribed EHT and are attending the breast clinic at the Mays Cancer Center (MCC), a
      National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center at the University of Texas Health Science
      Center at San Antonio. The intervention group will receive two components: 1) a bilingual,
      culturally tailored, personalized, interactive mobile app; and 2) support from a patient
      navigator. The control group will receive the usual care and information provided by the
      MCC's breast clinic and pharmacy to patients undergoing oral EHT. The intervention components
      are based in Social Cognitive Theory and elements of Motivational Interviewing.

      The proposed study aims to:

        1. Develop a bilingual, culturally tailored, personalized, interactive mobile application
           (app) to promote and improve EHT adherence among breast cancer patients diagnosed with
           hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The app will empower patients' self-monitoring
           and management, as well as facilitate patient education, early identification and
           reporting of side effects, delivery of self-care advice, and timely feedback through
           direct interaction between the patient and the oncology team when necessary.

        2. Conduct a 2-group randomized controlled study to assess the feasibility and
           effectiveness of a bilingual, culturally tailored, personalized, interactive app +
           patient navigation (PN) to promote EHT adherence compared to usual care among patients
           diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and who are prescribed EHT.
