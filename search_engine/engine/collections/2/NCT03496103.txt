      exposure to ragweed pollen in an Allergen Challenge Chamber (ACC). This single site study of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis was designed to enroll up to 35 participants. These participants
      would be age 18-70, male and female, with a mixture of ethnic groups. The study would involve
      2 phases: Screening and Exposure. In the Exposure phase, participants were exposed to pollen
      for up to 180 minutes. For allergic participants, qualification symptom scores at 120 minutes
      of exposure determined if ACC exposure would be continued.
