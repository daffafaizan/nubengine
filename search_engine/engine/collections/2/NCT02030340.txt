    
      Study design: Patient cohort, acute experiment, mono -center synchronous double urodynamic
      catheter technique study.

      Study population: Adult female patients and male or female patients with spinal cord injury
      or meningomyelocele unable to void, scheduled for urodynamic investigation on the basis of
      contemporary standards and guidelines, because of signs and or symptoms of lower urinary
      tract dysfunction.

      Intervention: Synchronous double catheter urodynamic testing; Standard filling cystometry
      with both air-charged Ã¡nd water filled catheter pairwise inserted, and connected to the
      registry equipment.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Difference of intravesical pressure increment maximum during
      filling cystometry between the two systems.

      Primary hypothesis to test: The average difference as well as the average absolute difference
      of maximum water pressure (standard system) and maximum air pressure (comparator) are both 0
      (zero).

      There is no per-protocol for follow up of the patients.
