    
      Primary objective:

      To evaluate immunogenicity by measuring the seroprotection rate against diphtheria and
      tetanus at 28 days after vaccination with BR-TD-1001 and Td-pur-inj.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate immunogenicity by measuring the geometric mean titer (of diphtheria and
           tetanus antitoxins at 28 days after vaccination with BR-TD-1001 and Td-pur-inj.

        -  To evaluate a boosting response by comparing before and after the administration through
           measurement of diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin titers at 28 days after vaccination with
           BR-TD-1001 and Td-pur-inj.

        -  To evaluate safety by observing solicited local and systemic adverse events that have
           occurred for 7 days after vaccination with BR-TD-1001 and Td-pur-inj.

        -  To evaluate safety by observing unsolicited adverse events that have occurred for 28
           days after vaccination with BR-TD-1001 and Td-pur-inj.
