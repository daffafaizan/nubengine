    
      In order to determine the differences in permeability in IBS-C in comparison with healthy
      volunteers, the following will be determined: differences in in vivo small intestinal and
      colonic permeability, differences in small intestinal and colonic mucosal barrier function,
      differences in effects of fecal supernatants on barrier function of T84 monolayers, and
      differences in novel biomarkers for intestinal permeability
