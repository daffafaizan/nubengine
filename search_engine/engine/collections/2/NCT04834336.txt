    
      The participants will randomly be allocated into two groups: (1) Physical training plus
      inspiratory muscle training, (2) Physical training

      Participants in the physical training plus inspiratory muscle training group will perform
      inspiratory muscle training and physical training. Inspiratory muscle training will be
      applied with an electronic device. Physical training will be implemented as balance,
      mobility, functional strength, endurance exercises. During the hospitalization, the
      inspiratory muscle training will be carried out twice a day with mild to moderate whereas
      physical training will be carried out once a day. The physical training group will perform
      only physical training. Physical training will be implemented as balance, mobility,
      functional strength, endurance exercises. During the hospitalization, physical training will
      be carried out once a day. For the safety and feasibility of inspiratory muscle training,
      data will be collected daily during the hospitalization. For effects of inspiratory muscle
      training, data will be collected at baseline and hospital discharge.
