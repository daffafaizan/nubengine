      for subtrochanteric nonunion between January 2008 and March 2018 in two institutions. The
      cases with infection, large bone defect, pathologic fracture, open fracture, previous surgery
      using plate, and follow-up less than 1 year were excluded. We compared the demographic
      details and radiologic results between patients who underwent the open procedure with BG (BG
      group) and the closed procedure without BG (non-BG group) as a historical control, and risk
      factors for the failure of revision surgery were evaluated.
