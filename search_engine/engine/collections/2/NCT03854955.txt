      patient encounters. Device based scribing services record the patient-physician encounter and
      securely transmit data to an off-site facility where trained professionals transcribe the
      dictations. The information is then sent back to the physician and stored in the providing
      institutions electronic medical records. The objective of the proposed study is to track and
      compare the allocation of physician time and associated quality metrics with and without the
      use of iScribes. We anticipate that the use of iScribes will reduce the amount of physician
      time spent away from the patient (e.g., charting, dictating).
