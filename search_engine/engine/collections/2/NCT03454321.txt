      related to a rotator cuff tendinopathy will be enrolled in the study. After validation of the
      inclusion criteria, the participants will receive oral information about the protocol. Then,
      they will be examined and will undergo X-rays and an ultrasound of their shoulder. Pain
      shoulder and shoulder disability will be assessed before the injection with a visual analogic
      pain scale and the Oxford Shoulder Score questionnaire, respectively.

      The subacromial injection will be performed under ultrasound guidance to accurately inject
      the subacromial bursae. After skin disinfection with povidone, the injection will be
      performed with a 21G needle. The bursae will be injected with 2 ml of lidocaine 2% and 1 ml
      of betamethasone.

      After the procedure, the participants will all receive a standardized physiotherapy.

      For primary outcome, the therapeutic response will be assessed 3 months after the procedure.
      Patients will be considered as having a good response if their level of pain decreases by
      over 30%.

      The number of participants having a good clinical response will be compared between the
      patients presenting a bursitis and those without bursitis. The comparison will be made using
      a Chi-2 test.

      Others parameters will be studied: reduction in pain 6 weeks after the injection, reduction
      in shoulder disability 6 weeks and 3 months after the injection. Other ultrasound lesions
      will be collected so as X-ray features to search other factors associated with the presence
      or absence of a good therapeutic response (details in secondary outcomes).
