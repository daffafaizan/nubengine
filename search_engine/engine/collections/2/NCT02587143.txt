      Basurto in Bilbao, Spain. Patients for whom arterial blood gas analysis had been ordered will
      be included. They will be randomly assigned to receive application of the experimental ethyl
      chloride spray or a placebo aerosol spray of a solution of alcohol in water. The assigned
      spray will be applied just before arterial puncture. The main outcome variable is pain
      intensity reported on an 11-point numeric rating scale.
