    
      This is a phase 1b, open label, uncontrolled, non-randomized dose-escalation study to examine
      the safety of intramuscular autologous transplantation of escalating doses of mesenchymal
      stem cells to patients with no option critical limb ischemia.

      Trial Aims and Objectives: To examine the safety of intramuscular transplantation of
      escalating doses of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to patients with no
      option critical limb ischemia.

      Patient Population: Patients with critical limb ischemia who are not candidates for
      revascularization.

      Trial Setting:HRB Clinical Research Facility Galway and Galway University Hospitals.

      Trial Intervention:Intramuscular delivery of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells to patients with no option critical limb ischemia.

      Study Design: Open label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, dose escalation study. Sample Size: 9
      Method of Participant Assignment:Sequential administration of 3 escalating doses of
      autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

      Examination Points: Day 0, 7, 30, 90, 180, 365 and 730 Primary Outcome: Serious adverse
      events that are attributable to intervention. Secondary Outcomes :Amputation free survival,
      median time to amputation, TcPo2, ABI, pain scale, ulcer healing, quality of life
      assessments, collateral vessel formation detected by MRI at 12 months.
