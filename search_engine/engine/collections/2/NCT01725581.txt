      acquire. However, due to its intimate nature some students are graduating unable to perform
      competent pelvic examinations. At present, evaluation of the medical students competence at
      pelvic examination is done by subjective faculty assessment. This assessment is typically
      performed at the end of the teaching block and is based on the assessors' recollection of the
      students' performance. This kind of assessment has been shown to have poor validity and
      reliability. This is in contrast to objective structured assessments of technical skill
      (OSATS), which use task specific and global rating scales and have been used to evaluate a
      wide range of clinical and surgical skills. However, no studies to date have evaluated an
      assessment tool for pelvic examination. In this study the investigators aim to determine the
      validity and reliability of an OSATS for pelvic examination. In addition, the investigators
      aim to identify factors that influence the scores in OSATS.
