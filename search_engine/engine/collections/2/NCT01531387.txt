      conditional TCD velocities. In addition, studies suggest that patients who were on
      observation alone, converted from conditional TCD (moderate risk category) to an abnormal TCD
      (with a much higher risk for primary stroke) within 30 months of initial identification of
      the conditional TCD velocity; this conversion led to initiation of chronic and indefinite
      transfusions in all cases. Preliminary data suggests that the risk of conversion to abnormal
      TCD velocities will be lower for subjects with conditional TCD velocities on hydroxyurea by
      at least three-fold. This important difference in conversion risk rate suggests that an
      alternative treatment could have a substantial and beneficial impact on patients with
      elevated TCD velocities.

      An alternative treatment could protect the brain of patients with SCA and conditional TCD
      velocities who are at increased risk for stroke. The avoidance of chronic blood transfusions
      would be a great benefit for all children with sickle cell disease, especially those in
      developing countries where the blood supply may be less safe (in comparison with that in the
      US) or unavailable, and very costly.
