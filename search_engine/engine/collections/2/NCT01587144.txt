      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucanthone administered as an adjunct to

      patients will be randomized to lucanthone or placebo arm in ratio of 1:1. The treatment
      period will be in two phases ; an initial six weeks of concomitant therapy with temozolomide
      and radiation, followed by a maintenance phase of six cycles of temozolomide given on Days 1

      concomitant and maintenance phases.
