    
      This is a single arm pilot study of peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) with ex vivo
      TCRαβ+ T cell and CD19+ B cell depletion of URD grafts using the CliniMACS device in patients
      with SCD and BTM. Apart from CliniMACS-based cell processing, PSCT will be performed
      according to current standards of care in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Cell
      Therapy and Transplant Section, including the use of a standard chemotherapy conditioning
      regimen and standard follow-up laboratory assessments. The study will determine efficacy of
      this strategy in terms of engraftment, rates of acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease
      (GvHD), and one-year overall and event-free survival.
