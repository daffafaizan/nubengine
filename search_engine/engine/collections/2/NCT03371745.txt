      of care:

      Group 1: PGS-FET group: deferred transfer of day 5/6/7 (blastocyst stage) embryos
      cryopreserved following trophectoderm biopsy Group 2: "freeze-only" (FET) group: deferred
      transfer of frozen/thawed embryos without biopsy Group 3: "fresh" ET group: immediate
      transfer of "fresh" embryos in the stimulation cycle.

      1539 eligible couples will be recruited to participate. Couples will be randomized at
      retrieval to undergo cryopreservation with deferred embryo transfer, with or without PGS, or
      fresh embryo transfer during the cycle of egg retrieval. Number of embryos to transfer will
      be based on clinical estimation of embryo quality and will not exceed ASRM guidelines for
      embryo transfer number including newly revised guidelines. We are aware that the number of
      embryos transferred, to maintain enrollment, may not be equivalent, with likely more embryos
      transferred in patients not having PGS. The primary outcome of live birth/retrieval, with a
      secondary outcome of healthy singleton birth, may reflect the true benefit of PGS.
