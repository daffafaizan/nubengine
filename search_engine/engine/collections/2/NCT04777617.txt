      with type 1 diabetes and kidney failure. Limited biomarkers are utilized to monitor the
      health of the allografts. For kidney transplantation serum creatinine remains the most
      commonly monitored biomarker; for the pancreas allograft blood glucose and serum amylase and
      lipase are measured. However, these biomarkers are imprecise and non-specific for rejection.

      In kidney transplantation cell free donor derived DNA at of value of >1% has emerged as an
      effective immune monitoring tool as a marker for renal allograft rejection and injury. Thus
      far, a discriminatory donor derived cell free DNA value for a stable and rejecting allografts
      has not been established for recipients of combined kidney-pancreas transplants.

      Study aim will be to help establish a normal range of donor derived cell free DNA in stable
      kidney-pancreas graft function in combined kidney pancreas transplant recipients while
      determining changes in cell free DNA in kidney-pancreas recipients with biopsy proven
      allograft rejection.
