    
      -  Adult patients admitted to our Acute Pain Service for intractable pain will be eligible
           if they are affected by PAOD at stages III and IV of Lèriche-Fontaine classification,
           and are opioid-naïve.

        -  Patients enrolled will be randomized to the control group, treated with standard
           therapy, consisting of an oral administration of oxycodone 5 mg and pregabalin 25 mg per
           day plus placebo (fructose 10 g) twice a day for two weeks, or to the experimental
           group, treated with magnesium oxide 300 mg twice a day.

        -  Randomization will be computer-generated, with allocation concealment obtained using
           opaque, sequentially numbered and sealed envelopes. Trials participants, care providers,
           data collectors, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to treatment
           allocation.

        -  Patients will be evaluated on the day of hospital admission (day 0) and on days 2, 4, 6,
           8, 12, and 14 with the following information being collected: daily oxycodone dose
           received; patient's perceived average and maximum pain using the Numerical Rating Scale
           (NRS: 0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain); pain relief using Pain Relief Scale (PRS: 0%
           no pain relief to 100% complete pain relief); characteristics of the pain, using the
           Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS: 10 items); impact of pain on the patient's daily
           activities, using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; 9 items).

        -  A sample size calculation performed for the primary outcome showed that 150 patients (75
           per group) are needed to achieve 90% power to detect a minimum reduction of 30% in
           oxycodone dosage in the experimental group, after allowing for a drop-out rate of around
           20%.

        -  Ethical approval of the study protocol has been obtained from Comitato Etico Provinciale
           di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.
