      will consume the favourable and unfavourable conditions (each containing three meals) on
      separate days following a crossover, randomised, couterbalanced design. The primary dependent
      variable is cognitive function, whilst secondary measures include glucose and mood. It is
      hypothesised that the favourable meal profile will be associated with cognitive and
      physiological benefits relative to the unfavourable meal profile.
