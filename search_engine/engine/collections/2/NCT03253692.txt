      diagnose heart disease; however, it is associated with radiation exposure. Several
      technological advances in both scanner hardware and software are now available to reduce the
      radiation exposure to patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the worldwide usage
      of these radiation dose saving strategies in daily practice and analyze their effect on image
      quality.
