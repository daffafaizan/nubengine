      lenvatinib in previously treated participants with AJCC unresectable Stage III or Stage IV
      melanoma and disease progression. Cohort 1 enrolled participants not harboring the V600E BRAF
      mutation with disease progression following up to 2 prior systemic anticancer regimens
      (excluding anti-VEGF) for unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, and is referred to as
      Cohort 1 or V600E BRAF negative. Other less common BRAF activating mutations were allowed as
      long as the participant did not receive a BRAF-targeted therapy. Cohort 2 enrolled
      participants harboring the activating BRAF mutations (mainly the V600E mutation) with disease
      progression following BRAF V600E-targeted therapy, and is referred to as Cohort 2 or V600E
      BRAF positive. Eligible participants had measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.
