        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of response rate, in patients with advanced or recurrent
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with rebeccamycin analogue via 1 infusion vs 5 daily
           infusions every 3 weeks.

        -  Compare the response duration in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity profiles of these two regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment for
           both arms repeats every 3 weeks for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-64 patients (18-32 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      at a rate of 3-4 patients per month.
