      parallel design study will be conducted in healthy participants with a propensity for
      extrinsic dental stain (based on the judgement of the examiner) on the facial surfaces of the
      anterior teeth. This study will be used to evaluate and compare the extrinsic dental stain
      and plaque removal of an experimental low abrasivity 0.5% spherical silica dentifrice and a
      marketed low abrasivity 6% standard silica abrasive dentifrice, and an experimental moderate
      abrasivity 1% spherical silica / 5% STP dentifrice and a marketed high abrasivity 16%
      standard abrasive silica / 5% STP dentifrice. Stain will be assessed using an established
      clinical measure of extrinsic dental stain - the MacPherson modification of the Lobene stain
      index (MLSI). Particpants will be stratified by baseline MLSI score (total MLSI (area [A] Ã—
      intensity [I]) for the facial surfaces of the 4 anterior assessment teeth). Plaque will be
      assessed using an established clinical measure of plaque - the Turesky Modification of the
      Quigley Hein Index. Stain and plaque will be assessed at intervals over an 8 week treatment
      period. Plaque will be assessed at baseline and Week 8 only.
