      four group: the eye patch group, the Dexmedetomidine(DEX) group, the eye patch+DEX group and
      the usual group. The sleep quality would be evaluated by the EEG monitor and the metabolic
      level, the inflammation and nutrition status would be detected. The research aims to confirm
      that the sleep quality could have a great influence on patients in the ICU and different
      interventions would make various changes.
