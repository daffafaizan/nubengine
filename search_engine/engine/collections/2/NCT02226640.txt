      (over 1 in 10 of all US adults over 20). Diabetes is diagnosed based on fasting
      hyperglycemia, oral glucose intolerance or markers of hyperglycemia such as HbA1c. However,
      we now recognize that diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder. With the existing overly
      simplistic diagnostic criteria, treatment failure rates are high for virtually every agent
      currently in the drug arsenal - including insulin. In the late 1990's oncologists pioneered
      the use of high-throughput molecular technologies, such as transcriptome profiling and more
      recently metabolomics to identify discrete sub-classes of cancers that cannot be
      distinguished histologically or by a small number of biochemical markers. That effort rapidly
      accelerated the pace of scientific discovery and quickly led to the development of
      personalized cancer therapeutics. We believe that those cancer efforts provide a roadmap for
      biomarker discovery and personalized therapy in diabetes. molecular phenotyping (profiling
      the metabolome, transcriptome, and epigenome) with advanced bioinformatics analysis will
      identify discrete subtypes of diabetes - ushering in a new era of personalized diagnosis and
      therapy in diabetes.
