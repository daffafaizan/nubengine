      SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The spread of the disease quickly developed to the global pandemic in
      March-April 2020, and was characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in
      10-15% of cases, which leads to a high frequency of hospitalization in the intensive care
      unit and high mortality. The search for effective treatment and reducing the severity of
      COVID-19 is a priority in the development of medical science.

      One of the key processes of the innate immune system are neutrophil extracellular traps
      (NET), formed by neutrophils when they eject their DNA from the cytoplasm. NET is most often
      described as a mechanism for capturing bacteria in order to limit their spread. In addition,
      NET also plays a role in antiviral immunity. In particular, viral infections lung damage is
      at least partially due to NET.

      This suggests that drug disruption of NET in COVID-19 is promising. DNase preparations, and
      in particular TigeraseÂ®, are safe and effective for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and can
      serve as a NET destruction agent in patient with COVID-19.
