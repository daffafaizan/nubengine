      immunosuppression regimens on renal function. Patients receiving the standard combination of
      prednisone and high-dose tacrolimus, a drug with known nephrotoxicity (Arm A) will be
      compared to patients receiving prednisone, low-dose tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF) (Arm B). MMF is an immunosuppression agent that has no associated nephrotoxicity. The
      primary end point of the study will be renal function as measured by glomerular filtration
      rate (GFR). Thirty pediatric liver transplant recipients will be randomized to these two arms
      in a 1:1 ratio (i.e. 15 patients in each group). Secondary end points will measure patient
      and graft outcome and incidence of immunosuppression-related complications, including:
      neurotoxicity, diabetes mellitus, growth retardation, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal
      hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, acute or chronic liver graft rejection,
      posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), viral infections, fungal infections and
      bacterial infections.
