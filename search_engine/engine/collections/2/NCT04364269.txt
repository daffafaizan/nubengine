      About 36 participants (adults and adolescents) are expected to take part in this study at a
      number of different institutions internationally.

      Adult Participants (Cohort I) will be randomized to receive either VIT-2763 once daily (QD)
      or twice daily (BID) or placebo, at a dose of 120 mg or 60mg depending on their body weight.
      Following cohort I review, adolescent participants (Cohort II) will be randomized to the same
      study arms with the same interventions.

      The study medication will be given as oral capsules, containing 60 mg of VIT-2763 or placebo.
