      program designed to promote healthy feeding practices and diet in socially disadvantaged
      pregnant women and their families. It first seeks to build knowledge, skills and social
      support regarding maternal diet and feeding practices (with a focus on breastfeeding and
      complementary feeding), within the frame of the French Nutrition and Health Program
      (Programme National Nutrition Sant√©, PNNS) while accounting for the cultural background and
      barriers of the targeted population (component 1). It also involves fresh fruit and vegetable
      baskets being made available at a reduced price from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to when
      the toddler is aged 24 months (component 2), along with the provision of follow-on formula
      and baby food vouchers from 6 to 24 months (component 3). The intervention group (n=400) will
      benefit from these 3 program components. The control group (n=400) will receive usual care,
      restricted to general information on healthy eating provided by the food guides of the PNNS.
      The ECAIL study will assess the program's effectiveness on diet and growth in the first 2
      years of life.
