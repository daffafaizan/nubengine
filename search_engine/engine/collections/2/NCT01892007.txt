      better hearing ear (as defined by audiometric hearing thresholds). Yet, it is becoming
      increasingly clear that the challenges faced by older listeners cannot be explained by the
      audiogram. The ability for people with hearing loss to use cognition to support context
      allows for compensation of degraded auditory input, which in turn offers promise for new
      cognitive-based rehabilitative interventions. Working memory is known to be highly associated
      with language and recent evidence has shown significant generalisation of on-task learning
      from Cogmed working memory training to improvements in sentence-repetition skills of children
      with severe to profound hearing loss and use cochlear implants. This evidence offers support
      for further investigation into the potential benefits of working memory training to improve
      speech perception abilities in other hearing impaired populations. This study aims to assess
      whether Cogmed (adaptive) working memory training improves the listening abilities of adults
      with mild to moderate hearing loss as assessed using untrained measurers of cognition, speech
      perception and self-reported hearing ability, compared with an active control (Cogmed,
      non-adaptive) group. A 6 month follow-up will assess retention of any training-related
      improvements in outcomes for the adaptive training group.
