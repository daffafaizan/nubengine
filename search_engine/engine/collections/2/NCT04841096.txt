      of action, with fasting and postprandial effects, may be required to achieve and maintain
      clinically acceptable glycemic control in some patients. A fixed combination of two or more
      therapeutic agents with complementary mechanisms of action makes it possible to optimize
      compliance and adherence to treatment among patients with T2D because it is administered once
      a day with the same efficacy of the separate components, but with fewer gastrointestinal
      effects. This is reflected in a reduction in HA1c and a lower evolution to long-term
      complications of T2D. Phase IIIb, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, prospective study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a daily fixed-dose combination of glimepiride /
      vildagliptin / metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes with a history of dual treatment
      failure and combined or individual oral antidiabetics with SGLT2 / Metformin, Biguanide /
      Sulfonylurea, Sulfonylurea / iDPP4 or Biguanide / iDPP4.
