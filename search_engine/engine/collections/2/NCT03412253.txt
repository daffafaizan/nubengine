      Single-anastomosis gastric bypass (SAGB) was shown to be effective in obese patients in terms
      of weight reduction and T2DM remission, yet its effect on non-obese diabetics is not
      extensively studied. In this study, we tried to determine the anthropometric and glycemic
      outcomes of SAGB as a proposed line of treatment for type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      patients with body mass index (BMI) 25-30 kg/m2.

      Methods: From November 2013 to March 2016, a prospective study has been conducted at
      Ain-Shams University hospitals on 17 consecutive patients undergone SAGB. The demographic and
      anthropometric data of the patients, as well as their relevant laboratory results, were
      reported, other data including anti-diabetic medications, co-morbid metabolic diseases were
      also assessed. All patients were scheduled for laparoscopic SAGB and were advised to come in
      regular follow up at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months postoperatively. T2DM Remission is considered
      if glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <6.5 % and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 126 mg/dl for at
      least 1 year without medication.
