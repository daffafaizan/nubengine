      the time they are orally intubated in the ICU to: 1) investigate tongue weakness and other
      pathophysiological aspects of dysphagia, and 2) evaluate, in a Phase II clinical trial, a
      novel, multimodal, sensorimotor intervention conducted during intubation to reduce or prevent
      dysphagia after extubation. Patients who are expected to be intubated with mechanical
      ventilation for >96 hours will be consecutively enrolled shortly after intubation. Laryngeal
      function, tongue strength, swallowing pathophysiology, and breathing-swallowing coordination
      will be evaluated with valid and reliable standardized measures. While orally intubated,
      patients in the treatment group will receive a novel, early, sensorimotor intervention for
      60-minutes daily, 5 times per week, targeting improved swallowing physiology and kinematics
      to reduce aspiration and dysphagia. These daily sessions will continue until the completion
      of a modified barium swallow study conducted within approximately 2 days after extubation,
      and thereafter standard clinical care will resume. Patients in the control group will receive
      standard clinical care during intubation and throughout their hospital stay. All patients
      will be followed to hospital discharge to determine the pathophysiological and clinical
      impact of the proposed intervention. Knowledge from this study will provide important data
      for this novel intervention and provide a critical foundation for understanding the
      physiological mechanisms of dysphagia and aspiration after intubation in patients with acute
      respiratory failure. With success, this investigation will help shift clinical practice
      patterns to consider early intervention with the goal of reducing the frequency and severity
      of swallowing impairment leading to aspiration and additional medical complications.
