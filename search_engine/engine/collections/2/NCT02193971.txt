    
      About 3400 patients derived from a population of Korean patients with acute coronary syndrome
      receiving percutaneous coronary intervention will be enrolled in the present trial.

      All patients will receive a loading dose of aspirin (300 mg) and prasugrel (60 mg bolus) will
      be administered. Sixty-mg-loading dose of prasugrel will be given regardless of pretreated
      antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or cilostazol). However, in patients who
      already loaded with other antiplatelet agents (clopidigrel, ticagrelor, or cilostazol),
      reduced dose (30mg) or omission of prasugrel loading is acceptable. Following angiography,
      patients with significant diameter stenosis >50% of coronary artery or graft vessel by visual
      estimation that have documented myocardial ischemia or symptoms of angina, and have lesions
      that are eligible for coronary intervention without any exclusion criteria, will be
      randomized 1:1 to either receive either BS-DES or BD-DES group.

      At 1-month clinical follow-up, patients eligible for antiplatelet comparison will be
      additionally randomized 1:1 to either receive the reduce dose of prasugrel (5 mg daily) or
      conventional dose (10 mg daily). The exclusion criteria (age â‰¥75 years, body weight <60 kg,
      or history of TIA or stroke) is classified as observational cohort. Post-PCI, dual
      antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 1 year. Follow-up data will be collected
      until 3-year after index procedure.
