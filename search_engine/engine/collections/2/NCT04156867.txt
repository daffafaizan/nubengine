      system(Dynesys) on treatment of single-segmental lumbar disc herniation(LDH) versus simple
      discectomy. 128 patients with single-segmental LDH were randomly divided into discectomy with
      Dynesys group(group A) and simple discectomy group(group B). Both groups were evaluated by
      Visual Analogue Score(VAS), Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), radiological evidence of
      intervertebral height and range of motion(ROM) of the treated segment at pre- and
      post-operation. Operation duration and blood loss was recorded. The clinical outcomes and
      complications were evaluated afterwards. All patients received a 2-year follow-up.
