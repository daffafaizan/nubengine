      to receive either PASERÂ®, an approved delayed-release oral formulation of 4-aminosalicylic
      acid, in doses of 50 milligrams per kilogram three times daily for 2 weeks followed by 50
      milligrams per kilogram twice daily for 2 weeks, or an identical-appearing placebo
      preparation.

      Patients will be required to maintain a daily diary and to return at 2 weeks for blood and
      stool tests. At the four week mark, patients will return for clinical evaluation, global
      assessment of disease activity and change in disease activity, as well as additional
      laboratory tests.
