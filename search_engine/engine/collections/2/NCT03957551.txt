      the Phase 1b portion of the study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of
      cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable melanoma and
      assess the safety and tolerability of the combined treatments. The objective of the Phase 2
      portion of the study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the established dose of
      cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by best overall response rate
      (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) with the combination of agents in
      patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.
