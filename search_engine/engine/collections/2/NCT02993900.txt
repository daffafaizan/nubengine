      improve tumor and normal tissue volume delineation, reducing toxicity and recurrence in
      gynecologic brachytherapy. The Investigators will compare dosimetric values to the organs at
      risk (OAR) with CT versus MRI planning. The Investigators anticipate that MR-planned cases
      will have lower OAR doses than standard CT-based cases due to more conformal planning. The
      Investigators will determine dose thresholds for radiation-related toxicity after treatment.
      The Investigators will compare toxicity rates at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after treatment,
      thereby enabling improved recommendations on dose limits to the OAR.
