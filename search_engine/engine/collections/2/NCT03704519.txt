      flow during single-dose treatment with darolutamide or enzalutamide as compared to placebo
      using voxel-wise quantification of the grey matter for the entire brain.

      The secondary objective was to investigate drug-induced changes in regional cerebral blood
      flow in brain areas related to cognitive function after single-dose treatment.
