      development of obesity. The stomach signals satiation in response to calories and volume
      ingested, playing a role in control of calorie intake. It is unclear whether the approved
      appetite reducing drug sibutramine alters gastric physiology. Genetic variations are
      potentially key to inter-individual differences in responses to treatment with the appetite
      suppressant sibutramine.

      Aims: 1. To compare gastric functions in healthy, overweight and obese individuals. 2. To
      evaluate effects of sibutramine on gastric functions and weight in patients who are
      overweight or obese. 3. To obtain preliminary data on the effect of genetic variation on
      responses to sibutramine.

      Methods: We shall measure gastric emptying, fasting and postprandial gastric volumes (using
      validated, non-invasive imaging methods), postprandial satiation and satiety, and integrated
      plasma ghrelin, leptin, insulin, GLP-1 and peptide YY levels before and after 12 weeks of
      sibutramine 15mg vs. placebo. We shall also collect DNA, to eventually study effects of
      candidate genes on response to sibutramine.

      Significance: Our study will provide the first evidence of the effects of sibutramine on
      gastric function.
