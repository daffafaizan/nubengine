      inhalation of 0.4M of citric acid solution using the ultrasonic nebulizer (MO-03 Norditalia
      Elettromedicali). The face mask would be connected with the spirometer and the nebulizer via
      a bidirectional valve in order to measure Peak of Cough Expiratory Flow (PCEF) of the RC.
      Secondly, it would be assessed parameters of the weaning protocol in order to verify the
      feasible of removing the tracheostomy cannula. Hence, if the previous assessments are
      positive, the cannula 's patients would be removed. The follow-up would be taken after 96
      hours from the decannulation in order to verify the outcome of weaning.

      In this study, it would be recruited a number of 30 consecutive patients admitted to IRCCS
      Ospedale San Camillo. The data would be firstly analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in
      order to verify the distribution. Secondly it would be chosen to t-test for parametric
      outcomes or Wilcoxon non parametric outcomes. Thirdly, the correlation between the Peak of
      Cough Expiratory Flow of the RC and the weaning outcome would be completed using Pearson Test
      (parametric) or Spearman test (non parametric).
