      precipitated by major stress. The researchers have shown that recovery is more protracted
      than previously appreciated, and is associated with persistent major morbidity and a
      long-term heart failure phenotype. In the absence of any effective therapeutic options, the
      researchers propose a mechanistic three-arm pilot feasibility trial of early rehabilitation
      (standardised physical exercise training or cognitive behavioural therapy) versus current
      standard of care in patients who suffered a very recent episode of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
      The primary end-point will be the restoration of cardiac energetic status assessed by
      31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the secondary end-points of cortisol awakening
      response, global longitudinal strain by echocardiography and the 6-minute walk test. If
      successful, this has the potential for rapid implementation into a large randomised clinical
      trial.
