      sensitivity of Colvera to detect recurrent colorectal cancer confirmed by radiology imaging
      (CT) with CEA sensitivity in paired testing. Blood is collected for assay of methylated BCAT1
      and IKZF1 DNA and CEA, from subjects who have undergone curative treatment for primary CRC of
      stages II and III (AJCC) and who are in remission (No evidence of disease). Subjects will
      have recently (within 4 weeks of blood collection) had follow-up radiological imaging as part
      of their surveillance program for recurrence. Participation is for one visit only as part of
      each subject's surveillance-monitoring schedule. Two PAXgene blood tubes (minimum 10 mL,
      maximum 20 mL) will be collected. Any evidence of methylated BCAT1 and/or IKZF1 DNA in blood
      represents a Colvera "positive" result. CEA levels of 5ug/L or higher will represent a
      "positive" result. Sensitivity and specificity of the Colvera and CEA test will be estimated
      and compared in a paired fashion in each case where recurrence status has been investigated
      and determined by the site clinical management team. Blood testing shall be performed and
      analyzed by qualified staff blinded to clinical status. This is a cross-sectional
      observational non-significant risk study, and test results will not be used for clinical
      management, i.e. there will be no interventions in subjects consenting to participate in this
      Research Study.
