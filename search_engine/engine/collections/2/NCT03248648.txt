      associated with postoperative pain. Intraarticular (IA) local anesthetics (LA) are often used
      for prevention of pain after arthroscopic knee surgery; however, the degree of postoperative
      pain varies. In an effort to find the ideal regime for sufficient, long-lasting postoperative
      analgesia, many different drugs, including opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      ketamine, clonidine, and neostigmine, have been added to the IA LAs The investigators
      designed this study to compare the efficacy of intra-articular administration of neostigmine
      versus ketamine as adjuvant analgesics after knee arthroscopy.
