      flow. Renal perfusion measurement is an important tool to analyze renal function and to
      detect acute kidney injury. The perfusion measurement is based on two data acquisitions, one
      with a global inversion prepulse followed by one with a slice selective prepulse (FAIR). The
      prepulses lead to a labeling of blood water spins. In contrast to the global inversion
      prepulse, the slice selective inversion prepulse only labels the blood water spins inside the
      kidney but not the inflowing blood water spins. Subtraction of both images therefore reflects
      the local perfusion. A third image without the FAIR preparation pulse is measured to
      normalize the signal intensifiers on each patients.

      MRI based arterial spin labeling is a noninvasive assessment not using contrast agents to
      measure the functional parameters of the kidney. This is avoiding serious complications such
      as acute kidney failure and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. There is no known negative impact
      to the patient. In addition we now want to analyze the validity of this MRI-technique by
      provoking acutely changes of renal plasma flow. As a further provocative maneuver we selected
      the cold pressor test as a physiological stress test. Forehead cooling activates the
      sympathetic nervous system and increases blood pressure and heart rate by causing pain. This
      mechanism has got an impact on renal haemodynamics. To minimize the possible cold injuries we
      use the 1Â°C ice water pack only for 60 seconds and avoid the contact to the eyes.

      In this study we want to compare the accuracy of two methods to measure renal perfusion by
      MRI spin labelling technique: the first measurement done with the 1.5 T MRI versus the second
      one obtained with the 3.0 T MRI (Siemens MRI device).
