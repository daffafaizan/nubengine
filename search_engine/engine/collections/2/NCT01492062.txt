      pancreas. An artificial pancreas uses a program which takes information from a continuous
      blood glucose monitor and uses that information to tell an insulin infusion pump how much
      insulin to deliver. The primary purpose of this study is to gain experience with insulin
      delivery algorithms or programs program (algorithm) provides the best regulation of glucose
      levels so that there are no severe low blood glucose reactions and blood glucose levels are
      generally between 70 to 180 mg/dl. If the system is working properly, you would not need to
      enter the amount of food you were eating, give an insulin bolus, or change your basal rates
      while wearing the device. You would need to periodically check to be sure the continuous
      glucose sensor was functioning properly and you would need to respond to alarms that might
      occur if your blood glucose was too high, too low, or the glucose sensor or pump were not
      working well. In addition to this the investigators will also gain experience with insulin
      delivery algorithms to minimize the number of glucose readings which are above or below
      target. It is our intention to modify the algorithms during these studies.

      In this study the investigators plan to use a commercially available insulin infusion pump
      (OmniPod) to deliver lispro (Humalog) insulin. The investigators will use Navigator
      continuous glucose sensors both to monitor glucose levels (sensor 1) and provide the glucose
      concentration for the closed loop algorithm (sensor 2). The signal from the second Navigator
      will be sent by serial cable to a computer which will be at the patient's bedside. A control
      algorithm will reside on the computer, and the amount of insulin to be delivered will be
      transmitted to the OmniPod Personal Device Manager which will then send a radiofrequency (rf)
      signal to the Omnipod pump residing on the subject. A health care provider will be in
      attendance and monitoring discrete blood glucose levels (YSI, GlucoScout, or HemoCue
      measurements) at least every 30 minutes. While the Navigator and Omnipod are commercially
      available they will be used in this study as part of an investigational system while you are
      in the hospital, an investigational system is one that is not approved for use by the FDA.
