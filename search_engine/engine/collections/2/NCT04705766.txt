      COVID19-negative and COVID19-positive adults for episodes of kidney injury over a 12-months
      period. Study candidates will be identified via site-specific electronic medical records
      (EMR) at seven academic medical centers in the U.S. within 4 weeks of a PCR-based test for
      SARS-Cov2. Screen-positive individuals will be contacted by email or text and invited to
      complete an online consent form documenting their willingness to participate. Participation
      will involve completion of questionnaires and return of urine samples in mailed collection
      kits at 2, 6, and 12 months after their date of PCR test. The primary endpoint will be the
      urine-based KIT Score, based on the composite measurement of multiple DNA, protein and
      metabolite urinary biomarkers (reference). Secondary endpoints include NGAL and KIM-1 urinary
      biomarkers for kidney injury assessment.

      Early detection of new or worsening kidney injury is urgently needed in order to implement
      preventative measures and target therapeutics that can minimize excess post-COVID19 kidney
      damage. A complete and standardized understanding of the trajectory and risk factors for
      kidney injury associated with COVID19+ disease is critical to informing the design and
      implementation of preventative and therapeutic strategies for COVID19-mediated kidney injury.
