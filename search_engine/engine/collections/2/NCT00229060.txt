      multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study of doripenem versus comparator
      antibiotic to assess the effectiveness and safety of doripenem in the treatment of
      complicated intra-abdominal infections in hospitalized adults. Doripenem or comparator is
      administered. The primary endpoint is the clinical response measured at late follow-up visit.
      The patients will receive either doripenem or comparator; treatment duration is 5 to 14 days.
