    
      This is a Phase 3, prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm, comparative
      study. Subjects who sign informed consent will undergo study-specific screening assessments
      within 45 days from the day of informed consent.

      Eligible study subjects will be randomized to receive either an HAV or AVF. The randomization
      will be stratified by upper arm or forearm placement based on the investigator's
      determination of where the study access (SA) should be located. Subjects will be followed to
      24 months post SA creation at routine study visits regardless of patency status. After 24
      months, AVF subjects with a patent SA will be followed (while the SA remains patent) for up
      to 5 years (60 months) post SA creation at routine study visits. After 24 months, HAV
      subjects will be followed (regardless of SA patency) for 5 years (60 months) post SA creation
      at routine study visits.
