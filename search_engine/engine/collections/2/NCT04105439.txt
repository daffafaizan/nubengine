      systems and characterized by recurrent attacks, oral and/or genital aphthous ulcers, skin
      lesions, and inflammatory ocular findings. It was first described in 1937 by the Turkish
      dermatologist Hulusi Behçet.[1-3]

      Although with an unclear pathogenesis, BD is considered a type of vasculitis triggered by
      immunological mechanisms. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are reported in
      patients with BD. In the afflicted organs, a remarkable infiltration of neutrophils and
      lymphocytes can be seen.[4-6]

      Diagnosis of BD is mainly clinical, on the association of symptoms, but
      diagnosis/classification criteria may help. Various sets of criteria were created for BD
      diagnosis and the recent one is the international criteria for Behçet's disease (ICBD) that
      was created by 27 countries in 2006 and revised in2014.[7]

      There is no standard laboratory marker for the diagnosis and follow-up of BD. certain
      cytokines and increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are considered as markers of
      disease activity.[8] Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a potential
      new biomarker, is a soluble form of the membrane-bound receptors expressed from and
      comprising mainly of various immune cells (monocytes, neutrophils, activated T lymphocytes,
      macrophages, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells and even tumor cells. [9]
      Numerous studies on various inflammatory diseases, cancer, tuberculosis, central nervous
      system infections, sepsis, liver fibrosis and inflammatory bowel disease have shown increased
      systemic levels of suPAR. In these diseases, suPAR systemic levels are shown to have a
      prognostic value in determining disease severity.[10]
