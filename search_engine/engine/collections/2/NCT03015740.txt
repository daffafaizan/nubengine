      I. To determine the toxicities (defined as a grade 3 or 4 National Cancer Institute [NCI]
      non-hematologic or hematologic adverse event, within 12 weeks from treatment initiation), and
      efficacy (defined as achieving complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease
      within 6 weeks) of sitravatinib (MGCD516) when administered orally (PO) daily in combination
      with standard dose nivolumab 240 mg/kg every 2 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) times, objective
      response rates (ORR), and quality of life (QOL) of patients with advanced clear cell renal
      cell cancer (RCC) treated with the combination of MGCD516 and nivolumab.

      II. Evaluate potential biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment response,
      including genetic analysis, serum cytokines and chemokines, as well as tumor antigen-specific
      immune responses, such as antibody and T cell responses, as surrogates for anti-tumor
      activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sitravatinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and receive nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 starting cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 14 days for
      cycles 1-6 and then every 28 days for subsequent cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who receive at least 6 infusions of nivolumab with no dose
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) related to nivolumab, may then receive nivolumab every 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.
