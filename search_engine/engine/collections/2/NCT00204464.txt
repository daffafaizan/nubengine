      are to determine variability, describe trends over a 6-month time frame and to estimate
      differences between individuals with ALS who perform an upper and lower extremity
      strengthening program three times per week and a control group of individuals with ALS with
      respect to the following outcomes:

        1. an increase in muscle strength (maximum voluntary isometric contraction) as measured by
           quantitative muscle testing.

        2. an increase in functional activities as measured by The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
           Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS)7 and the Schwab and England Rating Scale (SERS).

        3. a decrease in fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale.

        4. an increase in quality of life as measured by the SF-36.Subjects will be randomized into
           two groups - experimental and control. Subjects in the control group will perform a
           daily stretching exercise program for a period of six months. Subjects in the
           experimental groups will perform a strengthening exercise program three times per week
           for a period of six months. All subjects will be evaluated at baseline and then monthly
           using the following outcome measures: (1) maximum voluntary isometric contraction; (2)
           Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale; (3) Schwab and England Rating
           Scale; (3) Fatigue Severity Scale; (4) forced vital capacity; and, (5) the SF-36.
