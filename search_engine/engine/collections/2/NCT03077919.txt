    
      Study intervention will be administered at week 0 and at week 2. Injections will be performed
      under ultrasound visualization. The study medication will be either 7-10 mL 0.5% ropivacaine
      injected ventral to the right longus coli muscle (around and into the ventral fascia) and
      into the longus coli immediately dorsal to the presumed ventral fascia at the level of the C6
      anterior tubercle (landmarks for the stellate ganglion) (active study medication) or 1-2 mL
      preservative free normal saline injected anterolateral to the anterior tubercle of C6 (sham
      procedure). The participant will not be informed which treatment he or she has received and
      the interaction of the participant and treating physician will be scripted as much as
      possible. Following the intervention, the treating physician should have no further contact
      with the participant except as required for participant safety.

      Participants will be evaluated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology prior
      to week 0 and at 8 weeks using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5)
      Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5). They will complete the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5
      (PCL-5), the PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C), and the Mini-international
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.-Plus) Suicidality Items at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks; they
      also will complete the M.I.N.I.-Plus items at screening. The 12 item short form survey
      (SF-12), generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9),
      K6, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C/AUDIT), and a short pain scale will be
      completed at weeks 0, 4, and 8.

      Data collected at baseline and 8 weeks will be the primary focus of data analysis. Data
      collected at other time points will be analyzed as appropriate.
