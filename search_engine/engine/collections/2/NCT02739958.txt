      factors can affect whether recurrence, or metastasis , or elimination by the immune system.

      Cancer surgery can induce an acute inflammatory response, due to local tissue damage and the
      shedding of malignant cells into the blood and lymphocytic circulation although meticulous
      surgical manipulation. Many evidences suggest that several factors during the perioperative
      period can affect the immune system.

      These could be attributed to the surgery per se, pain, anxiety, hypothermia, blood
      transfusion, anesthetic technique, and anesthetic drugs .Impairment in the immune system may
      allow malignant cells to escape immuno-surveillance and metastasize in the perioperative
      period.As well as increase the risk of postoperative complications, such as systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.

      Previous retrospective clinical studies of both breast and prostate cancer surgery have
      suggested an association between anaesthetic technique and cancer recurrence.

      However ,other retrospective trials on various forms of cancer have shown no such benefit.
