      transit of gastric contents from the stomach into the duodenum in the absence of mechanical
      outlet obstruction. The symptoms of GP are variable but include early satiety, bloating,
      nausea, vomiting, and epigastric abdominal pain. Although the true prevalence of the disorder
      is unknown, symptoms suggestive of GP are present in 7-15% of the population with an
      estimated one-third of diabetic patients in tertiary care settings having abnormal gastric
      emptying studies. Yet, despite the significant healthcare and economic costs due to frequent
      hospitalization in these patients, treatment of GP is difficult due to the lack of available
      treatment options and the often potential side effects of available prokinetic agents,
      including cardiac side effects such as QT prolongation, sudden cardiac death, and torsade de
      pointes.

      One such medication used for treatment of GP is erythromycin. Erythromycin has its drawbacks.
      Several reports of cardiac arrhythmias associated with use of either oral or intravenous (IV)
      Erythromycin have been reported. This finding sparked our interest in another macrolide,
      Azithromycin (AZI), which does not have the drug-drug interactions as seen with erythromycin
      and is not metabolized by the CYP3A inhibitors, therefore having fewer cardiac side effects.

      In This study our primary goal is to determine whether AZI can be used to treat GP.
