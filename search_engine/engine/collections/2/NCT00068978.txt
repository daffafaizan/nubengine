      immune response to HIV vaccines. Such assays should be robust, reproducible, and amenable to
      high throughput analysis of clinical specimens. Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) assays can
      reliably and specifically detect human CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to AIDS-related
      opportunistic infections, including those caused by cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis, the Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptococcus, and human papillomavirus. The
      purpose of this study is to devise and evaluate a similar CFC assay for the detection and
      quantitation of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses against HIV.

      This study will evaluate a "Gag-IFNg CFC" assay by comparing the results of this assay with
      results from other assays of immune phenotype and function in long-term nonprogressors,
      untreated patients with progressive HIV disease, and recipients of candidate HIV vaccines.
      The study will also examine HIV-specific immune responses in HIV infected individuals who
      appear to exhibit significant immune protection from HIV disease.

      Participants in this study will be drawn from other studies currently underway. As a part of
      those studies, participants will have regular blood tests. Blood samples from those studies
      will be used in this study. No participants will be directly enrolled in this study.
