      prolonging pregnancy sufficiently to improve neonatal outcomes and other treatment strategies
      are needed. Multiple examples demonstrate that multi-agent treatments are routine clinical
      practice in other fields of medicine including chemotherapeutics for cancer,
      multi-therapeutics for myocardial infarction and broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. At
      this time, it is unclear if a combination of tocolytic medications for preterm labor is more
      advantageous for women. If pregnancy is prolonged with combined tocolytic therapy, this could
      directly influence the treatment of preterm labor and potentially improve neonatal outcomes.
      There currently are no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents,
      such as nifedipine and indomethacin. Thus, we propose a comparative effective trial of
      nifedipine plus indomethacin vs. nifedipine alone for the treatment of preterm labor
