      study implementation. The trial was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, matched
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in males 18 years of age and older who are
      in a residential treatment program for chemical dependency at the Salvation Army Harbor Light
      Center (865 West North Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15233) in the United States of
      America. Convenience sampling was used to recruit individuals from July 2015 to December
      2015. A total sample of 70 participants were enrolled and block randomized with an allocation
      ratio of 1:1 for the interventions. Financial compensation of $5.00 U.S. was initiated at Day
      7 and continued at each follow-up (Day 14, Day 21 & Day 28). Intention-to-treat and complete
      case analyses were conducted. No interim analysis was performed to assess efficacy.
      Participants completed study materials in a designated room at the center.

      Briefly, this study involved the completion of four validated surveys assessing self-reported
      perceived severity of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale; GAD-7), depression
      (Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale; PHQ-8), stress (Perceived Stress Scale;
      PSS-14), sleep complaints and how is sleep affecting daily life (Pittsburgh Sleep Symptom
      Questionnaire - Insomnia; PSSQ-1) at five time points (Baseline, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, and
      Day 28). To address any adverse events relating to the interventions, the participant was
      encouraged to report any perceived adverse events to the investigator. To protect the
      anonymity and confidentiality of the participants, all paperwork were de-identified but
      contained their unique identification number.
