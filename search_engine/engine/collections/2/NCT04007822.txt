      in the UK alone. Nearly half of those who experienced chronic pain in Europe reported
      receiving insufficient pain management. Conventional treatments commonly used in
      physiotherapy continue to show only moderate effects in pain management. A potential avenue
      to improve the global effect of treatments may lie in exploring non-specific treatment
      moderators such as the therapeutic alliance (TA). Findings suggest that it is linked with
      engagement in rehabilitation and is a strong predictor of treatment outcomes and adherence.
      This study aims to evaluate and compare the quality of practice with or without the Pain
      Navigator Tool (PNT). Understanding the impact of the PNT on therapeutic alliance would open
      an avenue to improve chronic pain management, reduce healthcare-related expenses and increase
      the quality of life in the population studied. In addition, exploring the experience of the
      physiotherapists with using the PNT will provide an in-depth understanding of its use and
      applicability in similar settings.

      The aims of this study are to:

        1. To evaluate and compare the quality of practice with or without the PNT in patients with
           chronic low-back.

        2. To collect preliminary data on the usability and practicality of the PNT for
           physiotherapists.
