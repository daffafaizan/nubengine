      60 individuals with recurrent non-specific LBP were recruited through advertisement in sport
      facilities, social media and among friends and family.

      Testing:

      The testing was performed before and after a six week period by three blinded 2nd master
      students of physiotherapy of University of Ghent. The pre and post testing were almost
      identical and lasted 1 hour, only for the first testing an anamnesis was conducted to
      evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria. The identical parts were tests for motor control,
      muscle performance and psychosocial factors.

      Intervention:

      The subjects were divided into 3 groups, only group B and C were given treatment. Group B had
      2 sessions PNE over a period of two weeks. Group C received 2 sessions of PNE and 5 sessions
      of exercise therapy over a period of six weeks. Each of the sessions lasted 30 minutes and
      took place at the clinical practice room at the university of Ghent. Group C began the
      exercise therapy a week after the second session of PNE.
