      hospitalization by starting IVIG administration within 48 hours of mechanical ventilation.
      The exploratory objective is to analyze the blood before, during and after IVIG
      administration. The blood will be analyzed for the production of inflammatory and
      non-inflammatory cytokines, biomarkers for endothelial injury and biomarkers for coagulation
      via Mass Spectrometry.
