      1-week washout phase followed by an 8-week treatment phase. This study will be executed by
      one clinical research company utilizing two test sites and up to 62 subjects with moderate or
      severe atopic dermatitis, ages 12-65, will be enrolled. Subjects that are enrolled will be
      placed on one of three products (e.g. Sponsor's Experimental Cream Treatment, a basic
      moisturizer, or a positive control - Desonide) and will be required to use the assigned
      product twice a day for the duration of the 8-week treatment phase.
