    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      atomoxetine as determined by the change in the ADHD-RS-IV Total score compared to placebo in
      the symptomatic treatment of patients diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
      (by DSM-IV ADHD-NOS criteria) occurring as a neuropsychological late-effect of chemotherapy
      used to treat Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL).

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. to assess the effect of once daily (AM) dosing of atomoxetine (1.8mg/kg) compared to
           placebo on ADHD symptoms as measured by:

             -  ADHD-RS Total score inclusive of subtypes for inattention, hyperactivity and
                combined subtypes.

             -  Clinical Global Impression-ADHD

        2. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine compared with placebo based on
           treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, physical
           examinations, and ECGs.
