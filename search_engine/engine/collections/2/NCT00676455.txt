    
      This is a Pilot Study that will evaluate if metastatic liver and lung tumor measurements made
      by the MeVis™ software program can provide more accurate information about the size and
      changes of the tumor compared to the current evaluation method, RECIST(Response Evaluation In
      Solid Tumors). This study will also collect information about the kind of treatment each
      subject receives.

      Subjects will receive standard of care surveillance CT examinations(a baseline to document
      tumor size and interval CT exams as indicated by the Oncology Department Protocols); the
      tumor will be measured according to the current standard-RECIST by Radiology personnel not
      involved in the study. The CT data will then be analyzed by investigators using the MeVis™
      software.
