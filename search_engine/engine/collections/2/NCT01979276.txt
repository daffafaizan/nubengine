      multiple myeloma. Up to 48 patients will be enrolled. Phase I will follow a 3+3 dose
      escalation design to find the maximum tolerated dose of romidepsin in combination with
      pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

      In Phase I, subjects will receive:

        -  Pomalidomide 4mg daily by mouth on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle

        -  Dexamethasone 40mg by mouth on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle

        -  Romidepsin intravenously (9 mg/m2, 12 mg/m2, 15 mg/m2 or 18 mg/m2) on days 1 and 15 of a
           28-day cycle.

      Phase II will expand the number of subjects in the MTD arm of the trial until 48 subjects are
      enrolled. In Phase II, subjects subjects will receive:

        -  Pomalidomide 4mg daily by mouth on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle

        -  Dexamethasone 40mg by mouth on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle

        -  Romidepsin intravenously on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle at the Maximum Tolerated
           Dose determined by Phase I
