    
      This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study.

      Before initiation of any protocol-specific activities, written informed consent was obtained
      from each patient and their legally acceptable representatives (consent of the legally
      acceptable representative was required for children younger than 10 years of age, and for the
      some sites, for children younger than 7 years of age). Subjects who met all of the
      eligibility criteria after screening assessments as specified in the protocol, were
      randomized into the test group or the comparator group in a ratio of 5 to 1 according to the
      pre-generated site-specific randomization table, and received a single dose or two doses of
      the study vaccine. The investigator performed the efficacy (immunogenicity) and safety
      assessments throughout the study. Efficacy data were collected at Visit 1 (prior to
      vaccination) and at the end-of-study visit for efficacy (immunogenicity) assessments, and for
      safety assessment, subjects and their legally acceptable representatives were instructed to
      record any treatment-emergent adverse event in Patient Diary cards.

      For all randomized subjects, blood sample was obtained prior to vaccination, and the study
      vaccine 0.5mL or 0.25mL was administered to the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh muscle.
      For children aged from 6 months to <9 years of age who had not been previously exposed to
      influenza virus or had not previously received influenza vaccine, another dose of the study
      vaccine was administered 4 to 5 weeks after the first dose. Blood samples were collected 4 to
      5 weeks after the last dose of the study drug for the assessment of antibody titer. All
      subjects were followed for 6 months after the last dose of the study drug for the safety
      assessments, and Month 6 follow-up visit was the end-of-study visit.
