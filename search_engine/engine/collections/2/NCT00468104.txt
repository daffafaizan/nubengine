      placement for drainage and IV antibiotics. If this fails and CPE occurs then in most patients
      thoracotomy is performed. Patients that are not surgical candidates have image guided
      catheter placement performed, sometimes multiple times. The American College of Chest
      Physicians (ACCP) formed a CPE panel and published guidelines for treating CPE. Percutaneous
      image-guided drainage is the most common approach for CPE. The panel recognizes the
      cumulative data that supports the use of fibrinolytics, VATS, and thoracotomy. The CPE panel
      acknowledged the lack of randomized clinical trials to determine efficacy and safety of these
      modalities in CPE and strongly encourages the research to take place.

      Fibrinolytic therapy is a relatively noninvasive, easy to use, and is relatively inexpensive.
      If successful, it will prevent sepsis and septic shock, decrease hospital stay, morbidity and
      mortality and prevent any surgical procedures. Multiple doses of fibrinolytics have been used
      in CPE with no evidence of systemic anti-fibrinolytic activity. Complications with these
      medications are also very uncommon and only isolated instances are reported. The benefit from
      successful pleural drainage using these agents will decrease morbidity, mortality, surgical
      procedures, and hospital stay.
