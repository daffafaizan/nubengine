      worldwide. Symptoms include otorrhea, otalgia and hearing loss. In many countries it is
      treated primarily with antibiotics; in other countries such as the Netherlands a surgical
      approach, such as a tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, placement or removal of tympanostomy tubes
      or a tympanomastoidectomy is preferred. There is however, no agreement on the management of
      this disease.

      Co-trimoxazole is an inexpensive antibiotic and tolerated well by children, also when long
      treatment regimens or prophylaxis is necessary. A previously performed retrospective study of
      48 children who were referred to the pediatric department of otorhinolaryngology in the UMC
      Utrecht because of "therapeutic resistant" otorrhea showed promising results; after 3 months
      follow-up, 52% of the patients were otorrhea free, 25% had otorrhea incidentally and 23%
      showed no signs of improvement. Therefore, the treatment of chronic otitis media with
      sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for a minimum of six weeks is promising and might be a good
      alternative to surgical treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with
      sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim during 6-12 weeks in children with chronic otitis media and
      otorrhea for more than 12 weeks.
