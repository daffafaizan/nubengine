      Single Exposure Dual-Energy Subtraction digital radiography with KA Imaging's Multi-energy
      detector.

      The acquisition of Dual-Energy Subtraction radiography will consist of using the Multi-Energy
      detector integrated into the X-ray system in Grand River Hospital. Patient will receive a
      Multi-Energy Chest radiography exam on the same day as their routine chest CT exam. Each
      Multi-Energy radiography exam will consist of one Chest PA image and one Chest LAT image.
      Duration of each procedure is 60 minutes. The Multi-Energy Detector will generate a General
      Radiography Image and Dual-Energy Subtracted Images.

      Visualization of lung lesions by Multi-Energy detector will be compared to corresponding CT
      exam and general radiography results. Imaging data will be evaluated qualitatively by
      radiologists on data collection form to describe the findings on the images. Further
      comparison between general radiography, Dual-Energy Subtraction radiography and CT will be
      analyzed to determine the differences of imaging characteristics such as description of image
      quality and visibility of relevant anatomical structures and anomalies.
