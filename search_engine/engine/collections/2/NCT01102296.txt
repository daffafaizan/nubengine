      HIV-infected patients who receive 2 doses or 3 doses of HAV vaccine and HIV-uninfected
      persons who receive 2 doses of HAV vaccine. Persons who identify themselves as male
      homosexuals aged younger than 40 years and are seronegative for hepatitis A virus will be
      enrolled. HAV vaccination will be provided free-of-charge. HIV-uninfected persons will
      receive 2 doses of HAV vaccine that will be administered at baseline and 6 months after the
      first dose, while HIV-infected patients will be given 2 doses or 3 doses of HAV vaccine; for
      those who choose to receive 3 doses, a second dose will be given 1 month after the first
      dose. A longitudinal follow-up of serological responses will be conducted to assess the
      effectiveness of HAV vaccination; HAV IgG will be determined at 6 months after the first dose
      of HAV vaccination(before the administration of the second dose), 12 months and 18 months
      after the first dose of HAV vaccination .
