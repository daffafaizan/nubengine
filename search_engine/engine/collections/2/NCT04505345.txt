      the main consequences of chronic and excessive alcohol use are cognitive and executive
      deficits. Some of these deficits may be reversed, with improvements in specific cognitive and
      executive domains, with behavioral approaches consisting in cognitive training. The advent of
      computer-based interventions may leverage these improvements, but RCTs on the use of digital
      interactive-based intervention are still scarce.

      The aim consists in exploring whether a cognitive training approach using virtual reality
      exercises based on activities of daily living is feasible for improving cognitive function in
      patients with alcohol use disorder undergoing residential treatment.

      The method consists in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with individuals recovering from
      alcohol use disorder in a therapeutic community that will be assigned to an experimental and
      a control group. The experimental group consists of virtual reality-based cognitive training
      whereas the control group of treatment-as-usual. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery
      of tests will be used consisting in tests for global cognition, executive functions, and
      specific tests form memory, attention and cognitive flexibility. The AB design will involve a
      baseline assessment before intervention and post-intervention assessment.
