      trial. The study consists of two weeks baseline measurements to assure that the
      neuropsychiatric symptoms are stable and six successive treatment blocks of 2 weeks. Each
      treatment block lasts for two weeks and contains two double-blinded drug periods, each
      lasting three days of oral THC or placebo, separated by four day washout periods. After three
      treatment blocks (period A), the dosage of active treatment was increased for the latter
      three treatment blocks (period B). After the two treatment periods, subjects will proceed to
      the extension phase if applicable.

      Study centers The department of Geriatrics from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre
      and the department of Elderly from Vincent van Gogh voor Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg Venray
      (VVG) will participate in this multi center study.

      Participants 20 subjects with dementia and NPS. Intervention NamisolÂ® in doses of twice daily
      0,75 mg tablet (period A) and twice daily 1.5 mg (period B) THC oral tablets. Placebo of
      twice daily 0,75 mg and twice daily 1.5 mg oral tablets Outcome measures Primary outcome is
      NPI score, secondary CMAI, Zarit Burden scale. Other outcomes include vital signs,
      side-effects, physical exam, mobility and pharmacogenetics.

      Visits This study will be assessed fully ambulatory, starting with a 5 hour clinical visit on
      day 1 and 8 of block 1 and a phone call on day 2 and 9 for assessment of Adverse Events.
      Furthermore, the research physician will conduct a weekly home visit weekly during the
      crossover phase for assessment of , among others, the primary outcome measure. These visits
      will all be repeated in period B of the crossover phase.

      During the 6 month open label extension phase, subjects will visit the clinic three times.
