      I. Determine the impact of a minimum of 4 months of full androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
      on cardiac and skeletal muscle structure and performance using novel cardiovascular magnetic
      resonance (CMR) approach.

      OUTLINE:

      Study participants will undergo a treadmill stress CMR focused on cardiac muscle comprised of
      resting MRI over 10-15 minutes followed by treadmill exercise until peak stress. Patients
      then undergo MRI and gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid
      [DTPA]) perfusion imaging immediately after exercise and after a 6-8 minute recovery period.
      Within 24 hours of treadmill CMR exam, patients also undergo skeletal muscle phosphorus
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PMRS) while at rest, during, and in the recovery phase of
      resistive lower extremity exercise which patients complete over 30 seconds. Both procedures
      are performed before initiation of ADT treatment (baseline) and 4-7 months after initiation
      of ADT treatment.
