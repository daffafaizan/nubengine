           There are structural and compositional changes in muscles, such as edema, adipose
           infiltration, and/or atrophy, in IIMs. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is sensitive
           to such changes. EIM parameters will be different when compared to healthy controls in
           IIMs.

        2. To assess whether EIM parameters are reflective of disease severity, based on clinical
           outcome measures of IIMs.

      Clinical outcome measures reflect on disease severity which is an indirect measure of muscle
      involvement in IIMs. If EIM parameters correlate with clinical outcome measure, it would
      indirectly prove that EIM can reflect disease severity in IIMs
