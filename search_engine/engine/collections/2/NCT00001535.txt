      efficacy of infusions of activated, genetically engineered, syngeneic CD4+ T lymphocytes
      obtained from HIV-1 seronegative identical twins. T cells from each seronegative twin will be
      obtained by apheresis, enriched for CD4+ cells, induced to polyclonal proliferation with
      anti-CD3 and rIL-2 stimulation, divided into aliquots which will then be individually
      transduced with a control retroviral vector and up to two additional retroviral vectors
      containing potentially therapeutic genes (antisense TAR and/or transdominant Rev). These
      engineered T cell populations will be expanded 10-1,000 fold in numbers during 1-2 weeks of
      culture, and then will be infused into the seropositive twins. The relative survival of the
      uniquely engineered T cell populations will be monitored by vector-specific PCR, while the
      recipients' functional immune status is monitored by standard in vitro and in vivo testing
      protocols. A total of up to 4 cycles of treatment may be given using identical or different
      combinations of control and anti-HIV-1 retroviral vectors.
