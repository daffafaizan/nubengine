      inclusion/exclusion criteria after voluntary agreement with informed consent. At the time of
      enrollment, we will stratify all patients according to LDL-cholesterol <100mg/dL, DM, and
      acute coronary syndrome, and randomly assign them in two groups according to LDL-cholesterol
      targeting level with a 1:1 ratio: "Intensive-targeting group" vs. "Conventional-targeting
      group". In addition, patients in each group will be randomly assigned to receive two
      lipid-lowering therapy regimen with a 1:1 ratio: "Ezetimibe/Statin combination therapy" vs.
      "Statin monotherapy". Patients allocated to each treatment group will receive lipid-lowering
      therapy with following protocols.
