    
      ARDS patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio equal or below 150 mmHg (during mechanical ventilation
      with PEEP 5 cmH2O) will be enrolled within 24 hours from endo-tracheal intubation.

      To standardize lung volumes at study initiation, all patients will undergo mechanical
      ventilation with tidal volume set at 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and PEEP set to obtain
      a plateau pressure within 28 and 30 cmH2O for thirty minutes (Express PEEP).

      Afterwards, a 5-step decremental PEEP trial will be conducted (Express PEEP to PEEP 5 cmH2O),
      and EELV will be measured at each step. PEEP-induced alveolar recruitment will be calculated
      for each PEEP range as the difference between PEEP-induced change EELV and the predicted
      increase in lung volume due to PEEP (PEEP-induced overdistension, equal to the product of
      respiratory system compliance and PEEP change).

      Patients will be then randomized to receive mechanical ventilation with PEEP set according to
      the optimal recruitment observed in the PEEP trial (IPERPEEP arm) trial or according to the
      Express strategy (Control arm, PEEP set to achieve a plateau pressure of 28-30 cmH2O).

      In both groups, tidal volume size, the use of prone positioning and neuromuscular blocking
      agents will be standardized.

      Primary endpoint of the study is a composite clinical outcome incorporating in-ICU mortality,
      60-day ventilator free days and the area under the curve of serum Interleukin 6 over the
      course of the initial 72 hours.

      Prespecified subgroup analysis will be conducted according to:

        -  [(Express PEEP EELV)-(EELV PEEP 5 cmH2O)]/Functional residual capacity (FRC) ≥ and < 73%
           during the PEEP trial

        -  Rec ≥ 19 ml/cmH2O and Rec < 19 ml/cmH2O across the range between the lowest and highest
           PEEP tested during the PEEP trial

        -  P/F ratio≥ and <100 mmHg at study inclusion

        -  IL-6≥ and <400 pg/ml at study inclusion
