      fields, which time of occurrence and localization over time are yet not examined
      systematically.

      A receptive field is defined as skin area anywhere on the same side of the body as the
      amputation, which when stimulated by others, causes phantom sensations in the amputated
      extremity.

      This clinical trial aims to investigate the reliability in detecting these receptive fields
      as well as their incidence and changes over time.

      Further it aims to evaluate the acute effect of the stimulating system ("Phantom Stimulator"
      (Cort X Sensorics, Spaichingen, Germany)) on selected gait parameters measured tough a gait
      analysis system ("OprtoGait" (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy)) as well as on phantom sensations
      measured through a questionnaire.
