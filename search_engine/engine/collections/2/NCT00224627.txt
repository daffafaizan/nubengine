      subjects were randomly assigned to be explored by CE or PE (first line exploration). The
      alternative exploration was only performed if no diagnosis was evidenced by the examination
      assigned by randomization. An independent staff member assigned subjects in 1:1 ratio between
      CE and PE strategies with stratification for overt and occult bleeding and centers according
      to consecutive number that were kept in serialized sealed opaque envelopes. After the
      completion of these explorations, the patients returned at month 3, 6 and 12 thereafter. At
      each visit, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were performed and patients were managed
      according to published recommendations2 (AGA medical position). The first line exploration as
      well as the alternative exploration could be done during the one year follow-up period only
      in case of severe relapse of OGIB or necessity to perform biopsies or a therapeutic
      procedure.
