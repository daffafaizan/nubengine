      to quantify a large number of blood proteins previously implicated in ACVS and mimic
      conditions in patients who are consented and enrolled in the Emergency Department within 24
      hrs of symptom onset. 560 patients will be enrolled, and grouped into two cohorts (Cohort 1A:
      220; and Cohort 1B: 350).

      In Cohort 1A, each consented participant provides three blood samples: on arrival, 4-6 hours
      later, then ~24 hours after that, but no later than 32 hours from symptom onset. In cohort
      1b, each patient provides only a single blood sample up to 24 hours from symptom onset.

      A positive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or
      definite ischemia on Computed tomography (CT) or vascular occlusion on CTA will be used as
      proof of ischemia to classify the clinical phenotype into three groups (see below). A
      neurologist will adjudicate all cases according to a study defined adjudication protocol.
