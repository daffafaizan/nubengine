      respiratory failure. The investigators are interested in the therapeutic potential of acute
      intermittent hypoxia (AIH) for individuals with neuromuscular diseases, such as ALS. More
      than two decades of research indicates AIH elicits meaningful respiratory and non-respiratory
      motor recovery. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) consists of alternating periods of breathing
      mildly hypoxic (lowered oxygen concentration) and normoxic (normal oxygen concentration) air.

      The investigators propose to study mechanisms of respiratory plasticity associated with a
      single presentation of mild AIH. The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that
      even a single AIH trial improves respiratory (and non-respiratory) motor function in ALS
      patients procedure. Participants will then be asked to breathe air with reduced oxygen for
      short periods of time, for a duration of 45 minutes. The activity of your muscles and your
      heart function will be monitored throughout the procedure.
