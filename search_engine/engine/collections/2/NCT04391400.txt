        -  Identify nucleic acid sequences that may be used aide in the development of SARSCoV- 2
           detection methods.

        -  Identify antibodies that may be used aide in the development of SARS-CoV-2 detection
           methods.

        -  Identify antigens that may be used aide in the development of SARS-CoV-2 detection
           methods. -Identify nucleic acid sequences that may be used aide in the development of
           COVID- 19 treatments and/or vaccines.

        -  Identify antibodies that may be used aide in the development of COVID-19 treatments
           and/or vaccines.
