      men with low-risk, localized, unilateral prostate cancer who have not received previous
      treatment. A total of 86 men between 40 to 69 years of age with biopsy proven, early stage
      localized prostate cancer will receive unilateral nerve-sparing cryoablation. The study
      includes a screening/pre-operative visit, a cryoablation procedure day, and 10 follow up
      visits over the course of 36 months. The first follow-up visit will occur within 2 weeks (±1
      week) after cryoablation. Thereafter, follow-up visits will be scheduled, from the date of
      procedure, every 3 months (±3 weeks) for 18 months and every 6 months (±3 weeks) thereafter
      until the patient completes the protocol, 36 months after the cryoablation procedure.
