      flexible dose, randomized trial in postmenopausal women who are recently experiencing major
      depressive disorder.

      Patients will be female, aged 55 or older, outpatient or inpatient status, with diagnosis of
      major depressive episode (single or recurrent) by DSM-IV, the current depressive episode
      within 1 years. The patients should also have HAMD-24 total score≥20,a HAMD-24 Item 1
      (depressed mood) score≥2 at screening and baseline.

      The eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups with 1:1
      allocation ratio: venlafaxine 75~225mg/d or fluoxetine 20~60mg/d. Treatment and observational
      duration will be 56 days (8 weeks).

      Primary efficacy measure will be assessed based on the decrease of HAMD-24 from baseline to
      endpoint. The secondary efficacy measures are change from baseline to endpoint in CGI-S,
      CGI-I, and Pain VAS et al.

      The safety in this study will be assessed by adverse event reporting, clinical laboratory
      measurements and physical examinations.
