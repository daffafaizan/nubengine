      10 mmHg for systolic and diastolic 7 mmHg. However, remain uncertain the effects of this type
      of training on BP in patients with more severe cardiovascular diseases such as peripheral
      artery disease. Because this type of training which requires approximately 20 minutes per
      session and does not require supervision, it is possible that this intervention is
      interesting to reduce BP of these patients. The aim of this study is to analyze the effects
      of IHT on blood pressure of hypertensive patients with peripheral arterial disease. Will be
      recruited 60 patients, which will be randomized into 2 groups (30 per group), IHT and control
      group (CG). IHT group will hold three sessions per week with four unilateral sets with two
      minutes of isometric contraction at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction and interval of four
      minutes between them, for 8 weeks. The GC patients will be encouraged to increase the level
      of physical activity. In the pre and post-intervention, is going to be evaluated functional
      capacity, brachial and central BP, arterial stiffness, cardiovascular autonomic modulation
      and muscle vasodilation. Will be used to analyze two-factor variance for repeated measures,
      with group (IHT and GC) and the time (before and after 8 weeks) as factors and the post-hoc
      test of Newman-Keuls.
