      complex. About one tenth of patients scheduled for surgery are taking antithrombotic
      medications. Coagulation disturbance induced by these medications may increase the risk of
      bleeding, whereas withholding these medications may increase the risk of thrombotic events.
      It is a dilemma when managing these patients.

      The guidelines and expert consensus published by multiple disciplinary teams constitute the
      perioperative antithrombotic management protocols. However, the effects of perioperative
      antithrombotic management guided by these guidelines or expert consensus are seldom reported.
      The investigators hypothesize that a protocol-based perioperative antithrombotic management
      can benefit patients with chronic antithrombotic therapy before surgery.
