electron microscopy of the bovine lung.. the normal blood-air barrier .lungs of 20 healthy, mature cattle were fixed in oso , embedded in apolyester resin, and studied via electron microscopy . the blood-airbarrier was widely variable in thickness and consistency . there was acontinuous epithelial alveolar lining . the cytoplasm of some of theepithelial cells contained membrane-bound aggregates of granules whichmay be secretory structures . the epithelium rested on a basementmembrane, which in turn was continuous with or rested on an adjacentcapillary endothelial basement membrane, or continued into mergingconnective tissue . the capillary endothelium was not fenestrated,. itwas a continuous cellular membrane . both the epithelium and endotheliumcontained numerous caveolae and pinocytotic vesicles . cells of thealveolar wall included fibroblasts, lymphocytes, macrophages, and anoccasional mast cell . very little elastin was observed .
