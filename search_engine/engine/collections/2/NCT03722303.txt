      Americans; CTS is caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel leading to
      nerve ischemia and symptoms of numbness, pain, and tingling. Treatment options depend on the
      severity of symptoms and range from noninvasive options (most commonly, steroid injections)
      to definitive surgical release of the compressed median nerve. Both non-invasive techniques
      and surgical intervention have their shortcomings; thus a novel approach for CTS treatment
      may be indicated.

      Lipografting is an established, validated, and widely used technique of plastic surgeons that
      injects autologous fat to correct contour deformities. From observing these reconstructions,
      plastic surgeons have witnessed the regenerative properties of fat transfer, specifically
      delaying the affects of chronic radio-dermatitis. These clinical manifestations have fostered
      numerous studies defining fat as a rich source of pluripotent stem cells with the potential
      for reducing scar formation, bringing neo-angiogenesis, and providing a barrier against scar
      adhesions This study applies the regenerative properties of autologous fat transfer to treat
      mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in comparison to the current standard of care,
      corticosteroid treatment. Ideally, the fat transfer would prevent scar formation and aid in
      nerve excursion along the canal, while the neoangiogenic and regenerative growth factors
      could stimulate nerve regeneration.
