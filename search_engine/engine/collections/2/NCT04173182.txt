      Currently there is an endoscopic classification system for classifying diverticular disease;
      however, white light endoscopic fails to accurately detect inflammation.

      Confocal laser endomicroscopy offers a real-time, in-vivo evaluation of the colonic mucosa,
      with an adequate correlation to histological findings. The investigators aimed to evaluate
      the role of peridiverticular and colonic mucosa inflammation in the prediction of complicated
      diverticular disease.
