      I. To document the complete response rate and overall response for patients with relapsed
      aggressive high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with two cycles PXD-101 followed by one
      cycle of Zevalin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate 2-year progression-free survival in patients with relapsed aggressive
      high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with two cycles PXD-101 followed by one cycle of
      Zevalin.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity of two cycles PXD-101 and one cycle of Zevalin in patients with
      relapsed aggressive high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive belinostat intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment with
      belinostat repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients then receive rituximab IV on days 1
      and either 7, 8, or 9, and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 50.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
