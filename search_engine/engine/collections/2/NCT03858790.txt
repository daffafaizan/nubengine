    
      Adult patients with chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs who are candidates for
      a treatment with spinal cord stimulation will be prospectively randomized into 2 arms. Spinal
      cord stimulation parameters are programmed and adjusted during outpatient clinic visits,
      within the normal clinical practice.
