    
      GnRH antagonist administration in the luteal phase has been proposed as a strategy for the
      treatment of established severe early OHSS, causing rapid regression of the syndrome on an
      outpatient basis. The approach has been described as tertiary OHSS prevention, thereby
      complementing the primary prevention (GnRH antagonist protocol) and secondary prevention
      (GnRH agonist trigger) that constitute the OHSS-free clinic concept. No randomized controlled
      trials (RCT) exist to date comparing luteal GnRH antagonist administration versus
      conventional treatment.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the novel method of GnRH antagonist administration
      in the luteal phase versus conventional treatment with primary outcome time to severe OHSS
      regression, in IVF patients who develop severe early OHSS and have all their embryos
      cryopreserved.
