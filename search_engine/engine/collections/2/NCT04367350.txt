      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. For that reason
      consecutive patients with proven corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19), who are admitted to
      the intensive care unit of the department of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine, or
      the department of neurology at TÃ¼bingen University Hospital, are enrolled. Multimodal
      assessment of neuromuscular pathology is based on medical history, laboratory biomarkers
      including inflammation parameters and autoimmune antibodies, vital parameters monitoring,
      muscle ultrasound, transthoracic echocardiography, electroneurography, as well as
      electromyography. Inclusion of follow-up visits permit longitudinal and prognostic evaluation
      of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (e.g. immunomodulation with immunoglobulins,
      corticosteroids, or interleukin 6 receptor antagonists).
