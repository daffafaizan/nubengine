      Patients are selected by a randomization process to take amphotericin B intravenously (in the
      vein), for 14 days, and either placebo (ineffective substance) or flucytosine for 14 days.
      Then patients are again selected by a randomization process to take either (1) fluconazole
      for a total of 8 weeks plus itraconazole placebo; or (2) itraconazole for a total of 8 weeks
      plus fluconazole placebo.
