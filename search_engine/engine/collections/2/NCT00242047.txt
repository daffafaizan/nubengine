    
      This is an open label, randomized, controlled, equivalency trial to compare the efficacy of
      the percutaneous route of administration with the intradermal route of administration of
      Japanese (Tokyo) 172 BCG, obtained from the BCG laboratory in Tokyo, Japan, in the prevention
      of tuberculosis, with bacteriological or histological confirmation, or meeting strict
      clinical criteria, during the first two years of life. The comparison of the two methods is
      necessary because the intradermal method is almost universally preferred, without direct
      evidence from a clinical trial. The intradermal method provides for more accurate dosing and
      produces a higher rate of tuberculin skin test conversion, but neither of these factors has
      been shown to correlate with efficacy of BCG vaccination. The percutaneous method is much
      simpler and, if shown to be equally effective, could become a preferred method. The Japanese
      strain was chosen because it is the one commercially available strain produced for both
      intradermal and percutaneous administration, and because a seed lot from this strain was
      previously used to produce BCG for the South African BCG vaccination program.
