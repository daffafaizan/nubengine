      cough spells without sedating the reflex. Looking into mechanisms for cough management
      different from mucolytics, or sedatives, such as protection of irritated pharynx mucosa from
      post nasal drip or other irritating substances is theoretically sound and shows practical
      interesting results. A parallel comparison of efficacy and tolerability between such
      protective mechanism (acting through a barrier and radical scavenging action) due to natural
      substances (honey, plantago lanceolata and thymus vulgaris) and placebo has been looked at
      specifically on the clinically critical population of children coughing since 1-2 days and
      not more, including very young children of one year old. The intent of this study is to use
      the protective syrup versus placebo in children with moderate to severe night and daily
      cough, measured with a validated parent questionnaire. Daily cough is assessed to better
      describe and select the general condition of the child however only night cough parameters
      due to treatment are assessed. The degree of disturbance of cough is followed immediately
      after one night administration on all night parameters, with special interest to frequency.

      Assessment of effectiveness of the protective cough syrup as compared to placebo is
      considered very interesting due to the mechanism of the remedy. The study looks at the effect
      of the syrup/placebo on the first night in order to well focus the "first" effect of a
      treatment on the ascending phase of the illness, such as to reduce to a minimum any
      interference due to natural regression of the symptom due to illness progression.
