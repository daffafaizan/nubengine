      focused efforts to improve monitoring of medication ingestion patterns are needed. This study
      will test the feasibility of using a Digital Medicine Program (consisting of an FDA-approved
      ingestible sensor co-encapsulated with oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg), a small
      wearable patch, and a mobile application) in cancer patients with metastatic disease
      experiencing uncontrolled pain. Data collected from this study (such as information on
      patterns of DMP usage by patients and physicians and changes to medication dosage based on
      the reported symptoms) will inform the design of a randomized controlled trial of the DMP vs.
      usual care to control cancer pain and increase quality of life. If successful, this DMP could
      be a new way for physicians to evaluate patients' pain medication use patterns and titrate
      for adequate pain control while concurrently monitoring for adverse effects or
      abusive/addictive behavior. It will also promote improved communication between patients and
      their physicians and potentially address and ease some of patients' concerns and hesitancies
      regarding opioid medications.
