      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of
      prexasertib (LY2606368) administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes, every
      14 days of a 28-day cycle to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of LY2606368 administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of LY2606368 in children with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of LY2606368 within the confines of a phase
      1 study.

      II. To examine checkpoint kinase (CHK)1/2 expression status in archival tumor tissue from
      solid tumor pediatric patients using immunohistochemistry.

      III. To evaluate tumor tissue for deletion and/or mutation of tumor protein 53 (Trp53) as a
      potential biomarker of Chk1 inhibition.

      IV. To evaluate autophosphorylation of Chk1 and H2A histone family, member x (H2AX) in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a potential pharmacodynamic marker of LY2606368
      activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive prexasertib IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
