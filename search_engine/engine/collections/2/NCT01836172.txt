    
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate superior effect of YJP-14 three doses,
      25, 50 and 100 mg t.i.d on endothelial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus indicated as mean
      change difference of flow-mediated dilation (FMD), compared to placebo group after treatment
      of 12 weeks.

      The secondary purposes of this study are divided into three as follows;

        -  Clinically significant effect of YJP-14 three doses, 25, 50 and 100 mg t.i.d on
           endothelial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus indicated as mean change difference of FMD,
           compared to placebo group after treatment of 8 weeks.

        -  Clinically significant effect of YJP-14 three doses, 25, 50 and 100 mg t.i.d on insulin
           resistance in diabetes mellitus indicated as mean change difference of Homeostasis Model
           Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), compared to placebo group after treatment of 4,
           8 and 12 weeks.

        -  Clinically significant effect of YJP-14 three doses, 25, 50 and 100 mg t.i.d on mean
           change difference of blood pressure in diabetes mellitus, compared to placebo group
           after treatment of 4, 8 and 12 weeks.

      The exploratory purposes of this study are divided into two as follows;

        -  Clinically significant effect of YJP-14 three doses, 25, 50 and 100 mg t.i.d on blood
           glucose level in diabetes mellitus indicated as mean change difference of HbA1c,
           compared to placebo group after treatment of 12 weeks.

        -  Clinically significant effect of YJP-14 three doses, 25, 50 and 100 mg t.i.d on vascular
           stiffness in diabetes mellitus indicated as mean change difference of blood lipids (LDL,
           HDL and TG), compared to placebo group after treatment of 12 weeks.
