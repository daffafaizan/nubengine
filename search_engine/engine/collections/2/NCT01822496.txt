      I. To assess whether patients with unresectable local-regionally advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) treated with targeted agents based on molecular characteristics have a longer
      progression-free survival than those treated with standard care therapy alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rate. II. To assess toxicity. III. To assess overall survival. IV. To
      correlate clinical outcomes with tumor molecular aberrations identified from deep sequencing
      of selected kinomes in patients from whom adequate baseline tissue is available.

      OUTLINE: Eligible patients are assigned to one of two cohorts based on pre-enrollment
      screening by the enrolling institution for two biomarkers: EGFR TK mutation and EML4-ALK
      fusion arrangement. Within each cohort, patients are randomized to either an experimental or
      control arm, resulting in a total of four treatment arms overall. Patients with both the EGFR
      mutation and ALK arrangement are placed in the ALK Cohort.

      Planned Sample Size: 156 for the EGFR mutation cohort and 78 for the ALK translocation cohort

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 2 months, 4-6 weeks,
      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.
