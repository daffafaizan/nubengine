      provide institutional-reviewed consent form will be randomly assigned into either model 1 or
      model 2 of an early functional training program. Participants in model 1 group will receive 2
      sessions of functional training per day whereas those in model 2 group will receive 1 session
      of functional training and 1 session of friendly visit and education per day. The following
      outcomes will be measured at admission, at discharge and at 3 months post stroke: Barthel
