      years. This extension trial was terminated after the decision to terminate the AFQ056
      development program. The decision was based on the results of two randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled phase IIb trials in adult and adolescent FXS patients (CAFQ056A2212 and
      CAFQ056B2214respectivly), both of which failed to demonstrate efficacy in the FXS population.
      As this extension trial was terminated, only the primary objective and safety are
      represented.
