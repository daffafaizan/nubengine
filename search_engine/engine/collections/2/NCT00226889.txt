      fibrosis. The accumulation of extracellular components in the extracellular matrix is mostly
      due to increased activity og tissue fibroblasts. The proliferation and hyperactivity of the
      fibroblasts may be caused by enhanced production of several cytokins, among them
      endothelin-1.The activity of endothelin-1 has been shown to be increased both in the
      circulation and within skin lesions. Endothelin-1 has several distinct properties, among them
      profibrotic activity, inflammatory and vasoconstriction.Thus, the actions induced by
      endothelin-1 may be a potensial target for the therapy of SSc.

      Thirty patients with early SSc, that is of less than 12 months duration will be offered six
      months of treatment with the oral dual endothelin-1 antagonist bosentan. Assessment of
      disease progression will be performed at 3, 6, 9. 12 and 24 months using clinical,
      histological and immunohistochemical methods.
