      will maintain a Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) while adolescents randomized to receiving the
      CloudConnect Report will have a lowering of HbA1c that is related to the increase in
      adolescent/parent disease-specific engagement. Moreover, the hypothesis is that the subjects
      receiving the CloudConnect Report will increase the engagement of adolescents/ parent through
      increased communication and self-management behavior, and that this increase in engagement
      will lead to improved medical outcomes.
