      relapses in real time could lead to a new era of MS relapse treatment. Accidental, anecdotal
      clinical observations suggest that transient upregulation of the intrinsic coagulation
      pathway, namely with elevated von Willebrand Factor antigen levels (vWF) and increased Factor
      VIII activity, occur with some MS relapses and that the higher the elevated plasma values,
      the more glucocorticoid therapy required to achieve clinical improvement.

      Ten adult patients with relapsing remitting MS with or without secondary progression will be
      consented and enrolled in this longitudinal clinical trial. As a standard of care all
      patients will be treated daily with one gram IV solumedrol for five days, and all patients
      will have performed standard MRI's of the brain, cervical spine, and thoracic spine with and
      without IV contrast during hospital admission, which may occur after Solumedrol treatment.

      In addition to this standard of care, patients will have a panel of labs drawn on Days: 1
      (prior to any solumedrol treatment), 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 135, and 180. Neurological
      clinical assessments, comprising of assessing the EDSS score, the MSFC index (that looks at
      ambulation, hand/arm coordination, and cognitive function, comprised of the 25 foot timed
      walking tests, with and without any assistive devices if possible), LCSLC test, SDMT, and
      Neuro QoL will be conducted on Days: 1, 7, 30, 90, 180. Individual and aggregate laboratory
      values, neurological clinical assessment results, and MRI findings will be correlated for the
      presence of a MS relapse, severity of relapse, and extent of recovery from the relapse.
      Patients and evaluators will be blinded to the lab results.
