    
      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled therapeutic study for 93 patients
      age 3 and older with confirmed diagnosis of NPC1. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 2000 mg/kg dose of Trappsol Cyclo (hydroxypropyl
      betacyclodextrin) administered intravenously by slow infusion every two weeks in addition to
      standard of care as compared to placebo and standard of care. Standard of care may include
      Miglustat or leucine products that are not currently under investigation as a therapeutic.
      Patients will be randomized to receive Trappsol Cyclo or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. The study
      duration is 96 weeks, with an unblinded interim analysis at 48 weeks. An open-label extension
      of up to 96 weeks follows the interventional study. Patients whose disease progression
      worsens by two levels in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale over 12 weeks,
      starting at week 36, may be moved to open label treatment. Efficacy will be measured at week
      48 and week 96 by a composite score of major disease features. A sub-study will be conducted
      in countries following EMA guidance for up to 12 patients age 0 - 3 years who may be
      asymptomatic. Outcomes for the sub-study are safety, clinical and caregiver impression of
      disease.
