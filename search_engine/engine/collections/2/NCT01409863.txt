      dermatologists and plastic surgeons. The Fraxel Laser is a new FDA cleared treatment for
      textural irregularities of the skin. There have been no studies examining the efficacy of
      Fraxel specifically for scar resurfacing though it is being used in clinical practice as its
      clearance was given under hte umbrella of "coagulation of soft tissue." Dermabrasion is the
      gold standard for scar resurfacing and provides the criterion against which Fraxel therapy
      should be measured.
