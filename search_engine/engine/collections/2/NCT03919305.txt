      an obstruction of the blood outflow. CVT mainly includes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,
      deep cerebral vein thrombosis and cortical vein thrombosis. However, the epidemiological
      features of CVT in China mainland remained obscure. This study was aimed to establish a
      multicenter cohort recruiting patients with CVT across 31 provinces and municipalities in
      China mainland. Clinical features,natural history of the diseases and current therapeutic
      situations will be analyzed to reveal the epidemiological features of CVT. Blood samples and
      cerebrospinal fluid samples will be collected after recruitment to reveal the pathological
      mechanisms of CVT and identify the biomarkers for CVT. Patients will be followed-up at 1, 3,
      6, 12 months from baseline to evaluate the clinical prognosis and therapeutic outcomes.
