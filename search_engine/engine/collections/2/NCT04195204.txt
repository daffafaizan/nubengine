      periodï¼Œespecially in elderly patients. It is characterized by cognitive decline, inattention
      and abnormal mental status following surgery. The presence of postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction is independently associated with poor recovery, increased hospital length of stay
      and increased mortality.

      Tropisetron is a 5-HT3A receptor antagonist and is widely used to treat postoperative nausea
      and vomiting. Previous studies found that tropisetron has positive effect on cognitive
      function.

      We have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if
      tropisetron has a positive effect on postoperative coginitive function in patients after
      cardiac surgery. Several assessements which are related to delirium, cognitive function,
      sleep and functional status, blood sample collection and EEG recordings will be involved in
      the trial. Moreover, we have assumed a few long-term follow-ups.

      Given the complexity of the trial, we have decided to implement a pilot trial to assess the
      feasibility and provide vital data for future formal trial.
