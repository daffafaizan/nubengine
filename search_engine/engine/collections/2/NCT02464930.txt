      consenting subjects. The investigators have previously identified BE specific miRNA that will
      be tested on the cytology specimens. These are miRNAs -192-5p, -215-5p and -194-5p. The
      investigators have also identified serum microRNAs in whole serum and exosomes by sequencing
      to study further. The investigators will also evaluate miRNA expression within biliary
      exosomes for the first time in patients with reflux related diseases.
