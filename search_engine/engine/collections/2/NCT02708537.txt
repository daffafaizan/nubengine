      biological responses. Obtaining plasma rich in growth factors is already widespread and
      simple protocol technique that is being used in various areas of medicine with superb
      results. Described many of the growth factors present in the PRGF are related to sperm
      parameters, especially motility The described effects have been studied in mammalian and each
      growth factor individually. PRGF contains a pool of growth factors and therefore be
      interesting to analyze their effect on various sperm parameters.

      One of those parameters is very important for fertilization sperm motility, since the lack of
      it will prevent displacement by the cervix to meet the egg in the fallopian tube.
