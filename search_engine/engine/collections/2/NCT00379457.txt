    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Improve the outcome in pediatric patients with low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) treated
           with vincristine and dactinomycin alone.

        -  Evaluate whether the outcome for older patients with standard-risk RMS with favorable
           features may be improved/maintained by administering a treatment with limited intensity.

        -  Evaluate whether chemotherapy intensity for patients with standard-risk RMS can be
           reduced, by lowering the cumulative dose of ifosfamide.

        -  Evaluate whether treatment can be reduced in a subgroup of patients with standard-risk
           RMS arising in an unfavorable site (e.g., parameningeal or other site) but with
           favorable site and age.

        -  Compare the value of standard chemotherapy comprising ifosfamide, vincristine, and
           dactinomycin with vs without doxorubicin (as early intensification in the initial part
           of treatment) in patients with high-risk RMS.

        -  Determine the role of low-dose maintenance chemotherapy comprising 6 months of
           cyclophosphamide and vinorelbine in patients with high-risk RMS.

        -  Improve the results in patients with poor prognosis (very high-risk) RMS treated with
           more intensive ifosfamide, vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin followed by
           maintenance chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-blinded, randomized, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to risk group (low risk vs standard risk vs high risk vs very high risk)
      and participating country.

        -  Stratum 1 (low-risk group): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1-4, 7-10,
           13-16, and 19-22 and dactinomycin IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22.

        -  Stratum 2 (standard-risk group): Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups
           according to their standard-risk subgroup.

             -  Subgroup B: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1,
                4, 7, and 10; vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1-7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25; and
                dactinomycin IV on day 1 in weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25.

             -  Subgroup C: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1,
                4, and 7; vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1-7; and dactinomycin IV on day 1 in
                weeks 1, 4, and 7. Patients are evaluated for tumor response in week 9. Patients in
                complete remission (CR) with favorable age and tumor size continue to receive
                ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin as above in weeks 10, 13, 16*, 19, 22,
                and 25. Patients may also undergo radiotherapy beginning in week 13 and continuing
                for 5-6 weeks. Patients in CR with unfavorable age or tumor size OR in partial
                remission (PR) (i.e., > 1/3 tumor volume reduction) continue to receive ifosfamide
                as above in weeks 10 and 16 and vincristine and dactinomycin as above in weeks 10,
                13, 16*, 19, 22, and 25. These patients also undergo radiotherapy beginning in week
                13 and continuing for 5-6 weeks. Patients with stable or progressive disease in
                week 9 proceed to second-line therapy and radiotherapy. Patients with residual
                disease after completion of chemotherapy in week 10 undergo surgical resection
                followed by ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin (with or without
                radiotherapy) as above in weeks 13, 16*, 19, 22, and 25.

             -  Subgroup D: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1,
                4, and 7; vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1-7; and dactinomycin IV on day 1 in
                weeks 1, 4, and 7. Patients are evaluated for tumor response in week 9. Patients in
                CR or PR continue to receive ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin as above in
                weeks 10, 13, 16*, 19, 22, and 25. Patients may also undergo radiotherapy beginning
                in week 13 and continuing for 5-6 weeks. Patients with stable or progressive
                disease in week 9 proceed to second-line therapy and radiotherapy. Patients with
                residual disease after completion of chemotherapy in week 10 undergo surgical
                resection followed by ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin (with or without
                radiotherapy) as above in weeks 13, 16*, 19, 22, and 25.

      NOTE: *Dactinomycin may be omitted during radiotherapy in week 16.

        -  Stratum 3 (high-risk group): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin as in subgroups C
                and D of stratum 2. Patients are evaluated for tumor response in week 9. Patients
                in CR or PR continue to receive ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin as in
                subgroups C and D of stratum 2. Patients may also undergo radiotherapy beginning in
                week 13 and continuing for 5-6 weeks. Patients with stable or progressive disease
                in week 9 proceed to second-line therapy and radiotherapy. Patients with residual
                disease after completion of chemotherapy in week 10 undergo surgical resection
                followed by ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin (with or without

                surgical resection followed by ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin (with or
                without radiotherapy) as above in weeks 13, 16*, 19, 22, and 25.

      NOTE: *Dactinomycin may be omitted during radiotherapy in week 16.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Patients who remain in CR or with minimal abnormalities on
           imaging studies after completion of therapy according to their randomized arm (as above)
           undergo a second randomization. Randomization occurs within 6 weeks after administration
           of the last course of chemotherapy on arm I or II.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive no maintenance chemotherapy.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
                oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
                up to 6 courses.

                  -  Stratum 4 (very high-risk group): Patients receive ifosfamide, vincristine,
                     and dactinomycin as in subgroups C and D of stratum 2. Patients also receive
                     doxorubicin as in arm II of stratum 3. Patients are evaluated for tumor
                     response in week 9. Patients in CR or PR continue to receive ifosfamide,
                     vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin as in arm II of stratum 3. Patients
                     may also undergo radiotherapy beginning in week 13 and continuing for 5-6
                     weeks. Patients with stable or progressive disease in week 9 proceed to
                     second-line therapy and radiotherapy. Patients with residual disease after
                     completion of chemotherapy in week 10 undergo surgical resection followed by
                     ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin (with or without radiotherapy) as
                     above in weeks 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25. After completion of chemotherapy,
                     patients with a limited quantity of viable tumor proceed to maintenance
                     chemotherapy.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1,
           8, and 15 and oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for up to 6 courses.

             -  Second-line therapy: Patients in any stratum with stable or progressive disease in
                week 9 receive 1 of 2 second-line therapy regimens.

        -  Regimen 1: Patients receive topotecan IV on days 1-3 and carboplatin IV on days 4 and 5
           in weeks 1 and 4. Patients are then evaluated for tumor response. Patients with good
           response receive topotecan IV on days 1-3 and cyclophosphamide IV on days 1 and 2 in
           weeks 7 and 13 and etoposide IV on days 1-3 and carboplatin IV on days 4 and 5 in weeks
           10 and 16. Patients with no response receive local therapy or a new chemotherapy
           regimen.

        -  Regimen 2: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 and carboplatin IV on days 1 and 2
           in weeks 1 and 4. Patients are then evaluated for tumor response. Patients with good
           response receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 in weeks 7, 10, 13, and 16; cyclophosphamide IV
           on days 1 and 2 in weeks 7 and 13; and carboplatin IV on days 1 and 2 of weeks 10 and
           16. Patients with no response receive local therapy or a new chemotherapy regimen.

      After completion of therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients will be accrued for this study.
