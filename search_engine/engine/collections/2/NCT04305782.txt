      result in changes in socket fit that lead to discomfort, skin injuries, and reduced mobility.
      It is known that limb fluid volume fluctuations can be reduced for some people by
      intermittently removing (doffing) the socket throughout the day. It is believed that
      partially doffing the socket may have a similar benefit, and could be made more convenient
      thereby promoting easier compliance for prosthetic users.

      The goal of the research is to create and evaluate a new technology for management of daily
      residual limb fluid volume fluctuation. The technology enables partial doffing through the
      release and relock of a socket panel and the prosthetic pin used to hold the limb in place.
      The expected outcomes are an enhanced understanding of how socket adjustments after activity
      facilitate limb fluid volume recovery, subsequent fluid retention, and improved socket fit.
