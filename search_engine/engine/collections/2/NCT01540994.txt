      deliver on a Monday through Friday basis. Recent phase I/II studies from Seattle and Palo
      Alto using stereotactic guidance to deliver high doses of radiation to the prostate over a 1
      to 2 week period of time suggest that outcomes may be equal or superior to standard
      approaches. These data, combined with markedly improved convenience for patients, make
      radiosurgery (SBRT) for early-stage prostate cancer an enticing option. The goal of this
      study is to offer a radiosurgical option to patients within the Sharp system under the
      umbrella of an IRB-approved study.
