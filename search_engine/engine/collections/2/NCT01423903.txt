      transcription (STAT) family of proteins in oncogenesis. One of the mechanisms of action of
      OPB-51602 includes inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. Therefore OPB-51602 is expected to be
      active as an anti-cancer drug. This first-in-human study will characterize the safety profile
      of OPB-51602, evaluate the pharmacokinetics of OPB-51602, identify a recommended phase II
      dose, and obtain preliminary efficacy data, in subjects with advanced cancers for whom there
      is no standard treatment available.
