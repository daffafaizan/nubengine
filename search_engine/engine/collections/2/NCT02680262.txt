      equally randomised into three arms: 1) Directly mailed a second reminder including a HPV
      self-sampling kit; 2) Mailed a second reminder offering a HPV self-sampling kit, to be
      ordered by e-mail, by text message, by phone, or by website; and 3) Mailed a second reminder
      for a conventional practitioner-collected sample (control group).
