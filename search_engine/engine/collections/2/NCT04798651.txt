      (CNS). MS is categorized into several distinct forms according to clinical symptoms and
      medical examinations. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is characterized by
      attacks of worsening neurologic function, followed by partial or complete recovery periods.
      Patients can also present a gradual but steady progression of the disease (progressive
      forms). While several treatment options are currently available, no treatment completely
      stops the disease progression. Therefore, a deeper understanding regarding the mechanism of
      the disease development is essential to generate more efficient treatment strategies. CD4 T
      cells are known to be significantly involved in the formation of the CNS lesions
      characteristic of MS.The investigators hypothesize that different types of B and CD4 T cells
      play major roles in different forms of the disease. They will determine the phenotype and
      functions of the cells from the immune system particularly B and CD4 T cells present in the
      blood and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or
      presenting a clinically isolated syndrome.

      The study will recruit 150 patients followed in Bordeaux University Hospital and diagnosed
      for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). Blood and CSF will be
      collected during a scheduled visit to study the properties of cells from the immune system in
      particular CD4 T cells in multiple sclerosis. Clinical and biological disease activity,
      treatment and outcomes will be studied in correlation with the properties of blood and CSF
      lymphocytes. No extra visit will be needed and the blood and CSF samples will be collected at
      the same times as those collected for clinical purposes.
