      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing sequences (fasted or standard high-fat
      breakfast) at a 1:1 ratio generated from a computer. Each dosing sequence will consist of 2
      cycles, with 1 dose in each cycle of the study and a washout period of at least 7 days
      between each dose. Study drug will be administered to subjects in the morning of each
      administration day of each cycle. PK, ECG, vital signs, physical examinations and laboratory
      tests will be performed as specified in the protocol. Tolerability and safety of the
      treatment will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events.
