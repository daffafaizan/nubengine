      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of adoptively transferred central memory-type CTL targeting
      ovarian cancer antigens administered alone, and in combination with, utomilumab, an agonistic
      anti-CD137 antibody, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

      II. Evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred central
      memory-type CTL with and without utomilumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti tumor effect of adoptively transferred central memory-type CTL targeting
      ovarian cancer antigens as measured by best overall response rate (BORR) and progression free
      survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of utomilumab.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on
      day -2, CD8-positive T-lymphocyte via infusion on day 0, and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC)
      every 12 hours for 14 days. Beginning 24 hours after CD8-positive T-lymphocyte, patients also
      receive utomilumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, and 141 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 3, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35,
      43, 49, 56, 64, 70, 77, 84, 112, and 140.
