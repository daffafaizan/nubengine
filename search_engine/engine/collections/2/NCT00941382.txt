      hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, and represents a risk factor for type 2
      diabetes. Although diet and exercise are valuable in this treatment, patient compliance is a
      major problem. Sibutramine has been shown to be a highly effective pharmacotherapy for weigh
      loss in obese patients, mediated by increased satiety and an enhancement of energy
      expenditure. Metformin is widely used for glycemia control and is associated with a small to
      moderate body weight loss. We are assessing the combination of sibutramine and metformin, two
      agents with different mechanisms of action for control of body weight and metabolic
      dysregulation.
