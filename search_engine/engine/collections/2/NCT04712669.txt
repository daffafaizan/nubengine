      treatment for PAH. This dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter study will evaluate the effect of Rodatristat Ethyl from baseline on pulmonary
      vascular resistance as measured at right heart catheterization.

      Patients will be enrolled into a main study with an option to enroll into an open label
      extension.

      The study is expected to enroll patients in the USA, Canada and Europe.
