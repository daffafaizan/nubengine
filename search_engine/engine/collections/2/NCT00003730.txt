        -  Determine the least toxic time of vinorelbine administration when combined with
           chronomodulated fluorouracil in women with previously treated metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and dose intensities of each drug in these women.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      chemotherapy (second line vs third line) and participating center. Patients are randomized to
      1 of 8 vinorelbine dosing times (0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800, or 2100).

      Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 20 minutes on days 1 and 6 and fluorouracil IV over 12
      hours according to a chronomodulated delivery rate (2200 to 1000 with a maximum dose at 0400)
      on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 3 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 80 patients (10 per dosing time) will be accrued for this
      study.
