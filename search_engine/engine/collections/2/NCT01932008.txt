      the term cardiorenal syndrome was used to describe the interaction between heart and kidney.
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor
      of cardiovascular disease, and the cardiovascular disease is one of most severe complication
      in patients with CKD. Previous studies have showed the changes in body composition, physical
      inactivity, decreased physical function, and poor quality of life existed in patients with
      either cardiovascular disease or CKD. Patients concomitant with cardiovascular disease and
      kidney insufficiency were expected to significantly increase physical dysfunction. However,
      few studies addressed on these alterations in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting
      (CABG) with CKD were reported.
