      assess the safety and immunogenicity in healthy adolescents in non-endemic area(s) for
      dengue.

      The study enrolled 400 healthy participants. Participants were randomized in 3:1 ratio to
      receive:

        -  TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Placebo normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl) for injection.

      In each trial group, participants received 2-dose schedule of TDV or placebo by subcutaneous
      injection on Days 1 (Month 0) and 90 (Month 3), but not all participants received both doses
      (8 subjects discontinued the trial before receiving the second dose).

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this
      study was 270 days. Participants had multiple visits to the clinic including a final visit at
      Day 270.
