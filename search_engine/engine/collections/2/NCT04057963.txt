      study group will instruct to perform both functional inspiratory muscle training and
      conventional treatments for neck pain, the patients in the control group will instruct to
      perform just conventional treatments. The severity of the pain, disability, fear of movement
      and depression levels will be assessed by visual analog scale, neck disability index, Tampa
      Scale of kinesiophobia and beck depression inventory, respectively. Neck postures
      (craniovertebral angle) will be evaluated by photogrammetric method.Endurance of deep
      cervical flexor muscles will be measured using Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit with
      cranio-cervical flexion test. Pain threshold will be measured by algometer from the middle
      point of upper trapezius. Cervical proprioceptions will be evaluated by laser pointer method
      in the right and left rotational directions. In addition, diaphragma thickness will be
      measured by two-dimensional ultrasonography. Assessments were repeated before and after the
      treatment.
