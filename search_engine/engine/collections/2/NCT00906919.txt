      merely provide information. Rather, educational programs must concentrate on behavior change
      and on supporting patients to become more confident and motivated in participating in
      managing their health. Persons with type 2 diabetes attending a Diabetes Education Centre
      will be assigned to either a group that receives regular professionally-led diabetes patient
      education (control group) or to to a group that receives regular professionally-led diabetes
      patient education augmented by lay-led self-management education i.e., the Stanford
      six-session Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (experimental group). Data will be
      collected at two points in time (0 and 6 months). Outcome measures will show if participants
      who receive self-management training in addition to regular patient education are able
      to:manage their diabetes more effectively; engage in the specific behaviors that keep the
      condition from worsening; achieve more control over their condition; and use the health care
      system more effectively.
