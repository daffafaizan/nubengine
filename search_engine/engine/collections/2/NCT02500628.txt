      Current diagnostic tests sample other tissues which often run on different fuels (fats),
      utilize unproven and often insensitive brain imaging scanners, or sequence thousands to
      millions of base-pairs of DNA. All of these tests are expensive. None of these tests
      accurately or completely capture the interactions between the 1000s of proteins involved in
      brain metabolism.

      The investigators suspect that mathematical analysis of the resting heart rate may provide
      some insight into brain metabolism. The brain controls heart rate in response to changes in
      blood pressure and blood gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen. Tight control of heart rate is
      necessary to make sure that the brain has the right mix of fuel and air. Because the brain
      can't respond instantly to changes in its fuel supply, this system acting as a biological
      carburetor has a natural oscillatory rhythm that can be monitored just like frequencies on
      the radio.

      The investigators propose to amplify these rhythms by modestly metabolically stressing the
      brain with metformin, a inhibitor of complex 1 in the mitochondria.
