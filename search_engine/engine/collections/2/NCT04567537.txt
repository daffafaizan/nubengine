    
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of laser treatment for the improvement of the
      clinical appearance of disorders of collagen metabolism, including hypertrophic scars and
      scleroderma. The investigators will be performing a randomized-controlled split-lesion study,
      where each patient will act as his or her own control. One half or side of the lesion will be
      randomized to receive laser treatment only.

      The investigators plan to have 20 patients (10 patients with hypertrophic scars and 10
      patients with scleroderma) complete the study.

      Subjects must be equal to greater than 18 years old, but may be any gender or Fitzpatrick
      skin type. They must have one of the following: at least one extragenital hypertrophic scar,
      or at least one extragenital area of scleroderma . Subjects must not have received any
      prescription or in-clinic medications or treatments, such as intralesional corticosteroids or
      excision, on the eligible scars/scleroderma in the previous 3 months. Those on
      anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications will also be excluded.
