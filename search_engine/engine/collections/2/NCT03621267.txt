      will be recruited and randomly assigned to either experimental group (n=20) or control group
      (n=20). The 12-week intervention comprises of 1-hour exercise per day and 3 days per week.
      The experimental group will receive interactive stepping exercise while the control group
      will be put under home exercise program. Primary outcome measures are executive function and
      gait variability. Secondary outcome measures include community walking test and other gait
      parameters (gait velocity, stride length and stride time). The participants will receive
      assessment at pre- and post-intervention
