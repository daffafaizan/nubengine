    
      Hypothesis: C-VATS is a feasible and safe method of entering the pleural space in order to
      perform pleural evaluation, pleural biopsy and pleurodesis in patients with pleural disease
      and/or pleural effusions.

      Objectives: Evaluate the safety and feasibility of C-VATS in patients with pleural disease.

      Design: Prospective, cohort, feasibility and safety study.

      Methods: Patients referred to all thoracic surgeons in the Division of Thoracic Surgery at
      the CHUM Notre Dame campus for the diagnosis or treatment of pleural based diseases will be
      screened for enrolment. The investigators plan to recruit 10 patients in this initial study.
      Eligible patients will be consented by one of the thoracic surgeons at the CHUM.

      All procedures will be performing in the operating room at the CHUM Notre Dame Hospital. All
      patients will be admitted prior to their procedure and treated on the post-operative thoracic
      surgery ward using standard post-VATS procedural treatments. All cause, as well as procedure
      specific morbidity will be recorded by the study investigators on the day of the procedure,
      every day in hospital until discharge and at 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post procedure.
