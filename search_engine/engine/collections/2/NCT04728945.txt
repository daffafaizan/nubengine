      head-down position. Informed consent will be obtained for study subjects who meet the
      selection criteria, and the subjects will be enrolled in Electronic Data Capture and
      randomized into two groups. Patients will be admitted to the operating room for induction of
      anesthesia and tracheal intubation. In the control group, mechanical ventilation will be
      performed according to the initial settings and protocols. In the intervention group, after
      intubation, the ventilator will be initially set up, and the first pulmonary recruitment will
      be performed immediately after the start of the laparoscopy, followed by recruitment every 30
      minutes until the end of the laparoscopy.
