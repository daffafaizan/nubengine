    
      The purpose of this two-group cluster randomized controlled trial is to determine the
      preliminary efficacy of an innovative intergenerational intervention on improving
      preschoolers' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and diet quality, and decreasing screen
      time, proportion of overweight and obesity, and body mass index z-score among Head Start
      preschoolers (aged 3-5 years) and their caregivers.

      The intervention is guided by an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, and will target both
      individual-level factors, including knowledge, self-efficacy, and skill, and
      socio-environmental factors, including parental support for child, parenting practices, and
      the home environment. The 16-week intervention has three components: 1) a caregiver component
      including 1a) a Facebook-based program with weekly electronic retrievable flyers providing
      health information and behavioral change strategies, and four weekly habit-formation tasks to
      create a healthier home environment for preschoolers; and 1b) three face-to-face meetings
      (weeks 1, 8, & 16) to establish personal connections and communication networks among
      caregivers and discuss strategies and share community resources to support behavioral changes
      at home; 2) a caregiver-preschooler learning component via Facebook messenger to send
      preschooler letters to each caregiver privately by the research team twice per week to share
      the preschooler's experiences of learning at school and his/her stated interests for healthy
      diet and physical activity at home, and to ask caregivers to respond to the letters; and 3) a
      Head Start center-based preschooler component to help preschoolers establish healthy habits
      via weekly healthy diet and PA participatory learning.

      From the eligible 13 Head Start centers with at least four classrooms in one Head Start
      organization, six Head Start centers will be randomly selected and assigned to the
      intervention (n = 3) or control (n = 3) group with usual Head Start activities. Four classes
      will be randomly selected from each selected Head Start center to be involved in the study.
      In each class, six caregiver-preschooler dyads will be randomly selected from the eligible
      participants, and total 24 caregiver-preschooler dyads will be recruited from each center,
      yielding a total of 144 dyads.

      Three specific AIMS are:

      AIM 1: Determine the preliminary efficacy of FirstStep2Health vs control among preschoolers
      on improving proximal behavioral changes of moderate to vigorous physical activity measured
      by accelerometry (primary outcome); diet quality (e.g., fruits/vegetables, fiber, whole
      grains, total protein, dairy, sugar-sweetened beverages, total sugars/fats), and screen time
      (e.g., watching television, playing video games); and decreasing distal anthropometric
      outcomes of proportion of overweight or obese and body mass index z-score. The investigators
      expect an overall decrease in body mass index z-score in intervention preschoolers because
      overweight or obese preschoolers' body mass index z-score is expected to decrease while
      healthy-weight preschoolers will have no change. The investigators focus on proximal
      behavioral changes as our primary outcome instead of distal anthropometric outcomes due to
      the brevity of this study and the need for behavioral changes to be maintained for at least a
      year before manifesting in changes in anthropometric outcomes.

      AIM 2: Examine the preliminary efficacy of FirstStep2Health vs control among caregivers on
      increasing their moderate to vigorous physical activity measured by accelerometry and diet
      quality; decreasing their screen time, proportion of overweight or obese, and body mass
      index; and improving their knowledge, feeding practice skill, self-efficacy, parental support
      of their child, parenting practices, and home environment.

      AIM 3: Compare FirstStep2Health vs control on the bidirectional relationship between
      preschoolers and caregivers on moderate to vigorous physical activity, diet quality, and
      screen time.

      Further, the investigators will validate established feasibility, acceptability, and
      satisfaction of the intervention using qualitative and quantitative data.

      This study forms the foundation for conducting a future large-scale randomized controlled
      trial to reduce overweight and obesity among low-income preschoolers and their caregivers.
