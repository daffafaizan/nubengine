    
      This is a cluster controlled trial conducted in a school setting. Two classes (intervention
      and control) of sixth grade will be selected from a large, centrally located school in
      Lisbon. The intervention will take place over a period of 16 weeks and will be composed of
      physical environmental (standing desks), social environment, and education/behavior
      components. Objective measurements of physical activity and sedentary behavior (ActiGraph
      GT3X+ accelerometer and activPAL inclinometer), school performance (students grades),
      attention (D2 test), memory (Rey complex figure), fluid intelligence (Raven's Progressive
      Matrices), visuo-spatial short term working memory (Corsi block-tapping test), processing
      speed and inhibitory function (Stoop test) will be assessed. Finally, anthropometry and
      stakeholders' perceptions will also be obtained at baseline and after the intervention.
