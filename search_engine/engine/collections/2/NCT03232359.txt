      thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are the two most well
      known, and are considered to be the most serious. TTP-HUS occurs more commonly in women and
      among women is commonly associated with pregnancy.

      Nevertheless, there are other pregnancy conditions that may manifest with TMA, including
      preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet
      count), in addition to acute fatty liver of pregnancy, antiphospholipid syndrome, and
      systemic lupus erythematosis.

      Assessment of immature platelets was introduced as a non-invasive test of real time
      thrombopoiesis. They are newly released in the circulation with a larger size & greater RNA
      content than mature platelets, and can be measured by automated haematology analyzer equipped
      with reticulocyte detection channel and described as immature platelet fraction (%-IPF) and
      immature platelet count (A-IPC).

      A high %-IPF has been suggested as an indicator of thrombocytopenia due to rapid platelet
      consumption, while a low %-IPF is characteristic of bone marrow suppression states.
      %-IPF/A-IPF has the competency to be performed routinely and, therefore, can provide
      therapeutic and diagnostic feedback in the life threatening conditions.

      The present study aimed to show the utility of estimating %-IPF and A-IPC using a
      reticulocyte detection channel CBC autoanalyzer as a simple reproducible blood analysis to be
      employed in the differential diagnosis of pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathic
      conditions.
