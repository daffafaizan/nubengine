    
      The study was performed as a single-dose (one 20 mg/25 mg tablet), two way crossover
      bioequivalence study with a wash out of 7 days between doses and with equal number of
      subjects randomly assigned to the sequence (AB or BA) in which they received the study Test
      (A) and Reference (B) treatments.

      Subjects were confined in the clinical facility for at least 10 hours before dosing and for
      24 hours after dosing. Subjects were discharged after 24-hours blood sample and returned as
      outpatients for the remaining blood samples. Standardized meals were served and no caffeine,
      alcohol, or grapefruit-containing foods or beverages were allowed to be consumed 24 hours
      before dosing or throughout study confinement.

      A total of 42 non-smoking subjects (24 men and 18 women) were randomized to receive single
      oral dose of Benazepril HCl/ Hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/ 25 mg tablet and 41 subjects
      completed both the periods of the study.
