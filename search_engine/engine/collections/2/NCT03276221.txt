      (1) if performance improves with abstinence beyond that observed with continued cannabis use,
      and if so, (2) when during abstinence cognitive improvement occurs, and (3) whether
      performance in abstinent individuals "returns" to performance levels observed in non-using
      peers. We hypothesized that abstinent adolescent cannabis users would have more
      neurocognitive improvement over four weeks compared to non-abstinent cannabis users, and
      performance would continuously improve throughout four weeks of abstinence. We will recruit
      210 adolescents with and without regular cannabis use. Eligible cannabis users will be
      randomized to either a contingency management intervention which will incentivize 4 weeks of
      cannabis abstinence (n = 70), or non-contingent monitoring with no abstinence requirement (n
      = 70). All participants (including non-users; n = 70) will complete cognitive assessments,
      toxicology testing, self-report questionnaires and semi-structured mood and substance use
      interviews during the 4-week study as well as one 30-day follow-up visit. Abstinence will be
      indexed by decreasing levels of cannabis metabolites in urine.
