    
      Stimulate STN (at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 70 and 130 Hz) in chronically implanted
      patients at rest and during simple and complex motor tasks while recording the steady state
      evoked potential over the cortex using EEG over the 19 sites of the classical 10/20 system
      and a channel to record artifact over the stimulator. Experiments will be carried out both in
      the OFF medication and ON medication condition.
