      demonstrated. The microbiota would have an influence on the effectiveness of anticancer
      treatments.

      Bladder cancers are five times more common in men than women, and this difference in
      incidence has long been explained by a higher smoking rate among men. However, the increase
      in smoking among women has not led, as in the case of lung cancer, to a significant increase
      in bladder cancer among them.

      Urine bladder has long been considered "sterile" by generations of researchers. Recent
      studies have shown that most urine is not sterile but instead contains a different microbiota
      in both men and women. In women Actinobacteria, including Mycobacteria, and Bacteroidetes
      have been detected.

      BCG therapy is used in the treatment of bladder cancer. BCG, in addition to being a vaccine
      to prevent tuberculosis, is a mycobacterium belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria [4].
      Controversial studies have suggested the same potential for Lactobacillus casei.
      Lactobacillii are Firmicutes found both in the urinary microbiota of men and women.

      Thus microbiota composed mainly of Actinobacteria could be associated with a lower incidence
      of bladder cancers in women.
