      tumor progression in patients who have developed androgen-independent (AIPC) or
      hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and who have a rising serum prostate specific
      antigen (PSA). In vitro studies have shown that fulvestrant downregulates androgen receptor
      (AR) in LNCaP cancer cell lines to a significant extent, thereby inhibiting growth of tumor
      cells. In addition, it is important to emphasize that fulvestrant has also been found to
      decrease growth of AR-negative prostate cancer cells. These observations provide the rational
      for using fulvestrant for the treatment of AIPC and HRPC.
