      different treatments, it is necessary to have quantitative outcome measures of high validity
      and reliability. The International Prophylaxis Study Group (IPSG - chair Dr. Victor
      Blanchette) was established in 2001 with the stated purpose of developing and testing outcome
      tools for this purpose. The group has developed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) score for
      quantifying arthropathy (representing the domain of structure and function domain in the ICF
      framework), a quantitative physical examination score, and the Hemophilia Joint Health Score
      or HJHS, to replace the older and less sensitive World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) score
      (representing the domain of structure and function in the ICF). In addition Canadian
      investigators have also developed a quality of life measure for boys with hemophilia, the
      Canadian Hemophilia Outcomes Kids' Life Assessment Tool or CHO-KLAT (representing the domain
      of participation in the ICF).

      We will use these tools, and other validated measures, to begin to determine the burden of
      hemophilia in Brazil and compare it to the burden of disease in Canada. Additionally, we will
      use this study to demonstrate the validity of these tools in the Brazilian population.
