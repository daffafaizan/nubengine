    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-418. TAK-418 is being tested in healthy
      participants in order to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      single oral doses.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 healthy participants. The study consists of equally
      divided 5 sequential cohorts of 8 participants each. In each of the following cohorts, 6
      participants will be randomized to receive TAK-418 and 2 participants will receive matching
      placebo-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Cohort 1: TAK-418 5 mg

        -  Cohort 2: TAK-418 15 mg

        -  Cohort 3: TAK-418 30 mg Fasted + TAK-418 30 mg Fed

        -  Cohort 4: TAK-418 40 mg

        -  Cohort 5: TAK-418 60 mg

      All participants will be asked to take TAK-418 or placebo-matching capsule once on Day 1 in
      each cohort. A washout period of 28-days will be maintained between the doses in Cohort 3.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants in this study
      will be assigned to one of 5 possible dose cohorts. Male participants will return for
      additional outpatient visits on Days 91 and 93 (+/- 7 days) and may return for outpatient
      visits on Days 182 and 184 (+/- 7 days) (depending on results from the Day 93 Visit).
