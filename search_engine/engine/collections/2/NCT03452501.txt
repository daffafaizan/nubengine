    
      A multicenter, observational, prospective, cohort study to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of biosimilar Infliximab (RemsimaÂ®) in newly diagnosed and in switched IBD
      patients diagnosed with active Crohn's disease (CD), fistulizing CD, or Ulcerative Colitis
      (UC). Each patient is expected to be treated for a total of 38 weeks if naive or 40 weeks if
      switched. The study duration will be between 46 and 48 weeks (up to 12 months). Follow-up is
      expected to end 8 weeks after the last treatment visit.
