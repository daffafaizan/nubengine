    
      This is an acute, observational, prospective, multi-center clinical study, evaluating
      coronary flow reserve (CFR) using the Volcano FloWire®. Subjects will be evaluated after
      treatment with orbital atherectomy and stenting of de-novo severely calcified lesions, due to
      coronary artery disease.

      Subjects who undergo successful revascularization using the Diamondback 360® Coronary Orbital
      Atherectomy System (OAS) and stenting are eligible for enrollment. Coronary blood flow of
      enrolled subjects will be measured with the Volcano FloWire®, Doppler velocity data recorded
      intra-procedurally, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) assessed at 24 hours or at
      discharge, whichever is earlier.

      Determination of CFR by Doppler flow measurements can assess physiological changes in the
      distal vascular bed. The primary endpoint of this study will evaluate coronary flow reserve
      after successful treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions using OAS and stent
      deployment. The secondary endpoint will measure the occurrence of post-procedural Major
      Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), including cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction (Q wave
      or non-Q wave), and target vessel revascularization.
