      rt-PA will be included. Patients are treated according to the local protocol, without any
      modification specifically for this study. A sample of 2 drops of the rt-PA used for the
      treatment is stored for analysis, to determine the sc-tPA/tc-tPA ration (immunostaining).

      700 patients are needed for the study assuming that a difference of 5% will be found in the
      primary outcome measure (modified Rankin scale 0-1 at 3 months) with alpha and beta risks
      respectively of 5% and 20%.

      The participating clinical centres recruit altogether more than 500 patients per year for
      thrombolysis. Assuming that 70% will be eligible, the recruitment should take less than 2
      years.
