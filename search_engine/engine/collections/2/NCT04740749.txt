      femur. To replace these large parts of missing bone, a prosthesis can be used. One innovative
      technology developed by Biomet is the CompressÂ® Compliant Pre-Stress System (CPS;
      Zimmer-Biomet, Warsaw, USA). This fixation device uses compression, via a short traction bar,
      to stimulate osteointegration at the bone-prosthetic interface, promote hypertrophy of the
      loaded bone, and avoid stress bypass of the host bone around a stiff intramedullary stem.
      Young patients cured of tumors have a long life expectancy and a compelling need for
      prosthetic fixation that is equally durable. Good bone fixation is a prerequisite for implant
      longevity. Since 1999, the CPS has been routinely placed on the orthopedics - UZ Leuven
      service and, as a result, more than 100 patients have been treated in this way. However,
      there are only few studies reporting on long-term performance of this system. In addition,
      limited data reporting functional outcome were found.

      Although the initial results are encouraging, there is a need for additional mid- to
      long-term survival data from larger patient series showing longevity of the system, as well
      as reporting of functional outcome. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no study
      examining the survival of the device using prospective data already exists. In addition, no
      studies were found examining the quality of life of the patients with the CPS system.
