        -  To test for association of polymorphisms in Fc-gamma (Fcγ) receptors IIa (H/R131) and
           IIIa (V/F158) with progression-free survival and clinical response in patients with
           follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with rituximab and CHOP chemotherapy comprising
           cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, and prednisone.

        -  To assess novel polymorphisms in Fcγ receptors for predictive and prognostic
           significance in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Genomic DNA extracted from paired samples of serum and formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded tissue is analyzed for R131H polymorphism in Fcγ receptor IIa and V158F
      polymorphism in Fcγ receptor IIIa by TaqMan-based assay. The DNA is also analyzed for
      genotypes corresponding with several other polymorphisms in Fcγ receptors, as determined by
      the HapMap project. The resulting Fcγ receptor genotypes are then compared with clinical data
      from the Southwest Oncology Group database to identify associations between particular
      genotypes and progression-free survival, overall response, and complete response. A
      multivariate analysis incorporating clinical prognostic variables (e.g., age, stage, serum
      LDH level, extranodal disease, and performance status) is also performed to determine whether
      Fcγ receptor polymorphisms are independent predictive or prognostic markers for clinical
      outcome.
