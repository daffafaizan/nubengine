a kinetic study of nickel(ii), complexes of sulfur-containing amino acidthe rate expression for the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)ligand exchange reaction with nickel(cysteine) is.. rate = k(complex) +kedta (complex)(edta) . this two-term rate expression is characteristicof square planar complexes and agrees with the square planarconfiguration of ni(cysteine) reported on the basis of spectral studiesthe edta-independent term of the rate expression is an acid-catalyzedterm and can be written k (h) (complex) . the value of kn is 2.5 x 10 msec while the value of kedta is only on the order of 10 -10 m sec . theedta reaction with ni(cysteine) methyl ester) is very similar to thereaction with ni(cysteine) . when the sulfur-containing amino acidligand contains a thiol ether, the kinetic differences are striking .ligand exchange reactions of edta, triethylenetetramine, anddiethylenetriamine with nickel-methionine complexes are several ordersof magnitude faster and give products that are mixed-ligand complexes .the results of this kinetic study of amino acid complexes containingsulfhydryl and thiol ether sulfur groups support other studies atequilibrium which suggest sulfur coordination and square planarcomplexes for the sulfhydryl groups and octahedral complexes with nosulfur coordination for thiol ethers .
