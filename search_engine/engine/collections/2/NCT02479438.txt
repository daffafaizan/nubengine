      similar disease of the stomach, esophagus or digestive tract. Each patient undergoing
      anti-reflux surgery will be asked to participate in the registry to gather preoperative,
      intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. The data collected from the registry will be used
      to assess the outcome of various treatments, both standard and new: some specific areas of
      interest include the long-term effects of treatment (or no treatment), the progression of the
      disease over time, and the overall length of survival of the patient.
