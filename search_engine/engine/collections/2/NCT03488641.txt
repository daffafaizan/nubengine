      of targeted drugs is emerging in leukemia and lymphoma it remains clinical reality that most
      genetic information is not used for therapeutic stratification. This is in part based on the
      shortcomings of traditional biomarker discovery within clinical trials, where throughput is
      limited in both, drug number and sample size. If it were possible to map the variable pathway
      dependencies and drug sensitivity patterns in individual patients it is likely to become an
      asset to identify genotype-phenotype associations, understand the underlying complexities of
      molecular networks and further precision medicine stratification.

      To link clinical outcome and ex-vivo drug response assays, the investigators systematically
      measure pathway sensitivity and resistance of primary tumor cells ex-vivo using a diverse
      compound library for individual patients in need of treatment. By systematically analyzing
      ex-vivo drug response patterns, tumors should be functionally grouped, by response phenotype.
      While for the purpose of this study selection of a specific treatment will not be based on
      ex-vivo drug response assays, clinical response- and follow-up data of patients will be
      prospectively collected in parallel.
