    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study. Eighteen healthy
      volunteers will be recruited. Lispro (0.2 units/kg) will be administered by jet injector or
      by conventional pen and a seven-hour euglycemic clamp test will be performed. PK-PD profiles
      of lispro will be calculated.
