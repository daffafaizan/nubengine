      level of consciousness with bispectral analysis (BIS) in ICU patients who are
      pharmacologically paralyzed with NMBAs (neuromuscular blockade agents) and to assess such
      things as the amount of time required to achieve the appropriate level of sedation/analgesia.
      Data will be collected and evaluated via this FDA approved equipment. The intent of this
      project is to evaluate this technology in those who are requiring "anesthesia" like states
      (use of NMBAs) for prolonged periods in the critically ill patient population.
