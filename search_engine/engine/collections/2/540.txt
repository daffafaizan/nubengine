5512. antigenic properties of human tumourspreliminary studies on the antigenicproperties of human tumours have beencarried out using heterologous antisera,prepared in rabbits, against a number ofdifferent cancerous and normal tissues.after repeated absorptions, antiserawere obtained which reacted only withtissue antigens.  some antisera, after ab-sorption with normal tissues, reacted onlywith tumours.  seventy-two tumour and31 normal tissue extracts were studiedby means of the ouchterlony agar geldouble diffusion technique.  the resultsshowed the presence of an antigen orantigens in some human malignant tumourswhich were not detectable in normaltissues, in foetal tissues, or in hela cells.in addition, there was some loss ofnormal tissue antigens from tumours.attempts are being made to isolate andcharacterize these tumour and normaltissue antigens.
