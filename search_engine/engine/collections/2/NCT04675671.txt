    
      One day before the scheduled surgery, a staff who was not included in this study will assign
      patients to the random Pregabalin group (n = 30) and the Control group (n = 30) according to
      a will be computerized randomization table. The hospital pharmacy will prepare all
      medications in same capsules, and all the medications of study drug will performe by a nurse,
      who was not involved in other process of this study administered the capsules orally with
      sips of water. Group pregabalin patients will receive 75 mg of pregabalin twice daily for 2
      days before surgery. the Control group will receive plasebo capsule mg at the same point in
      time. The last doses one hour before induction of anesthesia. The double-blind design in this
      study included blinding of anesthesiologist, orthopedic surgeon, nurse giving the drugs, and
      the patients.

      No other sedative premedication will be given to all patients. Anesthesia will induce with
      propofol 2 mg.kg-1and remifentanil 0.5-1 µg.kg-1, and tracheal intubation will facilitate
      with rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg-1. Anesthesia will maintaine with a continuous infusion of
      remifentanil 0.05-0.2 µg.kg-1.min-1 and sevoflurane 2-2.5 vol% to maintain a bispectral index
      scale (BIS) values of 40 to 60. All surgeries will be performed by an experienced orthopedic
      surgeon. At the end of the surgery, sevoflurane and remifentanil will stop and residual
      neuromuscular paralysis will antagonize, and extubation will performe when the patient had
      sufficient expiration. Age, gender, body mass index, the duration of anesthesia surgery and
      the type of surgery will record. In the preoperative period, and duration of operation will
      be measured.
