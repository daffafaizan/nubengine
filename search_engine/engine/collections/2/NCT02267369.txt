      Widespread use of social media is both a contributing factor, and a potential solution;
      however the cost-effective use of social media to promote fitness on college campuses is
      poorly understood. This study aims to identify what features of social media - promotional
      messaging or peer networks - can increase physical activity levels.

      In this randomized controlled trial, participants are randomized to three conditions: basic
      online program for enrolling in university-run weekly fitness workshops, media condition that
      supplements the basic program with promotional media messages, and a social condition that
      replaces the media content with a network of peers. Participants are limited to graduate and
      professional students at a large northeastern university.
