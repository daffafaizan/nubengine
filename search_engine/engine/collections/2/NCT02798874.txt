      Hospital between September 2013 and March 2015. STEMI was defined as typical chest pain
      lasting N30 min within the previous 12 h, a clear ST-segment elevation of N0.1 mV in ≥2
      contiguous electrocardiographic leads, and elevated blood levels of troponin T. We screen
      high-risk patients through no-reflow risk prediction model， patients were scheduled to
      undergo diagnostic cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions. We randomly
      assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel
      600 mg 30 min before PCI.

      The primary efficacy variable was the prevalence of no-reflow assessed immediately post
      procedure. Secondary efficacy variables were troponin T (TnT), high sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA),
      endothelin-1 (ET-1), and nitric oxide (NO) level
