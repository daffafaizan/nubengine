      during the prevailing RSV season. According to the requirements for non-interventional or
      observational studies, no diagnostic or monitoring procedures were applied to the
      participants included in the study other than those which would ordinarily be applied in the
      course of the individual therapeutic strategy. Only data which were part of routine medical
      care were collected.

      Data collection was conducted initially in season 2002/2003 using paper-based case report
      forms (CRFs); beginning in season 2008/2009 a protected internet-based data entry platform
      was used. Both the paper-based CRFs and the electronic system were subject to changes during
      the whole time of the registry.

      Data collection for registry seasons 2002/2003 - 2006/2007 was conducted by use of
      paper-based CRFs and hospitalization forms. Corresponding results were published in 2011 and
      are hence depicted together and reported here as a separate reporting group.

      Registry seasons 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 were considered transitional years in the process of
      switching the type of data collection to an electronic CRF (eCRF) system. Although data
      collection of registry 2007/2008 was still paper-based, it was not included in the original
      publication and hence, results are reported separately. In season 2008/2009 the mode of data
      collection was switched from paper-based CRFs to an eCRF system, however, several physicians
      still used the paper-based CRFs for documentation. In order to use all documentations and
      lose as few data as possible, results for 2008/2009 are based on a combination of paper-based
      CRF and eCRF data. Hence, it was decided to keep the results for 08/09 separate from the
      depiction of the homogenous, eCRF-based results of the following seasons.

      Data collection for registry 09/10 - 15/16 was implemented by an eCRF system. Corresponding
      results are therefore depicted together in one reporting group.
