    
      Therapists in each of 18 participating RTFprograms that serve adjudicated youth are
      randomized to receive either:

        1. W TF-CBT implementation strategy, provided via the free distance learning resources
           TF-CBTWeb, (www.musc/edu/tfcbt) and TF-CBTConsult (www.musc.edu/tfcbtconsult); or

        2. W+L implementation strategy, provided through W + 2 day TF-CBT training plus one year of
           twice monthly TF-CBT consultation calls with a TF-CBT expert trainer.

      All RTF staff receive one day training in trauma-informed care. All therapists in both
      conditions receive training in screening youth for trauma exposure and symptoms. Data are
      collected regarding primary outcomes of: 1) number of youth therapists in each condition
      screen for trauma symptoms, 2) number of youth consent to TF-CBT treatment; 3) number of
      youth complete TF-CBT, 4) TF-CBT fidelity during treatment. Secondary outcomes include
      1)changes in therapist knowledge and satisfaction regarding TF-CBT treatment and 2) youth
      outcomes including PTSD symptoms, depression and satisfaction with treatment.
