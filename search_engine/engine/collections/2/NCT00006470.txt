        -  Determine the humoral and T-cell response to adjuvant monoclonal antibody 11D10
           anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine with
           radiotherapy in patients with completely resected stage II or IIIA non-small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of
           this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 3H1
      anti-idiotype vaccine intracutaneously in separate sites once weekly for 3 weeks beginning
      2-7 weeks (no later than 49 days) after surgery and then subcutaneously once monthly for 2
      years regardless of disease progression. Beginning no more than 1 week after the third
      postoperative vaccination, all patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.
      Patients with extracapsular nodal metastases or T3 lesions also undergo 6 additional
      radiotherapy boosts.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
