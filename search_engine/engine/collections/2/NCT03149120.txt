      associated with an improvement in progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months compared to
      historical controls of placebo and pazopanib alone respectively.

      This is a randomized, Phase 2 study of nivolumab alone or nivolumab plus pazopanib in adult
      (â‰¥ 18 years old) male and female subjects with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma
      either ineligible to receive an anthracycline-based first line treatment or after one prior
      systemic therapy. Up to 33 and 46 subjects will be randomized (1:1) in the nivolumab and
      nivolumab plus pazopanib cohorts respectively, with a Simon two-stage design. Preliminary
      endpoint analysis will be performed when at least 18 subjects in the nivolumab cohort and 16
      subjects in the nivolumab plus pazopanib cohort, have completed the first 12 cycles of
      nivolumab (6 months). Accrual duration is expected to be around 2 years.
