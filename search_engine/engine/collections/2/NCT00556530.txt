    
      22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a disorder caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome
      22. Most people with this disorder are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building
      blocks on chromosome 22 within each cell. This disorder affects many areas of the body.
      People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may have heart defects, immune deficiency, kidney
      abnormalities, hearing loss, and cleft palate or other facial deformities. Many children
      experience developmental delays and learning disabilities, and they have an increased risk of
      developing mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar
      disorder. All people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing the same sequence of DNA, but
      the severity of this disorder varies widely; some people are diagnosed with multiple health
      and developmental problems, while others experience very few symptoms. In some people, the
      symptoms may be so minimal that they are not even aware they have 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
      This study will examine genetic material-either from blood or saliva-among people with
      22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Participants will attend one study visit and undergo either blood
      or saliva collection. By analyzing the DNA sequences of participants, the study will aim to
      identify any genetic variations that may affect the severity of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
