      cause .Its' estimated occurrence is in 20 to 30 people per 100,000 people per year. The
      occurence is greater in patients older than 65 years old and lower in children younger than
      13 years old. There are many estimated etiologies for Bell's palsy, such as failure of the
      vasa nervosa, viral infections, ischemic neuropathies and auto immune reactions. Of those,
      viral hypothesis is the most widely accepted.

      The prognosis for recovery for most patients is 80% to 90%. One series showed that only 17
      out of 1505 patients demonstrated moderate to severe sequela and none had complete facial
      nerve paralysis. The common practice for the management of Bell's palsy consists of oral
      steroids with or without the antiviral medications. A recent study made by the Department of
      Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck surgery in Korea indicated that Intratympanic
      injections could replace the use of oral steroids . Another recent study by Jong job lee et
      al. has shown that Intratympanic injections have prolonged uptake in rats, in comparison to
      Intraperitoneal injections.
