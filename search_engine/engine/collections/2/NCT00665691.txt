      to teach health care professionals to identify at-risk patients by doing a nutrition physical
      exam. The PEDSGA also includes questions that the patient/caregiver answers regarding
      appetite, recent treatment, and activity level. This method of screening is new and may be
      able to identify at-risk patients better than the standard method. This study will use both
      methods and evaluate the two, in hope of determining which method works best to identify
      at-risk patients.
