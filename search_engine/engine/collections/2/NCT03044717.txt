      done with a 3-hour nutrition module provided by the Gaples Institute. The Gaples Institute is
      a non-profit organization advocating natural strategies balanced with conventional medicine.
      The module will be provided free of charge for this education. There will also be a
      prevention education conference once every five weeks.

      The secondary aim is to affect change in clinical practice among fellows and faculty. With an
      intensive nutrition education spanned over six months, the goal is to see if investigators
      can affect change in clinical practice. The nutrition module online will be available to
      those who participate in the study. The study participants are required to complete the
      3-hour nutrition module prior to the six month completion of this study.
