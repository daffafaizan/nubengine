      Primary

        -  Determine if the prostate-specific antigen objective response (complete and partial
           response) rate is > 0.2 in patients with androgen-independent advanced prostate cancer
           treated with fulvestrant.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 0, 14, and 28. Courses repeat once a
      month in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
