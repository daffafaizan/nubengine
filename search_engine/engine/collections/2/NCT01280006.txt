        1. Cardiovascular effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on cerebral, vascular, blood pressure
           and homeostatic responses following chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure.

        2. Ventilatory response of cyclooxygenase inhibitors following chronic intermittent hypoxia
           exposure

        3. Evaluate the renal hemodynamic effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure and
           cyclooxygenase inhibition.
