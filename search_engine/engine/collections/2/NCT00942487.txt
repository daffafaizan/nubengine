        1. PRIMARY:

             -  Longitudinal myocardial velocities at rest (assessed by tissue Doppler
                echocardiography)

             -  Systolic functional reserve (calculated as the absolute and relative increase of
                the myocardial systolic velocities at peak stress from rest)

             -  Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, NT-pro BNP) after a 6-months period of treatment
                with nebivolol versus metoprolol. An improvement of more than 20% of the myocardial
                resting velocities of systolic functional reserve is considered to be clinically
                relevant. The working hypothesis is that the improvement of subclinical left
                ventricular dysfunction after 6 months of treatment is going to be greater in
                patients who receive nebivolol than in those who receive metoprolol.

        2. SECONDARY:

             -  Global systolic function (ejection fraction)

             -  Radial myocardial velocities

             -  Right ventricular function

             -  Global diastolic function

             -  Left ventricular mass index
