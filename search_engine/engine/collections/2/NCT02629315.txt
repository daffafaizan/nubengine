      tissue fixation. Specimens were randomized after the surgical procedure. The perivisceral fat
      was removed from the stomach and the lymph node stations disected and then fixed in formalin
      or carnoy's solution for 24-48h. After dissection the residual fat from the formalin group
      was re-fixed in carnoy and re-disected.
