      detection of pregnancy. This study aims to demonstrate that the pregnancy test has the
      required performance characteristics in lay user testing. The study will recruit a
      cross-section of the target pregnancy test user population, that is, women aged over 18 years
      representative of the intended user.

      A minimum of 300 women will be required to complete the study consisting of both pregnant and
      not pregnant volunteers. Each volunteer will conduct the pregnancy test using their preferred
      sampling method (either 'in-stream' or 'dip'). Volunteers will be evaluated against confirmed
      pregnancy status. Lay user comprehension of the device instructions and usability of the
      device will also be assessed.
