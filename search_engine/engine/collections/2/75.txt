postural changes in blood distribution and its relation to the change incardiac output .(1) cardiac output and the blood content indices of the several partsof the body were measured in 18 subjects including patients with variousdiseases using external radioisotope counting techniques . changes inthese 2 parameters induced by standing were compared with each other .(2) average changes in blood distribution produced by standing were asfollows . decrease in blood content in the /lung/ (-25 ) and in the/heart/ (-26 ) and increase in the /thigh/ (+56 ) were statisticallysignificant . no significant change was revealed in the /head/, /palm/,/liver/ and /abdomen/ .(3) cardiac output and stroke volume decreased by standing in most ofthe cases . recent data were added to those reported previously and weretreated statistically . average decrease in cardiac output was -13 in 6control cases, -35 in 16 cases with neurocirculatory asthenia and -35 in10 cases with hyperthyroidism . the difference was significant betweencontrol and neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced a substantialincrease in cardiac output in a case of idiopathic nodal rhythm,although there remains a doubt whether it is the ordinary response inthis disease .(4) significant linear correlation was revealed between per centchange of blood content in the /thigh/ or in the /lung/ and that ofcardiac output or stroke volume induced by standing . minimal bloodshift was observed when the latter was extreme, and vice versa . thisimplies as follows.. reactivity of the heart might be influenced byposture, and transmural pressure of veins and or capillaries is probablyadjusted, as in arterioles, to compensate for changes in cardiac output
