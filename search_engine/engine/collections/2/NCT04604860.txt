    
      The study consists of two visits, baseline and 12-week follow-up, with at least one follow-up
      phone call on a weekly basis. Visit one is expected to last for 30 minutes and visit 2 for 60
      minutes, whereas each phone call should take no more than 15 minutes. Twice during the study
      period, the investigators will draw serum and plasma samples for future translational
      research. Daily, the physical trainer will review collected data on EL-FIT research database
      and Fitabase. Each participant will have an exit interview by the end of week 12 with the
      trainer and a member of the research team to talk about their impressions of using EL-FIT and
      Fitbit, through a structured questionnaire assessing about how user friendly it was to use
      the EL-FIT app. Finally, trainers will be asked to compare the type of prescription that they
      provided to patients as part of the standard of care (based on liver frailty index or
      6-minute walk test), to compare it with the allocation provided by EL-FIT stratification
      algorithm.

      To learn about how to improve EL-FIT the investigators will ask patients and their caregivers
      open-ended questions as part of their exit interview. This will allow us to identify barriers
      precluding them from keeping up with physical trainer recommendations, and what would they
      like to include to enhance motivation as part of a physical activity program. A member of the
      research team will act as a facilitator during this session.
