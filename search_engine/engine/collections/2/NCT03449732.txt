      response to incremental nociceptive stimuli. The PDR is a robust reflex, even in patients
      under general anesthesia, and may provide a potential evaluation of the autonomous
      nociceptive circuit. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I or II
      patients from the age of 28 days till 18 years undergoing elective surgery under general
      anesthesia are recruited. Enrolled patients perioperative undergo PDR measurement at 2
      different standardized times (before and after opioid administration) generated by an inbuilt
      pupillary pain index (PPI) protocol. PPI, as a surrogate for nociception includes noxious
      stimulations from 10 up to 60 milli ampere (mA) until pupil dilation is larger than 13% from
      baseline diameter. Therefore, no inappropriate high stimulation is executed.
