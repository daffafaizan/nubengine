      with hypertension and diabetes. In CKD patient, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading
      cause of mortality. The lipidemic disorder is one of the CV risk factors in CKD but it was
      not fully concerned in Viet Nam.

      Hypocholesterolemia therapy has shown many benefits; however, its effects on OS and
      endothelial function are still not fully evidenced.

      In clinical practice, physicians always concern the effects and safety before giving the
      prescription. However, despite the high frequency of statin treatment, only 1/3 of CKD
      patients achieved the LDL-C goal. Whether high-dose of statins mono-therapy is more effective
      in LDL-C lowering is still unclear, but are associated with a high rate of hepatotoxicity,
      myopathy.

      Lowering LDL-C with statin mono-therapy and statin/ezetimibe combination reduces the risk of
      CVD in population without kidney disease. Which Cholesterol-lowering therapies are suitable
      for stage 3,4 CKD patients in term of e-GFR reduction and side effects? There is no data
      related to this field in the Vietnamese CKD population.

      Thus, more advanced lipid-lowering therapies and a better understanding of the mechanism is
      needed for treatment strategy of hyperlipidemia in Vietnamese patients with CKD.
