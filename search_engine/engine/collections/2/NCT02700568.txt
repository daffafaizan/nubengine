    
      Axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor,
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î±, and c-kit. The trial of comparative effectiveness
      of axitinib versus sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (AXIS) was an international
      randomized Phase III study designed for registration purposes. This trial randomized 723
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with any prognostic features to axitinib or
      sorafenib in the second-line setting and demonstrated significant clinical benefit of
      axitinib.

      Aim of present FavorAx study is to evaluate preliminary efficacy and safety of Axitinib in
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with favorable IMDC prognostic factors who had
      progressed on sunitinib or pazopanib in the first-line setting.
