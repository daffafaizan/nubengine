      or her parents. Facilitating relational insights, the key components of the Connecting
      Through Caregiving (CTC) intervention involves the following: 1) enhancing self-awareness of
      the caregiver, 2) developing interpersonal empathy of the care-recipient, 3) help-seeking, 4)
      balancing self-care and caring for others and 5) negotiating action plans. The CTC
      intervention is be evaluated against a basic skill training intervention consisting of
      scheduling pleasant events, communicating with the care recipient and other family members.
      Dementia caregivers providing at least 14 hours of care per week to a parent living with
      dementia are recruited and randomized into one the two conditions. The intervention lasts for
      six weeks for both conditions. Intervention in the first week consists of a home visit and a
      telephone follow-up. From the second to fifth week, there are weekly four telephone phone
      sessions. In the sixth week, there were two more telephone calls to consolidate the
      intervention and to review implementation plans.
