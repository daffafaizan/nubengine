    
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ToleroMune Grass in grass allergic subjects
      with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The efficacy of ToleroMune Grass will be explored in
      subjects using an EEU (Environmental Exposure Unit).

      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a
      maximum of 16 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic,
      at the Investigator's discretion. Baseline Challenge will consist of 4 visits to the EEU at
      least 3 days before randomisation.

      In Period 2, subjects in each cohort complying with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomised to one of four groups and will receive treatment every 2 weeks (Â±2 days) for 14
      weeks.

      In Period 3, Post Treatment Challenge will consist of 4 visits to the EEU about 25 weeks
      after the first administration in the treatment period and assessments will be performed
      identical to those at the baseline challenge. Follow-up will be conducted 3-10 days after
      PTC.
