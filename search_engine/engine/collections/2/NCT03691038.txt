      it appears to have several side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and edema, which
      lowers compliance with medications. A way to reduce side effects is the flexible dose
      regimen, which reaches the target dose to treat the drug. The proposed flexible dose regimen
      is a regimen that begins with twice the prevalence of 75 mg. However, dizziness is the most
      common side effect up to 20% in conventional flexible dose regimen. Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to propose a new flexible regimen starting at a dose less than the existing
      dose and to compare compliance with pregabaline according to both methods
