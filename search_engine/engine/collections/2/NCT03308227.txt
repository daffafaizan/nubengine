      patients may influence antibiotics' pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. The pharmacokinetics and
      tissue distributions of linezolid achieving effective concentrations are key factors of
      successful clinical outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, no observational clinical studies
      are available on the plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations of linezolid in
      septic shock patients. Severe pneumonia patients known or suspected to be caused by
      Gram-positive pathogens will be considered eligible for the study when the attending
      physician prescribed linezolid as treatment. The plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
      concentrations of linezolid are measured in each group at steady state. In an in vitro PK
      Model, concentration-time curve is drawn to calculate %T>MIC or AUC0-24h/MIC. Linezolid
      pharmacodynamics evaluation should be based on bacterial eradication and clinical outcomes.
