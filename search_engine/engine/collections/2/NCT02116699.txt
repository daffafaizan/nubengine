      mother's colostrum (OMC) and milk (OMM) protect against neonatal morbidity and are rich in
      immune factors which may provide immunostimulatory effects when administered oropharyngeally
      to extremely premature infants during the first weeks of life. This 5-year
      placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial will evaluate the safety,
      efficacy and health outcomes of oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM in a sample of 622
      (total patients enrolled) extremely premature infants with the following aims: Aim 1. To
      determine if oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM to extremely premature infants will
      reduce the risk of late-onset sepsis or death as the primary outcome, and necrotizing
      enterocolitis and ventilator-associated pneumonia as pre-planned secondary outcomes. Aim 2:
      To determine if extremely premature infants who receive OMC/OMM via the oropharyngeal route
      have a shorter time to reach full enteral feeds and a shorter length of hospital stay. Aim 3:
      To determine if oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM will have immunostimulatory effects
      for extremely premature infants, as measured by (A) enhancement of gastrointestinal (fecal)
      microbiota, (B) improvement in antioxidant defense maturation or reduction of pro-oxidant
      status, and (C) maturation of immunostimulatory effects as measured by changes in urinary
      lactoferrin. Results will confirm whether extremely premature infants demonstrate a
      host-immune response to this intervention and whether there is a beneficial effect on common
      morbidities in these high risk patients.
