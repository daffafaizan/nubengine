      the normal aging process. This natural transformation in the eye occurs as a result of the
      loss of accommodation of the crystalline lens, a condition known as presbyopia. Presbyopia,
      characterized by a progressive, age-related loss of accommodation (i.e., the lens ability to
      focus clearly over a wide range of distances), is most prevalent of all visual deficiencies,
      affecting 100% of the population over the course of a normal life span. Loss of accommodation
      begins early in life and, for an emmetropic eye, generally culminates in a complete loss of
      functional near vision.

      ReVision Optics has developed the Raindrop corneal inlay for the correction of near vision.
      The Raindrop is a 2mm corneal inlay, as small as a pinhead, thinner than a human hair and
      about 1/500th of a droplet of water. The inlay is the same refractive index as the human
      cornea. The inlay is placed in the non-dominant eye,centered over the pupil after a corneal
      flap (LASIK)has been made. The Raindrop is expected to provide presbyopic subjects with
      improvement of near and intermediate vision.
