      Measurements : A correlation coefficient between the variations of regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation (rScO2) as a surrogate of cerebral blood flow and the variations of arterial blood
      pressure (ABP) is calculated as an index of autoregulation (cerebral oxygenation index (COx),
      ICM+ softwareÂ®). CA is monitored either on left (COxl) or both sides. A COx > 0.3 is
      considered as critical. Neurological outcome is assessed by the onset of an acute neurologic
      event (ANE) during the ECMO run.
