      laboratory for isolation of immune cells. These immune cells are then proliferated over a two
      week period and used to produce the patented product IKC (Immune Killer Cells). The IKC will
      then infused back into the patient to treat the cancer. Each patient will receive a total of
      twelve infusions.

      60 patients are anticipated to be recruited. This is a double-arm study, the experimental
      group will receive IKC treatment along with TACE treatment. The control group will receive
      only TACE treatment. 30 patients will be randomized into each arm.
