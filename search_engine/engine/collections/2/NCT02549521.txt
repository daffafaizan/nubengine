      participate in this study. They were all healthy without any signs of osteoporosis, or
      fractures.They were stimulated to participate by having done bone density measurements free.
      Patients who had used biphosphonates, oestrogens, glucocorticoids , diuretics,
      immunomodulating agents, or prolonged use of heparin were excluded.

      Patients with possible secondary osteoporosis due to primary hyperthyroidism or chronic lung
      disease were also excluded. The participants were randomized into placebo or Mg-treatment
      groups. They were seen by the dietician, and blood and urine samples were taken at day 0, 7
      and 28 at the same time these days. Medicine was prepacked for intake twice daily. They
      received medicine for 30 days and should only take for 28 days. The number of tablets which
      should be left was controlled the last day. The participants were informed about the results
      of the bone density measurements taken the first and the last day. All the patient contacts
      were undertaken by the same dietician.
