      patients treated on GOG protocol 158 when their tumors are reclassified into a two-tier
      grading system. Although no universal grading system exists, Malpica et al. have recently
      published data on a clinically meaningful two-tier grading system for serous ovarian
      carcinoma (Malpica et al., American Journal of Surgical Pathology, 2004). Tumor grade has
      been shown to be an important prognostic factor in women with epithelial ovarian cancer,
      especially in early stage carcinomas. While there is less consensus regarding the prognostic
      significance of grade in late stage tumors, researchers have noted that patients with
      low-grade advanced disease may have a longer survival than those with high-grade lesions
      (Bodurka-Bevers et al., Gynecologic Oncology, 2000).
