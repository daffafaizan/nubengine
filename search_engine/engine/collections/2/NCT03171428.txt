      was applied. Among 744 patients, 246 undergoing hepatectomy with TAA and 246 undergoing
      hepatectomy with AA were compared. These patients were matched for baseline characteristics,
      underlying liver disease, comorbidity, tumor features, and extent of the resection. The rates
      of morbidity and mortality were the study endpoints.
