    
      Period 1 was double-blind and randomized 8 subjects (1:1 allocation ratio by gender) to XG005
      and 2 subjects (1:1 allocation ratio by gender) to placebo. Subjects were enrolled
      sequentially into a total of 5 ascending dose levels pending safety review, and PK review
      where possible, of Period 1 of the prior dose level. Sentinel dose participants (1 for XG005
      and 1 for placebo) were included as the first dose administered at each dose level in Period
      1.

      In Period 2, all subjects in the last three XG005 dose groups received approximate molar
      equivalents of naproxen and pregabalin corresponding to XG005 doses after a 7-day washout
      period. Period 2 was open-label with 10 subjects per group.

      PK blood samples in each treatment period were collected at 0 (pre-dosing), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
      3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs after drug administration.
