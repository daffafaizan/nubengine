      investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      drug to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ulocuplumab as a treatment
      for any disease. Ulocuplumab is a type of protein called an antibody that attacks CXCR4, a
      protein that is found on B-cells like WM.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has Ibrutinib as a treatment option for this
      disease.

      Ibrutinib has been under investigation in research studies in participants with recurrent
      B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and prolymphocytic leukemia, and
      WM. In a study of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory WM patients, response rates were high and
      the treatment was well tolerated. In that study participants who had a CXCR4 mutation had a
      lower response rate to ibrutinib than those without a mutation.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the safety of ulocuplumab in
      combination with ibrutinib participants with symptomatic WM who have a CXCR4 mutation. The
      investigators are also evaluating how well the ulocuplumab works in combination with
      ibrutinib
