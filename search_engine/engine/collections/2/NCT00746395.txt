      diagnostic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract. After esophagogastroduodenoscopy and
      colonoscopy about 5% of bleeding cases remain unexplained and capsule endoscopy provides
      small bowel yield. Capsule endoscopy has special application for evaluation of inflammation
      bowel disease and other small bowel conditions. Several adjuncts are used to enhance the
      examination by improving cleansing preparation or propulsion. Metoclopramide, tegaserod,
      simethicone, erythromycin, phosphates and polyethylene glycol (PEG) colon cleansing agents
      have been tried and some show improved visualization or increased propulsion where more
      capsules reach to colonic cecum while still recording within the limits of its 8 hour
      battery. Recently, our group had an observational report of our experience showing that
      either full bowel cleansing preparation or prokinetics such as metoclopramide or tegaserod
      enhanced visualization and functioning capsule transit to the colon. Lubiprostone is a novel
      chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion and motility. It is FDA
      approved and indicated for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation.

      This investigation is designed to compare lubiprostone and placebo for cleansing and
      propulsion in preparation for capsule endoscopy. The FDA approved 24 mcg constipation dose
      was chosen because other medications used in similar single dose in our pilot studies appear
      effective.
