      prevalence between 5% and 47%. It is one of the main causes of musculoskeletal pain,
      particularly in third place, after the low back pain and neck pain.

      Symptoms of pathologies of subacromial syndrome, where, regardless of origin, pain is the
      number one symptom for the patient, which emanates functional impairment and the impact on
      quality of life.

      Among the non-pharmacological treatments of subacromial syndrome, a systematic review
      concludes that the first line of intervention should be a therapeutic exercise program. In
      many cases, this is usually accompanied by the application of electrophysical agents (short
      wave, laser, etc.). A recent study has shown that the application of Short Wave Radio
      Frequency improved pain in people with subacromial syndrome. The current frequency that is
      applied in the short wave is 27.12 MHz, however, there are other relatively new forms of
      radiofrequency in which a frequency less than 1 MHz is used. These are beginning to be used
      in clinical practice and recently have shown positive results related to pain and
      functionality of musculoskeletal pathologies such as knee osteoarthritis. In these two
      clinical trials, what is called Resistive Capacitive Monopolar Radio Frequency (RFCR) was
      used, the frequency of which was 448 KHz and 485KHz respectively, much lower than the
      frequency used in Shortwave. The RFCR has a potential advantage since it is applied with
      electrodes directly on the skin and is not transmitted in the air unlike the Short Wave.

      Based on the few clinical trials in people with pathology and the physiological effects
      evidenced in healthy people and in vitro preclinical studies, it is considered pertinent to
      carry out the present investigation.
