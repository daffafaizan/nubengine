      randomized into a 52-week, multicenter, double-blind (DB), parallel-group, placebo-controlled
      study. Patients will be stratified based on whether they use concomitant estrogen/progestin
      therapy and then randomized in a 4:1 ration to receive either testosterone transdermal system
      (300 mcg/day) or placebo. Patients using estrogen/progestin at the start of the study should
      maintain this therapy throughout the study; patients not using estrogen/progestin at the
      start of the study should not initiate estrogen/progestin therapy throughout the study.
      Endometrial biopsies and transvaginal ultrasounds will be collected/performed at screening
      and study exit for all patients. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, reports of
      vaginal bleeding, lipids, serum chemistry, and hematology. Physical exams, pap smears, and
      mammograms will be monitored.
