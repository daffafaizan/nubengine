      cesarean section is high. A preoperative fluid bolus of undetermined volume is frequently
      administered to lower the incidence of maternal hypotension, with a somewhat poor efficacy.
      Recently, several investigations have shown that the use of a phenylephrine infusion after
      the induction of spinal anesthesia results in a significant reduction in hypotensive
      episodes. Given the high efficacy of this therapy (incidence of hypotension around 20%), it
      is possible to determine the effective volume of fluid which would prevent hypotension in 50%
      of the patients studied (ED50).

      Healthy term pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia will
      be recruited in this trial. The spinal anesthesia regimen will be standardized and all
      subjects will receive a phenylephrine infusion. The fluid investigated is hydroxyethylstarch
      (HES) 130/0.4 (Volulyte(R)). The ED50 will be determined using an up-down sequential
      allocation method initially described by Dixon & Massey. The determination of the HES ED50
      will help the anesthesiologist in further treating maternal hypotension appropriately.
