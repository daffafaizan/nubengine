      on the relationship between personal and social functionality and quality of sleep perceived
      in outpatients with schizophrenia. It is proposed to perform a simple screening for detecting
      schizophrenic patients reporting sleep disturbances. These patients will be assessed in a
      single visit and will be administered a number of quality of life and functional assessment
      scales. N/A
