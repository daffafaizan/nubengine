    
      FUERTES is an intervention with two main components: 1) the provision of a simple tool that
      MSM can access to learn how to develop an habit of taking their ART drugs, and 2) the support
      of a trained peer with background in psychology to help teach them how to overcome the myriad
      of barriers they may face in achieving medication adherence.

      The first component includes providing each participant in the intervention arm with a
      habit-formation kit, which will include: 1) an information and habit-formation tool that can
      be accessed through a web platform, a mobile app and a booklet 2) a pocket pill-case; 3) a
      weekly pill organizer; 4) a water bottle containing a hidden pill case; 5) a fidget cube; and
      6) a notebook and pen. Patients will also have access to a phone number to solve questions
      regarding HIV and ART with a medical doctor.

      The second component includes providing social support to patients with high level of
      barriers that might influence the adherence to ART, through two mechanisms. Firstly,
      participants will receive professional psychologists will act as habit-formation coaches and
      will provide emotional support, sex education and referral to relevant health services.
      Secondly, they will receive one-on-one habit-formation support from MSM living with HIV who
      have been taking ART for several years, with the objective of reducing self-stigma and
      providing experience and reassurance that living a full and healthy life with HIV is
      possible.
