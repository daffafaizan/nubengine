      were ventilated for 3 hours with pressure controlled assist-control (PC-AC) mode, followed by
      3-hours of volume guarantee assist-control ventilation (VG-AC). Continuous monitoring was
      carried out using pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation - SpO2 and heart rate - HR),
      near-infrared spectroscopy (cerebral oxygenation - StO2) and electrical cardiometry
      (circulatory parameters).
