    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study with collection of de-identified
      biospecimens with matched clinical data from up to 1000 participants from clinical networks
      in the United States and Canada. Clinical information, demographics, and medical data
      relevant to cancer status are collected from all participants and their medical record at
      baseline (at study entry and time of baseline biospecimen collection), and subsequent visits
      per patient consent, for up to 1 year.

      The primary assessment is the establishment of a tumor registry with annotated clinical
      outcomes. Exploratory assessments include correlation of ex vivo functional testing results
      with clinical outcomes, as well as identification of potential biomarkers that correlate
      responses with genotype and/or phenotype.
