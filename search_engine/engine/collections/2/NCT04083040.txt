      Alain Cribier et al. has offered new prospects for patients with severe aortic stenosis and
      multiple comorbidities, for whom surgical procedures are associated with exceedingly high
      operative risk (1,2).

      The randomized multicenter PARTNER trial (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter valve Trial)
      proved that TAVI is an alternative for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for high-risk
      patients.TAVI is characterized by similar mortality and results in terms of reducing the
      symptoms of stenosis (3).

      Current recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology in the Guidelines on the
      management of valvular heart disease (4) are that TAVI should be carried out in patients with
      a life expectancy >1 year, who deemed inoperable or high-risk by a cardiac surgeon and who
      are likely to gain improvement in quality of life. (5).

      One of the complications based on the consensus of experts (the Valve Academic Research
      Consortium-2 (VARC-2 criteria)) is Conduction defect (6).

      The mechanical interaction of the prosthesis stent frame with the conduction system and left
      bundle branch may lead to a high degree of or complete AV block and to left bundle branch
      block (LBBB) after TAVI.(7)

      The pathophysiology of new conduction abnormalities has not yet been elucidated. A number of
      studies indicate that both patient and procedure related factors such as septal wall
      thickness, non-coronary cusp thickness, pre-existing RBBB, depth of valve implantation within
      the LVOT, post implant prosthesis expansion, and the type of prosthesis play a role , LVOT/
      annulus ratio, LVOT/Prosethesis diameter..(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)
