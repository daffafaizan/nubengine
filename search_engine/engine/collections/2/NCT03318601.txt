      prolonged hospitalization in the Hepato-gastroenterology departments of the Besan√ßon, Nancy
      and Reims hospitals. The inclusion and follow-up periods will be six months each. At the
      inclusion of the patients we will evaluate the correlations between the plasma concentration
      of copeptin and 1 / the severity of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh and MELD scores) and serum sodium;
      2 / systemic inflammation markers (CRP, leukocytes, IL-6 and lipopolysaccharides), 3 /
      calprotectin concentration in ascites. "
