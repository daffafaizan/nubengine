    
      In this prospective observational cohort study of patients with high clinical suspicion of
      familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) we aim to study the association between different clinical
      characteristics, gene mutations and prognosis.

      The included patients will undergo physical examination and extended blood sampling. DNA will
      be extracted and used for both whole genome sequencing and investigation of both known- ,
      unknown- and suspected mutations associated with FH.

      The patients will be followed in for 15 years in the Swedish patients registry and the
      Swedish cause of death registry.
