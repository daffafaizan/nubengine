      and 6 months after baseline assessment (Child)

        -  An increase in objectively measured total amount of physical activity

        -  An increase in the proportion meeting MVPA guidelines (measured objectively)

        -  Reduction in time spent sedentary (measured objectively and self-reported)

        -  Change in self-reported physical activity

        -  Reduction in measures of adiposity (body mass index percentile, per cent body fat)

        -  Improvement in psychological factors that may mediate physical activity participation
           (self-efficacy, motivation, attitudes, social support and enjoyment of physical
           activity; and physical self-perceptions)

        -  Change in healthy food provision and parenting practices for healthy food

      The Investigators will also include qualitative data collected from:

        -  Evaluation forms following each intervention workshop session which will be completed by
           the Parent/guardian, child and facilitator

        -  Feedback from focus groups to be held following completion of the total intervention
           i.e. 8 sessions

      and 6 months after baseline assessment (Parent(s)/guardian(s))

        -  An increase in objectively measured total volume of physical activity

        -  An increase in the proportion meeting MVPA guidelines (measured objectively)

        -  Reduction in time spent sedentary (measured objectively and self-reported)

        -  Change in self-reported physical activity

        -  Reduction in measures of adiposity (body mass index percentile, per cent body fat)

        -  Change in healthy food provision and parenting practices for healthy food
