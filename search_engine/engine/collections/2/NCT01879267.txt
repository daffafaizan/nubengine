      leads to cognitive decline and dementia. HD was long considered a brain disorder but
      meanwhile it was shown that HD also affects other tissues such as muscle, leading to muscle
      wasting. Previous studies suggested that the muscle disorder might be caused by an impaired
      energy metabolism through mitochondrial dysfunction, which also might also contribute to
      brain pathology.

      In muscle tissue of healthy persons, a protein named PGC 1- α seems to regulate many, if not
      all of the adaptations of muscle metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis to chronic endurance
      training. It was shown that PGC 1- α is reduced in muscle tissue of human HD patients and
      animal models of HD.

      We aim investigating whether endurance exercise has the capability of stabilizing and / or
      reversing PGC-1α dependent decline of muscle function and structure in HD patients, and
      whether muscle training ameliorates muscular and cardiovascular function, as well as
      coordination and cognitive decline in HD. To this end, we will train 20 male HD patients
      using a 6 months progressive endurance exercise program. In order to compare the size effect
      of exercise between HD patients and healthy individuals, 20 age-matched healthy males will
      perform the identical exercise regimen as HD patients. Within one week before the training
      period starts and within one week after it has ended, we will assess metabolic and functional
      data. In addition, we will analyze muscle tissue samples for muscle fiber structure,
      metabolic phenotype and cellular pathology. Finally, gene and protein expression analyses
      will be performed on muscle tissue extracts to gain insights into the molecular regulation of
      training adaptations in HD.
