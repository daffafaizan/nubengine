      treatments. Cancer patients are among those at high risk of developing serious illness from
      an infection because their immune systems are often weakened by cancer and its treatments.
      Due to the growing coronavirus outbreak, patients clinic visits are being cancelled and many
      are facing social isolation and strict restrictions on their daily lives. We want to evaluate
      the impact of the coronavirus on the patient's well-being and their cancer care by assessing
      the delays in their medical care and any other unmet needs. We have created a survey that is
      available online for any patient with cancer to fill out voluntarily regarding their
      experiences to date. The survey is available at:
