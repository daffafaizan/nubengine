      most patients with AIDS, and probably with AIDS related complex (ARC), will be receiving AZT.
      Because AZT is reported not to be active against cytomegalovirus (CMV), it is important to
      see if it is useful to give GCV along with AZT.

      Patients are placed into one of four groups at entry into study according to their previous
      treatment:

      I: Prior treatment with AZT up to the time of developing CMV infection and not requiring dose
      reduction of AZT for toxicity.

      II: Prior treatment with AZT up to the time of developing CMV infection and requiring dose
      reduction of AZT for toxicity.

      III: Prior therapy with GCV for CMV infection. These patients should already be in the
      maintenance phase, having completed a minimum of 2 weeks of induction therapy.

      IV: No prior therapy with either AZT or GCV.

      Treatment lasts 24 weeks and consists of two treatment plans:

      A: Patients not previously treated with GCV are started on GCV for an additional 22 weeks.
      GCV is given as a 1-hour infusion. All patients are started on AZT at the lowest dose. B: For
      patients with chronic CMV disease who are receiving GCV maintenance, GCV is administered as a
      1-hour infusion 5 days/week.

      AZT is added and treatment with GCV is standardized prior to beginning of the study.
