      analysis, flow cytometry for phenotyping, metabolic, and functional analyses, and metabolic
      profiling by Seahorse analysis to understand the unique etiology of ITMs to understand how
      individual melanoma lesions metabolically and immunologically evolve as they move away from
      the primary tumor site. A large amount of translational data is able to be derived from from
      an individual tissue biopsies. This study will utilize this platform to extensively evaluate
      2-5 (melanoma) in-transit metastases (ITMs) per patient. It is hypothesized that as ITMs move
      away from the primary melanoma site each will harbor progressively hypermetabolic tumor cells
      and a harsher microenvironment. Each ITM station will be deeply profiled using metabolic
      assays, flow cytometry, and highly multiplexed immunofluorescent microscopy including, to
      interrogate the metabolic profiles of tumor and immune system in individual melanoma ITMs,
      and, to Determine tumor:immune interaction in the context of hypoxia using high-dimensional
      imaging. Using high throughput sequencing technologies, it will determined how tumor and
      immune cells interact and evolve during the course of transit in ITMs (as these cells become
      more metabolically and immunologically suppressive as they migrate further from the primary
      site). The clonal evolution analysis of tumor cells through and pimonidazole-enabled single
      cell RNA-sequencing will be used to identify transcriptomic changes in tumor, immune, and
      stromal cells correlated with hypoxia exposure.
