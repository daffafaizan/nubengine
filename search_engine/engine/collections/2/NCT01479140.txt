      will be approached prior to their procedure. A pregnancy test will be performed (standard for
      pre-menopausal women due to potential radiation exposure). If the cause of the heart attack
      is uncertain (eg no obvious infarct-related narrowing or occlusion), intravascular ultrasound
      or optimal coherence tomography will be performed within the context of the angiogram to
      better view the artery wall. A picture of the iliac and renal arteries will be accomplished
      by aortography (one dye shot down the aorta); in the case that the renal arteries are not
      well visualized, selective renal angiography will be performed (catheter at the entry to the
      renal artery). In the case of suspected non-atherosclerotic abnormalities, a head CT
      angiogram wil be performed. Referral to appropriate specialists for detected abnormality will
      occur. If symptoms continue, the subject will be followed by a cardiologist. A research
      coordinator will contact the subject at 1, 6 and 12 months and then annually to collect data
      on medications, hospitalization and symptoms.
