      effective in the septic shock treatment.

      Effectiveness of other extracoporeal blood purification methods, such as hemoadsorption or
      combined blood purification (hemoadsorption combined with CRRT) is widely pointed out in
      current publications: contemporary studies in general ICU patients demonstrated that the use
      of hemoadsorption or combined extracorporeal blood purification methods is effective for
      septic shock patients treatment.

      It has been proven that cytokines discharged into the systemic blood flow are the key
      pathophysiological mechanism of septic shock. Hemoadsorption allows for significantly more
      effective removal of different inflammatory mediators than the traditional methods of CRRT.
      The combined extracorporeal blood purification method demonstrated similar efficacy in
      general ICU patients.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency and safety of combined extracorporeal blood
      purification in with septic shock in neurosurgical ICU in comparison with the efficiency and
      safety of the continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with AN69 membrane.

      Study novelty: We have not encountered published studies evaluating the efficiency of
      combined extracorporeal blood purification methods in neurosurgical patients with septic
      shock. Furthermore, currently there is not enough data to compare combined extracorporeal
      blood purification with CRRT for septic shock treatment. The planned study is the first to
      investigate the safety and efficiency of combined extracorporeal blood purification in
      patients with septic shock in neurosurgical ICU.
