      Lifetime Data, John Wiley and Sons, 2003). Formulas are based on the assumptions of uniform
      accrual over time, no loss to follow-up, exponentially distributed death times.

      For STS 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained for the primary endpoint
      progression-free survival rate (PFSR) at 6 months. Estimated accrual time: 24 months. A PFSR
      of 5% will be considered not promising, whereas a PFSRof 15% will be considered promising in
      this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 43 patients are needed in
      this cohort.

      For bone sarcoma 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained under the same assumptions
      than above, but with a type I error α of 0.10, therefore 32 patients are needed in this
      cohort.
