      monitoring using the comprehensive visual field and telemedicine solution based on the
      ForeseeHome device in AREDS2 (referred to as the ForeseeHome comprehensive solution)
      participants at high risk of progression to neovascular AMD improves detection of progression
      to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) when compared with standard care. The primary outcome
      of this study is presenting best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the time of CNV diagnosis.
      Secondary outcomes include time to confirmed CNV diagnosis, lesion size, lesion location
      (extrafoveal, juxtafoveal, or subfoveal), lesion type (occult without classic, predominantly
      classic or minimally classic), sensitivity and specificity, and BCVA following three
      consecutive months of treatment and twelve months after the initial start of CNV treatment
      with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent using either ranibizumab or bevacizumab. Outcomes will
      be ascertained via the following specific aims:
