      like tablets and smart phones. There are magnets in smart phones and tablets that could
      affect the functions of pacemakers. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects
      of electromagnetic field exposure from using a tablet and a smart phone with participants
      that have a leadless pacemaker (MICRA device) implanted inside them. Participants will be
      asked to report any symptoms that they experience during the testing.
