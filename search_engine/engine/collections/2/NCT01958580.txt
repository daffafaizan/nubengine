    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of adjuvant pelvic radiation in combination with
      gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride)/docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with stage 1 and 2
      surgically-resected uterine leiomyosarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the two year recurrence-free survival in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma
      treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy including defining the patterns of recurrence
      in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma who were treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes
      on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning week 10, patients undergo 3 fractions of brachytherapy or
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) over 3 weeks. Patients then undergo external
      beam radiation therapy (EBRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
