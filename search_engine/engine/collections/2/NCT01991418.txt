      department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of xiangya School of Medicine Central South

      University. The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity in blood
      in staged(Ⅰ~ⅢA) non-small lung cancers, to study the warning relapse ability of thioredoxin
      reductase in blood. The secondary objective is to compare the warning relapse activity of
      blood thioredoxin reductase activity with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in subjects who
      received surgery. Blood will be collected in subjects before surgery, 5 days after surgery,
      and every 3 months after surgery till 2 years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect
      blood till tumor relapse for the subjects at stage ⅠA and low risk ⅠB. Blood will be
      collected before surgery, 5 days after surgery, before adjuvant chemotherapy, after 2 circles
      of all adjuvant chemotherapy, then every 3 months after adjuvant chemotherapy till 2 years,
      and every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor relapse for the subjects of high
