      high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (temporary insertion of radiation into the prostate) and
      external beam radiation. External beam radiation typically requires daily radiation treatment
      for three to five weeks. Improvements to radiation planning and delivery has allowed
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to be implemented in many types of cancer. SBRT
      has been implemented as a standard treatment option after HDR brachytherapy in response to
      the COVID pandemic. We are seeking to evaluate whether it is feasible to randomly assign men
      between SBRT (which will be five treatments of radiation or conventional radiation (3-5 weeks
      of daily treatment) following HDR brachytherapy
