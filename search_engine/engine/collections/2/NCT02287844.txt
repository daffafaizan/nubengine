      A semi-quantitative dietary survey was performed at enrollment in order to assess the usual
      dietary fiber intake in order to select the target population consuming 13 to 18 g/day. The
      volunteers were instructed to follow dietary guidelines to maintain their fiber intake during
      a two-week stabilization phase and then throughout the intervention.

      As all volunteers were living on-site and taking all meals at the Institut Polytechnique
      LaSalle Beauvais cafeteria, the content of each meal could be closely controlled during the
      week. A 3-day dietary survey was performed at the end of the stabilization period and
      repeated at the end of the intervention in order to assess the stability of the diet.

      The 60 volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received daily the
      intervention for 4 weeks.
