      efficacy of autologous bone marrow stem cells transplantation. In patients with myocardial
      infarction, the heart muscle does not pump well. Over a period of years, this continues to
      get worse until the patient dies of heart failure. The researchers are trying to find out if
      the transplantation of these stem cell can make a change in the functioning of these areas of
      the heart muscle.

      Patients between 18 and 70 years of age who received autologous bone marrow stem cell
      transplant at the Fuwai cardiovascular hospital may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      must have had their first transplant at least 3 years before entering the current study.

      These patients receive autologous bone marrow cells transplantation intracoronary undergoing
      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft. The objective evaluations will be performed at baseline and
      during 6 months follow-up.

      Heart function tests may include the following:

        1. Electrocardiogram (EKG) evaluates the electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes
           placed on the chest transmit information from the heart to a machine.

        2. Echocardiogram (Echo) is an ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create an image of
           the heart and examine the function of the heart chambers and valves.

        3. Gated acquisition scan is a nuclear medicine test that uses a small amount of
           radioactive chemical injected into a vein. A special scanner creates an image of the
           heart for examining the beating motion of the muscle.

        4. MRI evaluates function of the heart chambers the beating motion of the muscle.
