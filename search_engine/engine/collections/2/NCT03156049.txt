      pterygopalatine fossa that has both sympathetic and parasympathetic components as well as
      somatic sensory roots. The trans-nasal approach is a low risk, noninvasive technique that is
      easily performed and could potentially be beneficial in the treatment of PDPH through
      blocking the parasympathetic ï¬‚ow to the cerebral vasculature through the sphenopalatine
      ganglion which will allow the cerebral vessels to return to normal diameter and thus relieve
      the headache.

      The greater occipital nerve contains sensory fibers from C2 and C3 segments of medulla
      spinals. It arises from the dorsal ramus of C2 segment, contains a thin branch from C3
      segment, and innerves the medial aspect of posterior scalp up to the anterior aspect of
      vertex. Greater occipital nerve block (GONB) inhibits the pain sensation of this region.

      There is some evidence to suggest the effectiveness of GONB in the management of PDPH.
      Nowadays, guidelines for the management of PDPH were modified and included GONB as a part of
      standard management of PDPH.

        -  Dexamethasone possess potent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive actions by
           inhibiting cytokine-mediated pathways.

        -  Many providers believe that the local anesthetic produces the rapid onset of headache
           relief, like an abortive agent, and that the locally acting steroid produces the
           preventive like action of up to 6 weeks.
