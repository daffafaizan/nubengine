      participants who have advanced solid tumors. This study will look at relative
      bioavailability, effect of food and gastric pH modification on the PK of TAK-931.

      The study will enroll approximately 44 participants. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:
      Part 1 and Part 2. In Part 1 and Part 2, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) in a crossover design. In Part 1, participants will be assigned to 1 of
      the 2 following treatment sequences:

        -  TAK-931 80 mg PIC + TAK-931 80 mg Tablet

        -  TAK-931 80 mg Tablet + TAK-931 80 mg PIC

      Part 2 of the study will be initiated, once the preliminary PK data from Part 1 is available
      to determine the relative bioavailability of the tablet formulation in reference to PIC and
      to calculate the single dose of TAK-931 tablet to be used in Part 2.In Part 2, participants
      will be assigned to 1 of the 2 following treatment sequences:

        -  TAK-931 TBD Fed + TAK-931 TBD Fasted

        -  TAK-931 TBD Fasted + TAK-931 TBD Fed

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 2 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      and will be contacted for approximately 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug
      or until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow up
      assessment.
