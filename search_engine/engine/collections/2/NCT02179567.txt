      30-40% of cases are diagnosed in patients older than 70 years. Furthermore, recent data
      suggest that during the last decade, the incidence and mortality of NSCLC has decreased in
      younger patients, while it has increased among older patients. Based on these observations,
      it becomes clear that NSCLC represents a significant health problem in elderly patients.
      However, elderly patients are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials evaluating new
      treatments in NSCLC. Indeed, more than 75% of patients older than 65 years with metastatic
      NSCLC never receive any kind of chemotherapy in the daily clinical practice.

      According to retrospective data,the addition of bevacizumab to a standard, platinum-based
      chemotherapy regimen improves overall survival in patients with advanced non-squamous-cell,
      non-small-cell lung cancer and a good ECOG performance status. In addition, bevacizumab
      prolongs progression-free survival and improves response rate.

      In elderly patients there is a complete lack of prospective data regarding the role of
      bevacizumab. It is not clear whether elderly patients gain any survival benefit or not and if
      the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapeutic regimens results in a significant
      increase in toxicity.

      There is a clear need to prospectively evaluate the tolerability of bevacizumab when added to
      standard first-line chemotherapy of elderly NSCLC patients. Therefore, the investigators
      propose to study the efficacy in elderly (>70 years) patients treated with cytotoxic
      chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in the context of 1st line treatment.
