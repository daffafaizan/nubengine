      Long Lasting Memories (LLM) project (www.longlastingmemories.eu), which was funded by the
      European Commission (Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Program
      (ICT-PSP) for a three year period (2009-2012). It used a pre-post-test design with the
      between-participant factor group [intervention(s) vs. passive and/or active control].
      Post-test was conducted within 2 weeks after completion of the exercise period. Interventions
      were carried out in Thessaloniki (Greece) within day care centers, hospitals, senior care
      centers, a memory outpatient center, local parishes, and at participants' homes.

      Centers had to provide 8 exercise weeks, with a frequency of at least 2 physical and 3
      cognitive exercise sessions per week, resulting in at least 16 physical and 24 cognitive
      exercise sessions in total.
