        -  Compare the efficacy of first-line therapy comprising chlorambucil vs fludarabine
           phosphate in patients with previously untreated Waldenström macroglobulinemia, splenic
           lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, or non-IgM lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease
      (Waldenström macroglobulinemia vs splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes vs non-IgM
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral chlorambucil on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every 28 days
           for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate orally or IV on days 1-5. Treatment
           repeats every 28 days for 3-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo quality of life assessment at baseline.
