    
      The proposed aim of this randomized observational clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of
      the conventional anticoagulation in the form of warfarin and NOACs in the form of rivaroxaban
      in the treatment of LV thrombus.

      So patients with actual LV thrombus will be divided into 2 groups, one will receive the
      traditional therapy which is warfarin with follow up of the INR in order to reach the desired
      level of 2-3 then follow up every two weeks to determine the time in therapeutic range until
      the end of the study follow up. The other group will receive oral rivaroxaban 20 mg per day
      with follow up for the persistence or the disappearance of the LV thrombus one month, three
      months and 6 months later.

      As a secondary and safety end point, any major bleeding will be recorded as well as any
      thrombo-embolic events
