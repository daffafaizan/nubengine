      healing and cosmetic result of selected post surgical wounds in 12 subjects. The Epidermal
      Expansion System (designed by MoMelan Technologies) will generate an array of small
      microblisters and transfer the micrografts to a sterile wound dressing for application to the
      subject's surgical area. The sponsor hypothesizes that applying expanded micrografts to
      wounds that otherwise would have healed by second intention alone will hasten healing and
      possibly reduce scarring.
