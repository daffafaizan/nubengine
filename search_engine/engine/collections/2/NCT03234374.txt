    
      This is a multicenter randomized, single-blind, controlled study. Prior to surgery on Day 1,
      48 subjects who continue to meet study entry criteria will be randomized just prior to
      surgery in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 3 x 100 mg INL-001 bupivacaine HCl collagen-matrix
      implants (total bupivacaine HCl dose 300 mg) or Marcaine 0.25% (bupivacaine HCl) 175 mg
      infiltration. Subjects will then undergo open hernioplasty according to standard procedure.

      Subjects will remain in the clinic at least until after the 72 hour blood sample has been
      collected for PK analysis on Day 4. Subjects discharged after the 72 hour blood draw will be
      instructed to return to the clinic to complete the 96 hour PK blood draw on Day 5. Follow-up
      safety assessments will include clinic visits on Day 7, Day 15 and Day 30.

      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from subjects before surgery and at
      predetermined time points up to 96 hours after administration of study drug. Safety
      assessments will include frequent assessment of vital signs through 72 hours, continuous
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least 24 hours, oxygen saturation levels, and
      adverse events (AEs) reporting with particular emphasis on the signs and symptoms of CNS and
      cardiovascular bupivacaine toxicity. The surgical wound will be assessed frequently for
      adverse events associated with altered wound healing.
