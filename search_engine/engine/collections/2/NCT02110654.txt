             -  FESS: For patients with no surgical contraindications, FESS will be performed.
                Bilateral nasal cavities will be filled with swelling sponges postoperatively. The

           numbers generated by statistical software.

             -  Experimental group: Montelukast (10mg, once daily) and MFNS (200μg, once daily) for
