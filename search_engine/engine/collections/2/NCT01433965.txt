      stem cells in vivo and can be used to prevent the relapse of leukemia stem cells after
      transplant. A concern with any post transplant intervention is the possibility of multiple
      drug interactions, potential for graft versus host disease exacerbation and/or induction of
      cytopenia. Therefore, the smallest doses of lenalidomide (5 mg) that has been used in this
      setting will be utilized as dose level 1. Starting six months post-transplant, patients will
      begin on a daily dose of lenalidomide. Dependent on the cohort, patients will receive 5 to 20
      mg of lenalidomide post transplant. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined by
      the incidence of grade III-IV toxicities of all organs and grade II-IV GVHD. Duration of
      treatment is six months.
