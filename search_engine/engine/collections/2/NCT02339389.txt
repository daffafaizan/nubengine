      are diverse and include maternal chorioamnionitis, and other infections. In addition,
      epidural analgesia used for pain relief in labor is associated with mild maternal temperature
      increase and overt fever. Originally dismissed by obstetric anesthesiologists as a clinical
      curiosity of little consequence, epidural-associated hyperthermia may lead to significant
      maternal as well as fetal or neonatal adverse effects. Observational investigations performed
      2 decades ago demonstrated a gradual increase in temperature in laboring parturients with
      epidural analgesia not see in those electing systemic opioid analgesia or no analgesia. The
      epidural group showed an average increase in temperature of approximately 1 degree centigrade
      over 7 hours whereas temperatures in non-epidural group remained constant. No evidence of
      clinical infection was reported in any of the women. Many studies confirmed these raises in
      temperature in epidural group compared to no epidural group during labor and delivery.

      Several mechanisms have been postulated with no study reaching a conclusion. The mechanisms
      suggested include imbalance between heat production and heat dissipation, effect of opioid on
      interleukin-2, markers of inflammation induced by epidural analgesia, etc. Our study aims at
      the first mechanism. It may be a physiological process that leads to an imbalance between
      heat production and heat dissipation. Labor is a hyper metabolic state and increased heat
      production is dissipated via increased ventilation that is associated with labor pains with
      no epidural pain relief. It is conceivable that laboring women with pain relief subsequent to
      epidural analgesia, a decrease in ventilations may occur leading to decreased heat
      dissipation.
