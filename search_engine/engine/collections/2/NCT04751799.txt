      Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the most common sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide.
      The prevalence in the population is high. Epidemiological estimates suggest that 75-80% of
      sexually active adults acquire an HPV infection in the genital area at least once by the age
      of 50. However, up to 95% of these HPV infections are considered harmless and are
      spontaneously eliminated within 2 years in terms of immunological HPV clearance [1]. On the
      other hand, persistent infections with HPV of the high-risk group, e.g. HPV-16 and HPV-18,
      are the main cause for the development of cervical carcinoma and are also partly responsible
      for the development of vulvar carcinoma, vaginal carcinoma and anal carcinoma. HPV
      preferentially infects the epithelial cells of the anogenital region and, through
      incorporation of HPV DNA into the host genome and subsequent interference with the cell cycle
      control of the host cell, causes changes in the cervical epithelium that, if left untreated,
      may develop into precancerous lesions (so-called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) and
      consecutively into invasive carcinoma of the cervix (cervical carcinoma). Specifically, the
      viral protooncogene E6 gene product couples to p53 and promotes its degradation, and the
      viral protooncogene E7 gene product forms a complex with the retinoblastoma gene product pRB
      and suppresses its tumor suppressor function [2]. Both the impairment of apoptosis and tumor
      suppressor function promote immortalization of infected basal cells in the transformation
      zone of the cervix uteri.

      Cervical carcinoma is the third most common cancer in women worldwide, as well as the fourth
      leading cause of death in women worldwide. Cervical carcinoma accounted for 9% (n=529 800) of
      all new cancer cases and 8% (n=275 100) of cancer-related deaths in women in 2008 [3].

      The precursor of cervical cancer is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can lead
      to the development of squamous cell carcinoma (approximately 80% of all cervical cancers).
      Three grades of expression are distinguished in CIN (CIN1, CIN 2, and CIN 3). Compared with
      invasive cervical carcinoma, the occurrence of precancerous lesions of the cervix uteri is
      more widespread. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 women in Germany develop new
      dysplasias (CIN 1-3) annually, with a point prevalence of >200,000 [3, 4].

      Colposcopy as a diagnostic method

      Dysplasia of the cervix typically becomes conspicuous during the gynecological screening
      examination at the gynecologist. In this case, smears are taken from the ectocervix and
      endocervix and assessed by the cytologist after a Papanicolaou stain has been performed with
      regard to dysplastic cells and the quality of the smear. For further clarification of
      dysplastic changes, presentation to a specialized dysplasia consultation is recommended.
      During colposcopic examination, histological confirmation of dysplastic areas is performed by
      means of biopsy.

      Colposcopy (visual examination of the vagina and the entrance to the uterus with optical
      magnification) is an integral part of early cervical cancer detection. It is used to
      visualize dysplastic areas on the cervix uteri and to determine their spatial expression. The
      magnifying glass allows a multilevel (3.5 to 30x) two-dimensional magnification. After visual
      identification of suspicious areas using 5% acetic acid (dysplasias become acetic white) and
      classification into "minor" (grade 1) or "major" (grade 2) changes according to the
      internationally used RIO classification, a targeted biopsy for exact determination of the
      degree of dysplasia is possible [4]. Only in this way is further individual therapy planning
      possible.

      Pain sensation during colposcopic examination.

      Colposcopy itself and especially colposcopic targeted biopsy of the cervix are painful [4,
      5]. General practice is to use local analgesics, oral analgesics, or no analgesics during a
      colposcopically targeted biopsy of the cervix [5]. The use of nonpharmacologic methods to
      positively influence patient pain perception and satisfaction has been investigated in a
      number of studies. For example, in a prospective randomized study, our group demonstrated
      that classical music (Mozart, Symphony No. 40 in G minor, KV 550) [6] had no positive
      influence on satisfaction and pain perception. Similarly, in another randomized study, we
      found no positive influence on satisfaction and pain perception by using video colposcopy
      [7]. Virtual reality (VR) is a new method for 360° three-dimensional viewing of image
      content. A number of studies have shown that the use of VR can have a positive effect on the
      course of medical interventions. For example, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 8
      randomized trials with a total of 723 subjects, Ding et al showed lower postoperative pain
      scores after the application of VR in the context of various surgeries such as dental, knee,
      hemorrhoid surgery, and obstetric injury care [8].

      Randomized trials of the effectiveness of VR in a collective of women undergoing
      colposcopy-targeted cervical biopsy are not available according to a recent literature search
      (PubMed search as of 12/30/2020; search terms: cervical biopsy, colposcopy, pain relief, pain
      control, virtual reality). In studies of our research group on colposcopy, we found increased
      pain scores especially in younger patients, but also in obese patients and smokers [7, 9].
      Therefore, a controlled study on the effectiveness of VR in colposcopy-targeted biopsy is
      reasonable.

      Aim of the study

      Our study now aims to answer the question under prospective conditions whether the use of VR
      before initiation or before initiation and during colposcopy compared to no intervention
      leads to a significant increase in patient satisfaction and/or a reduction in pain in the
      context of clarification colposcopy and colposcopically targeted biopsy.
