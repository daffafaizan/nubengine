      of HIV-infected patients by decreasing the incidence of opportunistic infections and
      HIV-related malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma. However, the frequency of NHL remains
      increased in these patients. Moreover, their prognostic remains poor comparing to HIV
      negative patients. This is mainly due to the type of NHL (aggressive B, and frequent stage
      IV) but also host factors such as immunodeficiency, co-infections (EBV, HHV8), and
      chemotherapy-HAART interactions. In the lack of new and significantly more efficient
      treatments, therapeutic intensification such as high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (ASCT), already tested in relapsed or partially
      responding HIV negative patients, could be an option in HAART controlled HIV+ patients with
      NHL, rather in first complete remission (CR) but with initially high International Prognosis
      Index (IPI above or equal to 2), or in second CR, whatever initial IPI. Positive selection
      CD34+ cells is an approach for depleting grafts of tumour cells and HIV DNA. However the
      delayed lymphocyte recovery following this process, may lead to increased incidence of
      opportunistic infections (OI) in HIV-infected patients. OI prophylaxis will be systematically
      associated.

      Eligible patients will have peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and divided in two
      subgroups. Group A with 3-6 x 106 PBSC will not undergo CD34+ selection process and group B
      with more than 6 x 106 will undergo this process. The myeloablative conditioning process is
      the same in the two groups with total body irradiation before reinfusion of grafts.

      Patients will be followed from week2 (W2) up to W60 with clinical and biological evaluations.
