      higher rate of complications using cells from an unrelated or partially matched related
      donor. T cells within the donor cells may cause a complication called graft vs. host disease
      (GVHD). The goal of this study is to use the CliniMACs device to remove the T cells that
      cause GVHD, called T cell depletion.
