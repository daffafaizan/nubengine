      identified at public health and STI clinics within the San Antonio Metropolitan Health
      District system. Women who agree to participate and give informed consent will be randomized
      into the intervention or control arm. Women in the control arm will be interviewed at
      baseline, be given a targeted physical exam including a STI/HIV screen, pap smear and
      contraception counseling and will receive abuse and enhanced clinical counseling. Women in
      the intervention arm will be interviewed at baseline, given a targeted physical exam
      including a STI/HIV screen, pap smear and contraception counseling and enrolled in the
      intervention. Women in the intervention arm will be interviewed and examined again after
      completing the intervention, to establish a post-intervention baseline. All women in the
      study will be followed over one year, with follow-up interviews including an inquiry about
      any Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and a targeted physical exams and
      contraception counseling at 6 and 12 months. During the study period, women will be
      encouraged to return to the study clinic for problem visits if they suspect they have been
      infected with a STI or require contraception or abuse counseling. All analyses of
      intervention effects will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis.
