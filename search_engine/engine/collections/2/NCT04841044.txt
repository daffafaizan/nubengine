    
      This is a randomized double-blinded controlled trial ( randomized 1:1). Study population:
      healthy men and women 20-70 years, BMI 20-35 kg/m2.

      Study design:

        -  3 weeks run-in-period where all participants consume control capsules every morning.

        -  Randomization intervention: control (1:1). All participants consume their capsules
           (control or intervention) for 4 weeks.

      The intervention oil consists of a fish oil high in cetoleic acid and the control oil is a
      mix of different oils and low in cetoleic acid.

      Power calculation and sample size:

      It was expected a difference of 15% in n-3 between the groups after the intervention (Ã˜stbye
      et al. 2019, doi:10.1017/S0007114519001478).

      The level of significance was set to 5% (two-sided) and the power to 80%. A total of
      thirty-eight subjects were required to participate in the study, but a high dropout rate was
      expected (20%) and it was considered necessary to include a total of seventy (n=70) subjects
      (thirty-five per arm).
