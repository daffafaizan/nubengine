      new treatment involving bimanual (Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy (HABIT). The protocols
      have been developed at Columbia University to be child friendly and draws upon our experience
      since 1998 with constraint-induced movement therapy in children with cerebral palsy. The
      interventions are performed in a 15 day day-camp setting with several children and at least
      one therapist per child. The aim is to promote the use of and improve the coordination of
      movement of both hands together. PARTICIPATION IS FREE. Please check out our website for more
