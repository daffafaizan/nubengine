    
      The study will enroll approximately 375 subjects randomized 1:1:1 to dose regimens of 180µg,
      120µg BXCL501, or placebo stratified by age < 65 and age ≥ 65. Male and female adults with
      acute agitation associated with bipolar disorder will be enrolled. Eligible subjects (acutely
      agitated subjects with bipolar disorder, generally hypomanic, manic or mixed episodes) may be
      identified in outpatient clinics, mental health, psychiatric or medical emergency services
      including medical/psychiatric observation units, or as newly admitted to a hospital setting
      for acute agitation or already in hospital for chronic underlying conditions. Subjects will
      be domiciled in a clinical research setting or hospitalized to remain under medical
      supervision while undergoing screening procedures to assess eligibility. Efficacy and safety
      assessments will be conducted periodically before and after dosing.
