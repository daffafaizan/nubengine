      both Pneumovax 23 and Typhim Vi (age 18 months - 55 years). Analyses of anti-pneumococcal
      polysaccharide antibodies and anti-Vi antibodies are performed before and 3-4 weeks after
      vaccination. Also bloodgroup and anti-A/anti-B are assessed. Relevant clinical information
      (ENT infections, lung infections, bronchiectasis, invasive infections) is obtained from the
      patient file and history and is noted in a Case Report Form.

      The diagnostic performance of Typhim Vi response and allohemagglutinins will be analyzed by
      calculating sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios and Receiver
      Operating Characteristic curves for Typhim Vi and allohemagglutinins using pneumococcal
      antibody response as the reference standard. The association between low Typhim Vi response
      or low allohemagglutinins and clinical signs of polysaccharide antibody deficiency will be
      studied by multiple logistic regression.
