      I. To expand an existing couple-based behavioral intervention developed for African American
      (AA) or Hispanic men on active surveillance (Watchful Living; protocol #: 2017-0556) to AA
      prostate cancer (PCa) survivors who underwent active treatments to examine its feasibility of
      recruiting AA PCa survivor-partner dyads (N = 40 dyads) and implementing a lifestyle
      intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate a preliminary efficacy of the intervention in improving quality of life, physical
      activity, nutrient intake, and inflammation.

      II. Explore psychosocial mediators and moderators of the intervention. III. Conduct a process
      evaluation. IV. Assess healthcare-provider level factors (with N=15 providers) that influence
      both survivors' and partners' healthy lifestyle behaviors.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their partners are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients and their partners receive an exercise plan and printed materials that
      includes instructions for walking or other moderate-intensity activities. Patients and their
      partners also receive coaching calls discussing physical activity and diet related questions,
      each lasting 45-60 minutes and occurring every 2 weeks for 6 months. In addition, patients
      and their partners complete 2 nutrition counseling sessions over 1 hour each at baseline and
      before month 3 with an MD Anderson registered dietitian.

      GROUP II: Patients and their partners receive information/materials regarding physical
      activity and healthy eating.

      PROVIDER INTERVIEWS: Healthcare providers participate in an interview regarding their
      opinions on family-focused care and its ability to improve health behaviors.
