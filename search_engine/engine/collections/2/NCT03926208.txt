      foot and ankle procedures, and the infection rate following these procedures is higher than
      in procedures involving other areas of the body. This is at least in part because the anatomy
      of the human foot presents inherent challenges for preoperative sterilization techniques due
      to the many folds and crevices associated with the toes. In particular, the nail folds of the
      toes are known to harbor large amounts of bacteria.

      A systematic review and meta-analysis of previous studies that have investigated the efficacy
      of various foot and ankle preparation agents (including alcohol, chlorhexidine,
      chloroxylenol, and iodine/iodophors) showed that no single agent or combination of agents
      eliminates positive culture growth to undetectable levels for all patients. Articles have
      suggested superiority of a chlorhexidine prep solution over other types of preps; hence,
      chlorhexidine prep is now considered the gold standard at many institutions. But even a
      chlorhexidine prepped foot has been shown to contain culturable bacteria in the nail folds in
      30% of cases.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether a standard
      chlorhexidine prep can be augmented with a soak & scrub in dilute betadine to reduce the rate
      of positive cultures from the hallux nail fold.

      It is hypothesized that in comparison to feet receiving the standard chlorhexadine prep, feet
      receiving the standard prep plus the betadine soak & scrub will be less likely to have
      culture positive swabs of the hallux nail fold.
