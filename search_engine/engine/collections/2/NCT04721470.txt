    
      This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of combined therapy with conventional
      transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE)+microwave ablation (MWA) versus only TACE or MWA for
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) >3-<5 cm.

      This randomized controlled trial screened 278 patients with HCC >3-<5 cm. Patients were
      randomized into three groups: 90 underwent TACE (Group 1); 95 underwent MWA (Group 2); and 93
      underwent combined therapy (Group 3). Patients were followed-up with contrast-enhanced CT or
      MRI. Images were evaluated and compared for treatment response and adverse events based on
      modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumor. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
      concentration was measured at baseline and during every follow-up visit.
