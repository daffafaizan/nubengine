      questionnaire to obtain basic information about gender, age, etiology of cirrhosis,
      conventional liver function tests, serum AFP level, education level, substance use including
      smoking, alcohol drinking, betel quid chewing, history of familial HCC, etc. Then the
      patients was followed by periodic abdominal sonography examination and determination of AFP
      and liver function. If AFP elevated or liver nodule appears, effort to diagnose HCC will be
      performed.If HCC was performed, the survival will be followed-up. As anti-viral therapy was
      found to decrease risk for HCC, patients with those therapy will be excluded.
