      escalation manner starting from 200 mg in Cohort 1 to 2000 mg in Cohort 6. The study drug
      will be orally taken as capsules. In the MAD part of the study the investigational drug will
      be administrated twice daily for 5 days depending on the half-life of FP-025, as determined
      in the SAD part of the study. Study subjects will be randomized in a 1:3 ratio to either
      placebo or FP-025 in every cohort of the SAD and MAD part of the study.

      Note: Dosing in the SAD phase was completed, and the planned MAD portion of the study was not
      conducted. Evaluation of FP-025 MAD is being conducted under a separate protocol (Study No.
      FP02C-17-001).
