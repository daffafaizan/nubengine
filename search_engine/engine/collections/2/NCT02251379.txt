    
      The study is a parallel arm study of an individually tailored, multi-faceted ECS plus
      controller medication titration versus controller medication titration alone. After a 4-week
      run-in period to stabilize the asthma, the investigators will randomize 200 Baltimore
      children with persistent asthma and a recent exacerbation in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms and
      follow the children for six months. There will be five clinic visits and three home visits
      over this time period for clinical and home assessments, respectively. There will be up to
      four environmental intervention visits for participants randomized to the environmental
      control plus controller medication group. The environmental modules include mouse, cockroach,
      furry pets, dust mites, and smoking. Air purifiers and laundered bedding are also included in
      this arm. Participants randomized to the controller medication group have the option of
      having one home visit after completing the study at which the participants will receive home
      intervention services that the environmental control plus controller medication group
      received. Participants will have repeated assessment of: controller medication requirements;
      secondary clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory outcomes; and particulate matter (PM), air
      nicotine, and allergen levels.
