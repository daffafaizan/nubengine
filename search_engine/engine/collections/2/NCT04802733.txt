      anesthesia into a part of the brain called the putamen. Subjects then take medicines to
      partially suppress their immune system (aimed to prevent the body from rejecting the cells)
      for 1 year. Safety, tolerability, evidence of cell survival (using MRI and PET scans of the
      brain), and effect on Parkinson's disease symptoms are assessed for 2 years post-transplant.
