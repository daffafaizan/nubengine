      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of entinostat
      administered as a single-agent, once weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid
      tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of entinostat administered as a single agent, once
      weekly to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of entinostat in children with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of entinostat within the confines of a
      phase 1 study.

      II. To assess change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs) as a marker of the biologic activity of entinostat.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
