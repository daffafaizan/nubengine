      use of antifibrinolytics in spine fusion surgery. Several studies support the successful use
      of tranexamic acid for major orthopedic procedures, but the patient populations studied for
      spine surgery thus far have been small and highly variable, with less than clinically
      significant results. If TXA if efficacious in reducing not only perioperative blood loss, but
      RBC transfusion without an increase in thromboembolic events, then its use may be justified
      for patients at risk for major blood transfusion.
