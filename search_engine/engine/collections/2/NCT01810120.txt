      (PBSC)selectively depleted of TCR alfa beta T lymphocytes would offers some advantages over
      the use of positively selected CD34+ stem cells because of the presence of other non-stem
      ancillary cells (in particular Natural killer (NK) and alfa beta T cells) that might have
      potential positive effects on the outcome of the transplant.

      The clinical relevance of NK-cell alloreactivity has been demonstrated in adult patients
      affected by Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and given T-cell depleted HSCT from an HLA-disparate
      relative where a subgroup of patients had a particularly low risk of leukemia relapse. These
      patients belonged to the group transplanted from a donor having NK cells that were
      alloreactive towards recipient targets i.e. the patient cells express HLA-class I alleles
      that do not share the inhibiting allelic determinants recognized by Killer
      immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on donor NK cells. The emergence of this concept of
      NK-cell alloreactivity has represented a sort of revolution in the field of Haplo-identical
      hematopoietic stem cell translantation (haplo-HSCT), as the presence of alloreactive NK cells
      has been shown to positively affect the outcome of transplantation in adults and to display a
      Graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect that can compensate for the lack of T-specific anti-tumor
      effect.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the selective infusion
      of TCR alfa beta T cell depleted graft in pediatric patients affected by malignant or non
      malignant hematological disorders and receiving an HSCT from a partially matched family
      donor.

      This study will provide new data on the feasibility and the safety of using a TCR alfa beta T
      cell depleted graft instead of fully T cell depleted graft to improve the outcome of patients
      receiving a haplo-HSCT for the treatment of hematological disorders.
