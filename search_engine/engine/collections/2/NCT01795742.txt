      asthma with nebulized salbutamol (2.5mg). Subjects will receive nebulization using either an
      electric nebulizer compressor or a human-powered nebulizer compressor. Improvement in peak
      expiratory flow will be the primary endpoint. Blood oxygenation levels as measured by pulse
      oximetry will be a secondary endpoint of the trial.
