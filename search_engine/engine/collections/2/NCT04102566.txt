      multi-modal protocol. Multi-modal pain control is defined as: "analgesia that combines 2 or
      more agents that act by different mechanisms to provide analgesia with better pain relief and
      less opioids". In addition, patients in the intervention arm will receive education regarding
      pain control and opioid use. The investigators aim to demonstrate non-inferior pain control
      with this approach. The investigators hope this will inform new guidelines for pain control
      after TURP, minimize opioid use in this patient population, and educate physicians and
      patients on providing excellent pain control while minimizing the risks of opioid use. The
      investigators believe this could ultimately serve as a model for other endoscopic urologic
      procedures as well.
