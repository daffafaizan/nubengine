      participants in each study group. Women will be recruited at 2-6 months postpartum, with the
      intervention lasting through 12 months postpartum. Data collection will include:1) Physical
      activity; 2) Maternal body composition; 3) Questionnaires to assess:motivation to adopt
      healthy behaviors, body attitudes, infant feeding practices; 4) Process evaluation to assess:
      likes and dislikes about the intervention program, suggestions for improving the
      intervention, reasons for leaving the study. The proposed study time period is 6 months for
      study recruitment, 18 months to carry out the study, and 6 months for data analysis (total 2
      years).
