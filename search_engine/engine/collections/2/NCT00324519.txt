      termination is dependant on ripening of the cervix prior to labor induction. Multiple methods
      of cervical ripening and labor induction have been used for pregnancy termination in the
      second trimester. These two methods have different mechanisms of action. This study seeks to
      evaluate the effectiveness of these two methods.
