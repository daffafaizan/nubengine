      protocol for stimulating circuits relevant for addiction. Specifically, we will develop
      stimulation parameters and outcome measures for rTMS of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
      with a specialized TMS coil: the HAC coil (Brainsway Ltd.). Various parameters of rTMS
      stimulation (frequency and intensity) will be varied, and the sensitivity of behavioral tasks
      and MRI measures to this stimulation will be determined. The objective of this protocol is
      therefore to allow for the development, assessment and refinement of rTMS parameters for
      stimulating ACC targets. In addition, outcome measures will be developed to capture the
      effects of this stimulation. Results from this development protocol will be applied to
      subsequent cognitive imaging protocols.

      Study population: Up to 50 healthy, non-smoking adults will be tested in several conditions
      over up to two weeks. Subjects must fit exclusion/inclusion criteria for TMS and MRI. We
      expect 140 subjects to be enrolled to arrive at a number of 50 who complete the protocol.

      Design: Within-subject design with each subject completing up to 10 rTMS sessions.

      Outcome measures: In a first phase, the outcome measure will be the behavioral response on a
      task that relies on the ACC. In a second phase, outcome measures will be the effects on MR
      measures. These will include task-related blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses, as
      well as resting state BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Other MR measures,
      such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and arterial spin labeling (ASL), will also be
      explored as potential biomarkers.
