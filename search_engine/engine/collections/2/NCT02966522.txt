      primary aim of amyloidosis treatment should be an organ reversal. However, due to various
      reasons, not much is known about organ reversal in amyloidosis. Almost all of the clinical
      trials evaluated hematologic response in amyloidosis. Meanwhile, besides autologous stem cell
      transplantation with high-dose melphalan conditioning, hematologic response rate of various
      agents such as bortezomib, melphalan, thalidomide and lenalidomide are similar for
      amyloidosis. However, organ reversing potential of these agents is not known. If there is a
      difference in organ reversing potential despite of similar hematologic response rate, drug
      with effective organ reversing potential should be a standard treatment for amyloidosis.

      The investigators assume that thalidomide could make organ reversal in cardiac amyloidosis
      due to its specific mechanism of action. To prove this concept, the investigators propose a
      clinical trial that evaluates organ reversing potential of thalidomide in cardiac
      amyloidosis.
