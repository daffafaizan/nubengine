      to the whole breast/chest wall and to the draining lymph nodes; an optional single fraction 8
      Gy boost was administered with electrons to the tumor bed in patients who had undergone
      conservative surgery. Both acute (CTCAE v4.0) and late (LENT/SOMA) toxicity were collected.
      All pts but those who underwent mastectomy without reconstruction or with temporary expander
      were also asked to rate their cosmetic outcome according to the Harvard. Toxicity was
      assessed weekly during RT and then at each follow-up examination (1, 3, 6 months and then
      yearly).
