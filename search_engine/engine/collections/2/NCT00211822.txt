      in pathological gamblers and people with obsessive compulsive disorder compared to healthy
      controls. Healthy participants and participants who are diagnosed with PG or OCD will undergo
      one fMRI scan. The brain scan will last about one and a half hours and will involve
      performing tasks while in the scanner.
