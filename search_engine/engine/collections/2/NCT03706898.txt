      chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). This, as well as a possible change in PK parameters in case
      of co-administration of Elpida® and HIV integrase inhibitors, necessitates the study of PK
      and safety of co-administration of Elpida® with a combination of Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir and
      Dolutegravir in healthy subjects. Thus, the study to evaluates safety and pharmacokinetics of
      Elpida® in healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment, as well as assesses the
      impact of food intake and drug-drug interactions in case of co-administration with other
      antiviral drugs in healthy subjects.
