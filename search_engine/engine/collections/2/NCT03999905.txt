      gastrointestinal bleeding) they are not as prominent as that of warfarin but still important
      to consider before prescribing to patients. These limitations associated with the use of oral
      anticoagulants prove that there is need for special counseling of patients placed on oral
      anticoagulants. Counseling, as an important aspect of drug therapy management, is somewhat
      technical and requires a peculiar way of providing vital information on drug therapy within
      the shortest possible time. Pharmacists, who are key members of the healthcare team, are
      tasked with this role more than others and as such this area is of optimum importance.

      Proper and adequate counseling on oral anticoagulants is essential for optimal use of the
      drug and to reduce the number of incidence of adverse drug reactions. Adequate counseling
      cannot be achieved without proper training. This aspect is seen to be lacking due to the
      suboptimal performance discovered in research among healthcare professionals including
      pharmacists with regards to counseling of patients on oral anticoagulant use Mystery patients
      in pharmacy practice research are a very reliable means of obtaining unbiased data on
      pharmacists with regards to counseling. This study, therefore, is aimed at providing
      counseling training to community pharmacists and evaluating the impact of the training on
      patients indirectly using the mystery patient model.
