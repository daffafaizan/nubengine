    
      MePPEP is a ligand that is highly selective for the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor. This
      receptor is considered the most common G-coupled protein receptor in the brain (Pacher et
      al., 2006). The CB1 receptor is the site of action of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC), the
      active compound in marijuana, and is found primarily on the presynaptic terminals of
      dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic neurons (Howlett et al., 2002). The function of the
      CB1 receptor is not entirely clear; however, it has been implicated in several neurological
      and psychiatric disorders, and a selective inverse agonist, rimonabant, is currently in use
      in Europe for the treatment of obesity (Van Gaal et al., 2005). [11C]MePPEP was developed to
      enhance our understanding of the in vivo characteristics of the CB1 receptor (e.g., receptor
      density and receptor occupancy with pharmaceuticals).

      The purpose of this protocol is to establish an accurate method to measure CB1 receptor
      levels in brain by performing test/retest brain imaging studies. The results of this overall
      study are required to apply this PET ligand in various neurological and psychiatric disorders
      in the future.
