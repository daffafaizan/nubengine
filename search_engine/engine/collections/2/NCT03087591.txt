    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities and establish the safety of multiple infusions of small
      interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells APN401
      (APN401).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immunologic effects of multiple infusions of APN401. II. To document
      clinical response and survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive siRNA-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells APN401 intravenously
      (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 29, and 57 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
