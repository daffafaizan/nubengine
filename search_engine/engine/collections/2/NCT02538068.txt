      purpose and physical activity maintenance in a group of previously sedentary adults starting
      new exercise programs. Participants complete questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12
      weeks after starting an exercise program. Participants are randomly assigned to complete
      questionnaires about daily meaning, mood, and activity for the first 4 weeks or to complete 8
      random questionnaires about daily activities over the first 4 weeks. It is hypothesized that
      personal life meaning and purpose will be related to greater exercise participation at 12
      weeks.
