      we will prospectively evaluate whether nightly treatment with the orexin-1/2 receptor
      antagonist suvorexant (10 or 20 mg/day PO), relative to placebo, can increase outpatient
      opioid abstinence and improve sleep efficiency (sleep time per time-in-bed) as a
      mediator/moderator among patients with OUD. We have included current major depression and
      current alcohol use disorder severity as stratification factors in the group allocation.
      Using power and sample size calculations, we estimate that 60 participants in each study arm
      will suffice to test our hypotheses. We anticipate enrolling 210 participants to obtain the
      180 completers (60 participants in each of the 3 treatment arms).

      The study aims to test three co-primary hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: Relative to placebo, at least one of the two suvorexant doses (10 or 20 mg/day)
      will significantly increase percentage opioid abstinence during outpatient weeks 1-13.

      Hypothesis 2: Relative to placebo (i.e. expected sleep loss related to opioid
      detoxification), at least one of the two suvorexant doses will improve sleep efficiency
      during the inpatient stay.

      Hypothesis 3: Higher inpatient sleep efficiency will be associated with increased outpatient
      opioid abstinence (independent of experimental group assignment).
