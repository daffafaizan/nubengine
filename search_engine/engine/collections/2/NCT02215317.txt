      However, existing data were generated from small-scale, single-center studies. Therefore, in
      the Sleep and Stent Study, the investigators aim to conduct a large-scale multi-national
      cohort study to determine the association between OSA and the incidence of adverse
      cardiovascular outcomes over a long-term follow-up period. The investigators hypothesize that
      OSA is an independent risk factor for the development of major adverse cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in coronary artery disease patients treated with PCI. Results
      from the Sleep and Stent Study will advance the fundamental understanding of the burden and
      prognostic implications of OSA in patients undergoing PCI for coronary artery disease.
