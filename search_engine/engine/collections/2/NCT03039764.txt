      United States and one of the leading causes of disability and loss of motor function.
      Approximately 80% of stroke survivors have upper extremity limitations where the distal upper
      extremity motor function is severely affected and is the last body part to recover.
      Restoration of arm function is essential to regaining activities of daily living (ADL) such
      as holding objects like utensils, turning a doorknob, writing or telephone use. Literature
      search shows that intensive and repetitive training may be necessary to modify neural
      organization and recover functional motor skills. Along with traditional rehabilitation
      methods, virtual reality (VR) based rehabilitation has emerged in recent years. VR-based
      rehabilitation is more intensive, of longer duration and more repetitive. Using VR
      rehabilitation, repetitive dull exercises can turn into a more challenging and motivating
      tasks such as games. Moreover, VR-based rehabilitation can provide a quantitative measure of
      the rehabilitation progress.

      The investigators propose a study comparing conventional occupational services versus virtual
      reality-based rehabilitation intervention for participants during acute phase of stroke in
      the inpatient rehabilitation setting. The investigators hypothesize that by using VRA, will
      see a significant increase in the overall motor function, shorter hospital course and
      improved quality of life for the participants.
