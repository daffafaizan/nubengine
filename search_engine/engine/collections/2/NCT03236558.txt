      expresses a repertoire of antigen receptors that is approximately ten-fold less diverse than
      that found in mice resistant to autoimmune pathology. Genetic models later showed that this
      reduced diversity was involved in the susceptibility to diabetes. Researchers study the
      diversity of the TCR expressed by regulatory T cells from paediatric type I diabetes patients
      and controls. Regulatory T cells emigrated from the thymus will be isolated from the blood of
      patients and healthy controls. The repertoire of antigen-receptors will be analysed by high
      throughput sequencing and its diversity estimated using appropriate statistical models
      borrowed from ecology.
