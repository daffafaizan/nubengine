2950. aortico-left ventricular tunnel.  a cause of massive aortic regurgitationand of intracardiac aneurysmthe clinical, roentgenographic, hemodynamicand pathologic findings in a 14-year-old boy with aortico-left ventricular tunnel arepresented.  the accessory channelbetween the aorta and left ventricle resulted inmassive aortic regurgitation, andthe portion of the tunnel which traversed theventricular septum was aneurysmal,displaced the posterior wall of the rightventricle and caused severe obstructionto right ventricular outflow.  the presenceof associated cardiovascular anomalies,in this and previously reported cases,suggests that the malformation is congenitalrather than acquired.  the clinical andhemodynamic manifestations of aortico-leftventricular tunnel are indistinguishablefrom those observed with the more commonforms of aortic regurgitation, and thecorrect diagnosis can be established only bythoracic aortography.  the malformationis usually recognized in childhood; sinceaortic regurgitant flow can be abolished bysimple closure of the aortic ostium,and without aortic valve replacement, theindications for operative treatmentdiffer from those which apply in aorticregurgitation due to a valvular anomaly.
