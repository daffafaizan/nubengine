    
      If you agree to take part in this study, right after your already scheduled routine PET/CT
      scan is complete, a study staff member will take you to a separate imaging room located in
      the same clinic area where your routine PET/CT scan was just performed.

      You will then sit in a chair as a study staff member positions the PEMFlex Solo II on either
      side of your breast that has, or is suspected to have cancer. To take images using the
      PEMFlex Solo II, the breast is placed between two flat panels on the scanning machine and
      compressed (flattened). The position of the breast for this procedure is similar to getting a
      mammogram, but the PEMFlex Solo II uses about 50% less force to compress the breast(s). The
      compression will be repeated on the other breast if you are having scans of both breasts
      performed.

      It will take about 20 minutes to set up the PEMFlex Solo II and take the PET scan images.

      Length of Study:

      After the PET scan images have been taken using the PEMFlex Solo II, your participation in
      this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. The PEMFlex Solo II is commercially available for PET scan
      imaging of the breast.

      Up to 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
