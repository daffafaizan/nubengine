    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the internal consistency, reliability and
      validity of two assessments: (1) UHDRS Structured Interview of Function (SIF) that
      incorporates the UHDRS Total Functional Capacity, Functional Assessment Scale, and
      Independence Scale (UHDRS TFC, FAS and IS), and (2) the HD Clinical Status Questionnaire
      (HDCSQ). There will be two study parts: Part 1 will measure the performance of the UHDRS SIF
      assessment compared to the original UHDRS TFC, FAS and IS using a cross-over design by
      collecting data from the Manifest HD gene expansion carrier participants (Manifest HDGEC
      Participants) and their companions (Companion Participants) via an in-person baseline visit
      and a follow-up visit by phone. Part 2 will assess the UHDRS SIF and the HDCSQ using a
      cross-sectional design by collecting data from the Companion Participants via a follow-up
      visit by phone. Participants of Part 1 are eligible to participate in Part 2.
