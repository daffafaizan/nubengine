      to three coronary arteries supplying three major cardiac territories to the heart (anterior,
      lateral, inferior/posterior). After completion of the screening procedures, Phase Ia subjects
      will receive CAP-1002 administered via intracoronary infusion in a dose escalation, stepwise
      manner. Phase Ia subjects will be followed at Week 2 and at Months 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 after
      CAP-1002 infusion. The first fourteen (14) subjects will receive intracoronary infusion of
      CAP-1002 in an open-label fashion (Phase Ia). Once all 14 subjects in the Phase Ia have
      reached the primary safety endpoint (1 month visit), the DSMB will conduct a review of the
      Phase Ia data and recommend whether to proceed with enrollment of the next 28 subjects in the
      Phase Ib.
