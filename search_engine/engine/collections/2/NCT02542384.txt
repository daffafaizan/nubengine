    
      Patients will be admitted to the surgical center on the day of their abdominal surgery (Day
      1, unless admission the night before is required). All patients will be seen by the study
      staff to confirm eligibility, review study procedures, and conduct all pre-surgical
      assessments required for randomization.

      Qualified patients will be randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups, corresponding to 1 of 2
      dose levels of intravenous (IV) CR845 (0.5 or 1 mcg/kg) or matched placebo, respectively.

      Study drug will be administered every 6 hours during the 24-hour post-operative treatment
      period following these initial 2 drug administrations:

        -  Pre-Operative dose: Within one hour prior to anesthetic induction for surgery. This dose
           will be a 2X loading dose.

        -  Baseline post-operative dose: within 30-minutes of being considered stable in the
           Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)

      Subsequent dosing will be administered at 6, 12 and 18 hours.

      During the Treatment and Observation Period, pain intensity scores will be obtained at
      specified time points and episodes of nausea or vomiting will be recorded. Upon request,
      patients may be provided with analgesic or anti-nausea rescue medication (restricted to
      morphine (if tolerated), and ondansetron, respectively) at any time after the Baseline dose
      of study drug is administered.

      Blood sampling and safety assessments will be conducted during this period as well.

      Patients will remain in the hospital until Day 3 (48-hours after surgery) at which point they
      will be evaluated for discharge. A follow-up medical evaluation will be scheduled within 7 -
      10 days post-surgery.
