        1. To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of H1N12009 influenza vaccine in a convenience
           sample of adults, soon after the pandemic vaccine becomes available so as to inform the
           subsequent use of vaccine in public programs.

        2. To evaluate the compatibility of co-administered H1N12009 pandemic vaccine and seasonal
           TIV vaccine in the same group of subjects, as the option of co-administration would be
           useful for public programs.
