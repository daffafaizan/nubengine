      University of Konstanz, with focus on refugees. All of them (approx. 100) will receive a
      structured interview and a detailed diagnosis. The interview includes questions about
      sociodemography, traumatic events, PTSD and depression symptomatology. Individuals with a
      PTSD diagnosis (up to 30) will be offered a Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET).

      Irrespective of treatment and diagnosis, respondents are asked to participate in monthly
      telephone interviews assessing trauma-related and emotional distress and changes in life.
      Interviews assessing PTSD, depression symptoms and emotional distress will be conducted 6 and
      12 months after the initial interview.

      In addition, participants receiving NET will rate their PTSD symptoms and functionality prior
      to each therapy session.
