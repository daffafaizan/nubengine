      for about 30 days. This study is aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of D-PLEX in
      prevention of post abdominal surgery incisional infection.

      The study population includes male and female, 18 years old and above at screening,
      undergoing an elective colorectal surgery involving colon or rectal resection, with or
      without a stoma formation, that includes at least 1 incision that is ≥ 7cm (target incision).

      Eligible and willing subjects will be randomly allocated into 2 blinded study arms, either to
      the investigational arm (D-PLEX + SoC) or to the control arm (SoC only) in a 1:1 ratio.
      Subjects will be stratified by incisional length (7cm ≤10 cm, >10 ≤20cm, >20cm), type of
      prophylactic SoC (IV antibiotic only, IV antibiotic with mechanical bowel preparation or IV
      antibiotic with oral antibiotics combined with mechanical bowel preparation) and by region
      (US versus Europe + Israel).

      D-PLEX will be applied during the surgery at the final stage of incision closure. All
      patients will be followed up for additional 5 visits over 2 months, for safety and incisional
      wound assessment. This will include blood tests for hematology and chemistry as well as
      physician's assessment of the incisional wound.
