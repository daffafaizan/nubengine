    
      This study is a prospective, pre-market, multi-center, single arm study evaluating up to 50
      subjects with symptoms of ischemic heart disease attributable to stenotic lesions of the
      coronary arteries that are amenable to treatment with the Medtronic Coronary Drug-Coated
      Balloon Catheter.

      Patients with de novo lesions, In-Stent Restenosis or small vessel disease who qualify for
      percutaneous coronary interventions treatable with the device with a diameter between 2.0 mm
      to 4.0 mm and a length â‰¤25 mm will be screened and are intended to participate in this study.

      Each subject is expected to be followed in the study for 12 months. Procedural/acute outcomes
      and clinical outcomes will be assessed at procedure, 30 days, 6 and 12 months.
