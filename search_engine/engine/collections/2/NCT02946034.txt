      ombitasvir, dasabuvir (referred to as Viekira Pak) Â± ribavirin for adults with advanced CKD
      with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45ml/min that are infected with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and to determine the effect of treatment on traditional
      and novel markers of kidney function and cardiovascular disease risk in patients with
      advanced CKD. During the course of this prospective, single arm treatment trial, we will
      measure currently accepted markers of kidney function and novel biomarkers of CKD progression
      to determine if they improve with eradication of HCV.

      The objective of arm 2 is to evaluate Glecaprevir / Pibrentasvir (referred to as Mavyret) for
      adults with advanced CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than
      45ml/min that are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and to determine the
      effect of treatment on traditional and novel markers of kidney function and cardiovascular
      disease risk in patients with advanced CKD. During the course of this prospective, single arm
      treatment trial, we will measure currently accepted markers of kidney function and novel
      biomarkers of CKD progression to determine if they improve with eradication of HCV.
