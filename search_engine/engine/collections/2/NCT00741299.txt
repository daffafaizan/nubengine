      related to psychotic symptomatology. Only a few small descriptive studies have examined the
      prevalence and correlates of tobacco use among bipolar patients with conflicting results.
      Patients who smoke score higher on rating scales for psychotic symptoms than their
      non-smoking peers. While the association of smoking with psychotic symptomatology in
      schizophrenia is established, such association according to bipolar affective disorder has
      been reported in a few studies and remains unclear. Also a few studies reported about
      association of smoking with depressive and manic symptoms, and with suicidal behavior in
      bipolar patients. Thus further investigation of these issues is warranted.
