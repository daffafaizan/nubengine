      patients are diagnosed by computerized tomography scan and endoscopic ultrasound.

      The neoadjuvant strategy consists of 3-4 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy comprises weekly chemotherapy concurrently
      with daily external beam radiotherapy up to 45 Gy). Surgery is scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after
      the end of CRT. Pathological response is graded according to the Becker criteria. Statistical
      analysis is performed IBM SPSS v20.

      Estimate whether R0 resection rate, pathological response degree, patterns of recurrence and
      long-term outcomes may be initially predicted by dynamic prognostic factors as tumor size,
      neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR)
