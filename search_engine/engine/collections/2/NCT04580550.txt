    
      This is a prospective observational, controlled and unmasked study that would include
      patients which undergo cataract presurgical examination, after patient signed written
      informed consent. For each patient only one eye will be included.

      In total 50 eyes of 50 patients will be include. Due to missing previous data, the sample
      size is an approximation.

      Prior to surgery, slit lamp examination and cataract grading (LOCS) is performed. Routine
      biometry is performed using the IOL Master 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) and
      Heidelberg Anterion (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) for AL and lens measurement.

      Additionally, evaluation of tilt and decentration will be performed using Purkinje meter
      device.

      Follow-up examination will be performed three months after surgery and will contain: AL and
      lens measurement using the two ss-OCT biometery devices, lens evaluation (tilt and
      decentration of the IOL) using the Purkinje meter. Refractive outcome will be evaluated by
      determining best-corrected visual acuity and subjective refraction.

      In women of childbearing age, a pregnancy test will be performed before inclusion into the
      study.

      Main outcome variable:

      â€¢ Extend of AL difference between pre- and postoperative measurements in both devices

      Additional outcome variables:

        -  Agreement between the two ss-OCT devices in AL measurement

        -  Evaluation of lens parameter in AL differences between pre- and postoperative
           measurements

        -  Limit of agreement in lens tilt and decentration using two ss-OCT devices and Purkinje
           meter
