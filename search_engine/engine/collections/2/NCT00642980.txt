    
      Patients diagnosed with BV before 13 weeks will be divided into two groups. They will be
      defined as at low risk when they have no history of spontaneous preterm delivery or late
      abortion. Women with such histories will be defined as at high risk.

      Low risk patients will be asked to participate in a trial with 3 equal parallel groups,
      comparing two regimes of clindamycin (one or three 4-day treatments of clindamycin 300
      mgx2/d) and placebo.

      High-risk patients will be asked to participate in a trial with 2 parallel groups to assess
      the usefulness of repeating antibiotic treatment monthly by comparing the administration of
      one 4-day treatment of clindamycin (300 mgx2/d) to three 4-day treatments, one month apart.
