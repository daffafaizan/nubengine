      cold-induced (protocol B) BAT metabolic activation using 11C-acetate to measure BAT metabolic
      activity. The principle of this method is measurement of tissue fast disappearance of 11C, a
      marker of tissue 11CO2 production. This fast tissue 11C clearance thus gives an index of
      tissue oxidative metabolism. Ten healthy, non obese men will undergo two identical 5h
      procedures in which BAT metabolism will be stimulated with a Î²3-agonist (mirabegron 50mg) or
      using cold exposure, in random order. The investigator just received approval from Health
      Canada to use mirabegron as part of these metabolic investigations. In brief, baseline blood
      samples and indirect calorimetry will be performed between time -60 to -30 min followed by
      i.v. injection of 11C-acetate with 30 min dynamic PET/CT scanning at room temperature in both
      protocol A and B. Mirabegron will be administered orally at time 0 in protocol A whereas
      acute cold exposure protocol using a water-conditioned cooling suit will be applied from time
      120 to 300 min in protocol B. At time 210 min (i.e. Tmax of plasma mirabegron level or 90 min
      after the onset of cold exposure), i.v. injection of 11C-acetate will be repeated followed by
      30 min dynamic PET/CT scanning. I.v. injection of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) will be
      performed at time 270 min, followed by 30 min dynamic PET/CT scanning to determine BAT net
      glucose uptake and a whole-body PET/CT scan to determine BAT volume of metabolic activity and
      organ-specific glucose partitioning.
