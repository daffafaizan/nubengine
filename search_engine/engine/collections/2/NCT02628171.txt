      however, most of the research has been done with almonds, walnuts, and pistachios, while
      studies with cashew nuts are lacking. In addition to the cardiovascular literature, our
      recent studies measuring the metabolizable energy of nuts have demonstrated that the measured
      energy value of almonds, pistachios, and walnuts is lower than that predicted using the
      Atwater factors. However, the measured energy value of cashew nuts is unknown. There are two
      distinct aims of this study - determining the effects of cashew nut consumption on risk
      factors of CVD, and determining the energy value of cashew nuts in the human diet. The
      cardiovascular effects of cashew nuts will be determined by measuring both traditional and
      emerging risk factors. The metabolizable energy value of cashew nuts will be calculated based
      on the chemical composition and energy content of the consumed diet and excreta. This will
      provide a better estimate of the energy value than simply calculating energy value based on
      Atwater factors.
