      half regain pre-fracture independence. 95% of all hip fractures in older adults are due to
      falls. Thus, reducing fall risk while restoring function post-hip fracture is critical. Many
      with fall-related hip fractures have cognitive impairment and they are less likely to regain
      pre-fracture level of function than those without cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment
      also increase falls risk. It is currently unknown whether exercise is efficacious in reducing
      fall risk and promoting function among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      a fall-related hip fracture. The purpose of this 6-month proof-of-concept RCT is to assess
      the efficacy of the home-based Otago Exercise Program (OEP) compared with usual care in
      reducing fall risk among community-dwelling older adults with MCI and a fall-related hip
      fracture.
