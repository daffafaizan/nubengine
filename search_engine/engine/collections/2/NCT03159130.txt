      surgical population. Approximately 12 to 15 weight reduction surgeries are performed at
      William Beaumont Army Medical Center each month. It is the current practice that each patient
      receiving the laparoscopic gastric sleeve or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass receive an
      OnQ pain catheter during the surgery to reduce post-operative pain. There have been limited
      studies to quantify the efficacy of these devices. This study will seek to identify if a
      quantifiable improved post-operative course occurs in patients receiving a catheter filled
      with local anesthetic versus that achieved by patients who receive a catheter filled with
      injectable saline.
