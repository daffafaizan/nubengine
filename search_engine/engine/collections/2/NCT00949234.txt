      community, academic, and private agencies and individuals in an effort to provide a
      comprehensive package of HIV prevention services of which PEP can be an integral component.
      These services are designed to be easily accessible, non-judgmental, culturally, ethnically,
      and linguistically appropriate to the relevant populations, community-based, and independent
      of ability to pay or insurance/documentation status. They will also provide vital linkages to
      associated services, routine HIV testing, and primary health care.

      In its initial pilot project, 2 community-based sites will serve as facilities at which
      patients may present for screening for post-exposure prophylaxis services, as well as
      sexually transmitted diseases. At the sites, initial eligibility and testing will be
      performed, and an initial 14-day supply of PEP medications will be provided if appropriate,
      and referrals will be initiated. All subjects who are provided an initial 14-day supply will
      be required to return to the site for the remainder of the 28-day course of medication,
      follow-up testing, adherence counseling, risk-reduction programming, and other appropriate
      referrals. Follow-up with patients by phone, email, and mobile-phone text message will be
      used as appropriate to maximize program retention.
