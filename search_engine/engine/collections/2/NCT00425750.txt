      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
           squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with bortezomib and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  Determine 20S proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
           these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of bortezomib on NF-kB pathway in PBMC and serum samples.

        -  Identify biomarkers of clinical response to bortezomib and docetaxel in PBMC and serum.

        -  Determine quality of life, symptom burden, and physical function outcome in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive docetaxel* IV over 30 minutes and bortezomib IV on days 1 and 8. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Docetaxel is not administered on day 1 of course 1.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, after bortezomib administration on day 1 of course
      1, and at the completion of treatment. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics of
      bortezomib are assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 weeks for 1 year and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
