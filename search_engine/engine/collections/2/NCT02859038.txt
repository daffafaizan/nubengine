    
      OBJECTIVES: Compare the efficacy and safety in patients with FIGO (2014) stage IIIC or IV
      epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal carcinoma treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery versus upfront surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized phase III multicenter study. Patients will receive upfront
      maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by at least 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy or 3
      cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery, and then at least
      3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months within the first 5 years, and then every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 456 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
