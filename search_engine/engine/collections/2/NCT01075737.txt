      that they cannot perform themselves, because of their lack of autonomy. The fact of aiding a
      person with some degree of disability due to a chronic disease in an intense way and for a
      long time could generate a high level of satisfaction in the caregiver; but at the same time
      the emotional and physical exhaustion of the caregiver increases as the disease progresses.
      The QoL of the person who is emotionally bonded to the MS subject as a caregiver has a great
      chance to be affected; and this is for sure more likely than in the case when the caregiver
      is a hired professional.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To identify the impact of MS on the QoL of the MS subjects and their caregivers

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To establish the correlation between the QoL of the subjects with MS and their
           caregivers

        -  To identify the predictors of the QoL in the caregiver group

      This is an observational, prospective and non-interventional study planned to be conducted in
      20 centers in Argentina. The subjects with diagnosed MS will be managed with the clinical and
      therapeutic elements that their treating doctors considered appropriate, without modifying
      their decisions due to the subjects' inclusion into the study. The caregivers will be asked
      to complete the QoL questionnaire as a part of the normal interview on each and every visit.
      The total duration of the study is 24 months. A descriptive analysis will be performed for
      the demographic and clinical characteristics of the investigation subjects, as well as for
      the characteristics of the treatments they receive when they start their participation in
      this study. For the qualitative variables, treatment modifications, frequency tables and the
      percentages will be performed.
