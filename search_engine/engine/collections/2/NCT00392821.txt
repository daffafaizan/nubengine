      that are carried out by cancer cells that make them grow and spread. Sorafenib is an approved
      drug for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer. RAD001 is an experimental drug that has
      been used in other research studies with other types of cancer. In this trial, the use of
      RAD001 and sorafenib together for the treatment of kidney cancer is experimental. In the
      Phase I portion of this study 13-16 patients will be treated with the same dose of sorafenib
      and different doses of RAD001. The purpose is to see what is a safe dose of RAD001 when
      combined with sorafenib in the treatment of kidney cancer. Once this dose of RAD001 is
      determined, about 65 more patients will be treated to see how effective this combination of
      drugs is against this kidney cancer.

      Both of these drugs are taken by mouth. Sorafenib will be taken twice a day. RAD001 is taken
      by mouth weekly. Patients will be able to continue treatment as long as their disease does
      not worsen or side effects become intolerable.
