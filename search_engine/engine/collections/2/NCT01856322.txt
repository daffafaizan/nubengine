           cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Established evidence indicates
           activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is an early step in the malignant
           transformation of colorectal adenomas with persistent activation in 90% of colorectal
           cancers. Activation of this pathway ultimately effects transcription of the S100A4 gene.

        -  S100A4 transcript serum levels have been shown to correlate with risk of recurrence in
           colorectal cancer and patients with systemic metastases are found to have increased
           S100A4 transcript expression.

        -  S100A4 may be a novel prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.

        -  Cyclooxygenase-2 is a key enzyme involved in the inflammatory response and is a key
           target of molecular chemoprevention in colorectal adenoma prevention trials.

        -  Recent studies demonstrate mitigation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by COX-2 inhibition
           via administration of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac using in
           vitro and in vivo animal models.

        -  We hypothesize that sulindac administration will abrogate Wnt/beta-catenin mediated
           signaling and thus decrease S100A4 activity in patients with colorectal metastases.

        -  We propose to define the benefit of sulindac administration to patients with colorectal
           metastases following resection and validate the use of circulating S100A4 transcripts as
           a novel biomarker for disease recurrence.
