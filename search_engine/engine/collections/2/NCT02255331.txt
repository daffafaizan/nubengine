      concerns have been raised regarding the development of adverse local tissue reactions
      (ALTRs). Our group has previously found that: 1) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect
      and distinguish wear debris from THA; 2) MRI is sensitive to ALTR damage from different
      articulating surfaces; and 3) variable host-mediated response to wear debris mounts distinct
      morphologic patterns on MRI. There is continued interest in the evaluation of soft tissues
      near THAs as traditional THA designs, including metal-on-polyethylene (MOP) and
      ceramic-on-polyethylene (COP) bearing surfaces, have recently been implicated in ALTRs. It is
      believed that fretting and corrosion at the head-neck junction is responsible for ALTRs,
      secondary to flexural rigidity and other implant mechanical features. If a greater prevalence
      of ALTR is found in components with more flexible connections, this could drive the practice
      of THA to stiffer connections.

      In this study, we will evaluate two important causes of implant failure: (1) in designs not
      traditionally associated with ALTRs such as metal-on-polyethylene (MOP) and
      ceramic-on-polyethylene (COP) we will assess patients indicated for revision THA surgery with
      MRI and correlate the imaging metrics to targeted biopsy retrieval obtained at the time of
      revision (including the trunnion), the extent of tissue damage documented at surgery, and
      implant retrieval analysis of the neck trunnion, including flexural rigidity analysis; and
      (2) to longitudinally assess implant integration using qualitative MRI evaluation of the
      bone-implant interface as well as quantitative MRI techniques, T2 mapping and T2* mapping
      using MAVRIC-UTE, to evaluate relaxometry at the interface.
