    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of infants with mixed lineage
      leukemia-rearranged (MLL-R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with chemotherapy plus
      the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor lestaurtinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the 3-year EFS of infants with MLL-R ALL treated with chemotherapy plus the
      FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib to MLL-R patients treated with chemotherapy alone.

      II. To determine a safe, tolerable and biologically active dose of lestaurtinib given in
      sequential combination with chemotherapy in MLL-R infants.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lestaurtinib in infants
      when given at the proposed dose in sequential combination with chemotherapy.

      IV. To identify molecular mechanisms of resistance to lestaurtinib in leukemic blasts.

      V. To describe levels of minimal residual disease in infants with ALL within the context of
      the proposed therapy, and correlate with outcome.

      VI. To identify gene expression patterns in diagnostic infant leukemia samples that correlate
      with outcome within the context of the proposed therapy.

      VII. To describe the outcome of infants with MLL-G ALL treated with a modified P9407
      chemotherapy backbone that includes an extended continuation phase.

      A safety/activity phase is conducted separately for the intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk
      (HR) patients to identify a safe, tolerable, and biologically active dose of lestaurtinib
      combined with chemotherapy backbone. Once a tolerable/active dose of lestaurtinib has been
      identified for IR patients, subsequent IR patients are eligible to proceed to an efficacy
      phase, where they are randomized (or non-randomly assigned as of 7/16/2014) to chemotherapy
      with or without lestaurtinib. HR patients separately proceed to the randomized efficacy phase
      if a tolerable/active dose is identified for the HR stratum. IR and HR patients are
      randomized (or non-randomly assigned as of 7/16/2014) to 1 of 2 post-induction therapy
      regimens (post-induction therapy B or C).
