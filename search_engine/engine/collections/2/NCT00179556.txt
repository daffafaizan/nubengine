      in isoflavones, found in rich supply in soy products, as therapy for hot flashes. The effect
      of a daidzein-rich isoflavone-aglycone supplement from soy germ fermentation with Koji
      fungus, on the severity and frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women is being
      examined in a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The study is a
      13 week trial in which subjects record their hot flash frequency and severity in a diary.
      Subjects are given 40 mg or 60 mg of isoflavones (or placebo) once a day. This
      isoflavone-aglycone extract (Agly-Max TM, Nichimo, Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan) is a product
      prepared from soybean germ fermentation with Koji fungus (Aspergliius awamori) producing
      ÃŸ-glycosidase efficiency, followed by ethanol and water extraction and purification by using
      a proprietary extraction procedure. The product is rich in daidzein (70% daidzein, 10%
      genistein, and 20% glycitein).
