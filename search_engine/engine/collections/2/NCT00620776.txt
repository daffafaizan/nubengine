    
      The specific aims of this study are to collect preliminary data relevant to the following
      hypotheses:

        1. Primary Hypothesis: Acute phase improvement for combined cognitive behavioral therapy
           (CBT) plus medication will be superior to medication alone.

        2. Secondary Hypotheses: Combined CBT plus medication will be superior to medication alone
           on a number of secondary outcome measures, including the core feature of GAD (worry),
           depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life.

        3. Additional Exploratory Aim: We will explore the comparative relapse rates for the
           combined CBT plus medication treatment and the medication alone treatment condition at
           6-month follow-up.
