        -  Compare the overall survival rate of patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin or cisplatin followed by
           radiotherapy with or without concurrent paclitaxel.

        -  Compare the 1-year survival rate and mean survival time in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the objective response rate and local control in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the safety profile and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      All patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes or
      cisplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients then proceed
      to randomized treatment.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and radiotherapy on days 1-5
           of each week for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks. Patients are followed
           every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
