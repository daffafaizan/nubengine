      The secondary endpoint is in-stent percent diameter stenosis.This study is based on
      non-inferior assumption (vs. Xience V), requiring both endpoints reach statistical
      significance. Prespecified OCT follow-up is planned at 3-Year after index procedure at 3
      chosen hospitals.
