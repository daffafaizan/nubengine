      human growth hormone on the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC's) in the peripheral
      circulation. An increase in the number of EPC's is viewed as beneficial, as it has been
      postulated that they provide an endogenous repair mechanism to counteract endothelial injury.
      Additionally, a reduced number of EPC's has been found to independently predict
      atherosclerotic disease progression. Mechanisms proposed for enhancing the number of
      circulating EPC's and their function include an increase in proliferation, mobilization from
      the bone marrow, or prevention of EPC apoptosis. Thus, a pharmacologic manipulation of the
      number of EPC's in the peripheral circulation could potentially serve as a mechanism by which
      endothelial function, and thus vascular health, may be improved.
