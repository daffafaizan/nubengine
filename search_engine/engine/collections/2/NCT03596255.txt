      consecutively recruit adult patients returning for their annual examination. The patient
      rated DA using the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) and a Visual Analogue Scale of dental
      anxiety (DA-VAS). The patient also recorded gender, age, level of education and confidence in
      handling DA. After the examination, the dental personnel estimated the patient's level of DA
      (eDA) on a VAS. The examiner also recorded gender, age, profession, years of experience,
      country of education, interest in DA, special education concerning DA and confidence in
      ability to handle DA.
