      I. To determine the effect on percent with a 50% decrease in PSA response in patients with
      metastatic prostate cancer who have progressed on androgen ablation therapy and are
      classified into 1 of 3 separate categories:

        1. Never received prior chemotherapy/cytotoxic therapy

        2. Received prior taxane-based regimen

        3. Received 2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (including, but not limited to, prior
           taxane and anthracyclines)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine measurable disease response in patients with measurable disease treated with
      this drug and overall response rate.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the duration
      of PSA and measurable disease response in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the expression of p53, multidrug resistance protein, and Bcl-2 by
      immunohistochemistry in the primary tumors of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (none vs 1 prior taxane-containing regimen vs 2 prior cytotoxic regimens).

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
