      across the world. Myopia significantly affects the quality of life of an individual socially
      by restriction of employment in various fields and economically by additional cost for eye
      care and spectacles and contact lenses (Lim, Gazzard et al. 2009). In addition, high myopia
      increases the risk of ocular morbidity such as retinal detachment, cataract, glaucoma which
      can could lead to blindness. Several optical and pharmaceutical strategies were developed
      over the recent years that could control or slow the progression of myopia.

      It has been shown that persistent myopic defocus constantly applied on the whole retina has a
      beneficial effect on myopia progression, i.e. decrease in myopia progression (Anstice and
      Phillips 2011, Cheng, Woo et al. 2011, Ehsaei, Chisholm et al. 2011). In addition, a
      meta-analysis on the efficacy of non-invasive optical treatment strategies for myopia control
      reported prismatic bifocals to have the best outcome (Cheng, Woo et al. 2011). Therefore,
      test lenses were designed to increase the area and amount of myopic defocus on the retina
      without compromising vision.

      Thus, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy of test lenses to reduce the progression of
      myopia by either reducing the myopia progression rate per year and/or reducing the elongation
      of eyeball through myopic defocus compared with SVL. A total of 120 healthy children aged 8
      to 13 years will be recruited to participate in a double-masked cross-over clinical trial.
      Cycloplegic autorefraction will be the primary measure for myopia progression and axial
      length will the secondary outcome measure. Visual acuity will also be compared between test
      lens and control lens to determine the quality of vision using test lens.
