        -  Documenting project implementations and determining efficient replication methods for
           effective program components,

        -  Monitoring completion of overall program goals and objectives, and

        -  Allow for quality improvement during the five year grant cycle.

      The outcome evaluation which focuses on participant level impact will ask the following:

        -  Does participation in evidence-based relationship education improve healthy relationship
           skills for single or coupled enrollees?

        -  Does participation in partner education and support classes improve co-parenting
           relationship?

        -  Do participants have better attitudes toward their ability to manage money (i.e.
           savings, paying bills) after workshops in financial literacy and other money management
           services?

        -  Do participants have improved attitudes on their own employability after workshops
           targeted at job readiness?

        -  Does participation in job readiness preparation translate into improved employment
           prospects or readiness factors? (Readiness factors may include increased family assets
           and economic status.)

        -  Does participation in family care management sessions improve marriage/relationship,
           child and family well-being?

        -  Does participation in parenting education improve parenting skills and attitudes toward
           parenting? Does participation in parenting education improve commitment to parenting and
           children?
