      approach for a number of patients with hematological malignancies. However, the use of
      allo-SCT can expose patients to prolonged periods of immunosupression during which time viral
      infections can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

      Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and reactivation still represents one of the most
      important and lifethreatening complications in immunocompromised patients. Prophylaxis or
      early treatment with antiviral drugs after CMV reactivation have reduced the mortality
      related to this complication. However, the antiviral drugs have many side-effects and are
      costly. Furthermore, CMV infection refractory to antiviral treatment after alloSCT is
      associated with a high mortality. A number of studies have shown the efficacy of selecting
      Tcells against the virus from the donor and infusing them into the recipient (adoptive
      transfer of immunity) to prevent or treat CMV reactivation. However this approach relies on
      the donor having preexisitng immunity to CMV (50% of the healthy population is CMV
      seronegative and therefore have no preexisting immunity against CMV). We propose an
      alternative approach to collect CMV specific Tcells from the seropositive recipient prior to
      transplantation; the autologous CMV specific T cells will then be infused back into the
      recipient at the time of CMV reactivation post-transplant.

      This approach is especially relevant where the donor is CMV seronegative or unavailable or
      following the use of cord blood transplant where there is no memory T cell response to CMV.
