      However, the spontaneous resorption of the graft bone is still severe, and hinders the
      success of dental implant(s) and chewing function even after microsurgical vascularization.
      But till now, there is no effective prevention method for this major problem. Based on
      previous studies, the investigators pioneered a simultaneous innervated vascularized iliac
      bone graft method, through neurorrhaphy between the nerves innervating iliac bone and
      recipient site. A clinical retrospective study showed that this new method significantly
      decreases postoperative osteoporosis, and ensures the success of dental implants (Refer to
      our published article Wang L*, Wei J, Yang X, Yang Z, Sun M, Cheng X, Xu L, Lei D, Zhang C*.

      bone flap for mandibular reconstruction. PlastIc Reconstructive Surgery, 2017,

      The investigators intend to randomly divide the vascularized iliac bone graft cases into
      traditional group without innervation and simultaneous innervation group (through
      neurorrhaphy between the nerves innervating iliac bone flap and recipient site). The efficacy
      of simultaneously innervated maxillofacial reconstruction for preventing graft bone
      resorption will be assessed using bone mineral density test of grafted bone, as a blinded
      method. The innervation and sensation of the internal oblique abdominis muscle island will be
      tested using neuroelectrophysiological examination. The recipient nerve having the best
      effect on preventing bone resorption, will be determined using hierarchical comparison
      method.
