      Shahjadpur sub-district were divided into clusters so that each cluster contained a
      population of about 3,000. This generated 188 clusters. 104 out of 188 clusters-52 clusters
      for the intervention and 52 clusters for the control group - were randomly selected for the
      study to enroll the required 1300 pregnant women. Each cluster was then randomly allocated to
      either the intervention or control group using a computer generated random sequence. The
      random allocation sequence was generated independently by a statistician, who had no further
      involvement with the study. Once allocated, in each cluster all the eligible pregnant women
      were identified, invited, and enrolled during door-to-door visits by the project field staff.
      The field staff included female health workers, with the help of existing government
      community health workers such as family welfare assistants. A total of 628 eligible pregnant
      women were enrolled in the intervention clusters and a total of 639 eligible pregnant women
      in the control clusters. During the enrolment in the intervention clusters, a $100Kitchen
      with the improved cookstoves was installed at each of the 628 pregnant women's households
      following the verbal and written consent of the women and the household head.
