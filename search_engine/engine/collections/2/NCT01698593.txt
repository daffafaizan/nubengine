      epinephrine and approximately 10 hours with epinephrine - essentially doubling its
      duration.1,2 The analgesic effect of epinephrine on the duration of bupivacaine finger blocks
      remains unknown.

      Bupivacaine finger injection provides a much longer duration of action than lidocaine.
      Previous studies have shown the duration of action to be as long as 24.9 hours.1 In the
      senior author's experience, however, patients who get bupivacaine blocks start asking for
      pain medication as early as 7 hours after the block. Is it possible that the pain blocking
      effect of bupivacaine has a different duration than the touch and pressure effects? The
      answer to this question also remains unknown.

      The third unknown question about bupivacaine digital blocks is their effect on fingertip
      temperature. It has been shown that lidocaine wrist blocks increase temperature in finger
      tips, and this has been postulated to be potentially helpful in frostbite to provide pain
      relief and hyperemia.3 Previous studies have shown bupivacaine to exhibit vasodilatory
      properties at clinical concentrations of injection.4-7 Does bupivacaine provide increased
      warmth to the finger tip? How long does it last?

      The goals of this study are three fold: 1.) To determine what effect epinephrine has on the
      duration of bupivacaine finger block anesthesia. 2.) To assess the duration of action of
      bupivacaine with and without epinephrine on the digital sensory modalities of pain, touch and
      pressure, and 3.) To assess the finger tip temperature changes that result from bupivacaine
      digital blocks with and without epinephrine.
