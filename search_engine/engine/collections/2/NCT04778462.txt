      muscle. It is prevalent in regional musculoskeletal pain syndromes, either alone or in
      combination with other pain generators Myofascial pain syndrome is represented by many
      clinical symptoms such as pain, hyperirritable nodule of spot tenderness, referred pain, and
      muscle spasm by trigger points. The upper trapezius is probably the muscle most often beset
      by trigger points It was assumed that the muscle fibers are shortened and taut bands are made
      by calcium influx in damaged fibers or acetylcholine secretion in motor end plates. The
      trigger points are the hyperirritable nodules of spot tenderness in a palpable taut band of
      skeletal muscle that may cause pain to a distant point and also causes distant motor and
      autonomic effects Once myofascial trigger points are activated, changes in the structural
      characteristics and contraction function of the muscle will occur. The most distinctive
      changes are taut bands, tender nodules, referred pain, local twitch response, muscle
      weakness, and restricted range of motion Patients with unilateral pain of an upper trapezius
      muscle exposed to a fatiguing load analyzed with surface electromyography (sEMG) were found
      to have a difference in sEMG response between healthy and symptomatic muscle Surface
      electromyography (EMG) analyzes functional changes in muscle by measuring quantitative
      changes in motor unit action potential that is activated by muscle contraction

      Surface EMG, which was used to evaluate the functionality of trigger points in this study, is
      nonintrusive and convenient; thus, it is widely used in studies on the functional
      characteristics of muscle, by analyzing the electrical activity of muscle Surface EMG
      recording fortrigger points shows changes in recruitment of fast-twitch muscle fibers and
      conduction velocity of motor unit action potential According to Gemmell and Bagust (2009) EMG
      recordings confirm increased spontaneous activity of motor units in patients with myofascial
      pain during the "resting state" of muscles.

      The treatments of myofascial pain are divided into the invasive and the non-invasive therapy.
      The invasive therapy is about the injection of medications, dry needling and non-invasive
      therapy refers to massage, stretching and ultrasound Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)
      is recently considered an effective treatment for myofascial pain

      , It is a non-invasive and simple treatment, easy to apply at a large surface, and has fewer
      side effects with low intensity even if it requires relatively high cost.

      ESWT could reduce the pain of myofascial pain syndrome by pain signal alteration, promoting
      angiogenesis and increasing perfusion in ischemic tissues induced by sensitization of
      nociceptors and muscle ischemia .

      High power pain threshold ultrasound resolve acute active trigger points . High power-pain
      threshold ultrasound efficient method for relieving painand disability and increasing range
      of motion Although signiﬁcant in decreasing tissue stiffness Previous study, which is the
      ﬁrst to make a combined evaluation of the effectiveness of low-, moderate- and high dose
      (HPPT) US therapies in MPS, the results obtained considered signiﬁcantly in that greater
      improvements in clinical parameters were generally determined going from low dose to high
      dose and that the effect was achieved in only four sessions of HPPT US therapy. the cycle of
      pain-spasm-ischemia-pain is more effectively resolved when the dosage of US, applied for the
      treatment of trigger points in MPS, is increased the cycle of pain-spasm-ischemia-pain is
      more effectively resolved when the dosage of US, applied for the treatment of trigger points
      in MPS, is increased. Therefore, HPPT US therapy can be considered as a more economical
      treatment than conventional US treatments due to less number of treatment sessions.
