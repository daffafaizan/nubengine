      patients with mild to moderate UC.But for the UC with extending lesions, the conventional

      enteral Tubing(TET) is a novel, safe, convenient, and reliable procedure for Fecal Microbiota
      Transplantation(FMT).Compared with the conventional enema, which is only used for local
      administration, the Colonic TET enema can achieve total colonic administration.This study
      aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Colonic TET for UC.Patients in this study will be
      divided into 5 groups according to certain criteria: the Mesalazine conventional enema group,
      the Mesalazine TET enema group, the Compound Glutamine conventional enema group, the Compound
      Glutamine TET enema group, the Mesalazine and Compound Glutamine TET enema group.Each group
      was given enema for 7 days.The primary outcome measure was the clinical remission efficacy
      rate in each group. The secondary outcome measure was the safety of TET.
