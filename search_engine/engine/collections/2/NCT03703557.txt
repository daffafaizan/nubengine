    
      Patient recruitment during the first surgery consultation in Curie Institute. Odor sampling
      (non-invasive) with an odor-sensing polymer (SorbstarÂ® polymer developed especially for the
      trace level analysis), on:

        -  The hands, before and after surgical excision of the tumor (friction of the hands)

        -  The diseased breast, before and after surgical excision of the tumor (via a compress
           positioned on the breast for 1 night)

        -  The tumor, during the surgical procedure (odor collection over a tumor sample).

      Each patient will be her own witness, before and after surgical excision, in an attempt to
      isolate the chemical signature tracks of breast cancer. The samples after surgery will be
      made after healing and before implementation of a treatment (chemotherapy and / or
      radiotherapy).
