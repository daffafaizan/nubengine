    
      This is a prospective, non-therapeutic protocol designed to create and maintain a registry of
      participants with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and known/presumed mutation for ALD. This study
      also involves maintaining a prospective biorepository to collect and store buccal swab,
      blood, stool and urine samples as well. In this protocol, pediatric (including infants),
      adolescents and adult patients with confirmed or presumed ALD (based on positive VLCFA
      testing and/or confirmed mutation) will be offered potential study participation.
      Additionally, presumed mutation for ALD (based on pedigree or confirmed mutation) will be
      offered potential study participation. After appropriate consent (online or in-person),
      subjects will be requested to provide a medical history (with authorization of release of
      medical records), longitudinal biospecimens, and permission to perform laboratory analyses on
      these samples. The overall goal is to understand the natural disease course in affected and
      unaffected patients (identified patients and relatives with a diagnosis of ALD), as well as
      women with ALD to assemble a resource of clinical, medical, and biological data from the
      participants. This study also aims to understand the outcomes of this disease, as well as
      possibly develop biomarkers to identify prognostic markers for disease progression, which may
      help develop effective interventions. The biospecimen bank and registry will provide access
      to samples and data for the ongoing studies as well as will provide an important resource for
      the future research.
