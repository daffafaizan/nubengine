      underwent cesarean section with epidural anesthesia will receive 3 mg of epidural morphine
      intraoperatively, and have the epidural catheter left in place. Patients will be randomized
      to receive either epidural saline or epidural morphine 3 mg at 18 - 24 hours after the first
      dose of epidural morphine, following which the epidural catheter will be removed. It is
      standard of care at our institution for women undergoing cesarean section with epidural
      anesthesia to receive epidural morphine 3 mg. What is not typically carried out is to give a
      second dose of epidural morphine 3mg.

      The randomization will be carried out by a computerized block randomization table; the
      proportion for the 2 groups will be 1:1. The primary outcome will be the amount of
      intravenous morphine patients self-administer in the second 24 hours after surgery. Secondary
      outcomes will include pain scores every 6 hours, satisfaction with analgesia, side effects
      (itching, nausea/vomiting).
