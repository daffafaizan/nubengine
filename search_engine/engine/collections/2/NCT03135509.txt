    
      The study will consist of 2 study periods. Each subject will participate in a screening
      phase, a baseline phase in each study period, a treatment phase in each study period, and a
      follow up telephone call. Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will
      return to the study center on Day -1 of Period 1, and will remain domiciled at the study
      center from Day -1 of Period 1 to Day 4 of Period 2.

      On Day 1 of Period 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 sequences. On Day 1 of
      each study period, each subject will receive 1 of 2 treatments according to the sequence in
      which he or she is randomized.

      Blood samples will be collected at prespecified times for PK, PD, and clinical laboratory
      safety tests. Urine samples will be collected at prespecified times for clinical laboratory
      safety tests.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Safety evaluations will include AE reporting,
      review of concomitant medications and procedures, physical examinations (PEs), 12-lead ECGs,
      vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory safety tests. Subjects will be discharged
      from the study center on Day 4 of Period 2 upon completion of scheduled study-related
      procedures and satisfactory safety review. Each subject will receive a follow-up telephone
      call within 5 to 7 days following discharge from the study center.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.
