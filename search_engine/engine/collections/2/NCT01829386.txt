      delayed brain injury following a hemorrhagic stroke is poorly understood. One of the
      mechanisms demonstrated in

      animal studies points towards deposition of iron in the brain tissue following hemorrhage.
      Preliminary data in animal studies also support a favorable effect of iron chelate agents.
      Iron chelate agents are compounds that bind iron to them and may show the extent of neural
      tissue damage.

      Initial results of human trials based on this hypothesis demonstrated the safety of
      increasing amounts of desferroxamine given to human patients. The evaluation of iron chelate
      agents for hemorrhagic stroke is entering into phase II/III trials.

      There is no modality at this date that can quantify the iron in tissue non invasively. Some
      preliminary studies have demonstrated the role of MRI in identifying parenchymal iron
      deposition in traumatic brain injury.

      We propose to validate an MRI based method to not only identify but also quantify the non
      heme iron levels deposited in brain tissue following hemorrhagic stroke. Once validated this
      method will be a robust mechanism to reliably quantify tissue iron in the brain which then
      can be closely followed through iron chelate therapy in a trial setting.
