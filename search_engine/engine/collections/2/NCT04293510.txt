      clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity . Disease activity will be assessed
      through the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Also, investigators
      will evaluate the relationship between Janus_ kinase 3 expression and histopathological
      classes of lupus nephritis according to the 2003 International Society of Nephrology/ Renal
      Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification of lupus nephritis. This will be done through
      Janus_kinase 3 assessment in the blood and renal tissue of lupus patients.
