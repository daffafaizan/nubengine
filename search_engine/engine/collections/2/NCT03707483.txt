      fibrin scaffold aims to enhance the biologic potential of the endogenous mesenchymal stem
      cells that exist within the periodontal ligaments and stimulate periodontal tissue
      regeneration(Yan et al., 2013). As the concept of periodontal tissue-engineering has emerged,
      many inductive biomolecules were investigated for periodontal regeneration(Bartold et al.,
      2000).

      Vitamin C has shown promising results in periodontal regeneration, in a study vitamin C was
      suggested to enhance osteoblastic differentiation of periodontal ligament cells through
      modulating type I collagen-α1β2 integrin interaction leading to increased ALP activity in
      periodontal ligament cells(Ishikawa et al., 2004). Vitamin C treatment induces expression of
      cementogenic genes and considered to be a more feasible and safer treatment for clinical
      cell-based periodontal regeneration(Gauthier et al., 2017).

      There is also a study concluding that vitamin C induces the osteogenic differentiation of PDL
      progenitor cells via PELP1-ERK axis; and this implies that vitamin C may have a potential in
      the periodontal regeneration(Yan et al., 2013).

      Periodontal tissue regeneration aims to increase periodontal in intra-osseous defects thus
      improving clinical attachment level; reducing probing depth and upgrading the prognosis of
      teeth(Ramseier et al., 2012).

      Resolution of intra-osseous defects through regeneration preserves and improves function and
      provides patient comfort(Wang et al., 2005). It also facilitates supportive periodontal
      therapy; performed regularly to maintain periodontal health(Ramseier et al., 2012).
