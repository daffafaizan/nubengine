      cancer patients undergoing curative therapy maximizes their effectiveness in the treatment of
      trismus. That being said, treatment for trismus typically begins after head and neck cancer
      patients are found to have moderate to severe reduction in jaw range of motion. Typically,
      clinicians will begin therapy when the IID is 3.0 cm or less. A subset of head and neck
      cancer patients will develop severe or rapidly progressive trismus that will fail to respond
      to treatment. In this cohort, trismus may lead to permanent, severe morbidity. It may be
      hypothesized that preventative strategies that encourage routine stretching during and
      immediately after the completion of cancer therapy may prevent or minimize trismus. No
      studies have examined the prophylactic use of the Jaw DynasplintÂ® System during cancer
      treatment.

      Furthermore, it is not known whether patients can tolerate wearing a mechanical stretching
      device during treatment. The investigators would like to test the hypothesis that: 1)
      preventive use of a mechanical stretching device during cancer treatment and early recovery
      is feasible, and 2) preventive use of a mechanical stretching device will result in a marked
      decrease in the incidence and severity of trismus in patients undergoing primary or adjuvant
      radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.
