    
      A prospective, multicenter, open-label Phase I safety study of Anginera. Adults with Left
      Ventricular Dysfunction and reversible myocardial ischemia who are undergoing a CABG
      procedure, who have at least one graftable vessel and at least one coronary vessel not
      amenable to bypass or PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention)will be recruited. Three pieces
      of Anginera will be placed on the area of the surface of the ventricle, including the area
      supplied by the vessel or vessels that cannot be bypassed, as well as surrounding myocardium.
      Patients will be followed for 12 months after the surgery at which Anginera is implanted.

      The primary objective is to determine safety. The secondary objectives are to determine
      regional myocardial perfusion and regional left ventricular performance and to investigate
      the utility of measures of patient perception of improvement.
