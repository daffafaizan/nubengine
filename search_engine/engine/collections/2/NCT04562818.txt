      January 2007 and January 2017, patients of both sexes and different ages, who were candidates
      for receiving intensive chemotherapy along with tretinoin were included in the study. The
      diagnosis for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia was determined based on the following criteria:
      abnormal promyelocytes in the bone marrow and verification of the t(15;17) translocation by
      karyotype or using RT-PCR to determine the genetic lesion and define the type of PML/RARA
      isoform.

      In Mexico the investigators still treating patients with anthracycline and cytarabine +
      transretinoic acid. These information will help the authorities to realize the importance of
      having arsenic trioxide as part of the treatment of these disease, knowing the amount of
      patient that the investigators have in Mexico, knowing that in the hispanic race the
      incidence is greater.
