      examination, gingival sulcus microbiota sampling and saliva sample at baseline before
      starting chemotherapy.

      Patients will be separated into 2 cohorts, with periodontitis (Arm A) and without
      periodontitis (Arm B). All patients will receive standard oncologic supportive care including
      antibiotic prophylaxis. Serum samples will be obtained at baseline, at the onset of
      neutropenic fever, and weekly until day 28 or discharge (whichever sooner).

      Study participation will continue during the duration of standard of care chemotherapy for 28
      days or until discharge from hospital, whichever later.
