      hyponatremia. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of V2 receptors in the renal
      principal cell increases renal free water clearance and renal sodium excretion.

      Treatment with V2-receptor antagonists increases vasopressin concentration in plasma that
      stimulates V1-receptors in the vascular bed. This may change both central and peripheral
      hemodynamics and plasma concentration of vasoactive hormones. Changes in hemodynamics and
      hormone concentration may consequently change renal sodium and water handling.

      The nitric oxide system plays a central role in both renal sodium and water handling and
      regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure.

      The effects of tolvaptan the circulation and kidneys is investigated by using measurements of
      biomarkers specific for the sodium/water balance in the urine and by measurements of
      vasoactive hormones in the blood after administration of tolvaptan and L-NMMA infusion.
