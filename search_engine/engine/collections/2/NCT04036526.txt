      vaccine/placebo by drop method. Group 2 will receive vaccine/placebo with nasal actuator.
      After 60 days both groups will repeatedly receive the same dose of vaccine/placebo by the
      same methods of application. In each group there are 5 volunteers given placebo.

      Monitoring examination of volunteers is carrying out during 60 days after first and second
      vaccination.

      Each group (25 persons) shall be divided into three cohorts (5, 7 and 13 persons). The arm
      that will receive the drug/ placebo by the dripping method comprises cohorts 1, 3, and 5, and
      the arm that will receive the drug using the applicator comprises cohorts 2, 4, and 6.
      Initially, the first and second cohorts (of 5 volunteers each) will be included into the
      study, respectively.

      The main purpose of this study is selection of methods of applications and dosing schedules
      of GamLPV, a live intranasal Bordetella pertussis vaccine.
