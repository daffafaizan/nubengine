    
      This is a multicenter, open label, prospective, cohort study. Patients undergoing ablation
      with PVAC technology in up to 15 centers across Canada will be enrolled, ablated, and
      followed for one year post-ablation. Both primary and secondary objectives of the study will
      be determined from this cohort of patients. Comparisons to the traditional ablation methods
      will be made by collecting data from a prospective group of control subjects who are
      undergoing AF ablation with traditional ablation technology at the same centers by the same
      operators. Control patients will be enrolled in a 1:2 ratio compared to the PVAC cohort.
      While the final ratio of control to PVAC patients must be 1:2 by study end for each operator,
      the ratio may vary while the study is conducted to allow some flexibility in patient
      recruitment. However, the absolute difference between [# of PVAC patients] and 2x[# control
      patients] should not exceed 5 at any given time for any operator in any study center
