      periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). Based on investigators' review of the literature and
      experience, patients who may benefit from intraarticular assessment are those with
      radiographic or MRI evidence of damage where an intraarticular inspection may help in
      determining whether a PAO is a reasonable procedure, those with mechanical symptoms likely
      related to labral pathology, round ligament or cartilage problems and those with hip
      dysplasia and cam deformities with limited range of motion that may benefit from femoral head
      neck junction osteochondroplasty. However, despite these relative indications today there is
      no clear evidence to suggest that these patients will do better than those that do not have
      intraarticular work done. Hence, the objective of this project is to determine whether
      intraarticular work at the time of PAO surgery leads to improved pain and function when
      compared to patients that do not undergo intraarticular work at the time of PAO.
