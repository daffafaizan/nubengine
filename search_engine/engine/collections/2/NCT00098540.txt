      I. Determine the response rate in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer
      treated with sorafenib.

      II. Determine the clinical toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the 24-week progression-free survival rate in patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the
      time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate predictive disease markers (K-ras and B-raf mutations and ERK/pERK, AKT/pAKT,
      and VEGFR2/p-VEGFR2 expression) in these patients with the activity of this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.
