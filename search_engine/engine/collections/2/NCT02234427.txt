      platelet function. Equal number of individuals will be selected from each race and gender and
      from low or high platelet aggregation. We will have baseline platelet functions performed and
      baseline platelet gene expression examined. Participants will be given 2-week supply of
      aspirin(81 mg/daily) and will be examined at the end of 2-weeks with platelet aggregation
      studies and a repeat platelet gene-expression (using RNA-seq). The ultimate goal is to
      examine platelet gene expression differences due to aspirin and across different gender,
      race, platelet-aggregation groups.
