    
      A randomized controlled design will be used to study the effects of a regular yoga practice
      on body image in young adult women. Fifty female freshman, sophomores, and juniors between
      the ages of 18 and 26 years will be recruited from the University of Delaware student
      population, specifically targeting those new to yoga. Age, academic standing, availability
      and prior yoga experience will be evaluated.

      Consented individuals will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) yoga (offered 3 times
      per week) for 10 weeks; or (2) a control group. Baseline assessments, midpoint assessments,
      and end-of-study assessments will be conducted on all participants. Participants will be
      compensated for their attendance at assessment visits.
