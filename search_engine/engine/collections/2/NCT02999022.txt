      both) 10% of fractures do not heal or take longer than normal to heal. This can have a
      significant effect on a patient's function and productivity, as well as on healthcare
      expenditures. Very few advances in fracture healing have been made, despite the need for new
      approaches to fracture treatment. This study proposes a simple, economical, and non-invasive
      approach to complement traditional fracture treatment that could decrease healing time and
      reduce the incidence of delayed healing. The investigators think that this can improve health
      outcomes for patients and reduce health care costs for the healthcare system in general. The
      goal is to see if a low-dose of Lithium treatment can have a positive effect on fracture
      healing and can reduce pain and improve function in patients who have broken a bone.

      The LiFT study is a participant, surgeon and observer blinded single-centre randomized (1:1),
      controlled, superiority trial with 2 parallel groups. A minimization procedure will stratify
      participants based on the fractured long bone (clavicle, humerus, femur or tibia/fibula) and
      smoking.

      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: lithium capsules or placebo. The
      Lithium/placebo will be taken daily for 2 weeks, starting 2 weeks after the fracture occurs
      (or 2 weeks after surgery if the participant is treated with surgery).
