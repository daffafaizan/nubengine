    
      This is a phase I, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study of sublingual
      immunotherapy (SLIT) in pediatric and adult subjects with both house dust mite (HDM) and
      timothy grass (TG) allergies. We will evaluate whether Dermatophagoides farinae (DF) and/or
      TG allergen SLIT is safe in children and adults. We will also determine whether treatment
      with DF and/or TG SLIT reduces the severity of allergic symptoms (allergic rhinitis, allergic
      conjunctivitis) and enhances their resolution. The study will also evaluate whether SLIT
      provides a robust durability of response once it is terminated. The dosing-phase of the study
      will last up to 12 months. In addition, a follow up period of 2 years will occur.
      Approximately 10 subjects will be on placebo, and 20 on active treatment.
