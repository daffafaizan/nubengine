      questionnaire as part of the general health screening done at each visit. Due to the atypical
      and subclinical presentation of TB in HIV infected patients, culture will be performed on all
      HIV-infected pregnant women, with or without symptoms, and on all symptomatic HIVnegative
      women. Referrals for TB treatment in accordance with current national guidelines will be
      offered.
