      most often caused by uterine atony. To prevent this complication, uterotonic medication is
      used during elective cesarean section.

      Carbetocin, a long-acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin, has been used for this purpose for
      many years. This medication has numerous side effects: hypotension, tachycardia, nausea,
      vomiting, chest pain, etc. Using a smaller dose of carbetocin might lower the incidence of
      these side effects, without compromising prevention of uterine atony in a low-risk group of
      patient.
