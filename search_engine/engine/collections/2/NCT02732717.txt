    
      The study is designed as an observational prospective cohort study. The primary outcome is
      complicated twin pregnancy (sIUGR, TTTS, IUFD, twin growth discordance). The main exposed
      factors are discordance of crown-rump length more than 20%, discordance of nuchal
      translucency more than 20%, either of twin with abnormal amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios or
      oligoamnios), either of twin with abnormal umbilical artery flow (elevated resistance index,
      absent or reverse diastolic flow), either of twin with abnormal middle cerebral artery flow
      (more than 1.5Mom), either of twin with abnormal ductus venous flow (absent or reverse
      a-wave). Meanwhile, some demographic data are to be collected and confounding factors are to
      be analyzed.

      Women with twin pregnancy who are examined in the department are enrolled in this study.
      Ultrasound will be done in 11-13+6 weeks, 16-18 weeks, 22-24 weeks, 30-32 weeks and 37-39
      weeks, and perinatal outcomes are to be collected, including the diagnosis of complicated
      twin pregnancy, when it happens, ultrasound indices, delivery mode, delivery time, birth
      weight, neonatal outcomes.

      When there are indications for the detection of fetal chromosome, women are probably advised
      to have this examination, such as non-invasive DNA, amniocentesis, umbilical cord screening,
      as appropriate, and written informed consent will be achieved from every patient.
