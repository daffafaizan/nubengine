4. mixed hematopoietic and pulmonary origin of 'alveolar macrophages' asdemonstrated by chromosome markersthe origin of alveolar macrophages was investiga-ted in mouse chimeras in which the hematopoietic cellscould be identified by marker chromosomes.  by chro-mosome analysis it was found that in both normal lungsand in lungs exposed to an irritant, approximately two-thirds of the dividing cells which could be recovered bylung washing arose from the hematopoietic system andone-third were of pulmonary origin.
