    
      Perfusion index (PI) is a non-invasive numerical value of peripheral perfusion obtained from
      pulse oximetry, it is an indicator of the pulse strength at the sensor site. The PI's values
      range from 0.2% for very weak pulse to 20% for extremely strong pulse according to patient's
      physiological conditions and monitoring sites.

      Large increases in lactate (i.e. > 5 mmol/L) usually only occur due to hypoperfusion or
      muscle activity such as exercise or seizures.

      This study will investigate the role of nitroglycerine patch in improving the peripheral
      perfusion in poly traumatized patient with hemorrhagic shock for the first time.
