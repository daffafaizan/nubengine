    
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different
      sequences and schedules to healthy adult participants. The study consists of a screening
      period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which participants will be vaccinated at
      Baseline [Day 1] followed by a boost on Day 29 or 57 and a post-boost follow-up, until all
      participants have had their 21-day post-boost visit (Day 50 or Day 78). The participants who
      received active vaccine will enter a long-term follow-up. The total duration of the study
      will be about 1 year for participants who received vaccine and about 3 months for
      participants who received placebo. Immunogenicity and safety will be monitored during the
      study.
