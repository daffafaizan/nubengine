      chronic pelvic pain. When consented, the subjects fill out a questionnaire on demographic
      information and pain experience. The trial is conducted at home over three days. Each subject
      uses three different levels of nicotine (0mg, 5mg, and 10mg) administered in a random order;
      the study is double-blinded and patients act as their own controls. Subjects apply the
      placebo or nicotine patches in the morning and remove them in the evening when they fill out
      a pain diary for the day. During the study, patients will continue their typical course of
      pain medication and report pain medication use in the pain diary.
