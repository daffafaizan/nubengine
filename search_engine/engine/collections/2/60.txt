comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and twobiopsy sites .bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis ofhematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting theblood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which asuitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively littlediscomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paperhave been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow formicroscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrowaspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26patients show no significant difference . however, there were fourinstances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to theobservation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when thesternum was used, might indicate that the sternal area is a morereliable and efficient site for obtaining bone marrow .it was also observed during this study that patients experienced lessdiscomfort when the university of illinois needle was used . the majorobjection to the use of this needle is the inability to obtain a bonecore for biopsy .
