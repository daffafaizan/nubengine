      investigational products (most closely HLA-matched third party donor-derived T cells
      stimulated with viral or fungal antigen expressing DC), for the treatment of viral
      reactivation and/or infection or fungal infection following allogeneic blood or marrow or
      solid organ transplantation. The cells will be given therapeutically after transplantation in
      patients with active viral reactivation or proven/probably fungal infection despite standard
      therapy.

      Our AIMS are to study the safety of third party donor-derived CTL infusions, their effect on
      treatment of viral reactivation as well as their effect on reconstitution of virus- and
      fungus-specific immunity, viral and fungal infection and reactivation rates after
      transplantation, viral load, and use of antiviral and antifungal pharmacotherapy.

      We will evaluate the safety of infusions with respect to the development of adverse events
      within the first 12 months post-CTL infusion and the dynamics of cell persistence by T-cell
      chimerism analysis.
