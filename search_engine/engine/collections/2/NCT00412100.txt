    
      Patients with a documented history of moderate to severe non-malignant pain that require
      around-the-clock opioid therapy will be randomised to an oxycodone or an oxycodone-naloxone
      treatment arm. The primary objective is to demonstrate that patients taking
      oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release tablets have improvement in symptoms of constipation
      compared to subjects taking oxycodone prolonged release tablets alone.
