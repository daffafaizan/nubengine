mitral atresia associated with pulmonary venous anomalies .pulmonary venous anomalies were observed in 5 among 29 specimens withmitral atresia . in 4 of these 5 the anomalous pulmonary veins took theform of anomalous pulmonary venous connexion . in the remaining case thepulmonary venous anomaly was represented by cor triatriatum . in 3(group i), mitral atresia and premature closure of the foramen ovalecoexisted . the anomalous pulmonary venous connexions in this groupprovided collateral routes for the flow of pulmonary venous blood, andcan be understood as developing en response to obstruction at theforamen ovale when the mitral valve is atretic . in the remaining 2(group ii) no such causative factor could be invoked . in one of thelatter group total anomalous pulmonary venous connexion coexisted with acommon atrium . in the other, cor triatriatum coexisted with a patentforamen ovale .pulmonary venous obstruction occurred in each of the 5 cases .
