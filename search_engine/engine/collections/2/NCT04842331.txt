    
      In this study, we are investigating RESP301 as a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

      RESP301 is a liquid which is inhaled using a handheld nebuliser and produces Nitric Oxide,
      which is also naturally produced in the human body and is a key part of our defence against
      infections in the lungs. In a laboratory setting,RESP301 has been shown to be highly
      effective against many respiratory viruses, including CoV2 and influenza.

      RESP301 is currently being used as treatment for hospitalised COVID-19 patients in an ongoing
      clinical trial.

      The aim of this PEP study is to prevent onward transmission of the infection within
      households by treating both the infected individual and their household members. The primary
      endpoint is to evaluate the incidence of newly confirmed CoV2 infection (PCR positive) in
      previously uninfected household members (PCR negative, antibody negative and unvaccinated) of
      CoV-2 positive index cases after a 7 day course of treatment.

      Participants who are not eligible to participate, or do not want to participate will be
      invited to participate in an optional study where they will be asked to complete a short
      questionnaire.

      Participants will be on the study for a total duration of 15-17 days. Approximately 600
      adults will be on the study in total and index cases will be randomised 1:1 to either RESP301
      (plus SOC) or SOC alone, with all eligible persons in the same household enrolled into the
      same treatment arm.

      The study will be divided into the following periods: Baseline Visit / screening (1 day):
      Treatment Period (self administered at home - 7 days): End of Treatment Period (1 day):
      Follow-Up Period (~5-7 days): Follow-Up Call (1 day between day 15-17)
