      administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-CORT125134, to determine the routes and rate of
      elimination of [14C]-CORT125134 and associated radioactivity from the body, and to measure
      concentrations of radioactivity in the blood. Additional objectives of the study were to
      determine the chemical structure of each significant metabolite in plasma, urine and feces.
      Safety and tolerability were assessed.
