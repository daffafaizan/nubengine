      include ways to overcome obstacles to bystander intervention. This could lead to better help
      and higher helping rates in medical emergencies.

      The objective of this paper is to measure the effect of an innovative training programme on
      the help seeking behaviour and helping rates of bystanders in medical emergencies. We chose
      to test the helping behaviour for acute myocardial infarction because it is an important
      cause of mortality and invalidity. While the victim is urgently in need of help, delay in
      seeking professional help is an important problem.
