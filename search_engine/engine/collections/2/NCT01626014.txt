    
      In this study, we will pilot-test a technology-based approach for women with Stage III/IV or
      recurrent ovarian cancer, their caregiver, and their providers to assist in and study the
      decision-making process that surrounds end-of-life decisions, specifically, opting for
      palliative care and/or entry into hospice care. We will randomize the women and their
      caregivers into either our intervention or control websites. All subjects will complete a
      battery of demographic, psychosocial, health status and outcomes, health information, and
      decision making measures at baseline and 60-day post-baseline.

      Once the participant has completed the baseline survey, he/she will be automatically brought
      to their assigned website. Both the patient and their caregiver will be assigned the same
      group (intervention or control). All participants will have open access to their respective
      study websites for a minimum of 60 days. During enrollment, participants will agree to access
      their respective websites at least 2-3 times per week. Both patients and caregivers assigned
      to the control arm will view a website containing documents generally provided as part of the
      usual care. They will be requested to log in with the same frequency as the intervention
      group.
