      represents medication toxicity or the natural course of the illness. The study will help
      clarify this issue in observing 70 schizophrenic patients before and after they are
      prescribed an antipsychotic via standard of care.

      In addition, schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and a putative brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) deficit, while possibly a common pathway, may not fully capture
      the biological diversity-the supplemental biomarkers will allow us to perform a more
      comprehensive assessment of factors contributing to clinical course. Taken together analysis
      of these biomarkers in relation to clinical course and in relation to healthy subjects will
      inform us about biological mechanisms contributing to illness onset, effects of antipsychotic
      medication on these mechanisms, and the predictive value of the biomarkers for clinical
      course. This information will provide the foundation for future early intervention trials
      targeting biological mechanisms utilizing a personalized medicine approach.

      The baseline visit for 70 schizophrenic patients and 70 healthy age and gender matched
      controls consists of structural and functional MRI in addition to a blood draw for biomarkers
      including BDNF, inflammation markers, DNA, oxidative stress, and folate status and
      additionally a salivary cortisol sample collection. Biomarkers and imaging will be repeated
      after 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in patients.
