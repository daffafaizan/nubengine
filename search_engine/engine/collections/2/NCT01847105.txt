      contact lens dryness are: more frequent replacement schedule (24%), refit into different
      material (23%), rewetting drops (21%) and change care system (15%). Changing care systems has
      been a standard treatment for CL discomfort for many years. In the same survey, 30% of
      practitioners felt there is absolutely no difference among solutions with respect to reducing
      dryness and discomfort.

      The investigators set out to compare the clinical performance of these two solutions: AMO's
      RevitaLens and Alcon's Opti-Free PureMoist.
