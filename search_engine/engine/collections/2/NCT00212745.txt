      circumstances and behaviors trigger their seizures. The most common seizure precipitants are
      irregularities of sleep, sensory triggers such as flashing lights and emotional stress.
      Patients will learn how to avoid seizure precipitants and how to stop seizures in their first
      beginnings. Study participants will continue their prior medications.
