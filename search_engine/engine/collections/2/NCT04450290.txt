      the device which will be evaluated through the analysis of adverse events during the
      follow-up period. For the study to be considered a success, the results of the adverse event
      analysis shall never cause an unbalanced risk vs. benefit assessment.

      The secondary objectives of this study aim at investigating the usefulness of possible
      outcome measures in evaluating the performance of the device.
