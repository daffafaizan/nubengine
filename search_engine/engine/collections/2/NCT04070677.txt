      disaccharide units. It is found mainly in the extracellular matrix of the loose connective
      tissue and is associated with several key processes, including cell signaling and repair, as
      well as with tissue generation, morphogenesis, and structural organization of the
      extracellular matrix itself. In clinical terms, its role is well known in conditions such as
      mouth ulcers, where its barrier effect relieves symptoms. Chondroitin sulfate forms part of
      the glycosaminoglycan group in the extracellular matrix, which is in turn formed by
      D-glucuronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine. It has been shown to protect the epithelium of
      the esophageal mucosa by shielding the epithelial areas damaged by acid, thus diminishing
      catabolic activity and inhibiting proteolytic enzymes (e.g., metalloproteases, collagenase,
      or elastase). Chondroitin sulfate also regulates several inflammatory mediators (TNF-α,
      IL-1β, COX-2, PGE2, and NFκB) and reduces the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is involved in
      the inflammatory cascade. Polaxamer 407 is a bioadhesive component that acquires the active
      ingredients of ZIVEREL® adhere to the damaged mucosa and are not dragged away by the
      ingestion of food and liquids.
