    
      Criteria for inclusion into the study will be: 1) DSM-IV diagnosis of Dementia of the
      Alzheimer type with psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions,
      aggression/agitation, irritability, and disinhibition that called for the administration of
      antipsychotic drugs; 2) duration of psychotic symptoms at least 2 weeks before beginning of
      treatment; 3) lack of improvement of psychotic symptoms (less than 25% on Positive and
      Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) during perphenazine treatment (8 mg/day) for at least three
      weeks; 4) drug regimen for physical disease of all patients was unchanged for at least three
      months before the study.

      Exclusion criteria include: 1) a vascular dementia; 2) concurrent Axis I DSM-IV diagnoses
      (delirium, schizophrenia, delusional disorders, and affective disorders) 3) significant
      medical illness (cardiovascular, liver, renal, endocrinal, vitamin B12 or folic acid
      deficiency, and neurological illnesses); 4) drug or/and alcohol addiction.

      The study design will be a double blind group study, lasting for 9 weeks. Complete physical
      and laboratory examinations will be performed on all inpatients. Subjects will be randomized
      in a 1:1 fashion to receive treatment with 4 mg of perphenazine or 5 mg of donepezil or
      placebo in addition to the perphenazine treatment (8 mg/day) that they have received for the
      past 3 weeks (baseline). According to mental state (improvement less than 20% on PANSS
      scores), perphenazine dose will be elevated by 4 mg/day to maximum 16 mg/day in the first
      group, and donepezil dose will be increased by 5 mg/day to maximum 10 mg/day in the second
      group) and placebo will be elevated up to 2 capsules/day in the third group. All preparations
      will be administered in identical capsules made by a professional pharmacist, and supplied in
      individual number-coded packages.

      Assessments for psychotic symptoms will be done using PANSS and CGI at baseline and repeated
      weekly. Assessments for extrapyramidal side effects will be done using AIMS at baseline and
      repeated every week. In addition, both at the beginning and at the end of the study, all
      patients will be assessed with MMSE and GDS. Complete blood profiles, and urine analysis will
      be performed at screening and at week 9.
