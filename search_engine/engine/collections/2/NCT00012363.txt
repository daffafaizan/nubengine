        -  Determine the 6-month survival rate of patients with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma
           of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
