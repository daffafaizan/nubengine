    
      Severe Mood Dysregulation(SMD) is a new construct in children and adolescents characterized
      by persistent and non episodic irritability, hyperarousal and emotional reactivity.

      This is an open label trial using Risperidone in children and adolescents( 7-17 years old)
      diagnosed with SMD.

      We hypothesized that Risperidone would improve externalizing symptoms as well as depressive
      and/or maniac symptomatology. We also consider the effect of the pharmacological intervention
      in the co-morbid disorders especially ADHD.
