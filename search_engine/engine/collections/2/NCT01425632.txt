    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm parallel-group comparative
      study to confirm the superiority of TAU-284 over placebo after two weeks of administration of
      TAU-284 (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day) or placebo to pediatric patients with perennial allergic
      rhinitis, with "the change from baseline in total nasal symptom score (total score for the
      three major nasal symptoms [sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion])" as the primary
      endpoint; and to investigate the dose response, safety, and plasma concentrations of TAU-284.
