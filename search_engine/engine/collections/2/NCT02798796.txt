      treatment of breast cancer.An accurate assessment of the tumor is essential to select the
      best therapeutic strategy in the treatment of breast cancer.Currently, mammography,
      ultrasound and clinical examination are the standard techniques to assess the extent and
      location of the tumor.However, these imaging methods fail to assess the real size in
      approximately one third of patients eligible to conservative treatment.MRI has high
      sensitivity (95-100%) in the detection of invasive cancers as well as being able to detect
      hidden tumors, multifocality, multicentricity and cancer in the contralateral breast more
      often and greater accuracy than mammography or ultrasound.
