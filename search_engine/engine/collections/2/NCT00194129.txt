      Diagnosis Bipolar Rapid Cycling: This study recruits males and females age 18 and older who
      currently meet diagnostic criteria for rapid cycling bipolar disorder (type I or II) and who
      have met the criteria for substance abuse or dependence of cocaine, marijuana and/or alcohol
      within the past six months. Patients are initially stabilized on dual therapy of lithium and
      depakote and then randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either lithium monotherapy
      or continued dual therapy. Patients remain in the study for six months or until they
      experience a relapse. Patients in this study are required to bring a friend or family member
      to all study visits as well as attend chemical dependency services. This study is sponsored
      by the NIMH. Subjects receive study-related care at no cost.
