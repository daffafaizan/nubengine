      randomized controlled trial. We need 80 patients altogether. The Inclusion Criteria:

      organs failure, cancer The whole course of the acupuncture contains 24times(about 3 months).
      The acupoints are fixed and located over head and limbs.

      The whole course of the sham acupuncture contains 24times(about 3 months). The acupoints are
      fixed and 1cm away from meridian and no acupoints over head were chosen.

      The investigators use Barthel index, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale, Instrumental activities of daily living scale and Visual Analogue
      Scale to assess the effect of acupuncture on stroke patients. Four times of assessment are as
      below: baseline, after 8th treatment, after 16th treatment, after 24th treatment (the last
      time of treatment). The course of treatment should be completed within 3 months.
