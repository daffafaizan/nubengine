      reconstruction surgery. Therefore, reducing thigh muscle weakness after ACL injury and
      reconstructive surgery is important as the quadriceps muscles act as shock absorbers that
      protect the knee joint. If significant weakness is present in the quadriceps, the knee is
      exposed to increased forces and often results in degeneration of the structures in the joint
      leading to osteoarthritis. Thus, it is important to investigate activation and strength
      rehabilitation methods for the quadriceps muscles. This research study is being done to learn
      if thigh muscle weakness and the lack of muscle activation that accompanies ACL injury can be
      improved by conditioning brain responses (elicited by non-invasive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation) using a form of training called as operant conditioning.
