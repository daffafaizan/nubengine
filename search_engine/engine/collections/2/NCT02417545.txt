      important to identify the challenging environmental that provoke functional deficits; e.g.
      stair or ramp negotiation. The three steps at the ground and at the top of stairs is the most
      common location for missteps and stair accidents. This is supported by the observation made
      in a 12-month prospective study were 32% of the falls happened during the last step going
      down stairs in vestibular patients.

      It remains open if patient's vestibular dysfunctions have a different gaze or gait behavior
      than healthy individuals.
