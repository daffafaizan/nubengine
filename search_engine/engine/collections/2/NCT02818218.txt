      internal jugular vein or through a right atrial port of a pulmonary artery catheter is
      commonly used during liver transplant surgery. CVP measurements at the SVC-RA junction are a
      function of circulating blood volume, right ventricle function, intrathoracic pressure. CVP
      measurements can also be affected by the presence of tricuspid regurgitation. Because central
      venous pressure measurements are determined by several factors and do not predict the
      response to subsequent fluid bolus administration, they are considered "static measures" and
      are poor indicators of fluid responsiveness.

      Given the entirely intrathoracic location of the superior vena cava (SVC), its diameter and
      collapsibility with positive pressure ventilation it is a potentially attractive method of
      non-invasively estimating CVP.

      SVC diameter and collapsibility index, dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness have been
      successfully utilized as echocardiographic indices for fluid responsiveness in ventilated
      septic patients. Whether SVC collapsibility is correlated with CVP measurements in liver
      transplant patients is not known.

      Consecutive patients undergoing liver transplant surgery will be included in the study.
      Before surgical incision, during the preanhepatic phase, during the anhepatic phase, during
      the postanhepatic phase and following closure of the deep fascial layer of the anterior
      abdominal wall simultaneous measurement of SVC diameter, SBC collapsibility index and CVP
      will be recorded.
