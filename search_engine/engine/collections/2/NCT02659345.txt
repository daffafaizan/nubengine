        -  To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's anxiety

        -  To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's pain

      Secondary Objectives

           caregiver support, cancer diagnosis, reason for visit, and marital status

        -  To explore differences in response to art therapy by primary concern expressed by
