    
      This is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, open label trial, evaluating efficacy and safety
      of pazopanib versus a chemotherapy protocol combining methotrexate and vinblastine in
      progressive and symptomatic desmoid tumors.

      This study will include 72 patients in 15 centers of the French Sarcoma Group.

      Patients will be treated according to therapeutic strategy allocated by randomization until
      documented RECIST progression and for a maximum of 12 months :

        -  Arm A = experimental strategy: daily oral administration of pazopanib.

        -  Arm B = reference strategy: methotrexate-vinblastine.

      In case of documented radiological progression (RECIST criteria):

        -  Patients initially included in arm A will have the opportunity, as determined by the
           investigator, to receive arm B treatment, or leave the study,

        -  Patients initially included in arm B will have the opportunity, as determined by the
           investigator, to receive arm A treatment, or leave the study.
