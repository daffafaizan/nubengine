    
      This is a three arm feasibility study in which participants will be allocated to an exercise
      group, an increased lifestyle physical activity group, or a control group. We will determine
      the appropriateness of procedures for recruitment, allocation, measurement and retention for
      the intervention procedures in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

      The investigators will also determine if we are able to detect changes in blood lipid
      profile, inflammation, and hormonal and metabolic profile as a result of the intervention(s)
      using blood biomarkers.
