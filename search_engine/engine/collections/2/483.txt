1451. the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridylic acid inbacteriophage-infected bacillus subtiliswhen phage  e, which contains5-hydroxymethyluracil in its dna in place of thymine,infects b. subtilis, enzyme changesoccur in the host organism which can accountfor the synthesis of the abnormal base.deoxycytidylate deaminase increases atleast 90-fold and the product of its action,deoxyuridylic acid, is converted directlyinto the deoxynucleotide of 5-hydroxymethyluracilby a hydroxymethylase enzyme.the activity of thymidylate synthetase, which alsouses deoxyuridylic acid assubstrate, decreases rapidly after phage infection.
