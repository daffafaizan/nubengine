    
      Background:

        -  We have engineered human peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBLs) to express a T-cell receptor
           (TCR) that recognizes human leukocyte antigens (HLAA*0201) restricted epitopes derived
           from the gp100 or the MART-1 melanoma antigen.

        -  We constructed single retroviral vectors that contain both Alpha and Beta T cell
           receptor (TCR) chains and can mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency
           (greater than 30 percent) without the need to perform any selection.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A*0201 positive melanomas these TCR transduced T cells secreted
           significant amount of interferon-gamma (IFN-y) but no significant secretion was observed
           in control co-cultures.

        -  gp100:154-162 TCR or MART-1:27-35 TCR transduced T-cells could efficiently kill
           HLAA*0201 positive tumors. There was little or no recognition of normal fibroblasts.

        -  Adoptive transfer of either of these TCR transferred gene modified peripheral blood
           lymphocyte (PBL) following a nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting regimen could mediate
           tumor regression in from 13-30 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma though no
           complete responses were seen.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        -  In cohort 1 and 2, to determine if the administration of both the anti-gp100:154-162
           TCR-engineered and anti- MART-1:27-35 TCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL),
           aldesleukin and either the gp100:154-162 peptide or the MART-1:26-35(27L) peptide to
           patients following a chemoradiation lymphodepleting preparative regimen will result in
           complete tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  In cohort 3 and 4, to determine if the administration of both the anti-gp100:154-162
           TCR-engineered and anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR-engineered CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes
           (PBL), aldesleukin and either the gp100:154-162 peptide or the MART-1:26-35(27L) peptide
           to patients following a chemoradiation lymphodepleting preparative regimen will result
           in complete tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine whether the administration of the specific vaccine (the gp100:154-162 peptide
           or the MART-1:26-35(27L) peptide) can increase the persistence of the specific
           transferred cells (anti-gp100:154-162 TCR PBL, anti-gp100:154-162 TCR CD8+ PBL, the
           anti-MART- 1:27-35 TCR PBL, or the anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR CD8+ PBL), respectively.

      Secondary objectives:

      - Determine the toxicity profile of these treatment regimen.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have:

        -  metastatic melanoma with measurable disease

        -  been previously treated with IL-2 for melanoma;

        -  normal values for basic laboratory values.

      Patients may not have:

        -  concurrent major medical illnesses;

        -  any form of primary or secondary immunodeficiency;

        -  severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study;

        -  contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  In cohort 1 and 2:

             -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by leukapheresis
                (approximately 5 times 10(9) cells) and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3)
                and aldesleukin and separate aliquots will be transduced with the
                anti-gp100:154-162 TCR and the anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR retroviral vector.

             -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10(8) to 5 times 10(8) cells
                to supernatant containing the retroviral vectors. These gp100 and MART-1 TCR
                transduced cells will be separately expanded and tested for their anti-tumor
                activity.

             -  Once engineered lymphocytes are demonstrated to be biologically active according to
                the strict criteria outlined in the Certificate of Analysis, patients will receive
                a chemoradiation lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of
                cyclophosphamide and fludarabine and 600 cGy total body irradiation followed by
                intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive, gp100 and MART-1 TCR
                gene-transduced cells plus IV aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg q8h for a maximum of 15
                doses).

             -  Patients will be randomized to receive either the gp100:154-162 peptide or the
                MART-1:26-35(27L) peptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant.

             -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination,
                computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory
                evaluation four to six weeks after treatment and then monthly for approximately 3
                to 4 months or until off study criteria are met.

             -  The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design where initially 21
                evaluable patients will be enrolled into each of two cohorts. If none of the 21
                patients per cohort experiences a complete clinical response, then no further
                patients will be enrolled but if 1 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients
                enrolled in that cohort have a complete clinical response, then accrual to that
                cohort will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in
                that cohort.

             -  Cohort 1 and 2 will be closed with the approval of amendment D.

        -  Cohort 3 and 4 will be initiated with approval of amendment D.

             -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by leukapheresis
                (approximately 5 times 10(9) cells) and CD8+ cells will be selected from the
                cultures, using the Miltenyi CliniMACS apparatus, prior to being stimulated and
                transduced. Separate aliquots of CD8+ cells will be transduced with the
                anti-gp100:154-162 TCR and the anti-MART-1:27-35 TCR retroviral vectors.

             -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10(8) to 5 times 10(8) CD8+
                cells to supernatant containing the retroviral vectors. These gp100 and MART-1 TCR
                transduced cells will be separately expanded and tested for their anti-tumor
                activity.

             -  Once engineered lymphocytes are demonstrated to be biologically active according to
                the strict criteria outlined in the Certificate of Analysis, patients will receive
                a chemoradiation lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of

                intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive, gp100 and MART-1 TCR
                gene-transduced CD8+ cells plus IV aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg q8h for a maximum of
                15 doses).

             -  Patients will be randomized to receive either the gp100:154-162 peptide (cohort 3)
                or the MART-1:26-35(27L) peptide (cohort 4) emulsified in incomplete Freund's
                adjuvant.

             -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, CT of
                the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four to six weeks
                after treatment and then monthly for approximately 3 to 4 months or until off study
                criteria are met.

             -  The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design where initially 21
                evaluable patients will be enrolled into each of cohort 3 and 4. If none of the 21
                patients per cohort experiences a complete clinical response, then no further
                patients will be enrolled but if 1 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients
                enrolled in that cohort have a complete clinical response, then accrual to that
                cohort will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in
                that cohort.
