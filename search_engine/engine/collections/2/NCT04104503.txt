      new tablet formulations of the test medicine compared to a previously known formulation
      (reference tablet). The results from Part A of the study will be used to decide which
      formulation will be tested in Part B of the study. Part B of the study will look at the food
      effect, variability between participants, and absolute bioavailability of the test medicine
      i.e. how much of the test medicine is taken up by the body when dosed by mouth compared to
      when dosed once by injection directly into the vein. Safety and tolerability will be assessed
      throughout the study.
