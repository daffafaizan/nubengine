2413. the presence of lymphocytes in long term cultures ofnewborn mouse thymic epitheliumthymic epithelial cells derived from newbornmouse thymic fragments were culturedin vitro for over 22 mth.  subcultures werestarted by transferring minute cellsheets obtained by mechanical scraping ofthe original culture when it was 14 mthold or older.  lymphocytes, many of themwith the morphological appearance ofplasma cells, were seen in the subcultures.intact lymphocytes, as well as mitoticfigures were seen within cytoplasmatic vacuolesof the epithelial cells.  the possiblebearing of these observations on the origin of thethymic lymphocytes is brieflydiscussed.
