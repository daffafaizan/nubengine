    
      31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P MRS) is a non-invasive method to measure muscle
      metabolism during exercise. This protocol is intended to provide information for planning
      future clinical trials applying 31P MRS as an endpoint measure for proof of pharmacology
      studies with novel therapeutic molecules. Parts A & B of this study will refine imaging and
      exercise protocols for 31P MRS during brief periods of muscle ischaemia and will assess the
      test-retest variance. In Part C we will apply 31P MRS with aerobic exercise in a pilot study
      to estimate differences in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism between age- and sex-matched
      control subjects and patients with myopathy associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease.
