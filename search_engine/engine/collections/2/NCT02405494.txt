      properties and how and if these factors interact. The best way to assess these parameter
      combinations and their interactions is to use a special statistical approach named "Response
      Surface Methodology" (RSM). The current study therefore has a Central Composite Design with 9
      foams differing in liquid volume and in ratio of gas to liquid volume (%overrun, which is
      defined as 100 x gas volume/liquid volume).

      Each subject will be appointed to a single parameter combination and receives this parameter
      combination twice, separated by a one-week wash-out period.

      On both test days subjects' self-assessment of feelings of satiety and physical discomfort
      will be recorded during 4 hours post-consumption of the treatment using Electronic Visual
      Analogue Scale.
