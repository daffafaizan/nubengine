    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of immunonutrition (IMPACT®) in patients with de novo cancer of
           the upper aerodigestive tract.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the best time to initiate treatment.

        -  Compare the intermediate duration of treatment.

        -  Compare nutritional parameters.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard oral or enteral nutrition (IMPACT® placebo) over 7 days
           prior to surgery and over 7 days after surgery.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral or enteral neoadjuvant IMPACT® nutrition over 7 days prior
           to surgery and enteral adjuvant standard nutrition (IMPACT® placebo) over 7 days after
           surgery.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral or enteral IMPACT® nutrition over 7 days prior to surgery
           and enteral adjuvant IMPACT® nutrition over 7 days after surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days after surgery and then at
      2 and 3 months.
