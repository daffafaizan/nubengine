      neonatal gut microbiome is critically important with a profound impact on the host lifelong
      health. V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA amplicons of 581 stool DNA will be sequenced from a cohort
      of 51 PT infants and 50 FT infants to examine the microbial profiles. A random-effects
      generalized least square regression model is used to compare the difference in the main
      bacterial groups over time with the adjustment for multiple variables including gestational
      age and use of antibiotics .
