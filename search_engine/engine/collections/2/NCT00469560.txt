      dependent can prevent the overstock of iron and can reduce the already existing overstock
      reducing, then, the co-morbidity and improving survival.

      In particular, some authors have shown in MDS affected patients undergoing intensive
      chelating therapy with deferoxamine haematological recovery with a reduction of the need of
      transfusions.

      With the present study, we plan to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a therapy with the new
      oral chelating Deferasirox in MDS patients with transfusional hemosiderosis.

      This is an open label, single arm study on Deferasirox treatment in MDS patients with chronic
      transfusional hemosiderosis.

      Patients will receive daily oral dosis of Deferasirox in order to eliminate the quantity of
      iron administered during transfusions and, if needed, to reduce the overload of already
      present iron.

      After an screening phase in which patients are evaluated according to eligibility criteria, a
      one year treatment phase foresees monthly visits to evaluate safety and efficacy signs.
