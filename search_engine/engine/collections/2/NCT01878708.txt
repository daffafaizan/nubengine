    
      This is an open-label, investigator-initiated, single-arm pilot study. Patients with relapsed
      or refractory (R/R) peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) will receive OncasparÂ® every 3 weeks up
      to a maximum of 8 courses or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. They will
      also receive dexamethasone 40mg daily for 4 days with every cycle. They will be restaged
      after 2 courses (6 weeks) and after 8 courses (24 weeks).

      Both Oncaspar and dexamethasone have been used together to treat ALL and ENKTL, which is
      another subtype of T cell lymphoma. The combination may provide a collaborative attack
      against the cancer cell; moreover, the dexamethasone could also prevent some of the side
      effects of Oncaspar; especially allergic reactions. This study will test these two drugs
      together to determine if they are an effective treatment for T-Cell Lymphoma. Each drug is
      commercially available to the drug market.
