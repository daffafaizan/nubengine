      recent studies have shown improved results when patients receive a short course of
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery.

      Prior to surgery study treatment will be given over a 6 weeks (Days 1-42) period. Beginning
      Day 1 and continuing through Day 35 patients will receive a continuous infusion of 5-FU by
      vein. A small portable pump will be used to administer this drug into a tube that has been
      surgically inserted into the patient's vein. On Day 1 and 22 patients will also receive the
      drugs paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab by vein. Erlotinib is given by mouth beginning
      on Day 1 and continuing through Day 45. Patients will receive radiation therapy daily, Monday
      through Friday, beginning Day 1-35 (approximately 5 weeks).

      Surgery will be performed approximately 12-14 weeks after beginning this combined treatment.
