    
      A prospective, open, single-arm, single center, phase II trial to assess the efficacy of
      anti-PD1 antibody in combination with pulsed Hedgehog inhibitor in advanced Basal Cell
      Carcinoma.

      20 patients with advanced BCC will be included in the trial. No blinding or randomization
      will be conducted in this open label, non-randomized clinical trial. All of the patients will
      receive the investigative treatment (combination of anti-PD1 antibody and pulsed HHI
      therapy). The tumor response will be evaluated comparing tumour size at baseline, at each
      assessment, and 26 weeks after treatment initiation.

      The study duration from screening visit to the End of Study visit is 32 weeks with a
      Follow-Up 1 Visit at week 28 and Follow-Up 2 Visit at week 32. The duration of the
      translational part (secondary objectives) of the study is up to 24 months.

      If the best response any time at week 26 is partial response, patients will be offered to
      continue at least one of the study drugs until complete response or until a maximum of 2
      years. The evaluation during this period will correspond to the standard of care with
      laboratory tests at each follow up and imaging every 12 weeks.
