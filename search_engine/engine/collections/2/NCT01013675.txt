      phase II trial, but to expand into the elderly population who are more than 60 years of age.
      The results of this randomized, double blind, egg derived influenza vaccine (Influvac) -
      controlled, parallel-trial, in healthy elderly subjects are to be conducted over two
      consecutive years in multiple centers in Europe. At study initiation 600 subjects will be
      randomly allocated to receive the cell-derived or egg-derived influenza vaccine. At start of
      the second year subjects will be randomly re-allocated following stratification based upon
      the initial drug they were allocated and had received.
