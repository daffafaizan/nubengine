      pilot study in patients with UC and determine if this approach can reduce stool calprotectin.
      Before going forward with a larger efficacy trial, the investigators are first aiming to
      determine if the supplements/medications we are proposing to use are sufficient to reduce a
      biomarker. Consequently, this study will look at a more easily measurable biomarker to
      provide evidence that the dosing is sufficient.

      This pilot study will be conducted to assess preferable dose of hydroxocobalamin based on
      reduction of calprotectin. The investigators aim to determine if this reduction is sustained
      over time and is correlated to changes in clinical disease activity.
