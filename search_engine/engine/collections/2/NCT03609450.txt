      MTPC on specific mechanisms of change such as emotion regulation (primary outcome),
      interoceptive awareness and sustained attention/response inhibition (secondary outcomes).
      This study will also investigate the extent to which these self-regulation targets mediate
      the impact of MTPC group on action plan initiation. Participants randomized to 8-week MTPC
      are compared with participants randomized to a low-dose mindfulness comparator condition, in
      which they receive a 1-hour introduction to mindfulness with a referral to community
      mindfulness resources. Outcome assessments are conducted at baseline and study weeks 8-10.
      This study builds on the Phase 2 study, which demonstrated that Mindfulness Training for
      Primary Care enhanced chronic illness self-management action plan initiation among primary
      care patients receiving care in an urban, community, multi-cultural safety net healthcare
      system.
