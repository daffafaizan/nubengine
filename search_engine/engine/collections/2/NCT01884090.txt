      Community Schools and the Genesee County Intermediate School District. The study will include
      participants at eight high-need middle schools with 21st Century after school programs.

      Researchers have consistently found that participation in out of school programs enhances
      adolescents' well being and sense of worth, involves them in positive behaviors and helps
      them avoid involvement in problem behaviors. Although key elements of successful after school
      programs have been proposed (e.g., adult mentorship), the processes through which youth
      positive outcomes are achieved have rarely been empirically examined. Empowerment theory
      provides a unique conceptual framework for developing programs to enhance positive youth
      development because it incorporates the notion that health promotion requires not only that
      youth develop specific skills and positive assets, but also that youth become motivated to
      actively apply these skills and knowledge to become agents of positive change for themselves
      and in their communities. Thus, programs based on empowerment theory focus on building
      positive assets, connecting youth with local resources and adult role models, and engaging
      youth in community service activities. Ecological theory complements empowerment theory
      because it focuses attention on the social contexts in which youth develop, interactions
      between these contexts, and the roles youth can play in these contexts (e.g., schools,
      communities). An intervention approach informed by these two theories should enhance positive
      youth development by engaging youth in relevant ecological settings where they can learn
      skills, practice those skills, and establish the social resources to effectively navigate the
      social contexts in which they find themselves and develop into healthy adults.
