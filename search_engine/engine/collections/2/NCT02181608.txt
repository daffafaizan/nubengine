    
      Objective:

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role of early life stress (ELS),
      alcohol dependence (AD), and their interaction in psychophysiology and neural mechanisms of
      fear conditioning and extinction.

      The main outcome of interest is fear extinction, as measured by laboratory-based and fMRI
      paradigms. Secondary objectives of the study include: (1) explore the impact of early life
      stress on behavioral and endocrine response to challenge procedures among individuals with
      AD; (2) explore differences in reward processing, emotion processing, and neural response to
      alcohol beverages as measured by fMRI as a function of AD and ELS; and (3) examine the
      relationship between fear extinction and clinical outcomes in our patient sample.

      Study Population:

      The study sample includes four groups: 1) treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol
      dependence (AD) and ELS exposure; 2) treatment seeking individuals with alcohol dependence
      without ELS exposure; 3) healthy social drinkers without alcohol use disorders (AUD) but with
      ELS exposure; and 4) healthy social drinkers without AUD and without ELS exposure. Target
      accrual for each of these groups is 25.

      Design:

      All participants will be evaluated for fear conditioning and extinction using two separate
      paradigms: an out-of-the scanner shock conditioning extinction procedure that utilizes
      acoustic startle, and a shock conditioning extinction procedure combined with fMR imaging
      that utilizes galvanic skin response. In addition, the two alcohol dependent groups will be
      evaluated for several biomarkers including a guided imagery procedure designed to induce
      stress and/or craving for alcohol, and an assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis function.

      Outcome Measures:

      Primary outcome measures include fear-potentiated startle responses and galvanic skin
      responses; and neural BOLD fMRI responses during presentation of fear associated stimuli.
      Secondary and exploratory measures in alcohol dependent subjects include measures of distress
      and craving for alcohol in response to guided imagery scripts; neuroendocrine stress
      responses and clinical outcomes (alcohol consumption and self-reported anxiety and mood
      symptoms).
