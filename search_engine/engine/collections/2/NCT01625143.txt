      I. To identify global changes in the epigenome and various underlying histone modifications
      that characterize relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      II. To identify specific transcription factor-binding sites associated with histone
      alterations.

      III. To correlate gene expression changes of differentially regulated genes at relapse with
      underlying chromatin modifications.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived bone marrow samples, collected at the time of diagnosis and relapse, are analyzed
      for gene expression and histone modifications by microarray, chromatin immunoprecipitation
      (ChIP) sequencing, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
