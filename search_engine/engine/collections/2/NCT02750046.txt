        1. Establish type H vessel in bone specimen in patients with hip fracture.

        2. Explore the correlation of BMD and type H vessel.

      OUTLINE:

        1. Collect human bone specimens from patients with Osteoporotic and Nonosteoporotic
           Fracture.

        2. Provide a repository for storage of tissue and make these specimens available for
           approved projects by laboratory-based investigators.

        3. Observe the type H vessel in bone slice by immunofluorescence staining.

        4. Collect clinical data on these patients including bone mineral density.

        5. Investigate the relationship between BMD and type H vessel.
