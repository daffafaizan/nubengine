    
      Rationale:

      In elective PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) up to 40% of the patients show an
      asymptomatic rise in myonecrosis marker troponin-I. This release of troponin-I has been found
      to represent irreversible myocardial injury and has been related to an increased risk of
      restenosis and even long-term mortality. Dipyridamole has been proven to induce protection
      against ischemia reperfusion injury and to reduce risk of cardiovascular death or event in
      secondary prevention after TIA or CVA.

      Objective:

      To test the hypothesis that dipyridamole improves tolerance to ischemia reperfusion injury in
      patients undergoing elective PCI.

      Study design:

      Double-blind placebo controlled intervention study

      Study population:

      Patients undergoing elective PCI

      Intervention:

      pretreatment with dipyridamole (Persantin Retard) 2dd 200mg or placebo.

      Main study parameters:

      Periprocedural troponin-I release measured 8 hours after PCI.

      Bioequivalence study:

      before the start of th clinical trial we will perform a bioequivalent study to test whether
      our study medication (blinded by recapsuling) equals original dipyridamole capsules. 6
      Healthy volunteers in a cross-over randomised design will take original dipyridamole 200 mg
      SR and recapsuled dipyridamole 200mg SR (prepared by the department of pharmacy of the
      RUNMC). Plasma dipyridamole concentration will be measured frequently and at baseline and 1
      and 3 hours after administration of dipyridamole nucleoside transport inhibitions of
      erythrocytes will be measured, to assess drug activity.

      The clinical trial will only be initialized after conformation of bioequivalence of the study
      medication to the original dipyridamole.
