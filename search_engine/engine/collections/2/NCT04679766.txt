      lost labial plate of bone using different grafting materials with barrier membranes.

      This might be attributed to the necessity of using a full mucoperiosteal flap which
      interrupts the vascular supply to the bone and jeopardizing the process of total facial bone
      regenerative process. Therefore, Tan-Chu et al., (2014) described in a case report an
      innovative technique using resorbable collagen membrane in the shape of ice cream cone and
      allograft in the reconstitution of labial plate in patients with socket type II after
      extraction with folding the membrane to seal the socket and containing the blood clot to
      allow for occupation of osteogenic cell population without raising a flap. This technique
      showed an adequate bone regeneration with net result of 1.32 mm prior to no labial plate
      present before grafting. Hence, using immediate implant placement with the conjunction of the
      ice cream cone technique in regeneration of labial plate of bone needs to be further assessed
      to evaluate its clinical outcomes.
