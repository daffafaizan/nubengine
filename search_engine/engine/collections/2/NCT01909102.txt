    
      The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a mindfulness-based intervention which efficacy has
      been proven in the treatment of depression and anxiety, in stress reduction and in the
      modification of health- related behaviors in patients with several physical conditions. The
      application of an acceptance-based program in cardiac patients has revealed high treatment
      satisfaction and initial evidences of effectiveness in increasing heart-healthy behaviour.

      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief group-administered program
      based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in improving patients' ability to address
      modifiable multiple cardiovascular risk factors and overall psychological well-being,
      compared with the usual care.
