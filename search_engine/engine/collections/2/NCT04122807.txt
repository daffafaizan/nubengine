      heartbeats in young people. People with AVNRT have two pathways within the heart, the fast
      pathway (FP) and slow pathway (SP). A treatment for AVNRT is ablation (burning or freezing)
      of the SP. This can be done with either radiofrequency or cryo-energy. A complication which
      occurs in 1% of cases is AV block (AVB), meaning the person needs a pacemaker.

      Slow pathway ablation is a problem in people when the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a long PR
      interval, with greater rates of AVB. This accounts for 5% of AVNRT cases. A possible solution
      is to treat the FP with cryo-energy and leave the SP intact. This pilot study aims to show
      this is safe and effective.
