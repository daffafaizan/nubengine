    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
      treatment with bevacizumab and temsirolimus in combination and plus valproic acid or
      cetuximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Preliminary descriptive assessment of anti-tumor efficacy of each combination.

      II. Preliminary assessment of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic markers of target
      inhibition and correlates of response (optional).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bevacizumab and temsirolimus. Patients are
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22; bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15; and cetuximab IV over 1-2
      hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      GROUP II: Patients receive temsirolimus and bevacizumab as in Group I and valproic acid
      orally (PO) daily on days 1-7 and 15-21.

      GROUP III: Patients receive temsirolimus and bevacizumab as in Group I.

      In all groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
