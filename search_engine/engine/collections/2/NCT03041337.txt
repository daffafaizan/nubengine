    
      Patients will be evaluated with a routinely performed resting and stress echocardiography.
      Moreover, physical examination and ECG will be performed and past medical history will be
      collected. Optional procedures comprise of quality of life assessment (SF-36 questionnaire),
      six minute walking distance (6MWD), cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), routine
      laboratory including biochemical work-up.

      Comparison among different cohorts of patients with regards to right heart morphology and
      function at rest, assessed during a routinely performed resting and stress echography. The
      following parameters will be evaluated:

        -  Right ventricular (RV) diameters

        -  RV free wall thickness

        -  End-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction

        -  Right atrial (RA) area

        -  End-diastolic and end-systolic RV area and % shortening of the areas of the right
           ventricle

        -  Tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) and severity

        -  Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)

        -  Inferior vena cava diameter and % of collapsibility

        -  TAPSE at peak exercise and after 5 minutes recovery

        -  TRV at peak exercise and after 5 minutes recovery

        -  RV end-diastolic and end-systolic area and % shortening of the areas at peak exercise
           and after 5 minutes recovery

        -  RA area at peak exercise and after 5 minutes recovery

        -  Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume and ejection fraction at peak
           exercise and after 5 minutes recovery

        -  Left ventricular eccentricity index at peak exercise and after 5 minutes recovery
