      Primary Outcome Measure:

        -  Safety (incidence of adverse events defined as dose-limited toxicity)

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Survival of CAR T cells in circulation measured by flow cytometry and qPCR

        -  Overall complete remission rate

        -  Tissue infiltration of transferred CAR-T cells

        -  In vitro killing potential of infiltrated CAR-T cells

        -  Phenotype of infused CAR-T cells
