      a 3-minute withdrawal time. Patients will then undergo colonoscopy. All colonoscopies will be
      performed by a GI attending (standard of care). The colonoscopy is typically performed under
      conscious sedation using medications such as fentanyl and midazolam for comfort (standard of
      care). Occasional patients undergo colonoscopy under general anesthesia. For all patients,
      advancement of the colonoscope to the cecum will be followed by segmental withdrawal of the
      colonoscope in each of 3 segments of the examined colon (right side of colon, transverse
      colon and left side of colon). Following examination of each individual segment, the
      colonoscope will be readvanced to the proximal end of the segment and a 2 minute withdrawal
      will be re-performed. For those randomized to the 6-minute withdrawal each segment will be
      examined over 2 minutes, followed by a "second look" over each segment over 2 minutes by the
      same endoscopist. For those randomized to the 3-minute withdrawal time, advancement to the
      cecum will also be followed by segmental withdrawal in each of 3 segments of the examined
      colon. Each segment will be examined over 1 minute, followed by a "second look" over each
      segment over 2 minutes by the same endoscopist. All patients will therefore undergo a second
      look colonoscopy with a 6-minute withdrawal time ('de-facto' standard of care). Polyp/adenoma
      detection and miss rates will then be calculated and compared between the two groups.
