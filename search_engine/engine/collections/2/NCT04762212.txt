    
      This study aims to compare the effects of a therapist-performed mobilization with movement
      (MWM) technique with those of a dynamic stretch with over pressure on active hip flexion
      range of motion (ROM) in those with active hip flexion ROM limitations.Those individuals from
      the University of South Carolina's Department of Physical Therapy (UofSC DPT) community who
      are interested in becoming study participants will be identified by means of announcements
      made in the Seminar in Physical Therapy course which is attended by all students, faculty,
      and staff of UofSC DPT each week. Interested individuals will be provided with Cathy Arnot's
      email address in order to schedule an evaluation session to determine whether or not they
      meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, Sarah Cooper will attend a
      staff meeting at Vertex PT Specialists to make an announcement and provide the attendees with
      Cathy Arnot's email for inquiries. Participants will be assigned to either the MWM group or
      the dynamic stretch with over pressure group via blocked randomization for sex and age, with
      at least seventeen participants being placed into each group. The MWM group participants will
      receive a therapist-performed MWM technique and a prescription for a home exercise program
      (HEP) consisting of a dynamic stretch with over pressure to be performed once a day over the
      course of the following week. The dynamic stretch with over pressure group participants will
      receive only the prescription for the HEP consisting of the dynamic stretch with over
      pressure to be performed once a day over the following week. Measurements will be assessed at
      four time points: Immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, 24
      hours after the intervention, and one week after the intervention.
