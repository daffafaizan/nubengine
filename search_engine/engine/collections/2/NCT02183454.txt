      undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with (attempted) placement of at least one
      Combo Stent (according to the Instructions for use) as part of routine clinical care.
      Approximately 2,500 patients from 50 centers in Europe and Asia will be entered into the
      registry. Patients entered into the registry are followed for one year. The registry is
      considered finished when all patients have completed the 12 month follow-up.

      A follow-up is scheduled at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months post procedure. Follow-up is
      obtained at a planned regular visit to the outpatient clinic, or by telephone contact with
      the patient.
