      MK-2206 in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab when given to patients with
      HER2-overexpressing solid tumor malignancies. MK-2206 is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that
      turns off a protein called AKT inside cancer cells. This could be helpful in treating
      treatment-resistant cancers, because AKT allows cells to survive despite active anticancer
      treatment. In the case of HER2-positive cancers, laboratory studies suggest that the drug
      combination of MK-2206 and paclitaxel and trastuzumab may be effective.
