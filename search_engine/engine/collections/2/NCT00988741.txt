    
      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ARQ 197 or placebo. The
      treatment assignment will be stratified based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status (PS), and vascular invasion status. The treatment with ARQ 197 or placebo
      will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another
      discontinuation criterion listed in this protocol is met.

      After radiographic disease progression is documented, treatment assignment will be unblinded.
      Patients who were assigned to placebo arm and had documented radiographic disease progression
      will have the option to receive ARQ 197 and will be evaluated for objective response rate and
      disease control rate continuously.

      The study will continue until 78 total time to progression events are reached. At the end of
      study, all remaining patients still on treatment will have the option to be rolled over to
      another study to continue their treatment.
