    
      Participants will have a nephroureterectomy (taking the kidney and the ureter). Investigators
      will also be doing a lymph node dissection (taking the patient's lymph nodes in the same side
      of the kidney) to look for malignancy outside of the kidney and ureter. The lymph nodes will
      be sent to pathology for review.

      Study visits will be scheduled 10 to 14 days after surgery for removal of stitches and
      analysis of the patient's pathology report.

      The following procedures will be done:

        -  History and physical examination, urinary cytology (test to look for malignant cells in
           the urine) and surveillance cystoscopy (procedure to look inside the urethra and bladder
           which is performed in the office under local anesthesia) every 3 months for the first 2
           years after treatment, every 6 months for the next 2 years and yearly thereafter if the
           patient is free from recurrence.

        -  Radiographic studies including chest x-ray and abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CAT
           scans) will be performed every 6 months for the first 2 years and then yearly
           thereafter.

        -  Bone scan (special imaging study to look for cancer spread in bone) in case of bone pain
           or elevated alkaline phosphatase level.

      After surgery patients will be followed every 3 months for the first 2 years after treatment,
      every 6 months for the next 2 years and yearly thereafter if they are free from recurrence.
