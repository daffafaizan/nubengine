      Residents gave oral consent twice to participate. They were classified in groups of six
      residents taking into account socio-demographic and medical characteristics. Two experimental
      conditions were proposed : 1. a social stimulation session (36 residents) and 2. a control
      group without direct social stimulation (24 residents). Collected socio-demographic and
      medical characteristics are age, gender, timf of institutionalization, sociocultural level,
      marital status and diagnostic hypothesis. Before the study, scales and questionnaires were
      used to assess cognitive status with the Mini Mental State Examination (Folstein et al,
      1975); functional abilities with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Lawton and Brody,
      1969); depression with the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (Alexopoulos et al,
      1988); psychological and behavioural disorders with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Cummings
      et al, 1994); and the quality of life with the Alzheimer's Disease Related Quality of Life
      (Rabins et al, 1999).

      Social interactions are video taped and analyzed in a grid of observation.

      The aim of the study is to see if there is an impact on social interactions after just one
      social stimulation session compared to a control group situation. Expected results are that
      residents of the social stimulation group will have more social interactions between us than
      the resident of the control group.
