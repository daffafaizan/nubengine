    
      Multimodal Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (MCET) was developed for cognitive rehabilitation of
      mild cognitive impairment or ealy dementia. MCET consists of cognitive training, cognitive
      stimulation, reality orientation, physical therapy, reminiscence therapy and music therapy
      that obtained 'A' grade of recommendation by SIGN(Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines
      Network) for their efficacy (one of the followings: global cognition/specific cognitive
      domain/mood/activities of daily living/behavioral and psychological symptoms/quality of life)
      based on the systematic review and meta-analysis performed by our research team.

      This study investigated the efficacy of MCET compared with mock-therapy that consisted of
      random activities that were not based on clinical evidences (e.g., watching TV, conversation
      etc.).
