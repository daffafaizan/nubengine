    
      In this study we will use standard clinical studies, including simultaneous Video-EEG
      monitoring, to evaluate patients referred for uncontrolled or suspected seizures. The
      protocol will be used to screen patients for inclusion in other protocols, follow the natural
      history of seizure disorders, and train fellows in the evaluation and treatment of epilepsy.
      Both inpatients and outpatients will be studied.
