      admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research
      Hospital will be included in this prospective study. Blood for neonatal and maternal vitamin
      D levels will be obtained from all infants and their mothers at the time of hospital
      admission. The infants will be evaluated for RDS and surfactant requirement. If they have RDS
      and need of mechanical ventilation, they will be intubated and given surfactant, if
      necessary. The maternal and neonatal demographics of infants will be recorded. Infants will
      also be followed up in terms of other morbidities including patent ductus arteriosus,
      necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and especially BPD. Then infants will
      be divided into three groups according to maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels (mild, moderate
      and severe vitamin D deficiency) and group comparisons will be performed Plasmas after
      separated and stored at -80 C. Levels of 25-OHD will be determined using Shimadzu LC-20AT
      model High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. Data will be analyzed using SPSS
      software and appropriate statistical analyses will be performed.
