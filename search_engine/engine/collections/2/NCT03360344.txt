      non-surgical intervention of the dorsal application of Kinesio Tape for carpal tunnel
      syndrome, and forearm wrist hand pain. Little evidence exists for an effective non-surgical
      intervention. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to explore changes in occupational
      performance and compliance in order to understand if Kinesio Tape contributed to results and
      if so, how the participants perceived the interventions.
