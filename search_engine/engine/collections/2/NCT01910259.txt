      (fluoxetine, riluzole and amiloride). All three drugs are in human use and have a good safety
      record. Critically for the purpose of MS-SMART they all have shown promise in early phase
      human MS clinical trials and target one or more of the pivotal neurodegenerative causing
      pathways implicated in SPMS. This is a Type B trial, as the IMPs are all in human use, have a
      good safety profile but are not currently used for this patient population.

      The major need for patients with established and progressive MS is neuroprotective or disease
      modifying treatments that will slow or even stop disease progression. This study will
      evaluate three highly promising putative neuroprotective drugs as well as comprehensively
      address several of the current knowledge gaps related to the understanding of neuroprotection
      and neurodegeneration in SPMS through MRI and CSF examination.

      MS-SMART is a multicentre, multi-arm, double blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb randomised
      controlled trial. A total of 440 patients with SPMS, with an entry criteria of an EDSS score
      of 4.0-6.5 will be equally randomised to receive placebo or one of the three active agents
      (fluoxetine 20mg bd, amiloride 5mg bd or riluzole 50mg bd). Patients will be followed up for
      96 weeks with outcome-data collected after 0, 24, 48 and 96 weeks. That is, the duration of
      the trial for a trial participant is 96 weeks (a telephone assessment at week 100, 4 weeks
      post completion will be conducted). This is standard practice for phase II trials in SPMS.
