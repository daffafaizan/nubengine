      smoking cessation, anti-platelet therapy, cilostazol, statins and revascularization are used
      to treat PAD, men and women with PAD have significantly greater functional impairment and
      fasterfunctional decline than those without PAD. Stem and progenitor cell (PC) therapy that
      promotes neoangiogenesis is an emerging treatment modality in PAD. Progenitor cells,
      particularly those of endothelial origin, are involved in vascular repair and regeneration.
      They originate primarily but not exclusively from the bone marrow, differentiate into
      endothelial and other vascular cells, and contribute to neovascularization during tissue
      repair by direct and paracrine mechanisms. Endogenous, pharmacologically-stimulated, and
      exogenous PCs contribute to re-endothelialization and neovascularization. Granulocyte colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
      stimulate mobilization of hematopoietic and other PCs from the bone marrow.In the murine hind
      limb ischemia model, GM-CSF administered by injection or by plasmid transfer augments
      circulating levels of PCs, increases capillary density, and promotes arteriogenesis.GM-CSF
      also augments neo-endothelialization of denuded arteries, promotes proliferation,
      differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells, monocytes and macrophages.
