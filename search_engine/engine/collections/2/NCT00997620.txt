      as measured by validated daytime sleep score (Eppworth Daytime Sleepiness Scale) and
      cognitive performance weekly as measured by a validated test of cognitive performance (TOVA).
      The treatment group with intervention of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 mcg two sprays
      in each nostril once daily will be compared to a placebo treated group of similar subjects
      with seasonal allergic rhinitis.
