      with this situation, it is necessary to make preparations for the care of the elderly. World
      Health Organization (WHO) proposed aging health strategy in recent years, and the community
      participation is the most important for the elderly. The courses provided by the community
      empowering are important to promote the healthy life of the elderly. However, at this stage,
      there are relatively few courses related to cognitive functions, life-style activities and
      aging education. It is needed to add more courses related to multi-domain.

      Investigators anticipate recruiting a total of 50 participants with cognitive decline. The
      participants will receive a total of 12 training sessions, and each session will contain 120
      minutes of training. The programs contain sequential cognitive and exercise training, health
      lectures, and groups of daily living participation. Investigators plan to assess the
      participants before and after the intervention programs. Investigators expect that elders
      receiving training will improve on outcome measures. The results of the study will provide
      evidence of interventions for elderly with cognitive decline.
