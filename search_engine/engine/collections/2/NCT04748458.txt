      arthroplasty (THA) due to osteoarthritis after congenital hip pathologies challenging. While
      it seems that congenital hip pathologies did not significantly influence the outcomes when
      compared to THA after osteoarthritis, the choice of implant was demonstrated to impact the
      survival rates of the THA after congenital hip pathologies.

      To date, no guidelines exist about the correct choice of hip implant in congenital hip
      pathologies: only mid-term case series are available. Conical tapered stems have been
      frequently suggested for the most difficult cases.

      The aim of this study is to describe the survival rates and the long-term clinical and
      radiological outcome of conical tapered stems in THAs after congenital hip pathologies.
