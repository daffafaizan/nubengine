      northeastern US community pharmacies as a result of telephonic prompts during regular
      automated outbound communiqu√©s. There will be three projects assessing different forms of
      these appended prompts-appointment-based medication synchronization automated prompts, refill
      ready automated prompts, and refill reminder automated prompts. Each intervention will occur
      in one of three pharmacy chains, each with approximately 10,000 patients randomized to
      control or intervention (receive prompt or no).

      Prior to the outbound automated call to the patient, a third-party technology vendor
      (Scientific Technologies Corporation) will perform an automated immunization status
      assessment of the patient by submitting a query the state immunization registry to compare
      the adult patient's existing immunization record to the CDC Recommended Adult Immunization
      Schedule. Gaps in immunizations that fall within pharmacy scope of practice will be
      identified. During the automated call (performed by VoicePort, a pharmacy telephonic support
      vendor) to the patient, they will be prompted to receive identified immunization gap vaccines
      upon their next pharmacy visit, with priority on pneumococcal, influenza, and herpes zoster
      vaccinations. If the patient accepts, the vaccination will be delivered when next the patient
      comes to visit the pharmacy.

      After 6 months of running the trial, statistical modeling will be employed to assess
      vaccination rate differences between control and intervention patients.
