    
      Pupil light reflex will be measured by a pupillometer in response to short and long
      wavelength light small spot stimulus in different area of the visual field. The PRL will be
      measured in four quadrant, central, 10, 20, and 30 degree from the visual axis.

      Stimulus duration will be 1000 ms (1 sec), with intervals of 890 ms between stimuli. The
      stimuli size V with light intensity of 39.8 cd-s/m2 for both short wavelength stimuli (peak
      485 nm) and long wavelength stimuli (peak 620nm).
