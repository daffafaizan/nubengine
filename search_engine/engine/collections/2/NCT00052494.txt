        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate when administered with
           cisplatin and irinotecan in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of imatinib mesylate in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate, median duration of response, progression-free survival,
           median survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 60 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 4 courses. Patients also
      receive oral imatinib mesylate daily continually for one week prior to, during, and after
      chemotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are treated at the recommended phase II dose (one dose level below the MTD).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
