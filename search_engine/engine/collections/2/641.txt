mammalian cell cultures contaminated withpleuropneumonia-like organismsii. effect of pplo on cell morphology in establishedmonolayer culturesthe occurrence of cytopathogenic changes in monolayer cultures ofpplo-contaminated mammalian cells has been shown to be related todeficiency of arginine in the medium.  the same effects were seen when thecell culture medium was depleted by pplo prior to application to pplo-freecell cultures even though viable pplo were no longer present.  the fact thatthe same picture resulted in the absence of pplo when either arginine orglucose were omitted from the medium would indicate that, while the defi-ciency created under the conditions described was specific, the cellularchanges could as well be the result of omission or depletion of other mam-malian cell growth requirements.  the importance of surveillance of celllines for the presence of pplo to avoid misinterpretation of cytopathogeniceffects was stressed.
