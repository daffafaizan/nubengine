           almond and control, n=60 needed (30 in each arm) Subjects randomized to almonds arm are
           given a preload of 20 g of almonds 30 minutes prior to ingestion of 75 g of glucose,
           while those in the control arm do not have any food/almonds before OGTT. Blood samples
           are collected at (minutes): -30, 30, 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120. Cross over of these subjects
           is done and OGTT repeated in a similar manner. Assessment of blood glucose, serum
           insulin, glucagon, C-peptide, serum triglycerides, free fatty acids, DPP-IV, and GLP1
           levels are done at these time points.

        -  Sub-Acute Study:

      Three-day almond preload study monitored with CGMS, n=60 needed. All study participants
      undergoing OGTT are further studied with CGMS for three days each and then crossed over.
      Those in almonds arm continue to receive preload of almonds for three days and then studied
      without almond preload after cross over. A washout period of 7 days separates cross-over
      period.

      o Chronic Phase Study: Ninety days almond preload study monitored with self-monitoring of
      blood glucose; n=60 needed.

      This is a randomized controlled parallel-arm study to evaluate the long-term effect of
      preload of almonds on hyperglycemia. Subjects fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria are
      randomized to either the control arm or the almond arm.
