      that causes various symptoms including nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, olfactory dysfunction,
      facial pain, and headache. Patients with significant eosinophilic inflammation usually
      accompanied with a higher recurrence rate and more severe clinical symptoms. Endoscopic sinus
      surgery (ESS) is recommended to patients who do not response well to conservative treatments.
      A retrospective study showed that postoperative polyp recurrence rate of patients with severe
      eosinophilic inflammation was significantly reduced by rebooting sinus mucosa. In this study,
      the experimental group intends to adopt a modified radical surger to remove the mucosa
      including ethmoid sinus and maxillary sinus, as well as a completly middle turbinate
      resection to achieve a extensive treatment of ethmoid sinus. Antrostomies of frontal and
      sphenoid sinuses were then performed with meticulous operation and preserve the mucosa
      intactly.
