      (TMS) on craving in individuals treated with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.
      Investigators will enroll subjects aged 18-65 years old who are currently in treatment with
      buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Included subjects will have initiated treatment with
      buprenorphine in the last 3 months, be able to read, write, and understand English, and, if
      female, agree to use contraception. Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of
      bipolar or psychotic illness, current depression, use substances other than opioids, take
      medications that lower seizure threshold or impair neuroplasticity, have chronic pain, have a
      history of seizure or any other uncontrolled medical issue, or have a device or ferromagnetic
      implant in the head or neck. Enrolled subjects will receive 10 (twice daily for 5 days)
      sessions of active TMS (intermittent theta burst stimulation) to the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (L DLPFC) on consecutive weekdays. Investigators will assess craving,
      substance use, and mood throughout the study and 1-2 weeks post-treatment completion.
