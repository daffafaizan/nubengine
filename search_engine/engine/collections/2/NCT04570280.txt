    
      There are 3 groups in total in the study. The patients in the control arm will be given the
      practice of range of motion exercises for 50 minutes (1 day with a physiotherapist) 3 days a
      week for 12 weeks. The resistance exercise group will be given range of motion and resistance
      exercises with sandbag to the lower extremities for 12 weeks, 3 days a week for 50 minutes (1
      day in the presence of a physiotherapist). In the aerobic exercise group, range of motion
      exercises and aerobic exercises on the treadmill will be given 50 minutes (1 day in the
      presence of a physiotherapist) 3 days a week for 12 weeks.

      After the patient completes the 12-week exercise program, ultrasonographic measurements of
      transverse muscle thickness of M. Rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, long head of M.Biceps
      femoris and medial head of M. , 6-minute walk test, body composition measurements with DEXA
      device and quality of life measurements with SF-36, fatigue severity scale, fear assessment
      questionnaire in inflammatory rheumatic diseases and scales for other rheumatoid arthritis
      and pain status. Ultrasonographic measurements will be made at the midpoint between the
      anterior superior iliac spina and the upper end of the patella for rectus femoris and vastus
      intermedialis. For the medial head of the gascrokinemius, the measurement will be made at the
      thickest point where the head of the muscle is in the leg area, and for the biceps femoris
      muscle, 60% distal between the greater trochanter and the outer femoral condyle, and at the
      intersection point of a line drawn at the midline of the popliteal fossa. While measurements
      made for rectus femoris and vastus intermedius were evaluated in the supine position; The
      biceps femoris and gastrocnemius will be evaluated while the patient lies comfortably in the
      prone position.
