      early cardioversion. This has just been expanded with a delayed cardioversion approach.
      However, considering the recurrent and transient nature of AF, cardioversion might not be
      needed at all and rate control medication might be sufficient to accomplish spontaneous
      conversion to sinus rhythm. The aim of this trial is to evaluate effectiveness (presence of
      sinus rhythm) of a watchful-waiting approach, i.e. symptom reduction through rate-control
      medication and monitoring until spontaneous conversion is achieved compared to routine care,
      consisting of either early or delayed cardioversion. The trial is a multicentre prospective,
      randomized, open label, non-inferiority trial comparing the interventional watchful-waiting
      approach to routine care (control).The primary endpoint (presence of sinus rhythm), will be
      assessed after 4 weeks. The total follow-up time is 1 year.
