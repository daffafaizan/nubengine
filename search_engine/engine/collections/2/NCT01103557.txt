      metastatic patterns are relatively predictable. Initial nodal metastasis in PTC usually
      occurs in the paratracheal and pretracheal nodes in level VI of the central compartment of
      the ipsilateral neck and spreads to the lateral cervical lymph nodes. Macroscopic skip
      metastases to the lateral compartment of the neck in the absence of central disease are
      uncommon.
