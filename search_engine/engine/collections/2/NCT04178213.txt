    
      The purpose of this study is to conduct the initial clinical investigation of single piece
      ADAPT treated 3D - ALR (Aortic Leaflet Repair) to collect evidence on the device's safety and
      performance. The study is anticipated to confirm successful clinical safety and clinical
      performance with significant improvements in clinical hemodynamic performance.

      The ADAPTÂ® technology is used to process animal derived tissues to produce implantable tissue
      prosthetic devices that are compatible with the human body. This technology has been shown to
      produce reliable, biocompatible and versatile regenerative prosthetic devices capable of
      being used instead of synthetic products currently used in many soft tissue repair
      applications.

      15 patients with aortic valve insufficiency or stenosis will be enrolled in this single arm
      single site study.

      Follow-up will continue through to 26 weeks.
