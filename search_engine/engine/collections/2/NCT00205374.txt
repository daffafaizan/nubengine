      diminishing the frequency and magnitude of papilloma recurrences in adult and pediatric RRP
      patients. Briefly, patients will be randomized into either a treatment (cidofovir injection)
      or a placebo group. The following measures will be made at each of 6 data collection time
      points, over the course of one year: (1) tumor load, based upon a published staging system
      for papilloma, (2) degree of respiratory obstruction for phonation, as assessed by phonation
      threshold pressures, and (3) general health, on validated health inventories (SF12 and Voice
      Handicap Index for adults; PedsQL (Trademarked) for children) and via measures of height
      weight and days absent from school or daycare, where applicable, for children. A repeated
      measures analysis will allow examination of time by treatment interactions to determine if
      the cidofovir injection group has fewer, or less severe, recurrences than the placebo group.

      Specifically, we will answer the following questions in this investigation:

        1. Does cidofovir injection reduce the frequency of RRP recurrences?

        2. Does cidofovir injection reduce the magnitude of RRP, as assessed with a proposed
           staging system for RRP (Derkay et al., 1998) and measures of phonatory threshold
           pressure?

        3. Does cidofovir injection improve general health, as assessed by height, weight and days
           absent from school in pediatric patients and health inventories (general health and
           voice-related) in children and adults?
