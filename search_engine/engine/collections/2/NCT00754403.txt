      thiazolidinediones. The insulin-sensitizing actions of thiazolidinediones are at least
      partially mediated through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. These
      receptors are found primarily in adipocytes, vascular endothelial cells, monocytes,
      hepatocytes, and to a lesser extent myocytes.

      Metformin was developed as an extended-release formulation of metformin hydrochloride and
      designed for once-a-day oral administration. Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent, which
      improves glucose tolerance in patients with, type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and
      postprandial plasma glucose.

      On 15 July 1999, the FDA approved pioglitazone for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to
      improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pioglitazone is indicated for
      monotherapy and for use in combination with sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin when diet
      and exercise plus the single agent do not result in adequate glycemic control. On 26 November
      2003, the FDA approved the combined use of pioglitazone with metformin.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effect on glycemic control when pioglitazone and
      metformin are taken together. Individuals participating in this study will provide written
      informed consent and will be required to commit to a screening visit and approximately 5
      additional visits at the study center. Study participation is anticipated to be about 31
      weeks (or approximately 8 months). Multiple procedures will occur at each visit which may
      include fasting, blood collection, urine collection, physical examinations and
      electrocardiograms.
