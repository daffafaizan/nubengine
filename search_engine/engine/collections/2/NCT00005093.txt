      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to performance status and are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive CI-994 orally on days 1-21 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Arm II: Patients receive placebo capsules orally on days 1-21 and
      gemcitabine as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days as long as medically appropriate
      (absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 176 patients will be accrued for this study.
