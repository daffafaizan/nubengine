      negative neck in early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to
      determine the need for a randomized controlled trial in order to evaluate the survival
      benefit of elective neck dissection on the prognosis of T1, 2 N0M0 patients with carcinoma of
      oral cavity. We initiate this multi-institutional study, expecting 448 primary oral cancer
      patients to be enrolled. And we are going to randomly divide these patients into two groups:
      END and "watch and wait". The END group will undergo one stage surgery of END and primary
      tumor excision, and the "watch and wait"group will be treated with primary tumor excision
      transorally as initial treatment, with rigorous postoperation consultation. All patients will
      be followed up with at least 5 years after initial treatment, and the survival rate and the
      recurrence rate between groups will be compared.
