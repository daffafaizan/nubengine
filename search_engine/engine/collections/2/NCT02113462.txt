      disease (CKD).The reasons for the elevated risk of CVD in patients with CKD are not fully
      elucidated. There is not a good prognostic tool for the prediction of increased
      cardiovascular risk in CKD. A simple, widely available, relatively inexpensive, and generally
      reproducible marker to predict the CVD risk in subjects with CKD is needed.

      The Triglycerides (TG) to High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio is a feature of
      insulin resistance and an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. No study has been
      performed so far, to evaluate the role of TG/HDL ratio to predict the CVD risk in patients
      with CKD.

      This study is designed to evaluate the relationship between TG/HDL-C ratio and the
      endothelial functions in patients with CKD.
