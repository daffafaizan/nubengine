      of concussion. Data previously published shows potential benefit of certain vitamins in the
      management of migraine headache. These vitamins, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Magnesium,
      Co-Enzyme Q-10, and Omega-3 fatty acids, at dosages described in the literature, are being
      used based on the migraine literature findings and anecdotal evidence to help treat
      complaints of headache in concussion management.
