      included in the study. They will complete several questionnaires and a functional test.
      Spearman's correlation will be used to analyze associations between symptoms of CS and pain
      behavior, functioning, pain, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and illness perceptions.

      Additionally, a between-group analysis will be performed to compare patients with and without
      clinically relevant symptoms of CS.
