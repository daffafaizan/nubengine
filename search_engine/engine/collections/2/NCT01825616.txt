      skin when exposed to sunlight and is present in oil-rich fish such as salmon, mackerel, and
      herring. Mushrooms contain very little or any vitamin D2 but are abundant in ergosterol,
      which can be converted into vitamin D2 by ultraviolet (UV) illumination (Eur J Clin Nutr.
      2011;65:965-71).

      In recent decades, there has been increased awareness of the impact of vitamin D on muscle
      function (Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010;20:182-90). In the early 20th century, athletes and
      coaches felt that ultraviolet rays had a positive impact on athletic performance, and
      evidence is accumulating to support this view. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies
      support a functional role for vitamin D in muscle, and the discovery of the vitamin D
      receptor in muscle tissue provides a mechanistic pathway for understanding the role of
      vitamin D within muscle. Studies in athletes have found that vitamin D status is variable and
      is dependent on outdoor training time (during peak sunlight), skin color, and geographic
      location (Pediatr Clin North Am. 2010;57:849-61).

      25(OH)D is the best indicator and major form of vitamin D in the blood, with a circulating
      half-life of 2-3 weeks. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a plasma vitamin D [25(OH)D] level
      of less than 20 ng/ml, with vitamin D insufficiency defined as 21-29 ng/ml. Estimates are
      that 20-100% of children, young and middle-aged adults, and community-dwelling elderly men
      and women are vitamin D deficient (J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2011;96:1911-30).

      Purpose: To determine if 6 weeks supplementation with Dole Vitamin D Portobello Mushroom
      Powder (4,000 IU/day) can, 1) increase winter serum vitamin D levels, and measure whether
      vitamin D supplementation 2) has a chronic influence on muscle function and strength, and
      innate immune function, and 3) can attenuate exercise-induced muscle damage and delayed onset
      of muscle soreness (DOMS) in athletes.
