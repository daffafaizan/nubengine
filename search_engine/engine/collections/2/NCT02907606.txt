      peripheral blood, has shown great promise in lung cancer diagnosis and therapeutic
      monitoring.

      Urinary samples are completely non-invasive and easily obtainable compared to blood and
      tissue extraction. To date, only a limited number of published studies have examined the
      feasibility of ctDNA detection from urine.

      This study will collect tumor tissues, pretreatment peripheral blood samples and urine
      samples from different TNM stages of NSCLC patients, and detect EGFR gene mutations in paired
      samples.
