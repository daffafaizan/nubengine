      program for CP-741,952 was terminated on 15 March 2007. Primary reasons for program
      termination included a lack of significant efficacy at all doses investigated and an
      increased incidence of mild to moderate elevations in serum transaminases, primarily alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), and liver fat content, in treated compared to placebo subjects. A
      synopsis will be created and will include greater detail on these findings.
