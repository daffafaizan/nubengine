      To quantify the degree of sympathetic blockade in the upper limb in patients with end stage
      renal failure produced during a regional anaesthetic technique, using laser Doppler
      flowmetry.

      Hypothesis

      Regional anaesthesia of the upper limb results in blockade of motor and sensory nerves,
      providing surgical and post-operative analgesia. Sympathetic nerves are also blocked
      resulting in local vasodilatation. This may be of benefit in surgery where enhanced blood
      flow is beneficial such as arterio-venous fistula creation. The degree and duration of
      sympathetic blockade produced by regional blocks however, has never been quantified. This
      study aims to quantify sympathetic blockade by measuring the changes in skin blood flow and
      skin temperature after placement of a brachial plexus block.
