      been developed to modify the progression of AD. Therefore, it is important to manage vascular
      and metabolic risk factors, to eat healthy foods, to exercise, and to participate in social
      activities to prevent dementia. The FINGER study showed that the multi-domain intervention
      program is effective to prevent cognitive impairment and disability in elderly.

      In South Korea, exercise and leisure programs, and brain activity for the elderly also have
      been conducted in welfare centers and public health centers. However, there are not enough
      programs that have proven effective in the studies.

      So the investigators would like to develop a multi-domain intervention program and
      investigate applicability and efficacy before a large-scale randomized controlled trial.
