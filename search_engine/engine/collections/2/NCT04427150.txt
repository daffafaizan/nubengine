    
      Participants will sign an informed consent statement prior to arriving at the lab.
      Participants with ASD will be randomly assigned into either the auditory training group
      (Group 1) or the active control group (Group 2). Participants without ASD will be assigned to
      the typically developed group (Group 3). Groups 1 and 2 will complete all stages of the
      study, whereas Group 3 will only complete the pre-test stage.

      Pre-test: Researchers will assess participants' affective prosody recognition ability and
      psychoacoustic ability. The tests will be conducted in a sound attenuated lab located at Hong
      Kong Baptist University. The tests include an affective prosody recognition test, a pitch
      discrimination recognition test, a rapid auditory processing test, and a theory of mind test.

      Intervention Training: Participants will be required to partake in an intervention training
      program. The program will adopt training exercises provided by Posit Science - BrainHQ. The
      participants will be asked to complete a training session of 15-30 minutes each day for 8-12
      weeks, arriving at a total of at least 12 hours of training. The progress of intervention
      training will be closely monitored by the research team.

      Post-test: Participant will be asked to return to the lab for post-test assessment of the
      same tests, and complete an autism assessment (ADOS-2) conducted by a clinical psychologist
      and a non-verbal Intelligence test conducted by a trained researcher.

      Note: For ethical and fairness purposes, participants from Group 2 will be allowed to access
      the intervention training after Post-test.

      To encourage completion of the intervention training program, participants who successfully
      complete 12 hours of training will be offered a monetary reward as a token of appreciation.
