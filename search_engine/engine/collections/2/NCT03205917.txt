    
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-viral
      efficacy of the PGDM1400, PGT121 and VRC07-523LS mAbs for HIV prevention and therapy.
      PGDM1400, PGT121 and VRC07-523LS mAbs are recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies that
      target V1V2 (PGDM1400), a V3 glycan-dependent epitope (PGT121) and the CD4 binding site
      (VRC07-523LS) epitope region of the HIV envelope protein. PGT121, PGDM1400 and VRC07-523LS
      mAb were chosen for this study because of their potency, their ability to neutralize a wide
      array of cross-clade HIV viruses in a complementary pattern and their proven antiviral
      activity in animal studies e.g., their capacity to robustly prevent and treat simian-human
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in rhesus monkeys.
