      coherence tomography (pOCT) are non-invasive optical techniques, compatible with conventional
      diagnostic bronchoscopes and provide non-invasive, real-time information on the airway wall
      and the alveolar compartment. Therefore, immediate validation of optical measurements during
      a biopsy is possible. Optical techniques might either obviate the need for an tissue biopsy
      or improve the diagnostic yield of conventional biopsy methods and make surgical lung
      biopsies that are associated with high morbidity and costs redundant.

      Hypothesis: Novel optical techniques (pCLE and pOCT) provide real time information about the
      characteristics of the mucosa and/or the alveolar compartment in ILD.
