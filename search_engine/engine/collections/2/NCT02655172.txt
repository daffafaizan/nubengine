      laterality questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971), IQ test (IQ: PM38, Raven, 1960), and the PANSS
      (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Kay et al., 1987). Controls will only perform the
      laterality questionnaire. Then all will perform the affordance task, in which photographs of
      20 objects of everyday life, typically graspable with one hand, are presented in 4
      orientations. Participants have to respond in a graspable device, as quickly as possible, if
      the object is presented upright or inverted.
