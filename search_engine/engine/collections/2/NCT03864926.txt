    
      This is a single center randomized phase IV trial of comparing extended release Envarsus XR
      (study drug) once a day vs immediate release tacrolimus twice a day in a new kidney
      transplant recipients with delayed graft function (DGF). The primary study endpoint is the
      interval between first dialysis and last dialysis after kidney transplant (duration of DGF).
      The second end point is the number of tacrolimus or Envarsus XR dose adjustments required
      during the period of DGF.
