      this has not been adopted within obstetric practice internationally and does not feature
      within the NICE Intrapartum guideline.7 This is may be due to concerns with exposure of the
      fetus to iodine-based substances, concerns with vaginal staining and allergy to iodine.
      Iodine is an antibacterial agent, but becomes inactive by the presence of blood may limit its
      use.

      Chlorhexidine show greater reduction in skin flora after application compared with
      povidone-iodine agents (0.5 and 4%) respectively and has a greater residual activity after
      application than other preparations and (unlike povidone iodine) it is not inactivated by the
      presence of blood. Thus, there are a number of reasons to believe that vaginal cleansing with
      chlorhexidine would be an appropriate alternative to povidone iodine.8 There is one RCT
      comparing povidone iodine with chlorhexidine gluconate for vaginal cleansing at CS. This
      suggested that chlorhexidine may be superior, and further research was needed.9 Solutions
      that contain lower concentrations, such as chlorhexidine gluconate and acetate (0.05%) are
      usually well tolerated and may be used for vaginal preparation. With this preparation, there
      are no reported cases of allergy.8 Importantly, no safety concerns for the mother or baby
      have been identified with chlorhexidine gluconate used for vaginal cleansing.10
