      attributable to prostate cancer in the United States in 2010. Radiation treatment represents
      a commonly utilized method to treat prostate cancer with an excellent chance of controlling
      disease with biochemical control at 5-years in excess of 75% in men with locally confined but
      intermediate to high-risk disease. However, despite impressive biochemical control, local
      control remains a problem.

      Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:

        -  Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation

        -  Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity.

      Given the prevalence of PTEN deletion in high-risk prostate cancers as well as the evidence
      that tumor hypoxia leads to increased risks of failure after treatment with hormonal therapy
      and radiation, we hypothesis that inhibition of mTOR signaling in both tumor and vascular
      cells using everolimus concurrent with hormonal and radiation therapy will enhance the
      efficacy of radiation therapy without an unacceptable risk of toxicity in men with high-risk
      prostate cancer.

      Everolimus has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of prostate cancer by itself or
      in combination with radiation and hormonal therapy. It is not known if this combination is
      safe and effective in prostate cancer. The FDA has allowed their combined use in this
      clinical trial.
