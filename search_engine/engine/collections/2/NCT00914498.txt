      requirement for rapid and as painless as possible recovery is not only important for the
      general good reasons, but there is the newborn baby, who needs maternal care. Second, in many
      cases the operation recurs in the same site, which may involve higher level of post operative
      pain.

      Application of local anesthetics to the incision site have been tried for abdominal operation
      in several forms, ranging from pre-incision injection (1-6) through post incision injection
      (7 ) to indwelling catheter for protracted instillation (8-9). Where tried, these methods
      mostly contributed to the reduction of post operative pain and patients' satisfaction,
      although there is no consensus as to its efficacy. Yet, local, pre-incision injection of
      local anesthetics has not been tested for cesarean section.

      The above not withstanding, it has been proposed that local infiltration of tissue with
      xylocaine may interfere with wound healing (10-11). Others suggested possible benefit due to
      antimicrobial activity (12) Conversely, Al- Asfour et al. (13) found no effect of topical
      oral application of xylocaine on experimental wounds in rabbits. Interestingly, Drucker et
      al. found that less collagen was deposited in healing wounds that were infiltrated with
      xylocaine prior to incision, while the strength of the scar was not affected (14-15).

      Our proposed study will examine whether pre-incision infiltration of the skin cut site can
      attenuate post operative pain after a cesarean section. It will also examine possible effect
      of this infiltration of parameters of wound heeling and scar formation.
