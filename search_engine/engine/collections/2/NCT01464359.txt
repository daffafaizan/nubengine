      conditioning regimen followed (on day 0) by transplantation with double T-cell depleted (TCD)
      umbilical cord blood (UCB) units where the unit with fewer mononuclear cells (MNCs)/kg will
      be selected for overnight IL-2 activation prior to infusion. Beginning on day +3, post
      transplant IL-2 will be administered thrice weekly, not on consecutive days, for a total of 6
      doses to expand UCB derived progenitor cells. Post transplant immune suppression prophylaxis
      will not be administered with the intent to lessen toxicity and allow allogeneic NK cells to
      function longer providing better anti-leukemic therapy. However if either UCB unit has more
      than 5% T-cells, the patient will not receive either course of IL-2. Beginning on day +60
      after transplantation, a second course of IL-2 will be administered thrice weekly, not on
      consecutive days, for a total of 6 doses with the purpose of enhancing the in vivo expansion
      and education of NK cells derived from engrafting UCB cells.
