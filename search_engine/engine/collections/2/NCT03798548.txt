      associated with increased cardiac morbidity and decreased functional status. Cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective intervention to treat these
      symptoms after cardiac surgery, but has not yet been studied in patients undergoing less
      invasive cardiac procedures such as Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). This study
      will examine the effect of CBT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients undergoing
      TAVR.

      The CBT protocol was loosely structured on the Managing Depression and Anxiety using
      Education and Skills (MADES) protocol described in Dao and colleagues (2011). The current
      intervention was designed to address the needs of individuals who may develop anxiety or
      depression symptoms post-TAVR. The CBT intervention consisted of four 30 to 60-minute bedside
      treatment sessions with a trained clinician while the participant was hospitalized for TAVR.

      Main outcome measures were self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety as measured by
      the Beck Depression Inventory-II and State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y1. Secondary
      outcomes included health related quality of life and hospital length of stay.
