      respiratory morbidities in preterm neonates before 34 weeks of gestations. Recently, it has
      been suggested that ACS may be also effective for reduction of respiratory complications in
      singleton late preterm pregnancies. On the contrary, there is a paucity of information
      regarding the effectiveness of ACS in twin neonates with late preterm birth, and nowadays
      guidelines are recommending the use of ACS in twin pregnancies based on the evidences in
      singleton pregnancies. However, the effect of ACS in twin needs to be determined, because the
      rate of neonatal morbidities in twin preterm neonates seems to be different from that in
      singleton neonates. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of ACS in late preterm
      twin neonates.
