      used off-label but can have intolerable side effects. We examined the biological activity and
      safety of recombinant human prolactin (r-hPRL) as preliminary data for its use to augment
      lactation. Healthy, non-postpartum women (n=21) with regular menstrual cycles underwent a 7
      day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of r-hPRL. Galactorrhea, markers of
      bone turnover, calcium homeostasis and gonadal function were measured and side effects
      recorded.
