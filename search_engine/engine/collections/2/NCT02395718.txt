      now centralised at fewer hospitals, thus the ED now serve as the single point of entry for
      all acute patients. Another initiative, has been the establishment of a Quick Diagnostic Unit
      (QDU) as a subunit in the ED. The QDU is a ward for fast track diagnostics and treatment of
      stable medical patients that is believed to optimise in-hospital care by quicker diagnosis
      and shorter hospitalisations, and minimise time for patients to return to their habitual
      health status. However, little evidence exists on the putative benefits for elderly patients
      treated in a QDU setting.

      In this study, we will examine the benefits and drawbacks of treatment of elderly medical
      patients (â‰¥75 years) in an acute treatment system with the possibility of fast-track
      admission and treatment, rather than treatment in the traditional medical system. We will
      randomise patients to treatment in either a fast track ward/short stay unit, the QDU, or to
      standard treatment at the Dept. of Internal Medicine (DIM).

      We hypothesise that treatment in a QDU compared to DIM offers optimised care through
      immediate access to clinical staff and rapid diagnostic facilities, treatment and quicker
      rehabilitation.
