      I. To estimate the 1-year progression-free survival rate in patients with advanced stage
      diffuse large B-cell NHL treated with CHOP - rituximab - bevacizumab.

      II. To estimate the response rate (complete, complete unconfirmed, and partial) and 2-year
      progression-free survival of this regimen in patients with advanced stage diffuse large
      B-cell NHL.

      III. To evaluate the toxicities associated with this regimen. IV. To correlate angiogenic
      biomarkers with patient outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV over 15
      minutes, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on day 1. Patients also receive oral prednisone
      on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 6 months for 2
      years and then annually for 3 years.
