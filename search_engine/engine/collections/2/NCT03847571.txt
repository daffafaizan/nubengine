    
      Bartter syndrome is a hereditary salt-loosing tubulopathy caused by several gene mutations
      encoding the sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, with poor
      response to treatment. The effects of inhibition of proximal tubular reabsorption of
      bicarbonate by acetazolamide have not been previously studied in Batter patients.

      The present study is designed to assess he efficacy and safety of acetazolamide for the
      management of children with Bartter syndrome. The primary end point is change in polyuria,
      hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

      In this prospective observational crossover clinical trial, patients between ages 1 and 10
      years with clinical diagnosis of Bartter syndrome (hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, normal
      blood pressure, elevated urine chloride >20 milliequivalent per liter, high serum aldosterone
      and plasma renin levels) will be enrolled in a 4- week clinical trial. After initial clinical
      and laboratory evaluations, patients will receive acetazolamide 5.0 mg/kg orally as a single
      daily dose and each patient will act as his/her own control. Renal electrolyte and 24-hour
      urine output will be measured at baseline and after the 4 weeks acetazolamide treatment.
