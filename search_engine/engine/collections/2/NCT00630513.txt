      performed in the Department of Transplant, General and Emergency Surgery of St
      Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital (Bologna, Italy), a large teaching institution, with the
      participation of all surgeons who accept to be involved in.

      The study is designed and conducted in compliance with the principles of Good Clinical
      Practice regulations.

      The tolerability and efficacy of a 3 days treatment with Ampicillin- Sulbactam (AS 3g x 3/
      day i.v.) is compared a 3 days regimen with Ertapenem (1 g/day i.v.). in patients with
      localized peritonitis with a blinded evaluation of efficacy end points. Evaluation of cure or
      failure is blinded by use of designated third party individuals who are unaware of the
      treatment assigned to the patients.
