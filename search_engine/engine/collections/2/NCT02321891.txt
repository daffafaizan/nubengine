      stimulation (tDCS) stimulation protocols in the treatment of anxiety in an open-label pilot
      study in patients with chronic pain. The investigators also seek to detect autonomic nervous
      system changes induced by the tDCS, and develop new methods for the measurement of autonomic
      nervous system functions.
