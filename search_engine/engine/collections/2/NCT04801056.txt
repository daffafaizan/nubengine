    
      TB006, a monoclonal antibody, is an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent that reduces
      the severity of underlying diseases in COVID-19 patients. The primary objective of TB006
      treatment is to decrease the potential acute severe deterioration in outpatient COVID-19
      patients with underlying diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. TB006 has been
      developed to treat the ambulatory patients with diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 who are
      considered at high risk for severe disease or hospitalization. The preferred population
      includes patients with elevated cytokines (e.g., IL-6) at baseline and patients with
      underlying diseases at baseline including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases (such as
      hypertension), and cancer.

      In the single ascending dose study, the dosages of 10 mg/kg ~ 50 mg/kg will be investigated
      in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, and will be administered to patients over 60
      minutes after dilution in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) to a final
      volume of 250 mL. The primary objective of the SAD study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of single ascending doses of TB006 vs placebo administered via i.v. infusion in
      outpatient patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and to determine the dose recommended for
      Phase Ib study.
