      three groups,including premenopausal nullipara, premenopausal women with childbirth and
      postmenopausal women. The pelvic floor muscle function in three groups are evaluated. The
      modified Oxford Grading Scale and Levator ani testing is used to quantify PFM strength
      through vaginal palpation. Pelvic floor muscle strength ,endurance, repetition,vaginal
      contraction pressure and the knack test are evaluated using a PHENIX USB 8 neuromuscular
      stimulation therapy system (Company: Vivaltis-Electronic Concept Lignon Innovation,
      Montpellier, France). In six different regions of China according to geographic region
      (northwest, southwest, north, east, northeast, and central-south China) , 1 or more hospitals
      in each area are selected as sub-centers, which needs to complete the evaluation of pelvic
      floor muscle function of 360 cases in 3 groups totally.
