      often unnecessarily restricted of physical activities or avoid exercise due to the unpleasant
      experience of exercise-induced dyspnea. As a consequence both children and adults with asthma
      are less fit than their peers. Like in healthy individuals, regular training supports health
      in asthmatics. In short-term training programs improvements of physical capabilities have
      been achieved in children and young adults with asthma. Programs of longer durations than 3
      months have not been published in controlled trials. Effects of exercise training on quality
      of life in adult asthmatics are lacking.
