      resistance, insufficient insulin secretory capacity and low grade systemic inflammation.
      Results of recent animal experiments suggest that ingestion of probiotics not only influences
      gut microbiota composition and intestinal permeability but also secretion of GLP-2 as well as
      insulin resistance, components of metabolic syndrome and diabetes development. GLP-2
      secretion has been suggested to be a key mediator of probiotic effects mediating decreased
      intestine permeability through binding to intestinal GLP2 receptor in animal studies.
      Insulinotropic GLP-1, which is reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes, has also been
      described to be influenced by gut microbiota composition. We aim to test the hypothesis that
      Lactobacillus Reuteri-enriched microbiota improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance
      in obese healthy and obese type 2 diabetes patients by improving gut hormone secretion. In a
      prospective, double-blinded, placebo controlled randomized 10 weeks trial we aim to
      investigate metabolic and immunological changes related to modified gut microbiota by
      analysing (1) gut hormone secretion, (2) insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and (3)
      systemic LPS concentrations and immune status.
