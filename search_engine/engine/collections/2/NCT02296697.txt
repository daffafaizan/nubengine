      proven efficacy, it's a long-term healing process. Among Physiotherapy resources available
      for pressure ulcers treatment, the most used are low-level laser therapy and high-frequency
      generator. Even though the individual effects of both are evidenced on literature, there are
      no randomized clinical trials evidencing the effects of low-level laser therapy and
      high-frequency generator in comparison to wound dressing on pressure ulcers treatment.
