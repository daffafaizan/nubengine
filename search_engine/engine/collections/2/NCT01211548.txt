      randomized controlled trial designed to determine the cost effectiveness of an algorithm for
      pre operative cardiac risk stratification that uses coronary CT angiography. In addition
      perioperative and long-term cardiac event rate will be recorded to determine if there is any
      difference in these rates between the 2 groups.
