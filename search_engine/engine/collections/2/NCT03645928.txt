    
      LN-144 (Lifileucel)/LN-145/LN-145-S1 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an
      autologous TIL for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma,
      advanced, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The adoptive cell transfer therapy used in
      this study involves patients receiving a nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion regimen,
      followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
      Patients in Cohorts 1A, 2A, 3A and 3C will receive TIL plus checkpoint inhibitors. Patients
      in Cohorts 1B, 1C, and 3B will receive autologous TIL as a single therapy.
