      For dystonic patients who have failed medical therapy, stereotactic deep brain stimulation
      (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) or subthalamic nucleus (STN) can provide
      significant symptom improvement, but it is not known which site provides maximum benefit or
      the physiologic mechanisms by which these improvements may occur. The study goals are to
      determine if DBS of Gpi or STN provides significant clinical improvement in patients with
      primary generalized dystonia, whether the anatomic DBS site (if either) provides optimal
      improvement, and to gain deeper insight into the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Adult and pediatric patients with medically refractory primary generalized dystonia will
      make-up the study population. Patients with primary generalized dystonia suffer a wide range
      of symptoms including physical deformity, speech difficulties, swallowing dysfunction, visual
      problems, and intractable pain, which can result in an inability to care for themselves.
      Moreover, pediatric primary generalized dystonia patients will often have abnormal skeletal
      development (scoliosis) resulting from the abnormal forces placed on the skeleton by dystonic
      muscle contractions.

      DESIGN:

      We propose placing DBS electrodes (using microelectrode guidance) bilaterally into either the
      Gpi or STN of medically refractory dystonia patients. Physiological studies will be performed
      and compared with clinical changes to understand the mechanism of action of DBS and
      underlying pathophysiology of dystonia.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Clinical effectiveness of DBS of the Gpi or STN will be measured by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden
      Scale (BFM) and monitored over time to determine the effectiveness of DBS and if there is an
      ideal anatomic stimulation site. Electrophysiologic outcome measures will be obtained to
      determine the underlying pathophysiology of dystonia, and the mechanism of action of DBS.
