      productivity (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and depression). Women who met screening
      criteria were randomized to one of two treatment groups: either neuropsychological testing
      and phone feedback to review findings and tailored recommendations (standard-care treatment);
      or neuropsychological testing, in-person feedback, and two calls from a care-coordinator
      (experimental treatment). Adherence to recommendations and employment status at one year are
      evaluated. Follow-up periods also occur at year two and year three.
