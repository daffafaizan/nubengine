      Primary

        -  Evaluate the effects of nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid on aberrant cryptic
           foci (ACF) in patients at high risk for colon cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the presence or absence of ACF in these patients.

        -  Determine the expression of PGE2, COX-1, COX-2, NF-kB, and β-catenin in colon tissue.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of long-term nitric oxide-releasing
           acetylsalicyclic acid in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study. Patients are stratified according to gender and race (black vs non-Hispanic white vs
      Hispanic white vs Asian). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily
           for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily for 6
           months at a higher dose than in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months. Patients undergo
           sigmoidoscopies at baseline and at the completion of study treatment. Biopsies of
           aberrant cryptic foci (ACF) and non-ACF sites are collected at both sigmoidoscopies.
           Tissue is examined for biomarkers (PGE_2, COX, NF-kB, β-catenin).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study.
