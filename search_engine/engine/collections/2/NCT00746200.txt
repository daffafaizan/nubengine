      constipation is still a common problem in general population. Because the symptoms cause
      serious impairment of life quality, laxatives are commonly prescribed for people and over
      prescribing of laxatives is also common. Despite the large sums spent on laxatives, there
      have been few advances in laxative treatment in the last 50 years and there have been minimal
      research addressing the problem.

      Since there is unsatisfactory effect by current pharmacologic therapies and preventive
      strategies, we look forward to the practice of traditional Chinese medicine, which had
      abundant clinical experiences and medical records in the past of thousands years ago.
      Therefore we aim to do the research to create the evidence of acupuncture on the safety,
      efficacy and quality of life for chronic constipation.
