      contraindications to MRI and allergies to either regadenoson or gadolinium contrast, will be
      enrolled over 10 months. Patients will be recruited from UC San Diego and San Diego Veterans
      Affairs. The investigators will specifically enroll patients with nonspecific allograft
      dysfunction and patients with normal graft function.

      Brief protocol:

      Cardiac MRI is performed. Cine images in standard views are obtained. T2 mapping sequences
      are performed on short axis images. For stress imaging, intravenous regadenoson is given as a
      0.4 mg bolus followed by a 5 mL saline flush. After 30 seconds, short-axis images are
      acquired for 30 consecutive heartbeats with administration of gadolinium. Rest imaging is
      performed 30 minutes after stress imaging. Lastly, late gadolinium enhancement images are
      obtained in standard views. Images are analyzed offline by a blinded independent reader.
      Patients will be followed for one month after enrollment for MACE.
