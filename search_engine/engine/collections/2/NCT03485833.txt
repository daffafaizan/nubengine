    
      Patients with hypotension after anesthetic induction for cardiac surgery, who requires fluid
      resuscitation based on clinical judgement by the anesthesiologists are enrolled in this
      study. Patients are monitored by transesophageal echocardiography and FloTrac/Vigileo.
      Hemodynamic variables (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean
      artery pressure, central venous pressure, stroke volume variation, cardiac index, velocity
      time integral of the aorta etc) are measured at baseline, after end-expiratory occlusion
      (EEO) test, after end-inspiratory occlusion (EIO) test, after passive legs raising test, and
      after fluid challenge respectively. Responders are defined by an increase in velocity time
      integral over 15% after infusion of 5ml/kg of crystalloid solution.
