      measures of peak alpha frequency might provide a means of pain assessment. In healthy
      subjects, increased peak alpha frequency is strongly correlated with pain self-reports after
      exposure to acute noxious heat. Conversely, chronic pain patients compared to healthy control
      display decreased peak alpha frequencies higher in alpha power. Measures of peak alpha
      frequency also show a negative relationship with disease duration, suggesting that peak alpha
      frequency may not only index ongoing pain but also disease progression. The overall aim is to
      determine the predictive accuracy, reliability, and specificity of EEG alpha activity in
      acute pain and a model of neuropathic pain in healthy subjects.
