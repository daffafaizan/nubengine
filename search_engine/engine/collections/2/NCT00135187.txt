      effective, with partial response rates in ~40-60% range and tolerable toxicity. A recent
      study showed that substituting Doxil for Doxorubicin in a regimen similar to VAD (DVd)
      resulted in an improved toxicity profile and similar efficacy. The most active agents in VAD
      (and presumably in DVd) are Doxorubicin (or Doxil) and Dexamethasone, while Vincristine adds
      little, if at all to the efficacy of these regimen(s). One of the new active agents in
      multiple myeloma is VELCADE (bortezomib, formerly known as VELCADE). This molecule has a
      novel mechanism of action by specifically inhibiting the proteasome. A recently reported
      Phase II trial showed that VELCADE as a single agent induced at least minimal responses (i.e.
      > 25% reduction in monoclonal protein) in 35% of patients and at least a stabilization of the
      disease in 59% of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma using strict SWOG
      criteria. An additional 18% responded when Dexamethasone was added to VELCADE. Pre-clinical
      observations showed that the addition of VELCADE to other chemotherapeutic agents, such as
      doxorubicin, enhances cytotoxicity of multiple myeloma cells. Preliminary results from Phase
      I study of combination of VELCADE with Doxil showed 60% response rate (i.e. > partial
      response) with acceptable toxicity. In this study we propose to combine three active agents,
      i.e. Doxil, Dexamethasone (two most active agents from DVd), and VELCADE. The ultimate goal
      is to show that this combination of drugs is more efficacious than VAD or VELCADE with either
      Dexamethasone or Doxil and without additional toxicity.
