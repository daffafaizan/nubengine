      atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and stinging insect allergy are exceedingly common in the
      pediatric population. The impact that these disorders have on health, educational and social
      activities and costs of medical care are profound and widespread. In order to understand
      disease and improve therapy, the study of pediatric allergy is justifiably an important
      health priority and the goal of this protocol. This purpose will be fostered through the
      following objectives: 1) To gather a database of clinical and immunological data and to
      better clinically and immunologically characterize disease onset, progression and remittance
      of these disorders; 2) to foster collaborative studies in pediatric allergic disease with
      other institutions and 3) to provide a cohort of pediatric patients for residents in the NIH
      Clinical Center/NIAID Allergy and Immunology training program. Up to 500 new patients will be
      enrolled to attain these goals. Patients will undergo screening history, physical
      examination, and clinical laboratory evaluation according to the standard of practice in the
      community. Although imaging studies and tissue biopsies will be performed only when
      clinically indicated, blood samples for cellular and biochemical studies may be collected for
      research purposes. Treatment plans will be individualized for each patient and the number and
      length of additional visits and diagnostic evaluations will vary accordingly. Standard
      immunotherapy for allergic disease may be offered. Through the assessment, analysis, and
      treatment of a large cohort of patients, we will better understand disease manifestations,
      trends, outcomes, and mechanisms of pediatric allergy and lay the groundwork for discovery of
      new therapeutic modalities.
