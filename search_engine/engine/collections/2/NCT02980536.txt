      biopsy genotype assay and Circulating Single-Molecule Amplification and Resequencing
      Technology (cSMART) liquid biopsy. those patients who carry EGFR activating mutation and
      other TKI targeted activating mutation will receive TKI treatment. During the TKI treatment,
      every patients will take liquid biopsy assay to monitor the mutation status. the study will
      be ended when all the patients had a progressive disease (PD) in their targeted lesion
