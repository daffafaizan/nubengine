      simultaneous radiographs. It provides researchers with three dimensional motion analyses to
      look not only at routine flexion/extension, but also other rotational and translational
      changes. The measurement accuracy offered by this technique far exceeds the manual techniques
      currently used. Utilization of the RSA technology at the IHP and the United States is in its
      infancy. The investigators have placed much effort over the past 2-3 years to put the
      necessary dedicated resources and personnel in place. This has been a collaborative effort
      between the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and the Imaging Core at IHP. Preliminary work on
      the accuracy, reliability, and surgical planning for use of RSA has been completed and
      presented at national conferences.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of motion in the lumbar spine in patients
      with the AST Stabilimax BAR. The AST Stabilimax BAR is designed to allow for motion in the
      spine while providing the necessary stability to the spinal segment. The amount and degree of
      this motion is currently unknown clinically, but has been biomechanically tested in vitro. By
      using tantalum bead markers placed in the spine at the time of the surgery, RSA analysis can
      determine the amount and degree of motion the implant provides. Two questions will be
      examined with this data: 1) what is the amount of sagittal and coronal plane motion that
      occurs in vivo with the AST Stabilimax BAR system? and 2) will this change over the 2 year
      time frame for this study?
