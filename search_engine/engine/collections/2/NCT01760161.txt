      dual transversus abdominis plane block containing either ropivacain or isotonic potassium
      chloride.

      The investigators will record pain-score, opioid-consumption and sensibility on the abdominal
      wall in the postoperative periode.

      Also a blood sample will be taken at 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes after the block in order
      to measure the plasma-level of ropivacain after bilateral dual transversus abdominis plane
      block.

      The investigators assume that there will be significant effect on postoperative pain and that
      the level of plasma-ropivacain will be acceptable.
