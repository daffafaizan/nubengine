    
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is endemic in the New World from approximately the US-Mexican
      border through Central America and the Northern part of South America down to the level of
      Rio de Janeiro.

      L braziliensis CL is perhaps the most important of these diseases, since its natural cure
      rate is low and it may metastasize, and our group has been evaluating therapies for L
      braziliensis in Bolivia for some time.

      In recent studies at investigator's Bolivian site for the years 2013-2016, the cure rate for
      L braziliensis CL has been 70%-80% for standard systemic and local therapies. Systemic agents
      intramuscular pentavalent antimony cured 80% (114 of 143) and oral miltefosine cured 81% (47
      of 58). Local injections with pentamidine cured 72% (43 of 60); intralesional antimony cured
      70% (21 of 30). In contrast, cryotherapy was ineffective [20% (4 of 20) cured and placebo
      creams cured 17% (5 of 30) in one report and 10% more recently.

      Investigator's have recently evaluated treatment with topical paromomycin cream.
      Paromomycin-in-Aquaphilic had a cure rate of 77.5% (31 of 40 patients) compared to a cure
      rate of only 10% (2 of 20 patients) for the Aquaphilic vehicle alone. This remarkably high
      cure rate, combined with essentially no adverse events (both Paromomycin-Aquaphilic and
      Aquaphilic vehicle had only grade 1 adverse reactions in 5-10% of patients), makes
      Paromomycin-Aquaphilic very attractive for Bolivian CL.

      It would benefit patients if cure rates could be consistently >90%. Since all the individual
      therapies, whether systemic, local injections, or local cream, have an approximately 75% cure
      rate, we propose testing a combination of two treatment. The most attractive systemic therapy
      is the only oral agent, miltefosine, and the most attractive local therapy is simple
      application of Paromomycin cream. Thus the present protocol proposes to evaluate the efficacy
      of miltefosine, 2.5 mg/kg (50 mg tid) for 28 days, plus Paromomycin-Aquaphilic daily for 28
      days. The controls will be the two components of this combination used separately:
      miltefosine alone, Paromomycin-Aquaphilic alone.
