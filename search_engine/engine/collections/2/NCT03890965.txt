      a sitting position in a conventional chair, an unorthodox posture in the usual treatment of
      Vojta therapy.

      Description of the sitting posture: the back in axial extension with the shoulders located in
      front of the hips.

      The elbows must be supported with the medial epicondyl in contact on a table, whose height is
      at the level of the end of the patient's sternum.

      The forearms are placed prone with the palms facing the surface. In this position we place a
      rubber sphere 3 centimeters in diameter under the pisiform of one of the patient's wrists.

      The reflex stimulation is performed by the passive pressure exerted by the weight of the
      wrist (pisiform) on the rubber sphere. Simultaneously the patient has to exert a slight
      pressure with the heel towards the ground with his foot. This foot will be the opposite of
      the wrist that has the sphere under the pisiform.

      It is a cross-stimulation, that is, pisiform in one hand together with the load in the heel
      of the opposite side.

      Alternating each diagonal 4 times, 5 minutes each. Total session 20 minutes, 2 times per day,
      every day according to degree of affectation

      The duration of the study will depend on the degree of involvement: mild 2 weeks, moderate 3
      months.
