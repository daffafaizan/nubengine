      tested a variety of psychosocial interventions with youth that yield only modest short-term
      benefits. One potential way to improve treatments is to augment psychosocial interventions
      with pharmacotherapy. The National Institutes of Health has mounted a concerted effort to
      identify medications that reduce drinking for nearly three decades. Although this effort
      improved treatment for adults, no medication is indicated for adolescent use and randomized
      controlled trials with teenagers are almost nonexistent. This gap raises key questions about
      whether and how medications could benefit youth. Optimizing treatment options for youth
      requires closing this important gap. Lamotrigine is safe with adolescents and does not
      adversely interact with alcohol. Lamotrigine targets brain mechanisms implicated in alcohol
      use disorder, and it has shown to help treat adults with alcohol problems. Yet, despite its
      widespread use with children and adolescents, no published double-blind, placebo-controlled
      studies have examined the effects of lamotrigine on drinking-related behavior in youth. The
      purpose of this study is to determine how well teenagers accept lamotrigine plus alcohol
      education to reduce adolescent alcohol use. This study will also tell us whether teenagers'
      alcohol use, craving, and enjoyment of drinking are reduced by lamotrigine.
