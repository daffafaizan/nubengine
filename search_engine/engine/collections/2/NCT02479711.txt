    
      35 patients at 12-year-old, who have a matched pair of permanent molars with an approximal
      and /or occlusal carious lesion of similar size will be included.

      split -mouth design for the two restorative materials will be used. After removing the
      carious each patient will receive two restorations following the taking impressions to
      determine the cavity size.

      One of the two materials will be Equia (GC Europe N.V., Leuven , Belgium), a high viscosity
      glass ionomer cement and the second material used will be Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill composite
      (IvoClar Vivadent), along with a dentin bonding system (AdheSe One F, Ivoclar Vivadent,
      Lichtenstein).

      The dentist will randomly select the restorative material to be placed. The dentist will mix
      and handle the materials, in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions.

      The clinician will use a matrix to maintain tight adaptation of the restorations.

      The clinician will take impressions after the first setting reactions of the materials are
      done to determine the wear of the restorative materials.

      Two blinded examiners who were not involved in the placement of the restorations will
      evaluate the restorations at six, 12 and 24 months.

      Impressions will be repeated at 12 and 24 months intervals. The examiners will use the U.S
      Public Health Service (USPHS) Ryge criteria to evaluate the restorations.

      Wear analysis will be performed with a 3 dimensional laser scanning device (Laserscan 3D,
      Willytec, Germany) by scanning the cast models.

      The data will be analyzed using statistical software (SPSS 13.0, SPSS, Chicago). Cumulative
      survival rates will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and long-rank-test.
