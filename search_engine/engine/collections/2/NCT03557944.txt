      the intervention following baseline data collection. Initial baseline data collection from
      the patient will include information on demographics, medications, and illness
      characteristics. The patient will then attend an appointment with a pharmacist to review
      medications appropriate for discontinuation/dose reduction, after which the patient will meet
      with their family physician to discuss patient preferences for discontinuation/dose
      reduction. Both health care providers will have access to TaperMD, a web-based program linked
      to evidence and tools to support reduction in polypharmacy. Follow-up research assessments
      will take place at one week, 3 months and 6 months (study end). Outcome assessments and a
      semi-structured interview will take place at the 6 month appointment.
