      endoscopes, an oral bite is used to protect the examination instruments and patients. During
      sedated endoscopic examinations, the patients are under influence of anesthetics. Upper
      airway obstruction often occurred due to respiratory depression and airway collapse resulting
      in desaturation. Airway management with high percentage oxygen, jaw thrust, or insertion of
      nasal airways by trained anesthetic personnel is required during upper airway obstruction
      emergencies. Nasal airway is invasive and causes nasal bleeding, sinusitis and other
      problems. Jaw thrust and bag-mask ventilation requires training and is a burden to anesthetic
      personnel to perform. Oxygenation and capnography are important ventilatory monitors during
      sedative procedures. These are often influenced by open mouth breathing during upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations making oxygenation and capnographic measurements
      unreliable. In this study, we group the patients into A group using standard of care, B group
      using mandibular advancement oral bite and C group using high-flow nasal cannulas. After
      anesthetic induction, gastric endoscopy will be performed. Oxygenation, end-tidal carbon
      dioxide, and degree of upper airway obstruction will be evaluated and recorded. Differences
      between the groups will be evaluated.
