      effects on patients with acute respiratory failure. Lung injury results from excessive
      mechanical stress and strain applied to the lung by the ventilator and/or respiratory
      muscles, while diaphragm injury results from either insufficient or excessive inspiratory
      effort.

      The objective of this study is to investigate a new LDPV strategy designed to prevent both
      disuse-mediated and load-induced diaphragm injury, while also preventing excess global and
      regional mechanical stress and strain in the injured lung. To achieve these goals, the
      following specific targets to be met are: (1) respiratory muscle effort similar to that of
      healthy subjects breathing at rest, (2) lung stress within safe limits, and (3) clinically
      acceptable gas exchange.

      Targets are assessed through measurements of global lung stress, tidal recruitment,
      inspiratory effort, diaphragm contractile effort and adequacy of respiratory muscle and
      systemic tissue perfusion. Measurements commence at enrollment and continue for 24 hours
      consecutively.
