    
      This is a Phase II, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, dose-ranging study
      of the antimalarial activity and safety of 3 (50, 100, and 200 mg) RBx 11160 dose levels
      administered as a single dose orally for 7 consecutive days in patients with acute
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (mono-infection).

      At least 255 patients will be randomized at 4 study sites in South East Asia, India and
      Africa. Each investigational site will enroll between 60 and 90 patients to yield
      approximately 65 "per protocol" patients in each treatment arm . Patients will be randomized
      to 1 of 3 dose groups. Patients will be administered RBx 11160 with matching placebo tablets
      as required to maintain the study blind.

      The study is divided into 3 main periods including the Pre-Treatment Period (Screening/Day
      0), the Treatment Period (Days 0 through 6; Day 0 is the first day of study medication
      dosing), and the Post-Treatment Period (Day 14 +/- 1 day; Day 21 +/- 1 day; and Day 28 +/- 2
      days).

      Patient participation will be for at least 28 (Â± 2) days following the first dose of study
      medication. Patients will be hospitalized for at least 4 days (Days 0, 1, 2, and 3), but may
      remain in the hospital or live in the vicinity of the study site for the study duration. If a
      patient is discharged from the hospital on Day 3, he/she will return to the study site or an
      authorized study staff member will visit the patient on Days 4 and 5 to administer study
      medication and perform indicated assessments. The patient will return to the study site for
      study visits on Days 6 (last dose of study medication administration), 14, 21, and 28.

      If adverse events reported during the study are unresolved by Day 28, patients will be
      followed for an additional 30 days or until resolution of the event or determination that no
      further medical management is deemed necessary. Similarly, the investigator will instruct the
      patient to return to the study site if any untoward event occurs within 30 days of completing
      study medication.
