    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active controlled
      comparative study of the safety and efficacy of 2 dosing regimens of FV-100 versus
      valacyclovir administered for 7 days in subjects with uncomplicated AHZ(acute herpes zoster).
      Subjects diagnosed with uncomplicated AHZ within 72 hours of lesion appearance and worst pain
      of 4 or greater at day 1, will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of three treatment groups and
      will begin study treatment at the Day 1 visit(within 72 hours of AHZ lesion appearance) to
      either: 1. FV-100 400mg QD, 2. FV-100 400mg BID(total daily dose of 800mg), or 3.
      Valacyclovir 1000mg 3 times a day for a total daily dose of 3000mg. Subjects will be
      monitored for adverse events through day 21. Efficacy assessments for lesion status and AHZ
      pain are captured til day 120.
