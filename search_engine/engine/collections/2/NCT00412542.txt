      to decrease the blood supply in the tumor and make it unable to grow. CPT-11 is a drug that
      was designed to stop cancer cells from dividing.

      All participants will take thalidomide capsules by mouth every evening at bedtime. You will
      begin with 1 capsule every night for the first week then increase to 2 capsules every night
      for a week and then 3 capsules a night for the third week. After that, you will increase the
      dose to 4 capsules each night for the rest of the study. The dosages may be adjusted if you
      experience any severe side effects.

      In addition to thalidomide, you will receive treatment with CPT-11 through a continuous
      injection into a vein over 90 minutes once a week for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest
      from the drug. This 6 week period is called a course of therapy. The courses of therapy will
      be repeated as long as the disease is responding to treatment for up to 2 years.

      THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY. Both drugs are commercially available. Thalidomide and
      CPT-11 are FDA approved for the treatment of some cancers. The combination of these drugs is
      investigational.

      Up to 78 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
