      motor neurons. ALS symptoms are characterized by stiffness, muscle twitching, and worsening
      weakness due to muscle breakdown. Onset of symptoms are typically arm or leg weakness or
      difficulty speaking or swallowing and gradual development of overall body weakness. The cause
      is unknown and there is no cure for ALS.

      Poly MVA is a dietary supplement which contains a uniquely formulated combination of
      minerals, vitamins, and amino acids designed to promote cellular energy production. The
      active molecule in this supplement is Palladium Lipoic Acid (PdLA) complex. This compound is
      synthesized using a process whereby palladium (a rare metal, which is found in the food
      chain- we consume approximately 2 ng/day is chemically bound to alpha lipoic acid, a powerful
      anti-oxidant involved in cellular energy.

      Poly MVA was found to substantially lower fatigue and improve quality of life in a pilot
      study of patients with varied medical disorders. The reduction in fatigue was also observed
      in a small series of patients enrolled in an open label study for patients with gliomas.

      Specific Aim 1: To test the efficacy of PolyMVA as a treatment for ALS fatigue.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the specificity of the fatigue reducing effect of Poly-MVA by
      controlling for mood, disease severity, and cognitive status

      This is an open-label, prospective study which evaluates the response of 4 teaspoons of Poly
      MVA taken daily, over a 24-Week interval.
