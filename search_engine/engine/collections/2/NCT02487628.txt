      comprised of the silk fibroin protein of the Bombyx mori (B. mori) silkworm. The porous
      network structure makes it soft and pliable and convenient to implant. The mesh is
      mechanically strong, biocompatible, and long-term bioresorbable. The pore size is suitable
      for macrophage migration and recruitment, which hinders bacteria growth. The mesh is provided
      in single sheets of varying widths and lengths and may be cut to the shape or size desired
      for a specific application. It is sterile and for single-patient use only.

      ULTRAPRO® Partially Absorbable Lightweight Mesh (Ethicon, Inc.) is manufactured from
      approximately equal parts of absorbable poliglecaprone-25 monofilament fiber and
      non-absorbable polypropylene monofilament fiber. Designed for open and laparoscopic hernia
      repairs, it allows surgeons the versatility to perform various hernia repairs with a single
      technology. It offers excellent strength with minimal foreign body mass, to allow patients to
      heal more naturally with increased comfort and mobility.
