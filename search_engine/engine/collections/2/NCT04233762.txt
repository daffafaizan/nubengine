      (Visits 1) - For All Subjects. Eligible subjects will be identified during the initial
      screening procedures with measures of spirometry, hyperresponsiveness to methacholine,
      complete history, physical examination, allergen skin test, and capsaicin cough challenge.
      For female subjects, this visit will occur during Day 1-5 (follicular phase) of the menstrual
      cycle. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized to Sequence A or Sequence
      B.

      Sequence A will require Visit 2 to occur during menstrual cycle days 1-5 (follicular phase)
      and Visit 3 to occur during menstrual cycle days 21 - 25 (luteal phase).

      Sequence B will require Visit 2 to occur during menstrual cycle days 21-25 (luteal phase) and
      Visit 3 to occur during menstrual cycle days 1 - 5 (follicular phase).

      During Visit 2 and 3 subjects will undergo measures of spirometry, hyperresponsiveness to
      methacholine, capsaicin cough challenge, allergen skin test, sputum and blood collection.

      Visit Windows Each visit must be separated by a minimum of 24 hours. Study visits can be
      performed in the morning or afternoon, however for each subject the timing should be
      consistent with Visit 1 at the same time of day Â± 2 hours.
