      Major bioactive sphingolipids include ceramide, dihydroceramide, sphingosine,
      sphingosine-1-phosphate and sphingomyelin.

      Sphingoliplids are involved in development of various chronic metabolic diseases. Some
      ceramides species are implicated in pancreatic Î²-cell apoptosis and in insulin resistance in
      muscle, fat and liver. Some studies have shown association between inhibition of ceramide
      synthesis, insulin sensibility and lower hepatic steatosis. The deposition of hepatic lipids,
      especially triacylglycerol, defines the development of hepatic steatosis. However,
      sphingolipids appear to play an important role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
      and in its progression. Changes in plasma shingolipids concentrations may also contribute to
      the pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Distribution of plasma
      sphingolipids concentrations in type 1 and type 2 diabetes has poorly been studied.

      The objective of the CERADIAB study is to compare plasma sphingoliplids concentrations in
      type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.
