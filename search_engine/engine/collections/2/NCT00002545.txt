    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the use of radiosurgery (stereotactic external-beam
      irradiation) prior to conventional radiotherapy with carmustine (BCNU) improves overall
      survival compared to conventional radiotherapy plus BCNU alone in patients with
      supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine and compare the frequency and severity
      of toxicities associated with these regimens. III. Compare the effects of these two regimens
      on neurologic function and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Tumor
      irradiation using megavoltage equipment (at least 4 MV photons); plus Carmustine, BCNU,
      NSC-409962. Arm II: Radiosurgery followed by Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy.
      Stereotactic tumor irradiation; followed by tumor irradiation as in Arm I; plus BCNU.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 200 patients will be entered over approximately 3 years.
