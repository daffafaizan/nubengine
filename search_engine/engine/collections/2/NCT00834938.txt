      could explain it, mainly in predominantly malabsorptive procedures (98,9% for biliopancreatic
      diversion or duodenal switch), followed by those combining malabsorption and gastric
      restriction (83,7% for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Changes in the hormonal communication
      between the digestive system and the pancreas would explain the antidiabetogenic role of the
      surgery, so this effect could be obtained in nonobese, diabetic individuals.

      To explore potential factors affecting diabetes outcomes after RYGP, this study is proposed
      to make a description of effects of surgical procedures on incretin, insulin production and
      sensitivity and a comparison between patients with or without remission of Type 2 Diabetes.
