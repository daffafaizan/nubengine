      million older people. Symptomatic knee OA in the elderly is one of the most frequent causes
      of loss of independence and physical disability. There are currently no satisfactory
      pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies for knee OA. New strategies to improve
      functional capacity, quality of life and reduce long-term disability in people with knee OA
      are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the physical and psychological
      benefits of Tai Chi exercise as a complementary treatment for people with knee OA. Tai Chi is
      a traditional Chinese discipline with both physical and mental components that appear to
      benefit a variety of conditions. The physical component provides exercise that is consistent
      with recommendations for OA (range of motion, flexibility, muscle conditioning and aerobic
      cardiovascular exercise), while the mental component has the potential to increase
      psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and perceptions of health. These effects are
      especially pertinent for the treatment of older adults with knee OA.

      Over a three-year period, 40 patients with symptomatic knee OA were randomly assigned to
      receive a 12-week Tai Chi program or stretching and wellness education program. Outcome
      measurements were obtained at baseline and on completion of the 12-week program, as well as
      24 and 48 week follow-up periods. We compared changes in knee pain, stiffness, and physical
      function using the well-validated Western Ontario and McMaster Index (WOMAC), as well as
      clinical knee examination, lower extremity function, knee joint proprioception, and health
      related quality of life.
