      To study the effects of ACE-I/ARB combination therapy as compared to ACE-I monotherapy in the
      setting of standard blood pressure control (110-130/80 mm Hg) on the time to a 50% reduction
      of baseline estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), end-state renal disease (ESRD) or
      death, in hypertensive individuals with moderate renal insufficiency (GFR 25-60
      mL/min/1.73m2).

      * Hypothesis to be tested in Study B

      In hypertensive ADPKD individuals with moderate renal insufficiency (GFR 25-60 mL/min/1.73
      m2), intensive blockade of the RAAS using combination ACE-I/ARB therapy will slow the decline
      in kidney function over ACE-I monotherapy, independent of standard blood pressure control
      (110-130/80 mm Hg).
