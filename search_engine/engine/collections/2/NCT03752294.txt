      consists of 40-60 active participants with MCI probably due to AD and mild AD randomized to
      150mg once-a-day dose of dabigatran or placebo. A futility analysis will be conducted based
      on month 3 plasma biomarker changes from baseline. Excluding futility, at the end of Phase I,
      the study continues onto the open-label phase of the study where the placebo arm will be
      treated with 150mg once-a-day with dabigatran from months 10-21. The active treatment arm
      will continue on dabigatran through month-21. For final analysis, a difference in intercept
      of a generalized growth model between randomization groups during Phase 2 in the Cognitive
      Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) will be taken as evidence of effectiveness and
      justify further study. All patients will discontinue dabigatran after month 21 and a 3-month
      follow-up period will confirm whether or not the proposed cognitive effects can be sustained
      in the absence of treatment. The relationships between changes in levels of plasma biomarkers
      over time will be tested with regards to each other and relative to MRI and cognitive testing
      performed at scheduled intervals.
