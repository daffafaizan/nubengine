    
      BACKGROUND: Several cross-sectional studies have suggested that subjects with narcolepsy have
      increased body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance. These subjects exhibit a decrease in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels, which has been causally linked to the clinical
      manifestations of this disease. Orexins are peptides expressed in a brain region, the lateral
      hypothalamic area, which stimulate appetite and modulate sleep. Low CSF orexin levels provoke
      narcolepsy-like behavior, such as excessive daytime sleepiness and a sudden loss of muscle
      tone known as cataplexy.

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine whether subjects with
      narcolepsy have lower energy expenditure compared to healthy matched controls. In addition,
      we will assess food intake, physical activity, and other relevant parameters.

      STUDY POPULATION: 18 to 55 year old men and premenopausal women with narcolepsy and healthy
      matched controls

      DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional, case-controlled study of subjects with narcolepsy matched
      on a one-to-one basis with healthy, non-narcoleptic control subjects.

      OUTCOME PARAMETERS: We will assess metabolic, hormonal, and energy expenditure parameters in
      subjects with narcolepsy. Outcomes: energy expenditure by various methods (indirect
      calorimetry, metabolic chamber, doubly-labeled water method); leptin circadian levels
      (frequent 24h sampling); physical activity, characterization of the main endocrine axes, and
      other relevant parameters.
