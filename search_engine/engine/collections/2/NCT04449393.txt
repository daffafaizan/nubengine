      bio-modulator in periodontal surgery and have been demonstrated to enhance periodontal
      regeneration. Recently, also its flapless, non-surgical application has been shown to have
      beneficial effects when applied during initial therapy of periodontitis.

      The present study is designed as a single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. We
      plan to include a total of 50 periodontitis patients that have already undergone initial
      periodontal therapy, but still show remaining sites with increased periodontal probing depth
      (PPD). Patients will be randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to either scaling and root planing
      (SRP) in combination with EMD application into the affected pockets (test group, n=25) or to
      SRP only (control group, n=25). Before treatment, as well as after 3, 6 and 12 months, we
      plan to assess site-specific periodontal parameters as well as whole-mouth oral hygiene
      indices. Furthermore, we intend to evaluate gingival crevicular fluid, as well as parameters
      representing periodontal disease activity.
