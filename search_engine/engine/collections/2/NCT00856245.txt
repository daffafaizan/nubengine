      an option to receive high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous (from you) blood stem cell
      transplantation. One of the common causes of relapse is persistence of lymphoma cells in the
      bone marrow and in the collected stem cell products.

      Patients who do not have a complete response after traditional chemotherapy, have a greater
      chance of the lymphoma returning even after receiving high dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      transplantation. In order to improve the response and decrease the relapse rate, additional
      therapy may be used to kill the lymphoma cells by using antibodies both before and after the
      transplantation. Antibodies are protein made by white cells in our body to fight off
      infection and sometimes tumor. Rituxan (rituximab) is an antibody that is effective against
      your type of lymphoma. Researchers have reported that patients show an improved response and
      a lower chance of relapse when using rituximab with high dose chemotherapy with autologous
      stem cell transplantation. It is unknown how effective rituximab is in clearing persistence
      of minimal remaining disease in patients with follicular lymphoma.
