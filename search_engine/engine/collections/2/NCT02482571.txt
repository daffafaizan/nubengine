      healthy young adult subjects. For this purpose, the Investigator will utilize non-invasive
      imaging modalities based on functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) to estimate
      metabolic changes during a visual stimulus, while subjects are exposed to well-controlled gas
      mixtures that resembles conditions of either normoxia or mild hypoxia. Identifying the impact
      of mild hypoxia on functional brain energy metabolism in the healthy human brain is a crucial
      step for generating hypotheses in multiple patient populations that experience mild hypoxia
      as consequence of their pathological condition, such as in sleep apnea and traumatic brain
      injury. The Investigator hypothesize that the energetic demands of neuronal activation as
      revealed by fMRS will not be affected by mild hypoxia.
