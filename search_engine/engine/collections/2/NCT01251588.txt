    
      This study was an open-label, multicenter extension to the SUMMIT study designed to examine
      the 5-year efficacy and safety of MACI compared to arthroscopic microfracture in the
      treatment of articular cartilage defects of the knee in participants who received study
      treatment in the SUMMIT study. Follow-up to 2 years post-study treatment was completed as
      part of the SUMMIT study. Follow-up from 3 to 5 years post-study treatment in SUMMIT was
      completed in this extension study.

      All 144 participants who received study treatment in the SUMMIT study were eligible for
      enrollment into this extension study. Participants had until the end of the visit window for
      the last visit of this extension study (ie, Week 260 + 6 weeks) to consent to enter this
      extension study.

      Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at scheduled visits 3, 4, and 5 years
      following treatment in SUMMIT (ie, at Weeks 156, 208, and 260 postarthrotomy for patients
      treated with MACI implant or at Weeks 156, 208, and 260 postarthroscopy for patients treated
      with microfracture).
