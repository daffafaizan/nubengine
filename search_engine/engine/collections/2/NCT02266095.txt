      non of the exclusion criteria, the patient will be assigned a study ID number. The patient
      will be randomized with a ratio of 1:1:1 to a splint treatment with either a forearm thumb
      spica splint, Tee-Pee splint or oval- 8 splint at the time of initial visit to Orthopaedic
      Hand clinic (week 1 visit). The patient will be fitted and provided with the appropriate
      splint by Orthopaedic physician.

      Baseline radiographs (3 views anterior-posterior, lateral and oblique) and data points will
      be gathered from initial clinic history and physical, as performed per normal clinical
      protocol: arthritis grade, hand involved, dominant hand, interphalangeal (IP) extension, MCP
      extension, pinch strength, grip strength, pain scale, location of pain, DASH scores,
      analgesic use, and work/hobby activity. Additionally, demographic data including age, gender
      and race/ethnicity will be gathered and patient will be asked to repeat pinch and grip tests
      with study splint applied and asked to repeat assessment of pain scale.
