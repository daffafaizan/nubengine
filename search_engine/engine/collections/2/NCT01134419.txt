      to be provided to all pediatric residents. On our primary intervention unit, this will be
      accompanied by the introduction of a new computerized handoff tool that facilitates accurate
      transmission of data. The effects of this combined intervention on safety and workflow will
      be assessed on the primary intervention ward as compared with the historical control unit and
      the concurrent unit that received teamwork training without the computerized tool.
