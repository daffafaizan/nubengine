      Experimental and clinical studies showed that activation of parasympathetic system can induce
      and maintain AF. Adenosine is a cardiovascular modulator with effects on vascular tonus and
      activation of nodal tissue through the activation of A1, A2A, A2B et A3 receptors.
      Intracellular production of adenosine is directly dependent (30%) on the hydrolysis of
      S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in methionine cycle.
      Cellular production of adenosine depends on ratio SAH/S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and
      modulates the expression of receptors. Other potential interactions between this 2
      metabolisms in AF are: 1) ratio SAM/SAH influences epigenetic mechanisms that can modify the
      expression of candidate genes involved in synaptic transmission and potassium canals, 2)
      ratio SAM/SAH influences also the cellular production of homocysteine with effects on
      cellular polarization, 3) adenosine and homocysteine are factors involved in thrombophilia
      and potentially associated to thromboembolic complications of AF.

      This study will evaluate the genetic (micro SNP-array) and adenosine and methionine metabolic
      determinants in the physiopathology of AF in normal hearts.

      Perspectives of this study are the prevention of AF in normal hearts through a nutritional
      and metabolic approach in subjects having a multigenic predisposition.
