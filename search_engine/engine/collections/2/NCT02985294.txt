      measures that:

        1. Correlate with parameters of clinical pain and of pain processing in existing pain
           patients (cross sectional study), with the aim to obtain an objective Pain Biomarker.

        2. Predict development of neuropathic pain in susceptible patients (longitudinal study).
           Neuropathic Pain Predictor for patients:

      i. Undergoing surgical procedures associated with a relatively high risk of developing
      neuropathic pain such as thoracotomy and hernia repair ii. Planning to start chemotherapy
      with potentially neurotoxic agents such as vincristine
