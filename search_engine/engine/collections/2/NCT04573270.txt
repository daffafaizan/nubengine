      mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical chords have resulted in complete recovery
      of COVID-19 infected elderly patients with respiratory failure.

      This study investigates the efficacy and safety of a single umbilical cord derived stem cell
      intravenous injection in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection with fever
      and respiratory illness.

      A second arm will test efficacy and safety of a single umbilical cord derived stem cell
      intravenous injection to healthcare providers at high exposure rates to COVID-19 infection.
