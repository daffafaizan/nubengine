      are in disease remission experience cognitive sequelae from their treatment. Cognitive
      dysfunction can be of sufficient severity to interfere with their ability to function at
      premorbid professional and social levels. There are, however, no approved pharmacological
      interventions for improving cognitive functions in cancer patients who display
      treatment-related cognitive deficits. Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, has been
      shown to provide cognitive and functional benefits in patients with Alzheimer's disease,
      vascular dementia, and in patients with other neurological diseases without known cholinergic
      deficiency. The proposed pilot study will examine the efficacy of donepezil in improving
      cognitive functions in adult brain tumor patients treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy
      who have mild to moderate cognitive difficulties. Neuropsychological measures of executive,
      psychomotor speed, attention, and memory abilities will be administered prior to, during and
      following donepezil therapy. The proposed study will also test the hypothesis that the
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) e-4 allele correlates with the development of cognitive impairment
      after radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The proposed investigation is unprecedented and
      may provide preliminary information about (1) a pharmacological therapy that could improve
      cognitive functions in this population, and (2) a genetic risk factor that may increase
      vulnerability to radiation or chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline.
