    
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive disease of skeletal muscle caused by the
      absence of dystrophin due to a genetic mutation in the x-linked dystrophin gene. The absence
      of dystrophin results in a fragile muscle membrane that permits an abnormal permeability to
      electrolytes, especially Ca ++. The increase in intracellular calcium triggers a pathological
      cascade of events that ultimately results in muscle necrosis and fibrosis, which impedes
      normal muscle regeneration. The increased knowledge of the pathophysiology of DMD opens the
      opportunity for pharmacological treatment, with the purpose of altering the disease process
      and or reverting the muscle degeneration.

      This research study requires having Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the subject to be
      between 4 and 7 years old. We expect 5 children to take part in this study at Children's
      Hospital and 10 other children to participate at other hospitals worldwide.

      There will be two (2) screening visits to help decide whether you will be able to participate
      in the study. At the second screening visit, there will be a blood test (about 13 tablespoons
      of blood), and an EKG. Once the study doctors decide eligibility to be in the study, the
      subject will then come back once a month for three months to have his strength tested. After
      three months, the subject will begin to take the pentoxifylline and have an MRI (you will
      have a test called an MRI to look inside the muscles of your legs). This will continue for 12
      months.
