      primary care, both for follow-up in stable state and for treatment of exacerbations, which
      represent major events in the natural history of the disease.

      Systemic corticosteroid treatment is often proposed for exacerbations treatment, although
      guidelines in this area are heterogeneous regarding precise indications of this treatment.
      The latest data from the literature, seems to show efficacy of oral corticosteroids but
      involved only patients seen at the hospital. General practitioners need evidence-base
      informations to choose whether or not they have to give oral corticosteroids to their
      patients ; therefore it is very important to better define the benefit-risk ratio and precise
      indications of oral corticosteroids as part of the care for COPD exacerbations.

      The investigators built a randomized double-blind controlled trial to answer this question.
