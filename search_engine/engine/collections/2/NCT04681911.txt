      significantly improve the survival of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer
      and become the first-line standard treatment. However, the selection of second-line targeted
      drugs after the failure of trastuzumab treatment has become a new difficulty and challenge.
      Studies have shown that the ADCC effect is one of the main mechanisms of the anti-tumor
      effect of trastuzumab. Therefore, Inetetamab, a new antibody to optimize the ADCC effect, has
      become one of the second-line treatment options after trastuzumab fails, showing good
      survival benefits. Pyrotinib, another second-line HER2 targeted drug, is a typical
      representative of TKI drugs, which not only has a strong HER2 antagonistic effect but also
      can synergize with monoclonal antibodies to amplify the ADCC effect. As two important class
      1.1 innovative drugs in China, Pyrotinib and Inetetamab showed excellent anti-tumor efficacy
      and good safety in TKI and optimized ADCC respectively. Considering that the current
      guidelines recommend the combination of multiple anti-HER2 targeted drugs, and basic research
      also shows that Pyrotinib and Inetetamab have a synergistic effect, we plan to carry out a
      phase II single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of "Inetetamab
      combined with Pyrotinib and chemotherapy" in the treatment of her positive metastatic breast
      cancer, so as to provide better results for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast
      cancer Treatment options!
