    
      MeRT-TBI-005 is a prospective, double blind, randomized, sham-controlled, parallel group,
      adaptive clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of EEG/EKG-guided MeRT in active
      duty military service men and women, reservists on active duty orders, and military retirees
      with Persistent Post-Concussion Symptoms (PPCS) and Traumatic Brain Injury. A total of 152
      participants will be randomized, with blinded adaptive sample size reassessment up to 250
      participants, and a contingent group-sequential single look at interim efficacy data by the
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

      A Pilot Phase I has completed in which 74 participants were recruited. Phase I will only be
      used for confirming the safety of MeRT for this indication. For the Test Phase II, eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to either MeRT or Sham MeRT treatment groups in a 1:1
      allocation ratio, with stratification on recruitment site and two levels of PTSD co-morbidity
      (+/-). Treatment will be initiated on Day 1 of the study, following eligibility evaluation
      and data collection at the Screening Visit (SC) and Baseline (BL) Visit. Following the SC and
      BL visits, there will be a 4-week treatment period. Main study outcomes will be collected at
      the second follow-up visit (F2) at the conclusion of the 4-week treatment period. An
      abbreviated data collection visit will occur at the conclusion of the second treatment week
      (the F1 follow-up visit). Participants, clinicians, and all personnel who participate in
      evaluation, or who interface with treatment protocol downloading software, will be blind to
      study treatment group assignment.
