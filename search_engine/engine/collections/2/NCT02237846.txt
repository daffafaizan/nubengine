      allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) administered to 40 patients with
      OA. Arm 1 will receive one intra-articular injection of UC-MSC into the knee and Arm 2 will
      receive IV UC-MSC once per day for 3 consecutive days.

      The primary objective of the trial is freedom from treatment associated adverse events at 3
      and 12 months post treatment. Secondary objective will be efficacy as assessed at baseline,
      and 3 and 12 months post treatment and will be quantified based on the Western Ontario and
      McMaster osteoarthritis index (WOMAC).
