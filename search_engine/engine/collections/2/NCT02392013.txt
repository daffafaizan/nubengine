      cohort of older adults assessed annually by an Area Agendy on Aging via the National Aging
      Program Information System (NAPIS). The eligibility criteria include age 65 years or older
      and self-report of one previous fall or more in the preceding 12 months or self-report as
      "worried about falling." We will conduct baseline assessments and randomize participants to
      receive an home hazard removal program or usual care. Outcomes (falls, fall self-efficacy)
      will be assessed by a blinded rater at baseline and 12 months after intervention. All
      assessments and study visits will occur in participants' homes.
