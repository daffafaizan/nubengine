      groups. The European Food Safety Authority stated "cocoa flavanols help maintain
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which contributes to normal blood flow". Several studies
      reported that a daily consumption of hazelnuts reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.
      The hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate a beneficial effect of hazelnut and cocoa diet
      integrations on vascular reactivity and endocrine-metabolic parameters.
