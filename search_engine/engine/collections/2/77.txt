altered immunologic activity in sarcoidosis .studies in 16 patients with sarcoidosis revealed evidence ofimmunologic alterations other than impaired delayed hypersensitivity .transient impairment of the response of lymphocytes cultured frompatients with sarcoidosis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation was found toparallel the clinical severity of the disease . the hemolytic activityof serum complement was increased . a disproportionate increase in serumiga was found characteristic of the hyperglobulinemia of sarcoidosis .these observations indicate that an altered immune response may beimportant in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis . a simple hypothesis as tothe specific kind of interaction of infectious agent and immunity whichmight result in the immunologic alterations observed is formulated andpresented .
