    
      This is a randomized, open-Label, multicenter, Phase III study assessing the efficacy and
      safety of HS-10296 versus gefitinib as first-line treatment in patients with epidermal growth
      factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm+), locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either HS-10296 (110mg
      orally, once daily) or gefitinib (250mg orally, once daily) in a 1:1 ratio.
