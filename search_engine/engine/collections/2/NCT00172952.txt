      involves the ora-equatorial area and the posterior pole. Pathological myopia often
      accompanied by glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment, leading to
      blindness when the damage to the retina is extremely severe. Population and family studies in
      Chinese have provided evidence for a geneticcomponent to pathologic myopia. Children of
      myopic parents are more likely to have myopia than are children of nonmyopic parents.
      Therefore, it is possible to search a potential candidate gene for myopia through the genomic
      study of pathological myopia. The retina receives the signal from the retina-RPE complexes
      and affects the growth of scleral coats. The changes of scleral components, collagen fibrils
      and proteoglycans, are noted in experimental and human myopia and induce the pathology of
      high myopia. It is interesting to know that individual difference of SNP in the components of
      scleral coat affects the response to the signal from retina-RPE complexes. The most important
      effectors in scleral coats are collagens, proteoglycans, MMPs and TIMPs. Therefore, the
      difference of SNPs in different genes might contribute the formation of scleral thinning
      during myopia development. In this project, we will focus on this subject by using GenomeLab
      SNPstream Genotyping System which is powerful and helpful for identify some specific SNPs in
      the regard.
