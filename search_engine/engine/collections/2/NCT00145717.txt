      parallel groups, two assigned different doses of active treatment and one assigned placebo.
      The total study period for participants will be an average of seven weeks comprised of a
      two-week placebo treatment run-in period prior to randomisation and a five-week follow-up on
      randomised treatment. An estimated 400 participants will be commenced on run-in with the
      expectation that 300 (100 in each group) will go on to randomisation.

      STUDY TREATMENTS Pre-randomisation open run-in phase: All potentially eligible participants
      will commence a 10-20 days run-in period with the placebo milk tea administered twice daily.
      This run-in period will help to identify before randomisation, those individuals who are
      unlikely to tolerate the milk tea product or comply with the study follow up procedures.

      Post randomisation double-blind treatment phase: Participants that successfully complete the
      run-in phase will be assigned at random to receive either:

        -  Milk tea containing a total of 2.3g of plant sterol each day administered in two divided
           doses of 1.15g; or

        -  Milk tea containing a total of 1.5g of plant sterol each day administered in two divided
           doses of 0.75g; or

        -  Placebo milk tea containing no plant sterol. Blinding of participants and investigators
           will be assured by providing all groups with their allocated treatment in packaging that
           is identical except for a unique identifying number corresponding to the randomisation
           code.

      Comparisions:

        -  2.3g/d treatment group compared to placebo group

        -  1.5g/d treatment group compared to placebo group

        -  active treatment group (2.3g/d and 1.5g/d combined) compared to placebo group

        -  2.3g/d treatment group compared to 1.5g/d treatment group

        -  Secondary: To establish the effects of the same intervention on total cholesterol
           levels.
