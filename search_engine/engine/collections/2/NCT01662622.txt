      concentrations according to an 'up and down' design, with 0.2% as a stepsize. General
      anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane, tracheal intubation was facilitated
      with cisatracurium. After a steady-state period of 30min without surgical stimulation, the
      state of isoelectric EEG was considered as significant when a burst suppression ratio of 100%
      last for more than 1 min. The haemodynamic responses to skin incision and the vasopressor
      requirement to maintain cardiovascular system were also analysed according to the EEG state.
