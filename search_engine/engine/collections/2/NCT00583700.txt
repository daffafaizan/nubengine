      breast cancer. Of these, approximately 3 to 5% will develop into an acute, painful form of
      fibrosis. Mild fibrosis can present as a thicker or more dense breast where the acute form
      can cause pain in the breast, significant hardening, and inflammation.

      Treatments for fibrosis are lacking, with the primary treatment being hyperbaric oxygen
      therapy. The combination of Trental & Vitamin E has been used with success in Europe and at
      the University of Iowa.

      The focus of this study is to prevent fibrosis through intervention with Trental & Vitamin E.
      The study has two arms, a control arm and an intervention arm. The study is not blinded.
      Measurements are taken at standard follow-up visits to measure breast density and lymphedema.
