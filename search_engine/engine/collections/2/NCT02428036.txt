    
      This is an open label, non-randomized, dose escalation Phase I study evaluating the repeated
      intratumoral administrations of the TBI-1401(HF10), a spontaneously attenuated mutant of
      HSV-1, in patients with solid tumors with superficial lesions (e.g., malignant melanoma and
      squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).

      The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated intratumoral administrations
      of TBI-1401(HF10) at dose levels of 1 x 10^6 TCID50/dose (cohort 1) and 1 x 10^7 TCID50/dose
      (cohort 2) in Japanese patients. Three patients will be enrolled in each cohort. Patients in
      the each cohort will receive a total of four intratumoral administrations in the same lesion.
