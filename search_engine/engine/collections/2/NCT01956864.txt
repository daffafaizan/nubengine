      of VD that can be tolerated, in other words taken without causing severe side effects. The
      second phase is a 6 month treatment with the dose determined to be safe in the first phase,
      to investigate general health benefits and the potential to reduce the development of
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as liver cancer. Improvement of general health
      will be determined by interviews with patients, markers in the blood for response to VD, bone
      remodeling, inflammation, and evidence of HCC on routine imaging.
