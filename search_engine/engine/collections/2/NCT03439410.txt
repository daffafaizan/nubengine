    
      The Clinical Complexity Index (CCI) that will be validated is made of 25 different variables,
      divided into 5 domains (biological, socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental, cultural). All
      variables were dichotomised and were coded -1 (absence of the variable) and +1 (presence of
      the variable). For each variable, the answer "yes" increases the degree of complexity. See
      Citations for further details.

      Here is the CCI that will be used in the study:

      BIOLOGICAL DOMAIN Age > 75 years yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Intake ≥ 5 medications yes☐ +1 no☐ -1
      Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) > 3 and/or CIRS severity >3 yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 ↑ frailty
      (Edmonton Frail Scale > 5) yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      ↓ mobilization (Barthel<60) yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      SOCIO-ECONOMIC DOMAIN Living alone yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Income < 1000 €/month yes☐ +1 no☐ -1
      Unemployment/precarious work yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Dependent/disabled family member yes☐ +1 no☐ -1
      Need for a caregiver yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      BEHAVIOURAL DOMAIN Inadequate adherence to medications yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Active smoking of at
      least 4 cigarettes/day yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Alcohol (>3 Alcohol Units/day) and/or drug abuse yes☐
      +1 no☐ -1 Inappropriate diet yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Cognitive impairment (Short Blessed Test > 9)
      yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      ENVIRONMENTAL DOMAIN Institutionalization yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Difficult access to healthcare yes☐
      +1 no☐ -1 Presence of home architectural barriers yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Occupational exposure to
      toxins yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Air pollution yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      CULTURAL DOMAIN Schooling < 8 years yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Insufficient access to information yes☐ +1
      no☐ -1 Lack of adherence to health screening programs yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Language barriers yes☐
      +1 no☐ -1 Perceived discrimination yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      The investigators will administer the CCI to all patients admitted to the wards (Internal
      Medicine and Subacute ward), according the study protocol. All the enrolled patients will be
      followed-up with a phone call after after discharge (at 4-8-12 months) for collecting the
      following data: occurrence of hospital readmission within 1 month after discharge; the number
      of readmissions; the number of accesses to the emergency room (ER); the number of visits at
      the outpatient clinic; the number of different drugs prescribed; mortality. Mortality will
      also be assessed once a year for 5 years.
