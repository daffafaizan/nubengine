    
      A prospective randomized controlled trial investigating the use of long acting local
      anesthetic for transversus abdominis block in patients undergoing bariatric surgery at
      Montefiore Medical Center. Patients will be randomized to either receive an intraoperative
      TAP block with LB, an intraoperative TAP block with RB, or no TAP block. All participants
      will receive standard post-operative analgesia regimen. Pain scores will be recorded by the
      nursing staff as reported by the patients for 24-36 hours post surgery. Patients will be
      monitored for secondary post-operative complications up to the 2-week mark following
      intervention.
