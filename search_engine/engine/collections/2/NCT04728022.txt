      qualitative data elements. It will employ a one-group, pretest-posttest research design, in
      order to allow us to determine the effect of participation in the BRAINYAC program (i.e., the
      intervention) on participating students' STEM development (i.e., efficacy and identity). The
      study will also include retrospective individual and focus group interviews in order to
      obtain a fuller understanding of the concepts under study (e.g., scientific identity,
      readiness to pursue science, etc.) from the students' point of reference. To the extent
      possible, the study will incorporate a longitudinal analysis in order to examine how program
      participation affects students' academic and career decisions in their final high school and
      postsecondary years through retrospective surveys of alumni participants. In addition to
      assessing program impact, the research design will include an evaluation component to examine
      program implementation. Through an examination of program documentation (e.g., student
      attendance, descriptions of activities) and retrospective surveys of participants (i.e.,
      students and mentors) this component will determine the extent to which the program was
      implemented as proposed. It will provide valuable information connecting program elements to
      observed outcomes and can be used to make modifications to the research and/or program
      designs, as needed.
