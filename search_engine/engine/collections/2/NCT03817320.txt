      followed by a screening phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy of ixazomib in combination
      with chemotherapy in children with relapsed ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LLy). The single
      arm, screening phase 2 design will allow us to use a minimal number of patients to obtain
      preliminary information about treatment efficacy. Discovering a safe and tolerable dose of
      ixazomib in a PO formulation and the preliminary efficacy data will significantly increase
      the possibility of ixazomib moving forward in frontline pediatric treatment protocols in both
      intense chemotherapy courses and maintenance courses.
