        -  Perform a retrospective analysis, by medical chart review, of patients with primary
           squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who underwent neck dissection following
           complete response to chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Determine whether the role of a post-chemoradiotherapy neck dissection affects the
           outcome of the patient's disease, in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival,
           and recurrence rates.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, retrospective study.

      Patients who have undergone neck dissection after achieving a complete clinical and
      radiological response to chemoradiotherapy are compared to patients who did not. Data are
      gathered by medical chart review.
