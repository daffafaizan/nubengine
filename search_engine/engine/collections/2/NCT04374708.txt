      interactions between cross hormone treatment, the brain, and the body phenotype. The
      investigators also aim to identify pre-treatment neurobiological and other factors to help
      predict body congruence and quality of life outcomes from hormone treatment. There is
      mounting interest in gender identity issues worldwide, as requests for gender-confirming
      treatments have increased in the past 3 decades, and alarmingly high suicide rates have
      recently been reported in those with GD. Despite this, little is known about neurobiological
      or other etiological factors contributing to GD or gender incongruence. This study will
      address a core feature of GD that has been little studied in terms of the neurobiology: the
      incongruence between perception of self and one's own body.
