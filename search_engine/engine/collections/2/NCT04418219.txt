      I. To evaluate the safety of the allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine SV-BR-1-GM
      (SV-BR-1-GM) regimen when administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the overall response rate of
      the SV-BR1-GM regimen in combination with pembrolizumab. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the non-progressive rate of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      II. To evaluate the duration of response of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      III. To evaluate immune responses elicited by the SV-BR-1-GM regimen when administered in
      combination with pembrolizumab.

      IV. To evaluate patient and tumor characteristics that may be predictive of responses to the
      SV-BR-1-GM regimen when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.

      V. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) in patients administered the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in
      combination with pembrolizumab by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Survey.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1, SV-BR-1-GM
      intradermally (ID) on day 3, pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 5, and
      interferon-alpha-2b ID on days 5 and 7. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 1 year.
