      worldwide, without predilection for sex or race.

      The disease is characterized by gradual loss of the normal color of the skin resulting from
      melanin pigment loss due to the underlying destruction of the melanocyte.

      Vitiligo is a multifactorial disorder with many theories explaining its pathogenesis such as
      autoimmunity, self-destructing mechanisms,neural mediators, biochemicals,an imbalance of
      epidermal cytokines and genetic factors.

      Vitiligo is not a life-threatening disease,but it may cause a major social and emotional
      distress with significant impairment in the quality of life.

      Clinically; vitiligo is classified into segmental, non-segmental and unclassified vitiligo
      .Non-segmental includes generalized, acrofacial,universal, mucosal (more than one mucosal
      site) , mixed (associated with segmental vitiligo) and other rare variants. Segmental
      vitiligo includes uni- ,bi- or pluri-segmental subtypes. Unclassified includes focal or
      mucosal (one site) subtypes.

      Treatment options for vitiligo include attempting repigmentation of affected areas,

      depigmentation of non-involving skin or camouflage if neither is effective.Repigmentation
      could be attempted using medical therapy, surgical modalities.

      Topical medications include corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors.Ultraviolet radiation
      therapy, such as narrow-band ultraviolet B light (NB-UVB), is also widely used. It is
      minimally invasive, has few adverse effects and provides a good response rate. Excimer laser
      or light has become available for use recently, and favorable treatment results have been
      reported.

      When medical treatments are ineffective, surgical treatment is indicated.
