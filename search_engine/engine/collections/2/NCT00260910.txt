      is known that human essential hypertension does not follow a simple Mendelian mode of
      inheritance. Stanford-Asian Pacific Program in Hypertension and Insulin Resistance (SAPPHIRe)
      is an international genetic study, which intends to map the major genetic loci underlying
      hypertension in sibpairs of Asian-Pacific Chinese and Japanese origin. Based on the data
      generated through year 1 to year 5, preliminary analysis has not shown positive results in
      the linkage analysis of genome wide scan data, although association studies of some candidate
      genes give promising results.

      Success in genetic studies may depend on many factors including the selection of the patient
      population, the identification of intermediate phenotypes, the disease subsets, and the
      genetic strategy and methodologies employed. According to our previous analysis, presented in
      SAPPHIRe Steering Committee meetings (twice a year), there is heterogeneity among Chinese and
      Japanese origins.

      In order to reduce heterogeneity of the genetic and environmental background, we will focus
      our investigation on the Chinese population. Furthermore, besides the variables associated
      with insulin resistance, which were collected and studied in year 1 through 5 of SAPPHIRe,
      some more variables will be collected and studied in order to identify most sensible
      intermediate phenotypes and more homogeneous disease subsets.

      Our general approach is to continue analyzing candidate genes as well as perform a complete
      genome search based on the exiting genome-wide scan data together with old and new phenotype
      variables.
