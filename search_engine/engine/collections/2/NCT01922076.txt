    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose and schedule of
      the adavosertib (Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 [MK-1775]) administered concurrently with radiation
      therapy in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of AZD1775 (MK-1775) given concurrently with
      radiation therapy in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in children with newly
      diagnosed DIPG when given concurrently with radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of AZD1775 (MK-1775) within the confines of
      a phase 1 study, including response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival of
      treated patients.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of AZD1775 (MK-1775) by measuring expression of
      phosphorylated-cell division cycle 2 G1 to S and G2 to M (p-CDC2) (cyclin-dependent kinase 1
      [CDK1]) and phosphorylated-histone H3 (p-HH3) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
      before and after administration of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.

      III. To assess the biologic activity of AZD1775 (MK-1775) by measuring expression of
      gamma-H2A histone family, member X (H2AX) in PBMCs, a marker of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      double-strand breaks (dsDNA), before and after administration of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in
      children with newly diagnosed DIPG.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib.

      Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks (up to 30 fractions). Patients
      also receive adavosertib orally (PO) on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 3, and 5; days 1-5 of weeks 1,
      3, and 5 AND days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2, 4, and 6; OR days 1-5 of weeks 1-6 depending on
      dose level assignment. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for
      6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.
