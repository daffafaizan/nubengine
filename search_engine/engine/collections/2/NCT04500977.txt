      (DPP), in which women learned the health dangers involved in a sendentary life style, and
      unhealthy diet, a lack of planned physical activity, insufficient personal health management,
      and smoking. The importacne of adopting a healthy lifestyle, and how to achieve this goal was
      stressed. The 24 graduates most motivated to empower others were chosen to take part in this
      12 session leadership program. In the leadership program, women were taught more about the
      manner in which to bring about a change in one's health by adopting a healthy lifestyle,
      leadership, and facilitation skills and the development, implementation, and evaluation
      process required to conduct a community program that will impact society as a whole. Women
      learned how to map needs and resources, define goals and objectives, implement and evaluate a
      community based program. Following frontal training, three action grousp were established.
      Each group was responsible for developing and implementing a program in the community.
      Programs based on initiatives set during the first stage of the DPP included: working in
      schools to promote a healthy lifestyle, community work targeting non-working/homemaker women
      ages 25+, enhancing physical activity in the community, and empowering teens. Together, all
      of these initiatives: increased awareness of fast food dangers, increased awareness to the
      dangers of nargillah smoking, and increased awareness as to the importance of physical
      activity.
