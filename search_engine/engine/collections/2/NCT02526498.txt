      I. To determine the toxicity rate with shorter courses of accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (APBI) delivered with a breast brachytherapy applicator.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 3-year actuarial local control rate with abbreviated accelerated partial
      breast irradiation (APBI).

      II. To assess the rate of excellent or good cosmesis at 2-years after shorter courses of APBI
      and to identify co-variants associated with and predictive of poor cosmetic outcome in women
      treated with an overnight treatment course of APBI.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 1-5 days after balloon placement, patients undergo accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (APBI) using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy over 15-60 minutes for 2-3 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks and then at least
      annually for 2 years.
