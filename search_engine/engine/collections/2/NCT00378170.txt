      complications as damage to the teeth, lacerations of the mucosa, bleeding,
      fractures/luxations, hypoxia, hypercapnia, reflex bradycardia and in worst case braindamage
      and death.

      The more difficult the intubation is the more frequent complicationrate. We believe to have
      developed a laryngoscopeblade that hopefully eases the intubationproces and thereby reduces
      the complicationrisk.

      The patients included in this study is patients who are undergoing elective surgery requering
      intubation.
