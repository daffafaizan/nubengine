      by 25-50%. Most individuals (50-90%) experience a traumatic event in their lifetime, and PTSD
      is the fifth most common psychiatric disorder. Experts have now called for increased CVD
      surveillance after trauma and for PTSD treatment trials powered to reduce CVD risk. However,
      both CVD risk and PTSD are complex phenomena that likely interact in nuanced ways. This study
      will determine which PTSD dimension(s) contribute to endothelial dysfunction, one of the
      earliest modifiable precursors to CVD. The investigators will examine cross-sectional and
      longitudinal associations of PTSD and its underlying dimensions with functional and,
      secondarily, cellular measures of endothelial dysfunction (FMD and circulating endothelial
      cell-derived microparticles, respectively) in a community-dwelling sample of CVD-free adult
      men and women with a history of trauma (50% with current PTSD).
