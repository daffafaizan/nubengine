    
      This was a prospective, randomized study. Subjects who provide informed consent and present
      to the offices of Specialists in Gastroenterology for colonoscopy will be randomized in a 1:1
      distribution to either left lateral tilt down versus left lateral horizontal positioning to
      initiate colonoscopy.

      Demographic data as well as routine information regarding the colonoscopy was filled out
      during or at the end of each procedure. In addition, the following parameters were assessed,
      and compared between groups:

        1. Occurrence of complications related or possibly related to the colonoscopy procedure

        2. Scope insertion time

        3. Pain during and after the procedure

      The subjects' participation was limited to the duration of the colonoscopy, which is
      typically less than 60 min and a follow up by telephone 24 hours later to assess the
      occurrence of complications.
