      the taste of a given medicine and complete the full course of treatment, whereas others will
      strongly reject its taste, suffer taste-modulated side effects, or both. This study will
      systematically measure initial palatability and reactions to the first dose of an antibiotic
      (clindamycin, liquid formulation) by pediatric patients who are receiving clindamycin as part
      of their standard of care treatment. Saliva will be collected from all patients for GWAS.
      Taste response, tolerance of the medication, adherence and clinical outcomes will be
      assessed. Subjects will be followed to determine if they complete the prescribed medication
      regimen (adherence) and/or experience side effects (tolerability). Because
      medication-specific side effects have patient-specific variability, the investigators will
      determine whether the child's initial taste responses, genes, or both predict subsequent side
      effects and medication adherence.
