    
      According to Lung LLC, and from my review of summary results contained within the most recent
      version of the BPS-314d-MR Investigators' Brochure I concur, BPS-314d- MR has been shown to
      have a similar safety and pharmacokinetic profile in healthy volunteers to BPS-MR. It is also
      my understanding that at an End of Phase II meeting in April of this year, FDA acknowledged
      Lung LLC's intention to continue the development of BPS-314d-MR by conducting a Phase III
      pivotal study in PAH patients. This study, BPS-314d-MR-PAH-302 was subsequently initiated
      this past June.

      In my opinion, and based upon the similarities of the two formulations, it is in the best
      interest of our patients to transition their treatment to BPS-314d-MR.

      Lung LLC has agreed to supply BPS-314d-MR for the patients.
