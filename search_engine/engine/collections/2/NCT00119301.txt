      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of trimetrexate glucuronate when administered with
           high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin calcium in patients with refractory or recurrent
           high-grade osteosarcoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trimetrexate glucuronate.

      Patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 8 and oral trimetrexate
      glucuronate twice daily on days 2-6 and 9-13. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV
      continuously over 24 hours or orally 2 or 4 times daily on days 9-14. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of trimetrexate glucuronate until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
