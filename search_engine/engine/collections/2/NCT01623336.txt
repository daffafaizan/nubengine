    
      The study will be an open, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase II - III trial. Patients
      (n = 740) will be randomized (1:1) to receive BIP48 (peginterferon alfa-2b 48kDa) or Pegasys
      Â® (peginterferon alfa-2a 40kDa) 180 micrograms ,subcutaneously,once a week,associated with
      ribavirin at a dose 1000-1250 mg, orally, daily. For genotype 1 treatment time will be 48 to
      72 weeks and for genotypes 2 and 3, 24 to 48 weeks. The study's population will be naive
      patients, of both sex, between 18 and 70 years old, with chronic hepatitis C (HCV), genotypes
      1, 2 or 3, from 18 to 25 Brazilian research centers. Diagnostic criteria will be as followed:
      positive anti-HCV and qualitative PCR, liver biopsy showing any degree of fibrosis and at
      least mild inflammatory activity, performed in the last 24 months. The interruption Criteria
      will be: no partial virological response at 12 weeks and positive quantitative PCR at week
      24.The primary outcome will be the rate of sustained virologic response and the secondary
      endpoints will be the quality of life during treatment, frequency of adverse events and
      cost-effectiveness. As a substudy, will be performed a comparative assessment in 24 patients,
      evaluating viral kinetics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repeated doses of both
      alfapeginterferons .
