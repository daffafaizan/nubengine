      between the two drugs. Lucentis is administered in the form of smaller molecules, which is
      thought to give Lucentis an advantage over Eylea in its ability to penetrate the eye's retina
      and halt abnormal blood vessel growth contributing to advanced macular degeneration and
      scarring that causes blindness. They may have a role in treating ocular disorders involving
      fibrovascular proliferation. To determine and compare whether intraocular aflibercept and
      ranibizumab decreases rubeosis iridis (RI) in patients with neovascular glaucoma (NVG).
