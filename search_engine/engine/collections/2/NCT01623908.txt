      cancer-related mortality among women.

      Zoledronate is a bone-targeted bisphosphonate, which is used to treat osteoporosis and to
      reduce the risk of skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases. Zoledronate can also
      reduce the persistence of disseminated tumour cells in the bone marrow of women with
      early-stage breast cancer. Nowadays, consensus is emerging that certain subsets of patients
      with early-stage breast cancer may benefit from bisphosphonate therapy.
