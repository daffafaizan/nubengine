1131. disorders of oculomotor functions in lesions of the optic pathway at theparieto-occipital level and their significance in topical diagnosisparesis of ocular movements to the hemianopic side is described in 9 patientswith acute vascular lesions in the parieto-occipital region.  in 7 cases theparesis was of the dissociated type with inability to follow the moving finger,while ocular movement in a verbally stated direction was quite normal.  in theremaining 2 patients in whom the oedema extended into the frontal region therewas complete paresis of all conjugate movements.  conjugate paresis recededhand-in-hand with the parietal symptomatology even if the hemianopiapersisted.  the oculomotor disorders referred to have never been observed inlesions which did not extend beyond the occipital region.  conjugateparesis has in all cases drawn attention to the presence of hemianopiaunobserved by the patients and this has led to a more accurate topicaldiagnosis.
