      University-Shuang Ho Hospital at November 2014. 255 episodes of hand washing are enrolled.
      The participants are assigned equally to use either a waterless hand rub (Group R), or
      traditional scrub formation with 10 % povidone-iodine (Group I) and 4% chlorhexidine (Group
      C). Hand washing time, microorganisms on hands before and after scrubbing is recorded. The
      primary outcome is the colonies grown on bacterial culture plates and expressed as
      colony-forming units (CFU) on plates after hand washing. The secondary outcomes is hand
      microbial flora after surgery and duration of hand washing.
