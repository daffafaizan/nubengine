    
      Screening took place up to 90 days before quarantine, where volunteers were asked to complete
      an informed consent and undergo scheduled screening assessments to determine their
      eligibility.

      Eligible volunteers were invited to test and record their respiratory symptoms and peak
      expiratory flow (PEF), medications and any adverse events in diary cards from Day -14 to Day
      -5.

      They attended Quarantine on Day -4/-3, received the study drug/placebo intra nasally on Day
      -2 and Day -1 and subsequently challenged with HRV16 on Day 0. Randomisation to receive study
      drug/placebo was 1:1.

      Volunteers remained in the quarantine unit for 8 days after inoculation.

      PEF self-testing continued from Day 9 to Day 28.

      On Day 20 (±3 days) and Day 28 (±5 days), volunteers attended follow up visits where they
      were assessed by a study physician for well-being, on-going symptoms and adverse events.
