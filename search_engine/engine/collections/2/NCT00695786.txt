      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in
      previously untreated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in previously
      untreated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 drug schedules.

      SCHEDULE A: Participants receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and rituximab
      intravenously (IV) over 4-8 hours on day 1 of courses 1-12. Courses repeat every 28 days for
      up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SCHEDULE B: Participants receive lenalidomide PO on days 2-22 and rituximab IV over 4-8 hours
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on day 1 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat
      every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months.
