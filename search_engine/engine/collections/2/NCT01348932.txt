      studies in literatures, increased expression of CHI3L1 has been proven to be correlated with
      the presence of different diseases, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and chronic
      inflammatory conditions. Elevated serum levels of YKL-40 are associated with increased
      disease severity, poorer prognosis and shorter survival for many other diseases. When
      monitored over time, increases in serum YKL-40 parallel with disease progression. It can
      serve as an measurable marker of changes in disease status.

      There were indicated that chitinase 3-like 1 might be associated with some clinical diseases.
      The C-allele of the -131 Câ†’G (rs4950928) polymorphism of CHI3L1 has been shown to associate
      with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reduced lung function. It is suggesting that
      variations in CHI3L1 may influence risk of asthma.

      The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide
      polymorphism of chitinase 3-like 1 and human asthma. The association between CHI3L1 SNPs and
      the continuous outcomes were examined by real time PCR and gene sequencing analysis.

      In Korean reports there was no significant associations between CHI3L1 SNPs and asthma were
      observed. On the other hand, there were association between CHI3L1 and asthma observed in the
      majority of Caucasian populations. However, similar research has not been conducted in
      Taiwan. In contrast to preliminary studies, the investigators predict the rs4950928 G allele,
      and not the C allele, was found to be associated with asthma. The g.-247C/T polymorphism in
      the CHI3L1 promoter region is associated with the risk of atopy.
