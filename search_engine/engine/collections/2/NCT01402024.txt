        -  VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin/Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide)

        -  ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine)

        -  Cisplatin/Doxorubicin

      Sampling technique Subjects who met the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned using
      random allocation number generated by computer into one of the two groups. The unit of
      randomization will be the subject at first cycle of HEC. The same patient will not be
      enrolled for twice

      Procedure for data collection:

        1. The data will be collected from each patient from d1 to d10 of chemotherapy of which
           patient will received chemotherapy in day care, maximum up to d3.

        2. After taking consent patient will be enrolled as per inclusion and exclusion criteria,
           and randomized to one of two groups. All baseline assessment will be done. Patient will
           be explained about the filling of the diary. In first 2 days. The subjects will fill the

      Procedure of double blinding

        -  Double blinding will be done for the intervention. Four different boxes will be made for
           capsules. Total 3 capsules for 3 days will be made in a blister pack, mentioning the d1,
           d2, d3 (for each capsule). Two different body weight groups will be made: 15-40 kg, and
           41-65 kg.

        -  Group "A" will be the code for Aprepitant group and group "B" will be code for control
