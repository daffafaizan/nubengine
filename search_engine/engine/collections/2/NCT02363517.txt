      hepatitis C virus (HCV) in community-based settings with a 12-week course of oral therapy
      combination of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (SOF + LDP). It will also measure the effectiveness
      of using a social network-based approach ("bring your friends") to reduce HCV incidence among
      PWID. Participants will initially be sourced from the Burnet Institute's existing SuperMIX
      cohort (N= 757). This cohort comprises PWID followed for between two and six years
      (median=1057 days), of whom 299 have chronic HCV infection. The HCV genotype distribution in
      the SuperMIX cohort is: HCV-1 (55%); HCV-3 (40%) and HCV-6 (<5%).

      Participants will be randomly allocated to three groups:

      Group 1: Primary (n=40) and secondary (n=100) participants will receive supportive care only.

      Group 2: Primary participants (n=40) will be treated with SOF + LDP for 12 weeks. Secondary
      participants (n=100) will receive supportive care only.

      Group 3: Primary (n=40) and secondary participants with chronic HCV infection (n=50%*100)
      will be treated with SOF + LDP for 12 weeks. Participants in Group C who have evidence of HCV
      re-infection will be offered re-treatment with SOF + LDP for 12 weeks.

      Treatment participants will have a clinical review, questionnaire and blood sample collected
      at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 12 (end-of-treatment), and at weeks 12 (SVR12), 24 (SVR24), 36,
      48, 60 and 72 post-treatment. Non-treatment participants will have a clinical review,
      questionnaire and blood sample collected at baseline and weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84.
