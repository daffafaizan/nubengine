      populations in non-inner city environments by targeting adolescents at risk for future
      exacerbations from the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) at Arkansas Children's Hospital
      (ACH).

      We propose to conduct a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial with 372 adolescents with
      uncontrolled asthma to test the effectiveness of mAAP. mAAP provides real-time, personalized
      feedback, asthma education, and data logging/tracking capabilities.
