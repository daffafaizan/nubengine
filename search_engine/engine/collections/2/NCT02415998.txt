      to successfully guide an epidural catheter to a targeted thoracic level in pediatric
      patients. The catheter will be placed in the epidural space under real-time TEE imaging and
      assistance by a trained TEE operator.

      The primary outcome is to determine the success rate achieved using TEE guidance to thread an
      epidural catheter to a targeted thoracic spinal level. Post-operative radiograph will be used
      to confirm catheter position.

      The secondary outcomes include analysis of catheter tip position within the epidural space as
      anterior, lateral or inferior to the spinal cord. Further, efficacy of the catheter will be
      determined using the following criteria from previous studies: Hemodynamic response at skin
      incision analyzed by heart rate and systemic blood pressure changes using the no change in HR
      or BP or changes < 20% from baseline were considered "sufficient block" to surgical
      stimulation, while HR or BP changes > 20% from baseline were considered "not sufficient
      block" to surgical stimulation.
