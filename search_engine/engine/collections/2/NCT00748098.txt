    
      Double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover study which assessed the
      efficacy and safety of gabapentin enacarbil (GEn; GSK1838262; XP13512) extended release
      tablets in adults with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)-associated sleep disturbance. One hundred
      thirty-six (136) adult subjects with RLS-associated sleep disturbance and periodic limb
      movements (PLM) were randomized from 23 centers in the United States. Subjects who met all
      eligibility criteria were randomized to receive a treatment sequence of GEn:placebo or
      placebo:GEn. Investigational product was taken with food at approximately 5pm.
      Investigational product was dosed as 600mg/day x3 days followed by 1200mg/day x25 days for
      each 4-week treatment period. There was a 1-week taper at 600mg after each treatment period
      followed by a 1-week washout between treatments. Polysomnography (PSG) was used to
      objectively evaluate changes in sleep and PLMs.
