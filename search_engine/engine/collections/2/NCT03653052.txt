      study a tumour without invasive biopsy. By measuring ctDNA at different time points the
      investigators can detect tumour changes that indicate if the patient is responding to
      treatment or not.

      This trial has been designed as a prospective, open label, non-randomised trial where patient
      with advanced oesophageal cancer will be treated with MEDI4736 (durvalumab), a drug designed
      to alter the immune system response. Samples will be taken to regularly to measure ctDNA
      levels and compared to patients response at 6 months when undergoing standard CT scans.

      The study will run at a single centre (Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge). Nineteen,
      evaluable, patients will receive durvalumab until progression while detailed studies will
      assess their tumour and immune response.
