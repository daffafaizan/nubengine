      antimicrobial treatment will be included. The study comprises the identification of patients
      as potential study participants, obtaining informed consent, documentation of available
      potential covariates from patient file, withdrawal of pre-study blood samples (PK, PD,
      microbiology) including documentation of exact time of sampling and processing of the
      samples, first drug administration including exact documentation (as part of patient care;
      not as a study intervention), withdrawal of subsequent blood samples (PK, PD, microbiology)
      during the next 3 days including documentation of exact time of sampling and processing of
      the samples, storage of processed samples for further analysis, and, if possible,
      documentation of patient outcome after 7 days. The following steps are carried out after
      completion of the clinical part of the study in the individual patient or, when possible, in
      all patients together or in a subset: Bioanalytics, DNA Counts, assessing primary and
      secondary study endpoints, pharmacometric analyses including PK parameter estimation, PD
      parameter estimation and assessment of covariate effects with regard to DNA count, CRP, IL-6
      and procalcitonin.
