      treatment and control conditions. To assess the impact of offering TOP®, students were
      surveyed three times: at baseline, before the intervention began for the treatment group; 12
      months after baseline (short-term impacts); and 24 months after baseline (long-term impacts).
      Baseline data and subsequent follow-up data were collected using a Web-based survey. Paper
      surveys were used as back-up for baseline data collection. The pooled survey data from two
      school-year cohorts (school years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013) were used to estimate program
      impacts using an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Program fidelity and interview data were
      used to describe program implementation.TOP® was delivered in middle schools, high schools,
      alternative schools, and public charter schools in Hennepin County. It was implemented during
      school hours in classes that spanned an entire school year with the same cohort of students.
      The subject of the class in which TOP® was placed differed across schools (for example,
      social studies, study hall, health).
