      enrolled. Each subject will receive RestylaneÂ® Silk to the entire cheeks. The defined area
      will be defined as the following: line extending from the upper margin of the nasal ala to
      the upper margin of the tragus, from the tragus to 1 cm above the mandibular angle, from 1 cm
      above the mandibular angle to 1 cm above the pre-jowl sulcus, and from 1 cm above the
      pre-jowl sulcus to the upper margin of the nasal ala. The injections will be delivered
      intradermally via multiple 0.02 cc microinjections distributed in a grid array pattern with
      1-2 cm between each injection point (see figure 1; injections will extend 1 cm above the
      illustration). Following completion of injection treatment, manual massage will be applied to
      the full area to promote even distribution of the product. Each subject will undergo a total
      of three treatment sessions, one month apart, day 1, week 4, and week 8. The maximum amount
      of Restylane to be used per treatments session/per cheek is 1.5cc (not to exceed a total of 9
      cc) per treated patient. Three-dimensional digital photography utilizing the Vectra 3D System
      (Canfield) will be utilized to document pre-treatment status, sites of injection, and
      post-treatment effect. Subjects will be followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, post-treatment day
      90, and day 180. Objective measures of efficacy will be me performed pre-treatment, at day 90
      and 180.
