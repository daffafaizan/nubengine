      blockers (ARBs) are susceptible to hypotensive events during general anesthesia. The purpose
      of this study is to determine if the use of either methohexital or propofol general
      anesthesias is more likely to result in hypotensive events in these patients during their
      induction. Hemodynamic metrics like blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate
      will be monitored during the induction process, under both drugs, for use as the main
      metrics, as well as the need for vasopressors in response to patient hypotension.
