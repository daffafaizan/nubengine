      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. Using the visual analogue scale (VAS) that consists of a
      10 cm line, patients are asked to report pain sensations of the recipient site. Patients
      report their satisfaction with functional recovery of the injured finger according to the
      Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire that is based on a 5-point response scale.
