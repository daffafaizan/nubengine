      patients with prolong mechanical ventilator (PMV) and is associated with increased rate of
      weaning failure and days of hospitalization. Electrical stimulation (ES) has been shown to be
      beneficial in patients with severe chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of ES on skeletal muscle
      function, pulmonary mechanics and hospitalization outcomes in patients with PMV.

      METHODS: Patients who have been on mechanical ventilator for more than 21 days will be
      recruited from respiratory care center (RCC). All subjects will be randomly assigned into
      three groups: ES in abdominal muscles (ES-Abd, n=30),ES in brachial biceps (ES-bicep, n=30)
      and sham group(Sham). Subjects in both groups will receive ES in muscles for 30 min/session,
      2 sessions/day for 10 days with the same setting except area of ES. The muscle function will
      be assessed by skin-fold thickness and muscle strength. The pulmonary function will be
      assessed by: lung compliance, airway resistance, tidal volume, minute volume and maximal
      inspiratory pressure. The hospitalization outcome will be followed up until patients are
      discharged from RCC. The outcomes variables include: weaning rate and duration, mortality,
      days of ventilator, and length of RCC stay.
