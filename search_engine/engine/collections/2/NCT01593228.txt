    
      The Treatment Extension protocol consists of three time points/periods: the Screening Period
      (during which assessments are performed to determine whether the patient meets the criteria
      to participate in the study), the Treatment Period (during which the patient receives
      treatment with the study drug(s)), and the Post-Treatment Period (during which patients
      complete an evaluation approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug). Patients may
      continue to participate on the Treatment Extension study as long as they meet criteria to
      continue to receive therapy, tolerate the treatment regimen, do not develop progressive
      disease (PD), do not discontinue from iniparib, do not withdraw consent, or until iniparib
      becomes commercially available.
