    
      A single site, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study designed to compare the effects of
      flax oil and fish oil supplementation on the oxylipin profile in females with obesity (n=24).
      Eligible participants will complete two supplementation phases (flax oil and fish oil rich in
      DHA) and will be asked to attend 3 in-person clinic visits (0, 3, and 28 days) for blood and
      urine collection during each phase. In addition to oxylipin profiles, assessments will
      include plasma fatty acid composition, adipokines, markers of adipocyte dysfunction and
      inflammation; immune cell/monocyte fatty acid composition, and functional properties
      including their metabolism and oxylipin production; and vascular function. If participants
      sign an optional consent form, vaginal fluid samples will be obtained at 0 and 28 days of
      each Supplementation Phase and analyzed for oxylipin and immune cell profile.
