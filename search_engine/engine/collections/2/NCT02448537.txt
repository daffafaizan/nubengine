      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      PM01183 is a new drug that is believed to bind DNA cause double strands of DNA to break. This
      drug has been studied in previous research studies, and these suggest that it may slow or
      stop the growth of cancers. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      PM01183 as a treatment for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are trying to assess the effects, good or bad, that
      PM01183, administered either alone or in combination with gemcitabine or doxorubicin has on
      metastatic or unresectable sarcoma.
