        -  To evaluate the diagnostic performance of CardioPET™ in assessing myocardial perfusion
           as compared to standard Tc-99m myocardial perfusion agents with coronary angiography as
           the standard of reference for CAD.

        -  To evaluate the safety of CardioPET™ in known or suspected CAD subjects.

        -  A secondary objective is to assess fatty acid uptake at rest and following stress.
