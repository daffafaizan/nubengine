    
      Adolescents who use marijuana and are truant from school are a high-risk population with
      increased likelihood of substance use disorders, criminal justice involvement, and long-term
      impairments in vocational, family, and peer domains.

      This study will test a theory-driven intervention for early adolescent marijuana using,
      truant youth identified through Rhode Island Truancy and Family Courts. Adolescents will be
      randomly assigned to one of the 2 conditions: a motivational interview versus
      psychoeducation.
