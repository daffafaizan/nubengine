      sites covered with the OxyBand Dressing, and the other treated according to standard of care.
      OxyBand is an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved (K043063) wound dressing for
      delivery of oxygen into the wound. Two small clinical studies using OxyBand have been
      conducted on standardized laser burn wounds, demonstrating faster healing time compared to a
      placebo. No studies have compared this dressing to Xeroform dressing, the standard dressing
      used on donor sites in the USAISR.
