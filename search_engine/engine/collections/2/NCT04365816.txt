    
      The recent Covid-19 outbreak has brought USA, European, British and French nutrition learned
      societies to publish recommendations for the nutritional management of patients infected with
      the SARS-CoV-2. They reminded that there is a risk of malnutrition for that population.

      The emergency and rapid evolution in the situation have led to severe cases of anosmia,
      ageusia, diarrhea, odynophagia, anorexia etc.. Some of the first patients cured from Covid-19
      have lost up to 10 kgs.

      To this day, there is no available information regarding either nutritional characteristics
      or nutritional interventions (enteral or parenteral nutrition, oral nutritional supplements,
      dietary supplementations) for Covid-19 patients.

      The objective of this study is to describe nutritional consequences of the Covid-19 infection
      for adults, 30 days after their discharge from hospital, as well as the nutritional care they
      received.

      Type and proportion of chronic diseases will be assessed in this trial.
