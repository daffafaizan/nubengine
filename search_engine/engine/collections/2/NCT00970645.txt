      evaluated for lung cancer. The study will enroll approximately 300 subjects (150 in each arm)
      at 3 participating centers (MUSC, Mayo Clinic Rochester and Jacksonville). This sample size
      will provide sufficient statistical power (i.e. >80%) using a non-inferiority study design
      with 1-sided hypothesis testing (Farrington and Manning 1990) to determine whether or not the
      sensitivity of the EUS/EBUS diagnostic technique is inferior (i.e. 10% or more lower) when
      compared to the sensitivity of malignant mediastinal adenopathy of about 40%. This study
      requires subjects to agree to the selection of their standard of care procedure. Subjects
      will be randomized (stratified computer generated randomization stratified y center and y CT
      positivity for pathologically enlarged [>1cm short axis] node - 10 strata). Randomization
      will use variable block sizes (4-8), so that randomization allocation remains concealed as
      investigators will not be blinded. This study requires subjects to consent to the release of
      outcome data and follow-up data to be used for study analysis. No additional visit will be
      required for this study; this study will not require any additional time requirements beyond
      their scheduled evaluations.
