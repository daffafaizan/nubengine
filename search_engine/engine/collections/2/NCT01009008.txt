      Controlled CO2 Inflation

      Design: Prospective, open-label, single-arm, feasibility trial Purpose: To evaluate the
      AirXpanders tissue expander in patients undergoing breast reconstruction surgery following
      mastectomy.

      Enrollment: This feasibility trial will enroll up to 10 patients. Following enrollment of the
      first 5 patients, the sponsor will determine if additional subjects will be recruited to
      further evaluate treatment outcome.

      Clinical Sites: Up to 3 sites and 3 surgeons will participate in this study. The surgeon(s)
      should have the necessary qualifications and sufficient experience (minimum of 12 breast
      tissue expanders placed per year) to participate in the trial.

      Duration of Patient Participation: Eligible patients will be enrolled over approximately 2
      months.

      Patients will be instructed on the tissue expansion protocol pre-operatively and undergo
      post-operative clinical follow-up on a weekly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary by
      the treating surgeon.

      Each patient will be followed through removal of the tissue expander.

      Study Population:

      The study population will consist of up to 10 patients. Eligible patients are females between
      the ages of 18 and 65 years who are planning to undergo breast reconstruction surgery
      following mastectomy. Eligible patients must be able to provide informed consent and
      understand protocol components.
