      efficacy of OKZ in subjects with moderately to severely active RA who previously completed 24
      weeks of double-blind treatment with OKZ in the core studies. OKZ is expected to reduce the
      disease activity and induce an improvement in physical function. The study is expected to
      provide long-term safety information in a large group of subjects treated with OKZ for up to
      106 weeks.
