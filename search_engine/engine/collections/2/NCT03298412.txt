      with high-risk DLBCL in complete remission. The study will consist of up to a 28-day
      screening period, a run-in period of up to 24 months, a 12-week treatment period (8 weeks of
      blinatumomab treatment followed by a 4-week treatment free period), a 30-day safety follow-up
      visit after the last dose of blinatumomab, and a long-term follow-up period that begins after
      the safety follow-up visit is completed until 1 year from the first dose of blinatumomab. The
      study will enroll approximately 90 subjects in the screening period with biopsy proven,
      high-risk DLBCL that are positron emission tomography-computer tomography (PET-CT) negative
      90 days (Â± 30 days) post aHSCT. During the run-in period subjects will be followed by clinic
      visits at regular interval for up to 24 months for monitoring of MRD status in plasma by a
      next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay. It is estimated 30 subjects will be either
      MRD-positive at screening or become MRD-positive during the 24-month run-in period. The
      number of subjects enrolled may be altered in order to ensure that approximately 30 subjects
      are assigned to treatment with blinatumomab. Enrollment may be stopped, once approximately 30
      subjects have been assigned to treatment with blinatumomab.
