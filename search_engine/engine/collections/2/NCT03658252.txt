      inflammatory property, for conditions ranging from eczematous disease, autoimmune disorders
      and many other primary dermatoses.

      There is large evidence that topical steroids are safe in the long term when used
      appropriately, and the benefits of reducing skin inflammation outweigh their risks of skin
      atrophy and telangiectasia.

      Topical corticosteroid phobia (TCS phobia) toward topical steroids is a significant factor
      contributing to non adherence. Much of this may be attributed to the excessive or exaggerated
      propagation of 'steroid phobia' messages from the internet, family/friends, and even medical
      professionals.

      The TOPICOP© score is the first, and presently only score that is validated to explore TCS
      phobia. It consists of 12 items assessing three domains of TCS phobia, knowledge and beliefs,
      fears and behavior. Responses are graded with a 4 point Likert scale.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of targeted education, and
      involvement in a moderated social forum in reducing steroid phobia as assessed by the
      TOPICOP© score. Secondary objectives include determining if reduction in steroid phobia
      correlates to an increase in compliance, or an improvement in quality of life.

      The investigators hypothesise that providing information directed at common misconceptions
      towards topical steroids will decrease steroid phobia, and that this would result in improved
      adherence and quality of life. Providing access to moderated forums with balanced views and
      information may also help to address concerns of patients.
