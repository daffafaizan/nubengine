      presently the most popular nicotine replacement product used in England. Recently NHS Greater
      Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) have, like other Health Boards and Trusts in the UK, lifted the
      ban on ECs on hospital grounds. This decision has been based on recent evidence that ECs
      appear to be less harmful when compared to TS but it is acknowledged that the short- and
      long-term sequelae of ECs remain unknown. Systematic research focusing on the effectiveness
      of ECs on cardiovascular and pulmonary phenotypes is urgently needed.

      The VAPOUR pilot study is a randomised control trial (RCT) investigating the short-term
      cardiorespiratory effects of EC in comparison to nicotine replacement patches (NRP) in
      smokers following 12 weeks of smoking cessation support with NHSGG&C Smokefree Community
      Services. We hypothesise that both EC and NRP users will experience improvements in
      cardiovascular and pulmonary function; but the effects may be less pronounced in EC users.

      The data generated from the pilot study will be invaluable for sample size and power
      estimation towards the development of a larger scale study. If the data generated from such a
      trial demonstrate that EC have short-term cardiovascular and pulmonary health effects, this
      may reduce tobacco associated morbidity and mortality, improve patient care and minimise NHS
      healthcare costs, and lead to the development of long term studies.
