      predominance of stage I sleep and a paucity of slow wave and REM sleep. The causes of this
      sleep disruption include the intensive care unit (ICU) environment, medical illness,
      psychological stress, and many of the medications and other treatments used to help those who
      are critically ill. Surveys have identified poor sleep as one of the most frequent complaints
      among patients who have survived a critical illness. Patients in medical, cardiac, and
      surgical ICUs almost uniformly have fragmented sleep.

      Although illness, pain, and medications contribute to sleep disruption in ICU patients, the
      primary factor causing sleep disruption had been thought to be the ICU environment. Noise
      from various sources, including ventilators, alarms, television, phones, beepers, and
      conversation, have all been purported to disturb sleep in the ICU. Patients have reported
      that noise, specifically talking, is a frequent cause of sleep disruption in the ICU. Several
      studies have confirmed that peak noise levels in ICUs are far in excess of 45 dB during the
      day and 35 dB at night, which are the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Agency
      for peak noise levels in the ICU.

      The clinical importance of this type of sleep disruption in critically ill patients, however,
      is not known. The investigators hope to determine if placing patients in sleep/circadian
      rhythm friendly rooms will enable them to achieve better sleep, suffer from decreased
      delirium, and have improved recovery from their critical illness.
