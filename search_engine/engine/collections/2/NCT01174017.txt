      Interior is usually performed at one month after the procedure with CT and MR imaging. In
      order to test the ability of the new design of prostate brachytherapy seeds (AnchorSeeds) to
      hold their position in the prostate, 40 men who have been randomly assigned to receive either
      standard seeds or AnchorSeeds will have an additional CT scan immediately after the procedure
      to record seed position for comparison to positions one month later. The magnitude and
      frequency of seed displacement will be determined.
