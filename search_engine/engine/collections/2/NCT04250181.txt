      and is usually associated with a long procedural time and sensation of pain in conscious
      patients. Prolonged radiation exposure during the procedure puts the patient and the operator
      at risk of malignancy and genetic abnormalities. Complications such as asymptomatic cerebral
      lesions, tamponade, perforation, and also arrhythmia recurrence were associated with longer
      ablation time.

      High-power, shorter-duration radiofrequency ablation (HPSDRFA) appears to be a novel concept
      for atrial fibrillation (AF) but there are scarce data in conscious patients. The lesion side
      index (LSI) value has been associated with durability of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)
      lesions.

      We hypothesised that HPSDRFA applications based on the lesion side index (LSI; its has been
      associated with durability of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) lesions) which were not inferior
      to standard approach regarding safety and effectiveness with shorten procedure time and being
      less painful for a patient.
