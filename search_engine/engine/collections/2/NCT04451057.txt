      Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Japan.Informed consent will be obtained from the their parents
      or legally representatives.They will receive postoperative standard care in ICU and
      spontaneous breathing test(SBT).If SBT will be done successfully,they will be extubated.Just
      before extubation,they will be divided randomly into the intervention group or the control
      group.After randomization,they will be extubated.After extubation,the intervention group will
      receive HFNC therapy,while the control group will receive conventional oxygen therapy.The
      flow in the intervention group will surely be maintained to be high,while the flow in control
      group will surely be less than 2 liter/min.In both groups,outcome measure will be assessed
      within 72 hours after extubation,or during ICU stay.
