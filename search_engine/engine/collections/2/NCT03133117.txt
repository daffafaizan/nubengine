      interview (inclusion assessment). Their recruitment will be carried out on the basis of
      advertisements displayed at Grenoble Alpes University. Patients will be volunteers, selected
      on the basis of their ophthalmological clinical record. Their recruitment will be done at the
      Ophthalmology Clinic of the University Hospital of Grenoble (through Professor Florent
      Aptel). For all the participants, a medical examination before MRI examination will be
      carried out in the MRU unit of the CHU of Grenoble in order to verify the eligibility
      criteria for contraindications to MRI and MRI scanning. The results of these examinations
      will be communicated to the subjects prior to the expression of their consent directly or
      through the doctor of their choice.
