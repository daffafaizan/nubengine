      parallel-group study. Three (3) cohorts of 12 patients each will receive either placebo, 25
      mg INT-747, or 50 mg INT-747 by mouth daily for 6 weeks.

      The primary objective of assessing changes in insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis will
      be attained by performing a euglycemic clamp procedure at baseline (Day 0) and at the end of
      6 weeks of treatment (Day 43). Other endpoints will be evaluated by monitoring adverse
      experiences; vital signs; clinical laboratory values; plasma drug and metabolite
      concentrations; and general health and well-being.
