      new life-style (combination of exercise and cognitive) interventions on primary outcomes
      (cognitive function), and secondary outcomes (physical fitness, QOL and depression) among
      community-dwelling elderly adults with MCI.

      Background. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common clinical syndrome that identifies
      people at high risk of developing dementia, and the prevalence range from 7.7 to 51.7%.
      Although treatments for MCI are currently unavailable, preliminary evidence has identified
      potential neuro-protective effects of exercise program and cognitive rehabilitation, which
      may lead to improved outcomes. However, the design and delivery of an appropriate program for
      people with MCI is challenging for having physical, psychological, cognitive, and social
      barriers.

      Design. A prospective randomized control trial. We developed a Physical activity
      stage-matched intervention (SMI) (1st year), cognitive rehabilitation (2nd year) and New
      lifestyle program
