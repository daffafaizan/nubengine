      chronic kidney disease. Recent evidence from animal studies suggested that low dose of active
      vitamin D may be protective against vascular calcification, whereas high dose could
      precipitate it. The present study will examine the effect of low dose oral alfacalcidol on
      coronary artery calcification in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients with
      hyperparathyroidism.
