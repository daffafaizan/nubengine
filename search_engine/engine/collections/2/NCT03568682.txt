      preliminary effectiveness of a culturally appropriate, multi-component intervention that
      targets food insecurity and nutritional health with the ultimate goal of improving
      antiretroviral therapy adherence and virologic suppression for people with HIV in the
      Dominican Republic. Through an initial phase, we conducted formative research on dietary
      patterns and locally available foods and, together with our preliminary research on
      nutritional counseling and urban gardening, developed a multi-component nutrition
      intervention to address food insecurity among people with HIV that integrates
      culturally-appropriate, peer-led nutritional education with a sustainable urban garden
      component. During the clinical trial phase, we will enroll 120 HIV+ adults with food
      insecurity and suboptimal adherence in 2 HIV clinics (60 participants in the intervention
      clinic and 60 participants in the control clinic) and will evaluate the feasibility,
      acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of urban gardening plus peer nutritional
      counseling on improving virologic suppression and ART adherence in both the short (month 6)
      and longer terms (month 12). We will also explore preliminary intervention effects on
      potential mediators (food security, nutritional status, internalized HIV stigma, and social
      support). As one of the first studies to develop a sustainable food production approach with
      peer nutrition counseling among people with HIV, key products will include: 1) an easy-to-use
      peer nutritional counseling curriculum and urban gardens training materials; 2) pilot data on
      the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of our intervention on primary outcomes and
      potential mediators; and 3) if results are promising, an R01 application to conduct a
      fully-powered cluster randomized controlled trial that examines effects across a larger
      number of clinics in the Dominican Republic.
