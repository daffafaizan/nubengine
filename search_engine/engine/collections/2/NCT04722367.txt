      session one or session two.

      Regardless if they are registered for Session One or Session Two, each participant will be
      invited to self-report their stress levels, feelings of being aware of the present moment,
      and feelings of connection and belonging on a weekly basis. There will be a follow-up survey
      at the end of Session One and Session Two to compare changes between participants who have
      already received the intervention and those who have not. In this way, Session One
      participants act as a control group. This follow-up survey will be utilized once again after
      Session Two finishes in order to examine whether there is a lasting impact on Session One
      participants.
