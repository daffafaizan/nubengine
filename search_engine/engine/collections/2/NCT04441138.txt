      adjuvant Durvalumab can be safely given, expanding its utilization and benefits. With a
      unique, extremely well-tolerated 4-phase split course CRT regimen preceding the
      administration of Durvalumab, we expect to be able to offer adjuvant Durvalumab to a
      significant proportion of patients on study.

      Patients who have completed four cycles of chemoradiation (Radiation is 60 Gy in 30 fractions
      administered over 12 weeks with 1-1.5 week breaks between cycles; Chemotherapy is once every
      3 weeks for up to 4 cycles) will go on to receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy as 1500mg
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) via IV infusion Q4W for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13
      doses/cycles) with the last administration on week 48 until confirmed disease progression
      unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation
      criterion is met.

      Primary objectives are:

        1. To determine the percentage of poor risk and/or elderly unresectable stage III NSCLC
           patients who complete split course chemoradiation

        2. To determine the safety and tolerability of durvalumab (MEDI4736) after completion of
           chemoradiation in this group of patients.

      Secondary Objectives are:

        1. To determine the 1-year overall survival rate

        2. To determine the 1-year progression-free survival rate

        3. To determine the 1-year loco-regional progression-free survival rate

        4. To determine rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities with this regimen in the selected patient
           population
