      non-exercising control at seated rest (Con). They maintained their current antihypertensive
      medications throughout the trial. Each session was composed of 20 min of rest in the supine
      position, 40 min of PT or Con protocols, and 60 min of rest in supine position after
      protocols. The PT was composed of 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions of 5 exercises performed in the
      following order: leg press, bench press, knee extension, upright row, and knee flexion, using
      an intensity corresponding to 50 % of 1-RM and two-minute intervals between sets and
      exercises. The concentric phase of exercises during each repetition was performed "as fast as
      possible" while the eccentric phase lasted 1-2 seconds. During the Con, the participants
      remained seated rest on the same exercise machines, but without any exercise. Standardized
      office BP was performed before and during the first hour (in intervals of 15 min) after
      exercise and control sessions. Together with the office BP evaluation in the pre and post
      sessions, the endothelium-dependent brachial vascular function was evaluated using
      Flow-mediated dilation. Afterwards, participants underwent 24h ambulatory BP monitoring..
