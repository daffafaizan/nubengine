      and left ventricular leads two-times the capture thresholds. This safety margin is necessary
      for the right atrial and right ventricular outputs to prevent asystole during fluctuation of
      capture thresholds. This two-times safety margin may not be necessary for the left
      ventricular lead output and may be causing shorter device battery longevity. Newly
      implemented LV capture threshold management algorithms may help maintain a proper balance of
      safety margin and battery longevity. However, recent research conducted on automatic left
      ventricular capture measurement (LVCM) shows as much as 3.5 V daily variability in capture
      thresholds. In this same study, 18% of patients had >1.5 V LV threshold variability. A
      possible explanation for the variability of LV thresholds is lead stability. Small movements
      of the lead electrodes associated with movement of patient posture may account for daily
      fluctuation of capture thresholds. As heart failure patient care and therapies improve, CRT
      patients may survive longer than the projected longevities of their device. In order to
      minimize patient risks associated with device change-outs, care must be taken to maximize
      battery longevity while maintaining CRT pacing. Examining patient posture changes as a
      possible cause of threshold variability may guide clinicians to program more appropriate LV
      outputs with patient safety and device longevity in mind.
