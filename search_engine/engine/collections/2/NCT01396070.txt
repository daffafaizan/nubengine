      MF and SS, where tumor cells express variable levels of CD30 target molecule.

      The primary objective is to explore the biologic activity of brentuximab vedotin in patients
      with MF and SS, the most common types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), where expression
      of CD30 is variable. Brentuximab vedotin has significant biologic activity in Hodgkin's
      disease (HD) where only a small numbers of CD30 positive tumor cells are present, as well as
      in lymphomas with large numbers of CD30-expressing tumor cells such as systemic anaplastic
      large cell lymphoma (sALCL). The subject grouping by CD30 expression levels (low,
      intermediate, high) is for accrual purposes only, to ensure that a wide range of CD30
      expression is studied.
