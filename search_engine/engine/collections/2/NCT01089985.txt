      exhausted the usual treatment options (lubricants, topical immunosuppressive and punctal
      occlusion) and not keen for tarsorrhaphy will be recruited. After informed consent, they will
      undergo plasmapheresis and start on daily autologous serum eyedrops for a period of 4 months.
      Clinical monitoring for standard dry eye parameters such as punctate corneal keratitis,
      Schirmers testing, tear break up time as well as severity and frequency of dry eye symptoms
      will be conducted. Tear inflammatory proteins captured on Schirmers paper pre and post
      treatment will be analysed as well.
