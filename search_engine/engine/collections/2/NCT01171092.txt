      standard for mobilization with G-CSF alone. The rationale for VELCADE prior to the G-CSF is
      because VELCADE causes thrombocytopenia, similar to how cyclophosphamide is given followed by
      G-CSF for stem cell mobilization. Usually a cycle of VELCADE for myeloma therapy consists of
      4 doses, but this may result in more significant drop in the platelet count. Low platelet
      counts may preclude adequate stem cell collection. The mobilization with VELCADE and GCSF
      will be approximately 3 -4 weeks after completion of the initial therapy for the primary
      disease.

      Patients meeting eligibility criteria and who give informed consent will be mobilized using
      bortezomib at 1.3mg/m2 on day -11 and day -8. Subsequently G-CSF will be administered
      subcutaneously from day -4 to day -1 as a once daily injection at the standard /established
      dose of 10mcg/kg. Stem cell collection will be done on day 0 per standard of care regimen and
      protocol with processing of 4 -5 blood volumes. Stem cell enumeration by flow cytometry will
      be done prior to the collection by flow cytometry. The number of CD 34 positive cells (stem
      cell phenotype) / kg obtained each day of collection will be noted. G-CSF will be continued
      daily until adequate numbers of stem cells are obtained for the performance of a single
      autologous transplant (> 2.5 million CD 34 cells/kg of weight. Subsequently the data for
      engraftment of neutrophils and platelets will be monitored as is routine for all patients
      undergoing autologous transplant.
