      associated with significant morbidity and mortality indicating a need for new therapeutic
      approaches. In vitro, daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal, with concentration-dependent
      killing, and MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/ml for S. aureus; in clinical studies, daptomycin appears
      to be well tolerated and can be administered once every 24 hours by i.v. infusion. These
      characteristics suggest it should be clinically and microbiologically effective in the
      treatment of serious S. aureus infections, including IE and bacteremia

      Comparison: standard of care (Vancomycin or Semi-synthetic Penicillin with adjunct
      gentamicin)
