      the current treatment options are limited. These facts demonstrate the need for an improved
      understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity. The gastrointestinal tract plays a key element
      in the control of satiation; discrepancies exist, however, for the role of gastric and
      intestinal parameters in the control of satiation in relation to body mass. To achieve a
      comprehensive understanding for the reciprocal control between gastric functions and
      intestinal parameters in the development of satiation in obese people the investigators will
      compare satiation parameters, gastric emptying and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),
      peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and ghrelin levels between normal and obese healthy
      volunteers.

      Time needed to reach the level of satiation and total calorie intake will be measured by a
      standardized nutrient drink test; gastric emptying of solids by a 13C-octanoic acid breath
      test; and plasma GLP-1, PYY and ghrelin levels will be measured after a standardized nutrient
      drink.
