    
      Part A is being done in treatment-naïve (TN), genotype 1 (GT1), interferon eligible,
      non-cirrhotic (N-C) participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Participants will be
      assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatment arms in which they will receive grazoprevir 100 mg once
      daily (QD) + elbasvir 20 mg or 50 mg QD and twice daily (BID) RBV, or to a treatment arm in
      which they will receive grazoprevir 100 mg QD + elbasvir 50 mg QD without RBV. Treatment will
      last 12 weeks.

      In Part B, participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) GT1 and HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      levels of ≥10,000 IU/mL will be randomly assigned to a study arm, based on absence or
      presence of cirrhosis (C), whether they are TN or had poor response to previous antiviral
      therapy (null responders [NR]), or whether co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV); these participants will receive open-label grazoprevir (100 mg) in combination with
      elbasvir (50 mg) ± RBV. Treatment will last 8 to 18 weeks dependent on arm assignment.

      In Part C, TN, N-C participants with HCV GT1b and HCV RNA levels of ≥10,000 IU/mL will be
      randomly assigned to receive open-label grazoprevir (100 mg) in combination with elbasvir (50
      mg) ± RBV. Treatment will last 8 weeks.

      In Part D, TN N-C participants with HCV GT3 and HCV RNA levels of ≥10,000 IU/mL will be
      randomly assigned to receive open-label grazoprevir (100 mg) in combination with elbasvir (50
      mg) + RBV for 12 or 18 weeks.
