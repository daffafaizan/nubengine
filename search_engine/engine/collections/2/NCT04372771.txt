      promoting health and fitness among women. The program involves a 30-minute circuit training
      program and a weight management program involving periods of moderate caloric restriction
      (1,200 to 1,600 calories per day) followed by short periods of higher caloric intake (2,600
      calories per day). The program is designed to promote a gradual reduction in body fat while
      increasing strength and muscle mass/tone. Researchers in the Exercise and Sport Nutrition Lab
      at Texas A&M University have conducted an extensive study on the effectiveness and safety of
      the Curves fitness and diet program. Results of this initial study have shown that the
      program promotes weight loss, improves markers of health, and improves fitness. The Weight
      Watchers program is another popular weight loss program. It provides a systematic approach to
      diet and exercise throughout the weight-loss process. Consequently we are interested in
      comparing the efficacy of both programs to one another. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether following a Curves high protein/low fat diet (30% carbohydrate, 45%
      protein, 25% fat) for 30-days several times during 16 weeks of participating in the Curves
      fitness program promotes stepwise reductions in body weight, improvements in body composition
      and/or improvements in markers of fitness and health better than following the Weight
      Watchers Momentum Program for the same time period.
