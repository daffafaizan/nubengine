      Because of its high lipid solubility, fentanyl has a rapid onset of action and a relatively
      short duration of action. Fentanyl is one of the most widely used agents in the synthetic
      opioids family. Being a pure agonist with no active metabolites, it is highly suitable for
      use in patients with opioid tolerance. It can be used outside of an intensive-care clinical
      environment.

      Evidence-based guidelines for clinicians on which agents to use, what doses should be
      considered and whether treatment doses are related to the dose and the pharmacological
      properties of the maintenance opioid are lacking, but needed. This study seeks to determine
      the suitable doses of fentanyl required in opioid-tolerant patients, which are able to
      overcome the tolerance and hyperalgesia while maintaining an acceptable therapeutic index.
      The importance of this study is that it has the potential to improve acute pain management in
      the opioid-tolerant population.
