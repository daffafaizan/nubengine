      help us diagnose gastrointestinal diseases. The major impediment to reducing mortality of
      mesenteric ischemia is the lack of a noninvasive diagnostic test that identifies the syndrome
      before extensive necrosis occurs. Mesenteric ischemia is caused by the lack of blood flow to
      the intestine. The Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) measures the magnetic
      field of the intestinal smooth muscle. By comparing normal smooth muscle and that of patients
      with mesenteric ischemia, the investigators hope to identify abnormal disease states without
      surgery.
