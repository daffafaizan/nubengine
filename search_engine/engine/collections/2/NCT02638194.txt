      hookah and 10 participants are exposed to second hand hookah smoke for 2 hours in NYC hookah
      bars. Subjects in the control group will also be paired as they were for the hookah bar visit
      but will visit a control location, where they will be asked to consume a similar amount of
      food and drink at a wine bar. Pulmonary function, cardiovascular changes, and blood and urine
      markers of inflammatory mediators before, immediately after and 24 hours after the
      participants' visits to hookah bars and wine bars will be examined. Air quality monitoring
      will also be performed at the hookah bar and at the control location. Physiological changes
      will be assessed by measuring pulmonary function, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood
      oxygenation status. To determine the extent of tobacco exposure and associated inflammatory
      changes from secondhand hookah smoke, investigators will measure blood inflammatory
      biomarkers, oxidative stress, gene expression, tobacco-related carcinogenic metabolites, and
      exhaled carbon dioxide levels.
