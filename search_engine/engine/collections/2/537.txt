2371. participation of 7s and 19s antibodies in enhancement andresistance to methylcholanthrene-induced tumoursserum factors responsible for enhancementand resistance to methylcholanthrene-induced tumors in a syngeneic system in micewere studied.  they were found to bepart of the serum immunoglobulin system.the active components of specific anti-tumor serum were always contained in the7s (y-2) and 19s (y-1m) fraction, whileno activity was detected in the 4s fraction.in sera which in the given dose enhancedgrowth of the tumor graft, enhancing activitywas present in both the 7s and 19sfraction of the serum and was higher in theformer.  in sera which in the given doseinfluenced the interaction of the organism withthe tumor by producing resistanceto the tumor graft, both fractions were againactive, the activity of fraction 19sbeing higher than that of fraction 7s.
