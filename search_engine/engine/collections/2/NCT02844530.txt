    
      The experimental treatment will consist on 2 injections of 370 MBq/m2 of 90Y-epratuzumab
      tetraxetan fractionated RIT at day 1 and day 8. The first infusion of 90Y-epratuzumab
      tetraxetan will be co-injected for the six first patients in Nantes with 111In-epratuzumab
      tetraxetan for dosimetry purpose.

      Subjects randomized to receive standard of care salvage chemotherapy/ immunotherapy regimen
      will be assigned per investigator's choice to one of the following chemotherapy/
      immunotherapy regimens:

        1. FLAG +- anthracycline based regimen (such as Idarubicin 10 mg/m2 days 1, 3; fludarabine
           30 mg/m2 days 1-5, cytarabine 2 g/m2 days 1-5).

           For subject's >60 years : idarubicin 5 mg/m2 day 1,3, fludarabine 20 mg/m2 days 1-5,
           cytarabine 1 g/m2 days 1-5.

        2. Clofarabine or clofarabine based regimens. Clofarabine use as a single agent should
           follow the recommended prescribing information. Clofarabine combination based regimens
           should use >=20mg/m2/day for up to 5 days.

        3. Hyper-C-VAd regimen: hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 intravenously(i.v.)
           every 12 hours for 6 doses Days 1 to 3 + vincristine 2 mg i.v.Days 4 and 11; doxorubicin
           50 mg/m2 i.v. over 24 hours via central venous catheter Day 4; and dexa-methasone 40 mg
           daily Days 1 to 4 and 11 to 14.

        4. Blinatumomab (Blincyto®) is administered as a 28-day continuous infusion (9µg/d for days
           1-7; 28µg/d thereafter, followed by 2 weeks of rest for up to 2 cycles. Patients should
           be hospitalized the first 9 days during the first cycle and at least the first 2 days
           during the second cycle.

      A second RIT cycle (consolidation) will be allowed in the experimental group in case of
      response (CR or CRp).

      From an ethical point of view, it will be also permitted to propose the RIT experimental
      treatment in the control group in case of treatment failure or relapse during the 6 months
      following inclusion. Follow-up will be also 12 months from the RIT for these patients.
