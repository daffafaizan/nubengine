    
      Methotrexate and interferon are widely used drugs in treatment in patients with cutaneous
      T-cell Lymphomas. Efficacy and safety of both drugs have never been compared directly in one
      study.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive Methotrexate or Interferon Alfa 2b. Treatment
      will continue until disease progression or the development of intolerable toxicities. Study
      is conducted to analyse and compare efficacy, safety and quality of life provided by
      Methotrexate or Interferon Alfa 2b.
