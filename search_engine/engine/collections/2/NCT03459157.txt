      prophylaxis (PrEP) for men who have sex with men (MSM) as part of a comprehensive HIV
      prevention package in community-based clinics in West Africa.

      The specific objectives are to assess the acceptability of PrEP, the adherence to PrEP and to
      quarterly HIV testing, the safety of daily and on-demand use of TDF/FTC, the impact of PrEP
      on the other prevention strategies, the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
      on PrEP, the "real life" effectiveness of PrEP use and treatment-related resistance, and the
      cost and cost-effectiveness of PrEP.

      This interventional, open label, multidisciplinary and multicentre cohort study will be
      performed in Burkina Faso, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Mali, and Togo.

      All MSM enrolled will benefit from a comprehensive HIV prevention package including quarterly
      clinical examinations, screening and treatment of STIs, screening of HIV, PrEP (daily or
      on-demand, according the participant's choice), immunisation against hepatitis B,
      individualised peer-led support (for adherence and prevention), group discussions, condoms,
      and lubricants.

      These activities will be performed by community-based organisations which are pioneer in the
      fight against HIV, especially in MSM. The study will have a total duration of 3 years.
