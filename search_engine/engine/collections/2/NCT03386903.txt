      hypomnesis is important risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease, neurological
      disorders or mental disorders. Acupuncture is a widely recognized therapy to treat chronic
      insomnia in clinical practice. Previous researches presented that sleep-wake dysfunction of
      patients with chronic insomnia have strong correlation with abnormal of the default mode
      network and salience network. The project present acupuncture may improve sleep quality by
      adjusting the abnormal default mode network and the salience network in patients with chronic
      insomnia.

      The investigators are assigned the ninety eligible participants in three groups: thirty
      chronic insomnia patients by true acupuncture treatment (Zhoushi coordinated points), thirty
      chronic insomnia patients by sham acupuncture stimulation (non-acupoint points) and thirty
      healthy subjects, Treatment will be given 3 times per week for 3 months. Additionally, two
      methods include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and clinical scales evaluation
      as the outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness and security of acupuncture. Outcomes
      will be evaluated at baseline and 3 month post-treatment.

      The aim of this project is to investigate effect of acupuncture treatment on gray matter and
      functional connectivity of the default network and the salience network in chronic insomnia
      patients, and to analyze the association between sleep quality, emotion, day function with
      imaging results. The central nervous mechanisms underlying acupuncture treatment are
      discussed by this finding which may provide scientific basis for acupuncture treatment in
      chronic insomnia.
