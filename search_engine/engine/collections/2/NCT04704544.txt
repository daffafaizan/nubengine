      at-risk for COVID-19-related fragmented care and poor outcomes. RMD burden is high in terms
      of disability-adjusted-life years (DALYs) and has been escalating. Beyond the prevailing
      challenges to in-person visits such as scheduling conflicts, transportation, or disability,
      the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated RMD patient burden through disruptions in
      healthcare delivery (e.g. limited availability of in-person visits). Thus, high quality
      adaptations of healthcare services for people living with RMD including through TR in the
      context of the COVID-19 crisis are badly needed. The investigators found from a recent survey
      of 24,500 people living with RMD that 60% of respondents avoided in-person clinic visits.
      However, with the increasing availability of technology (90% Americans have internet access,
      81% are online daily most patients and clinicians can engage in some form of TR. Due to
      widespread social distancing and major health policy changes necessitated by COVID-19, TR has
      been swiftly adopted (but minimally tested) as a means to deliver ongoing care for people
      with RMD. Because patients can be evaluated in their own homes, thus avoiding travel that
      increases COVID-19 risk, this approach provides means of healthcare for socially and
      medically vulnerable groups, such as those residing in rural areas and those with
      comorbidities, a group particularly at high risk of COVID-19 complications.
