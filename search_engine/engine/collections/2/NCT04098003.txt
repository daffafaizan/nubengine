      to the variation in drug response. Atorvastatin, simvastatin and rosuvastatin, three of the
      most commonly prescribed statin medications, also display evidence for modulation by the gut
      microbiome.The objective of this study is to understand the interaction between the gut
      microbiome and host drug response to statin therapy using 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics
      sequencing and bile acid metabolomics.

      Aim 1: To compare changes in the gut microbiome in healthy volunteers randomized to an 8-week
      intervention with rosuvastatin 10mg daily or placebo.

      Aim 2: To determine the relationship with gut microbiome, fecal bile acid composition, serum
      FGF19 levels and the change in plasma LDL-C with rosuvastatin.

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled trial to investigate the effects of rosuvastatin on
      the gut microbiome, fecal bile acids and FGF19 levels. Healthy volunteers will be randomized
      to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo for eight weeks in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will be
      blinded to treatment assignment. Stool and blood will be collected at baseline, 8 weeks, and
      12 weeks for 16S sequencing, plasma lipid assays, bile acid metabolites and FGF19 assays. A
      subgroup of participants at the tails of LDL-C response will undergo metagenomics sequencing.
