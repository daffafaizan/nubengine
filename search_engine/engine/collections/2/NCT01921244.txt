    
      SDM involves clinicians sharing information about treatment options and parents sharing their
      goals, concerns, and preferences to ensure that treatment plans are based on what matters
      most to well-informed parents. SDM often incorporates use of decision aids, which are
      balanced sources of information about treatment options for a particular condition. Decision
      aids consistently increase knowledge, improve treatment expectations, increase active
      participation in decision making, reduce uncertainty about the appropriate course of action,
      and help patients reach decisions that are more aligned with their stated values.
