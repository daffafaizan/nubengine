      introduction of solid foods and healthy weight gain among infants. Introduction of
      complementary foods (i.e., foods besides formula or breast milk) represents a major dietary
      milestone for infants. The current study will test the feasibility of a 3-session
      intervention encouraging healthy introduction of complementary foods and use of a responsive
      feeding approach. Feasibility of the intervention and the impact of the Healthy Start to
      Feeding (HSF) intervention on obesity risk factors and growth will be explored. This will be
      achieved through exploration of the following aims and hypotheses:

      Aim 1: Determine feasibility of the intervention and family satisfaction with the treatment.

      H1: Families assigned to the intervention condition will attend equal to or greater than 67%
      of treatment sessions.

      H2: Families receiving the intervention will rate the program as helpful and consistent with
      the families' needs and priorities.

      Aim 2: Test the impact of the HSF intervention on growth trajectories, appetite regulation,
      and diet at post-treatment.

      H1: Infants receiving the intervention will experience lower incidence of high
      weight-for-length (> 85th percentile) compared to infants in the control condition.

      H2: Infants in the treatment condition will show greater satiety responsiveness and lower
      food responsiveness as assessed through a well-validated parent-report measure (Baby Eating
      Behavior Questionnaire; Llewellyn, van Jaarsveld, Johnson, Carnell, & Wardle, 2010).

      H3: Infants in the treatment condition will consume a greater variety of fruits and
      vegetables than infants in the control condition as assessed through a food frequency
      questionnaire completed by parents.
