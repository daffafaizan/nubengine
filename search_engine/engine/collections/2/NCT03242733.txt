      condition makes the gastric movement slow, and the pain also contributes to delayed
      digestion.

      In the present study, the gastric content is assessed by using ultrasonography in fasted
      elderly patients for hip fracture surgery. Ultrasound assessment is performed in the supine
      position. All patients scheduled elective surgery for hip fracture over 65 years old are
      objects. The primary outcome is the number of patients with not empty stomach and full
      stomach, and the secondary outcome is the component of residual gastric contents.
