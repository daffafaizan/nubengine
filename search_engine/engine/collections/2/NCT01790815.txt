      in the developing world. A simple, reproducible, scalable way to recognise acute malnutrition
      and target early intervention would be a huge advance. Can mothers with limited training
      reliably measure and interpret the results of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC), a
      measurement performed with a MUAC measuring tape costing $0.06? MUAC contrasts with Z-score
      (WHZ), which requires both scales and a height gauge, both health worker interventions
      susceptible to considerable error, sensitive to non-nutritional factors, requiring
      calculations and growth curves, yet much less accurate in predicting risk of death compared
      with MUAC.
