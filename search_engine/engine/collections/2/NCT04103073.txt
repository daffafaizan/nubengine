      increase the respiratory workload in patients with OSAS. This results in chronic overload of
      the inspiratory muscles -especially the diaphragm- and respiratory muscle fatigue in OSAS.
      When the literature was checked, there was no study assessing and comparing the activities of
      M. genioglossus, submental muscles (upper airways dilator muscles) and diaphragm during
      inspiration and expiration in a workload. Differences in the activity of these muscles
      according to the type of respiratory maneuver will provide more appropriate respiratory
      muscle training in patients.
