    
      This will be a non-randomized, open-label, Phase 1/2 study of the safety and efficacy of
      AGTC-401 administered to one eye by subretinal injection in individuals with achromatopsia
      caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene. The primary study endpoint will be safety and the
      secondary study endpoint will be efficacy.

      Subjects will be enrolled sequentially in seven dosing groups. Subjects in Groups 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5, and 6 will be at least 18 years of age and will receive varying dose levels of study
      agent. Subjects in Group 4a will be 6 to 17 years of age and will receive the same dose as
      Group 4. Subjects in Groups 5a and 7 will be between 4 and 8 years of age. Subjects in Group
      5a will receive the same dose as Group 5, and subjects in Group 7 will receive the maximum
      tolerated dose identified in Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, and 6.

      Safety will be monitored by evaluation of ocular and non-ocular adverse events and hematology
      and clinical chemistry parameters. Efficacy parameters will include visual acuity, light
      discomfort testing, color vision, static visual field, ERG, adaptive optics retinal imaging,
      functional MRI (fMRI), color brightness test and OCT.
