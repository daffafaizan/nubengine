      recipients with syndrome of hypoglycaemia unawareness. Existing imaging methods are not
      sufficient to provide adequate information about amount and fate of islets transplanted into
      the liver. Labeling of islets with superparamagnetic contrast agent ferucarbotran
      significantly shortens T2 relaxing time and therefore increase the contrast between islets
      and liver tissue in magnetic resonance imaging. In consequence, islets transplanted into
      liver could be easily detectable like hypotensive areas dispersed throughout the liver. MRI
      examination will be done on 1, 2, 4 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months.
