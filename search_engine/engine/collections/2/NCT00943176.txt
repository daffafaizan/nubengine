      patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Specific aims include: 1) to determine the safety
      profile of modafinil in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis; 2) to evaluate the
      beneficial effects of modafinil on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and fatigue as
      documented by a well-validated questionnaire (Fisk Fatigue Severity Score) to be applied at
      the beginning and end of the study period; and 3) to compare the performance of three
      questionnaires (Fisk Fatigue Severity Score, Fatigue Severity Scale and the fatigue domain of
      the PBC-40) as instruments to determine the benefits of a therapeutic intervention on fatigue
      by establishing the minimally important clinical difference of these measures of fatigue.
