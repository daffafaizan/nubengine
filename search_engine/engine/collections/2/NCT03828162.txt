      discharged with atrial fibrillation as main diagnosis from November 1st 2010 to December 31st
      2017 from a large hospital in the Northern part of Stockholm in Sweden, Danderyds Hospital.

      fibrillation and atrial flutter) according to the International Classification of Diseases,
      10th revision. The first admission to the hospital during the study period is recorded as the
      index admission.

      admission and at discharge have been recorded for each patient through the screening of
      medical journals.
