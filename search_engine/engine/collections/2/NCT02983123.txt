      majority of these patients have symptoms suggestive of a benign non-cardiac chest pain. These
      patients do not need a directly transfer to the hospital, but can be admitted to the
      Observation Unit at the OAEOC for further pre-hospital testing, including serial troponins
      for a safe rule-out of acute MI. The main goal of this study is to improve the current
      routine at the Observation Unit at OAEOC by introducing the 1-hour algorithm for hs-cTnT for
      a faster rule-in/rule-out of acute MI.

      All recruited patients will have serial troponins drawn at 0, 1- and 4/6 hours, with the main
      hypothesis that the absolute changes within 1 hour can be used as surrogates for the changes
      and conclusions drawn after 4/6 hours. The cut-off levels used within the 0/1-hour algorithm
      are assay specific as specified in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the
      management of acute NSTEMI.
