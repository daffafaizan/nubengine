      otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) that will eventually improve clinical methods for the early
      detection of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), which is a major sensory disability suffered
      by military Veterans, in particular. Toward this end, a special-purpose DPOAE measure the
      investigators call an augmented will be obtained. These DP-grams will test the notion that
      subtle post-noise changes in the DPOAE response space can be more sensitively identified when
      the f2 and basal source DPOAEs are isolated by the use of an interference tone (IT) and
      vector subtraction methods than by the commonly employed standard DP-gram procedures. The
      term 'augmented' maps or DP-grams was coined to describe these frequency functions when
      obtained with the IT present in that, under this condition, the basal source that 'fills in'
      or 'masks' the damage pattern is removed. The discovery of the contaminating basal source
      promises to modify the hearing field's current knowledge concerning the fundamental processes
      underlying DPOAE generation, and may also lead to the development of DPOAE tests that more
      sensitively identify the earliest stages of NIHL. Such tests may also be useful in Veterans,
      who are clinic patients and often have significant preexisting hearing losses in that
      higher-level primary tones can be used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while
      maintaining their sensitivity and frequency specificity. The investigators will test the
      ability of augmented DP-grams elicited by higher-level primary tones to uncover damaged
      regions in Veterans with NIHL. The notion examined here is that high-level primary tones will
      be more useful under conditions of preexisting hearing loss than conventional low-level
      primaries using the optimized augmented DP-gram by removing basal sources that come into play
      to obscure damaged cochlear regions as primary-tone levels are increased. Together, the
      combined experiments will provide a more complete understanding of the generation of DPOAEs,
      which will permit the creation of a useful clinical test for diagnosing and monitoring the
      development of NIHL.
