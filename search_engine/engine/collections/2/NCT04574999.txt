    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study, with parallel
      groups, to determine the efficacy and safety of a new low-concentration estriol formulation
      (ITFE-2026 0.005%) for application by vaginal route in the treatment of postmenopausal
      vaginal atrophy.

      Eligible patients were randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to 0.005% Estriol vaginal gel : placebo.
      Each patient was treated for 12 weeks followed by a one-month observational period. The
      patients attended the study centre at baseline and at 3, 8 and 12 weeks after start of
      treatment. Vaginal cytology was performed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 12; the vaginal pH
      and the signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 12
      weeks of treatment. Vital signs, gynaecological exploration and changes in health and
      concomitant medication were documented at each visit. Transvaginal ultrasound was performed
      at screening and week 12. The investigators telephoned the patient approximately one month
      after the final visit to check if the patient had experienced any adverse events since the
      final visit. Two independent cytopathologists assessed the maturation value of each cytology
      sample at the end of the study.
