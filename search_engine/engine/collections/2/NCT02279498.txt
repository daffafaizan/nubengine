      cystic fibrosis (CF). Liprotamase is a biotechnology-derived enzyme replacement without
      enteric coating. This is an open-label, assessor blind, parallel group, multicenter,
      international trial to evaluate the noninferiority of liprotamase and pancrelipase in CF
      patients aged â‰¥7 years with pancreatic insufficiency. Subjects were randomized to liprotamase
      or pancrelipase, dose-matched to pre-study lipase doses. The lower bound of the 95%
      confidence interval (CI) for noninferiority was -15% for treatment difference in change from
      baseline coefficient of fat absorption (CFA).
