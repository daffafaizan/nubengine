    
      1. Collect the BALF from patients diagnosed with CRKP infection in surgical intensive care
           unit（SICU）of Shanghai 10th people's hospital.

        2. Separate and purify the BALF. Divide each CRKP into four treatment groups based on
           meropenem.

      3.1 By checkerboard method and microdilution broth method,get the minimal inhibitory
      concentration (MICS) of two antibiotics,then calculate the fractional inhibitory
      concentration (FIC) index according to MIC results.

      3.2 Observe the effect of two antibiotics on the growth of CRKP by TKA.

      4.By the above two invitro experiments, analyze the data of the experimental results and get
      the best combination therapy based on carbapenems.
