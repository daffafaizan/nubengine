      of gain in specific function (such as hand function) that might help patients and clinicians
      make decisions regarding novel and time-sensitive surgical treatment options.

      Understanding the pros and cons of any surgical intervention, especially in the setting of
      complex and often incomplete information, is challenging. Ultimately, this project will
      create a decision support intervention (DSI) that can be used to help clinicians and people
      living with cervical level SCI and their caregivers. It will be most useful to those with
      acute or sub-acute injury (< 1year after SCI) for both military personnel and the general
      public. Clinicians and patients will have evidence to help them make decisions about
      treatments to improve upper extremity function.

      In such a manner, patients can make more well-informed choices that are consistent with their
      values, needs and goals.
