      blood pressure monitoring is superior to office-based measurements for prediction of the
      future development of cardiovascular diseases and is recommended by major guidelines. To
      monitor BP at home, patients can use devices that measure BP either at the arm or at the
      wrist.

      Among BP monitors, the wrist device is relatively easy to use, as the cuff can be used with
      one hand easily and correctly around the wrist than around the arm, and undressing is not
      necessary. Since the wrist devices have the advantage of being smaller, lighter, and more
      inexpensive than the upper arm devices, wrist devices become increasingly popular. However,
      it is of utmost importance to ensure that the BP measuring device can measure BP accurately.
      To make sure the performance of these devices, several guidelines have proposed protocols to
      validate these devices. This study will be aimed to validate a wrist type oscillometric blood
      pressure monitoring with reference to the brachial blood pressure measured by auscultatory
      method with a mercury sphygmomanometer.
