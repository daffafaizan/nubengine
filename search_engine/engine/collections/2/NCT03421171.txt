      anaesthesiologists as ' perioperative' doctors is increasingly giving anaesthesiologists a
      treatment function. As the third largest medical specialty, they are also involved in ethical
      dilemmas. Examples of common themes in the literature include:' informed consent' and
      professionalism. Nevertheless, good research into ethical dilemmas in the field of
      anaesthesiology is lacking.
