      brain's function (measuring brain activity). Recent research suggests that TMS can be used
      for both prognosis (determining future function) and to determine what type of rehabilitation
      therapy will work best after stroke. The purposes of this research study are to: 1) determine
      changes in cerebellar activity after motor cortical stroke 2) compare changes in recovery of
      motor function with changes in cerebellar - motor cortex connections; 3) determine the
      ability of TMS to "predict" functional outcome after stroke. The primary hypotheses are: 1)
      functional recovery will be correlated with TMS changes (as measure of motor threshold (MT),
      intracortical inhibition, cerebellar cerebral inhibition (CBI), motor evoked potentials
      (MEPs) and recruitment curves; 2) baseline TMS will predict future functional outcomes.
