      other hypertensive drug groups. The aim of the study is to rotate patients through the four
      main diuretic groups and see if it is possible to identify the most effective diuretic for
      this group, as measured by a >=10mgHg decrease in Systolic blood pressure in one specific
      group a compared to the others.

      As most caucasians with Low renin hypertension are older (>55), presentation with this type
      of hypertension at a younger age suggests the presence of substantial genetic variation in
      order to cause the atypical presentation. It is hoped that by identifying the best diuretic
      for these patients we will also be able to identify:

        1. Whether the young low-renin hypertensives can be sub-classified according to their most
           effective diuretic;

        2. Whether this sub-classification helps us to identify the genes and mutations
           responsible, since these are to expected to be in the so-called sodium channels (i.e.
           salt pumps)which the kidneys use to prevent salt being excreted in the urine.
