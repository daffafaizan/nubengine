      with self-regulation target engagement, using self-appraisal, cuff pain and pain
      anticipation, and interoceptive attention fMRI tasks among primary care patients with an
      anxiety or depressive disorder. Primary outcome for this study is evaluating the changes in
      OFC activation during self-criticism blocks within a self-appraisal fMRI task. Secondary
      outcomes include changes in activation during self-appraisal fMRI task, pain regulation task,
      and interoceptive attention task, and the relationship of these targets with medical regimen
      adherence.
