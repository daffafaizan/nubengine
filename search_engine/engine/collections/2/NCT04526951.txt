      revascularization, bears high risk of permanent blindness. The condition is typically the
      result of an artery-to-artery embolism from a carotid plaque or cardio embolism. A recent
      meta-analysis of observational data indicates that prompt revascularization with systemic
      thrombolysis might improve outcome. A randomized controlled trial of early systemic
      thrombolysis for CRAO is therefore warranted. The aim of this project is to assess the effect
      of systemic tissue plasminogen activator tenecteplase versus placebo administered within 4.5
      hours of CRAO onset in patients admitted to the participating hospitals in Europe. The main
      endpoint is the proportion of patients with ≤ 0.7 logMAR visual acuity 30 (±5) days after
      treatment, representing an improvement in visual acuity of at least 0.3 logMAR, equal to at
      least 15 letters/three lines on a visual acuity chart. In addition, we will access
      differences in visual field parameters and patient reported outcome measures between the
      groups. This study is based on a broad collaboration and interaction between leading
      ophthalmologists and neurologists in European centres.
