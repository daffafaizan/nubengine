      key-regulator of major transcriptional pathways regulating aseptic inflammation and recovery
      of skeletal muscle following aseptic injury. Antioxidant supplementation may hamper
      exercise-induced cellular adaptations.

      Our objective was to examine how thiol-based antioxidant supplementation affects skeletal
      muscle's performance and redox-sensitive signalling during the inflammatory and repair phases
      associated with exercise-induced micro-trauma.In a double-blind, counterbalanced design, 12
      men received placebo (PLA) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 20 mg/kg/day) following muscle-damaging
      exercise (300 eccentric contractions). In each trial, muscle performance was measured at
      baseline, post-exercise, 2h post-exercise and daily for 8 consecutive days. Muscle biopsies
      from vastus lateralis and blood samples were collected pre-exercise and 2h, 2d, and 8d
      post-exercise.
