    
      Double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing patient-reported pain and pain
      medication/narcotic use between patients randomized to treatment (bupivacaine) or placebo
      (saline) delivered via pain pump to the mastectomy site. Candidates will have elected to
      undergo unilateral post-mastectomy immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction.
      Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled and baseline data collection
      completed prior to randomization and surgery.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to bupivacaine- (treatment) or saline-(placebo) filled
      percutaneously-placed pain pumps in a double-blinded design. Patient-specific surgical
      details will be recorded intraoperatively. Following the surgery, post-operative pain, pain
      medication/narcotic use, and assessment for adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events
      (SAEs) will be assessed on Days 1, 2, and 3. A clinic visit occurs on Day 7 when the pain
      pump will be removed and additional data collected (updated medical history, pain
      medication/narcotic use, AEs/SAEs, and study questionnaires). A Pain Pump Questionnaire will
      be completed to obtain the patient's assessment of the usability of the pain pump.

      Long-term quality-of-life/health outcomes assessments will be done on post-operative Day 90
      (±14 days), Year 2 (±14 days), and Year 4 (±14 days). The Year 2 and Year 4 follow-ups are
      included as tertiary endpoints to capture differences in chronic pain, and patients will be
      asked to complete the same questionnaires as at the Day 90 follow up.
