      anaesthetists and researchers to study methods to improve the perioperative care of children.
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with properties that make it
      attractive to pediatric use. It provides sedation and anxiolysis acting on these receptors in
      the locus ceruleus of the pons. It also exerts dose-dependent moderate primary analgesic
      effects through activation of alpha-2 adrenoreceptors in the dorsal spinal horn causing a
      subsequent decrease in substance P release. The study aims to explore whether a single
      low-dose dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period has a preventive effect on EA in
      children, and through short-term and long-term follow-up, to investigate the effect on
      post-hospitalization behavioural changes.
