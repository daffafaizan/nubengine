      psychological positive reaction to nature has been developed. Accordingly, emerging
      literature highlights the positive effect of therapeutic gardens, as environmental ecological
      therapy (EET) on the reduction of behavioral disorders (BD) and the preservation of cognitive
      functions in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      Despite these promising preliminary studies, limited data are available on the effectiveness
      of EET in individuals with advanced AD. Therefore, the aim of the current trial will be to
      evaluate the effectiveness of EET on AD symptoms in patients with advanced AD.

      Participants with advanced AD will be selected from among residents of the Alzheimer's care
      units of the Mons. Mazzali Foundation (Mantua, Italy). Selected participants will be randomly
      assigned to a treatment group (TR), or to a control group (CTRL).

      Participants assigned to TR group will perform a program of EET for 2 hours a day, 5 days a
      week for a total of 6 months. Individuals assigned to the CTRL group will be treated with a
      standard therapy.
