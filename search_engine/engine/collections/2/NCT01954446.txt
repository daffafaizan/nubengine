      prospective, randomised, comparative investigation in a population with a representative
      spread of BPs to ensure that the ID performs as good as current marketed and approved
      devices. The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Standard
      ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2 - Non-invasive sphygmomanometers - Clinical validation of automated
      measurement type.

      This clinical investigation will enrol up to 96 male and female subjects to ensure the
      recording of 85/35 evaluable datasets in accordance with the ANSI/AAMI/ISO standard [11]. All
      measurements will be paired and falls into 2 categories: Auscultatory measurements as gold
      standard reference, oscillometric measurements for clinical practise reference and further
      validation of ambulatory monitoring and pulse shape measurements.
