      used to facilitate insertion of the LMA during anaesthesia induction. To date, however, there
      have been no published reports addressing the use of remifentanil to facilitate LMA insertion
      during sevoflurane inhalation induction in adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
      to determine the most suitable effect-site concentration of remifentanil target-controlled
      infusion (TCI) for the LMA insertion during inhaled induction with 8% sevoflurane in adults.
