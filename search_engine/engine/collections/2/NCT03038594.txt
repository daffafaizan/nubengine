    
      Either recombinant human growth hormone (daily subcutaneous injections of 0.05 mg/kg/day of
      GH at discharge [somatropin, Genotropin, Pfizer, New York, NY]; 0.025 mg/kg/day of GH
      titrated the week before discharge) or placebo (n=31) will be administered to adult burned
      subjects (n= 31, 18-85 years) after screening and voluntary consent who have â‰¥30% TBSA
      assessed by either the Lund and Browder chart or the 'rule of nines' method during excisional
      surgery. It will be administered daily for 9 months beginning the week before discharge, and
      the primary and secondary endpoints will be collected during the acute hospital stay,
      discharge, and long-term follow-up visits (6, 12, 18, and 24 months after burn injury).
      Additionally, subjects will be contacted frequently [most likely 1 week, 1 month, and 2
      months post discharge by telephone] to ensure that there are no adverse events or concerns
      with their study drug, as well as visit with them during their clinical visits that address
      their post-burn needs. All subjects will receive similar standard medical care and treatment
      from the time of emergency admission until their discharge.

      Growth hormone will be used to potentially attenuate losses in height, weight, muscle and
      bone, reverse the oxidative stress of burn injury and, in the process, decrease the secondary
      consequences of burn injury, including organ dysfunction. This may improve the quality of
      life of the burn patient by preventing pathophysiology that may result from muscle and bone
      loss and may reduce hospital stay. Our research will lay the foundation for the future
      development of effective, safe, and economic therapeutic interventions to treat burn
      injury-associated metabolic abnormalities. Also, it will provide the basis for the
      development of supplemental regulations and pharmacotherapy to treat burn patients with GH.
      The risks are very reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to our subjects because
      a) GH at a higher dose has been tested in pediatric burned subjects with minor adverse
      events, and b) the subjects will be monitored consistently.
