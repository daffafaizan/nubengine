    
      Primary objectives

        1. Optimizing current treatment of AML based on the classification of patients into
           different risk groups according to parameters cytogenetic and molecular response to
           treatment and to analyze its effectiveness in terms of survival.

        2. Apply a uniform treatment to individual patients according to previously defined
           prognostic groups.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Correlate the different clinical and biological characteristics with response rates and
           patient outcomes.

        2. Studying the role of minimal residual disease by molecular techniques in anticipation of
           relapse of AML
