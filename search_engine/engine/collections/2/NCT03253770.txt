      since the dawn of time, human beings are aware that managing complex situations will always
      be an inexhaustible source of mistakes. This is particularly true in anesthesia and intensive
      care in which situations are often complex and stressful, thus leading to mistakes or
      inadequate management. Improvement might arise from the use of cognitive aids.

      In a first study (MAX, accepted for publication BJA) the investigators designed a smartphone
      application including 5 scenarios of anesthesia and intensive care crises (malignant
      hyperthermia, anaphylactic shock, acute toxicity of local anesthetics, severe and symptomatic
      hyperkaliemia, ventricular fibrillation), designed to be used in the hand of the leader
      managing the crises. Technical and non technical skills were improved in 4 out of 5
      scenarios. Cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation) clearly happened to be a different
      situation compared to other crises, and no improvement could be measured with our cognitive
      aid.

      The present study exclusively deals with the management of cardiac arrest (man in recovery
      ward, pregnant woman in the delivery room) with the second generation of our digital
      cognitive aid, and explores new insights on how to better manage cardiac arrest with a
      digital cognitive aid in the hand of the leader.
