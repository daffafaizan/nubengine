      junction and at 200 cms proximal to Ileo-Caecal junction;this ileal segment of 170 cms is
      interposed into proximal jejunum between 20-50 cms distal to Ligament of Treitz. Endo-GIA
      staplers and hand-sown closure was used for the 3 anastomoses. The mesenteric gaps defects
      were closed with 3/0 prolene sutures. Sleeve gastrectomy was done starting from antrum/body
      upto angle of His with a sizing bougie ranging from size 32--58 Fr.
