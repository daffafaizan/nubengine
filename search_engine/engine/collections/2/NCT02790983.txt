    
      Objective: To prospectively investigate the prognostic variables (clinical, diagnostic, and
      therapeutic) within subgroups of patients diagnosed with primary spinal column tumors that
      are associated with:

        -  survival

        -  local recurrence

        -  perioperative morbidity

        -  patient reported outcomes

      Outcome measures: Variables applicable to primary spinal column tumor patients which will be
      collected in the registry include:

        -  Patient details

        -  Treatment status

        -  Details of previous treatment

        -  Diagnosis and biopsy types

        -  Tumor details

        -  Oncological staging

        -  Symptoms

        -  Treatment details

        -  Imaging information

      The investigators aim to collect the following outcome measures:

        -  Overall survival data

        -  Local disease recurrence data

        -  Perioperative morbidity data

      Patient reported outcomes:

        -  Euroqual-5D-3L

        -  Euroquol EQ-5D VAS - Quality of Life

        -  Neck pain numeric rating scale (NRS)

        -  Arm pain NRS

        -  Back pain NRS

        -  Leg Pain NRS

        -  SF-36 version 2

        -  SOSG Outcome Questionnaire
