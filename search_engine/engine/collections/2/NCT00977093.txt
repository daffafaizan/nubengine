      that Gd-DTPA-BMA (a conventional MR contrast medium = OMNISCAN) enhanced myocardial MR
      perfusion imaging is non-inferior to myocardial SPECT. Both imaging techniques will be
      performed during adenosine stress (0.14mg/min/kg over 3 minutes IV). Gd-DTPA-BMA will be used
      twice (2 doses of 0.075 mmol/kg for the stress and rest study each) for the detection of
      myocardial perfusion defects. The standard of reference is invasive coronary angiography,
      which defines the presence of coronary artery disease, if vessels of at least 2mm in diameter
      show stenosis of at least 50% (diameter reduction). Patients with a history of myocardial
      infarction(s) are positive for coronary artery disease, even when coronary arteries are not
      stenosed as evidenced by the coronary angiography performed in the setting of this trial(=
      assigning patients as positive for coronary artery disease after successful
      PCI-revascularization of acute infarct(s) in the past).
