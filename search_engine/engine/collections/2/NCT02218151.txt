      revolutionize hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Traditionally, home care has
      been used for palliative care in end-stage cancer patients and in geriatrics. More recently
      the PCMH has gained increasing adoption for both primary care and care of medically complex
      patients. The core of the PCMH lies in the interaction between the healthcare team, the
      patient's family and support, and above all, the patient. These interactions can be enhanced
      through health information technologies such as the electronic health record (EHR) and
      videoconferencing via iPads. In addition, collection of patient reported outcomes (PRO) will
      allow feedback and adjustments.

      This integration is especially important when considering the multiple complicated needs of
      the HCT patient: navigating a Byzantine healthcare system that often requires input and
      coordination from multiple specialists including transplanters, hematologists, infectious
      disease physicians, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, pharmacists, social
      workers, financial coordinators, etc.; managing medication regimens to prevent infections,
      GVHD, and other complications (not to mention avoiding drug and food interactions); adjusting
      to multiple side effects including fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
      rashes, pain, anxiety, stress, organ failure, etc.; the sheer amount of time required for
      healthcare visits, lab draws, waiting for results, infusions, transfusions, etc.; physical
      and psychosocial struggles of living with a life-threatening disease; and the burdens of a
      treatment that often seems as debilitating as the disease. The PCMH provides
      patient-centered, comprehensive, accessible, and coordinated care and a systems-based
      approach to quality and safety: these attributes are essential to the successful care of the
      complicated HCT patient. this approach has the potential to lower overall costs while
      preserving or increasing the quality of care.
