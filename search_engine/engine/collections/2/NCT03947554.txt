      ginsenosides than typical Korean ginseng. This study will test whether HRG80 is effective at
      preventing symptoms of stress, such as fatigue, impaired memory, difficulty in concentration,
      attention deficit, restlessness, and irritation related to daily work situations of healthy
      individuals in comparison to placebo and a standard Pananx ginseng with a lower concentration
      of ginsenosides.
