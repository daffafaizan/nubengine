      smooth dermal depressions formed by the loss of volume. These fillers (also known as soft
      tissue augmentation devices) can restore the age-related volume loss of the face, balance the
      disproportions or correct topographical anomalies. A previous study has already shown the
      efficacy of Art Filler Volume on the midface, but this study was not comparative. It was thus
      interesting to compare the efficacy of Art Filler Volume to a reference product but also to
      test its efficacy on other areas including the temple, jaw-line and chin.

      In this context, it is proposed to conduct, in post-CE marking, a randomized, prospective and
      comparative study in order to document, an adequate aesthetic correction of the treated areas
      as well as their immediate and long-term tolerance. This study aims to document the filling
      capacity of Art Filler Volume, in relation to a product technically of the same order and
      considered as a reference2,3,4,5 (this study will be comparative on temple / midface and
      jawline but no on the chin were only Art Filler Volume will be injected). To do this,
      subjects in whom a correction of mid-facial areas and / or temple and / or jaw-lines and / or
      chin is sought, will be included. The aesthetic correction will be appreciated at 3 weeks.
      Subjects will be followed over 18 months. The persistence of the correction will be evaluated
      at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months.

      No corrective injections with the products under study will be allowed. Each subject could be
      injected for maximum 2 different zones.
