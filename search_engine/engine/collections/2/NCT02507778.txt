      Lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common malignancy with a high recurrence rate even when diagnosed at
      early stages. Biopsy is currently the procedure of choice for the investigation of pulmonary
      lesions, yet it is unclear whether the biopsy itself releases tumor cells into the
      circulation and attributes to the late distal recurrence.

      Studies of various malignancies show the ability to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
      even in early stage cancer. The number of CTCs correlates with disease outcome. Dynamics of
      CTCs after CT or bronchoscopy guided biopsy has not been evaluated so far. In the metastatic
      setting, the number of CTCs correlates to tumor response to chemotherapy in both small and
      non-small lung cancer (SCLC and NSCLC, respectively).

      The aim of this study is to quantify the spillage of tumor cells after biopsy in early lung
      cancer.

      Patients with suspected pulmonary lesions undergoing CT or bronchoscopy guided biopsy will be
      enrolled into the study. The CellCollectorTM will be used for CTCs detection before and after
      the procedure. These patients will be their own controls.

      In this study the investigators will use the CellCollectorTM (Gilupi, Germany) needle that
      isolates CTCs of epithelial origin using a needle coated with antibodies directed against the
      epithelial cell adhesion molecules (EpCAM). This technology enables high quality
      immunohistochemical and molecular testing of the acquired cells as needed for treatment
      planning, and even allows cell culture growth from the live CTCs. This device is certified
      for use throughout Europe, with no adverse events noted with its usage .
