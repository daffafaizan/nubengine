    
      Longitudinal, cas-control study, observational multicenter study based on a cohort of 200
      SARS-CoV-2 seropositive patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatisms (CIRs) from the
      COVID-RIC-1 cohort.

      The follow-up the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 serological status for 2 years in 200 patients
      with inflammatory rheumatisms compared to matched 100 healthy controls to evaluate the impact
      of immuno-suppressive therapy will be proposed.

      Schedule: 4 visits over a 24-month period.

      An observational routine care study was initiated in 16 French hospitals to assess the
      SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in France in a population with CIRs (Covid-RIC-1). The project
      plans to screen 5000 CIRs patients. The COVID-RIC-2 study will thus be proposed to these
      pre-screened subjects according to their positive status in the serology for SARS-CoV-2 at
      the time of their inclusion in COVID-RIC-1.

      For the control group, 100 health professionals participating in the COVID-BIOTOUL cohort
      will be selected to be matched on age, gender, and the time between the date of infection
      with Covid-19 and the first serology of CIR patients.
