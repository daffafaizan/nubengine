      alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (10% bolus + 90% infusion/60 minutes) a) within 4½ hours after symptom
      onset; b) within 4½ hours after awakening with stroke symptoms, and c) as bridging therapy
      within 4½ hours before thrombectomy.

      Study design: NOR-TEST-2 is a multi-centre PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded
      endpoint) trial, designed to establish superiority of tenecteplase as compared with alteplase
      for consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated within 4½ hours after
      symptom onset. Randomisation tenecteplase:alteplase is 1:1.

      Endpoints: Primary endpoint is functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at 90 days (efficacy). Secondary
      endpoints include rates of cerebral hemorrhages on CT/MR at 24-48 hours and mortality
      (safety).

      Patient recruitment: All patients admitted to hospital with acute ischaemic stroke eligible
      for standard iv thrombolysis with alteplase and with pre-stroke mRS<3 and NIHSS score of >5
      on admission are potentially eligible for NOR-TEST-2.

      Based on power calculations from NOR-TEST, NOR-TEST 2 aims at including 1342 patients.
