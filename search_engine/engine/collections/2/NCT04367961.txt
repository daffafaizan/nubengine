      development. Several factors such as serous otitis media or abnormal musculature of the velum
      can have consequences on hearing and language. In this context, it seems important to
      describe the evolution of this disease after surgery to better anticipate complications and
      improve their subsequent management. The aim of this study is to describe the hearing profile
      and language development of children with cleft palate from surgery to pre-adolescence. The
      hearing profile is assessed though an audiogram once or twice a year during the annual
      follow-up with the referring surgeon. Language development is assessed by the intelligibility
      scale, a validated questionnaire. This study will allow identification of : - predictive
      criteria for poor hearing and poor language development; - risk groups: type of cleft,
      medical history, genetic background, etc; - Level of speech disorder other than
      intelligibility: rhinolalia, eagerness for communication; - Other factors in the history of
      the disease: âge at surgery ; - history of chronic otitis media, ventilation tube placements;
      - nasalization and language disorder; - speech-language pathology; - History of hearing
      impairment; - age of first words; - Other ENT clinical history; - History of malformations; -
      Socio-economic level of the household; - Mother's language / number of languages spoken at
      home. This is a retrospective and prospective cohort study. Children aged 5 to 11 with a
      cleft palate operated on for a veloplasty at Robert Debré Hospital between 2008 and 2014 were
      included in the study between 2008 and 2014.
