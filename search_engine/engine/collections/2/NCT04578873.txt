    
      Qpex Biopharma, Inc. is developing an oral dosage form that delivers QPX7728, a new
      boron-based beta-lactamase inhibitor with activity against both serine and
      metallo-beta-lactamases, for oral treatment in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic.

      The objectives are:

        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of QPX7831 when administered orally in single
           ascending doses (SAD) and in multiple ascending doses (MAD) to healthy adult subjects.

        2. To assess the PK of single and multiple doses of oral QPX7831 when administered to
           healthy adult subjects to determine if the target exposures identified in preclinical
           studies can be attained in healthy adult subjects.
