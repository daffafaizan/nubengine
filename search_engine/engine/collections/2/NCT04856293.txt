    
      In order to overcome the poor taste/palatability associated with the original oral solution
      formulation of crizotinib for pediatric patients, an encapsulated microsphere (eMS)
      formulation with improved palatability compared with the oral solution and acceptable PK
      characteristics was developed.

      The primary objective of this study is to establish the bioequivalence of the eMS formulation
      to the current commercial formulation, ie, formulated capsule (FC), in adult healthy
      participants to support the commercialization of this new formulation.
