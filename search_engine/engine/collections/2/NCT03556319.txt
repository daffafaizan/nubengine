      and post-menopausal females will be recruited for the study. Eighteen volunteers will be
      studied with a reasonable sampling of ethnicities from the Nashville area, and an effort will
      be made to recruit equal numbers of males and females. The study will be conducted by the
      Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC).

      Based upon single dose pharmacokinetics, two multiple dose regimens will be studied to
      determine the safety, accumulation kinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of multiple daily
      doses administered over 2 weeks. A complete health history and physical examination will be
      conducted by a physician. An EKG, baseline blood and urine sample, and vital signs will be
      taken prior to supplement administration. A physician will oversee all clinical aspects of
      the study and will be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions. Additionally, DNA
      will be collected from the blood drawn and used to determine if there are any genetic
      differences in metabolism of 2-HOBA. Volunteers will be given 3 daily doses of either placebo
      or one of two levels of 2-HOBA to determine the safety, accumulation kinetics, and
      pharmacodynamic effects of the multiple dose administration over a 2 week period.
