      three different lidocaine/prilocaine products will be assessed in parallel at different skin
      sites on the same participant.

      For BE evaluations a reference product will be compared against itself and an approved
      generic test product as positive control and against a non-equivalent test product as
      negative control. Additionally different non-invasive measurements (e.g. TEWL) will be
      conducted and results will be correlated with lidocaine/prilocaine PK data to identify
      factors that might influence skin penetration.

      dOFM probes will be inserted into the dermis to monitor the dermal drug concentrations up to
      12 h post-dose in topically treated skin sites. Blood samples will be drawn to rule out
      systemic appearance of lidocaine and/or prilocaine.
