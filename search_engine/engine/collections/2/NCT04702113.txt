      evidence-based guidelines to provide personalized drug response profile(s) to guide treatment
      decisions.

      The patient specimen is genotyped using a proprietary, carefully curated pharmacogenetic
      variant panel to determine the individual's phenotype. The Lighthouse report (PGx findings)
      are provided to the clinician, and a notification is generated when the patient has a
      genotype with a deleterious drug-metabolizing phenotype.

      Evaluating the South Texas community for the pilot project will enhance the understanding of
      the impact of genetic variants on individuals of Hispanic/Latino ancestry, especially as the
      variants pertain to the efficacy and safety of medications.
