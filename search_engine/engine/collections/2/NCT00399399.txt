      methylprednisolone pulse (15 mg/kg) at treatment start followed by oral prednisone (1
      mg/kg/day) according to a tapering schedule. Treating physicians allowed to treat minor
      relapses with corticosteroids without referring the patient for randomization, as long as the
      prednisone dose did not exceed 0.5 mg/kg for 1 month.

      Patients in whom prednisone doses could not be tapered below 20 mg, those who failed to enter
      remission and those who relapsed were randomized to receive either 6 months of oral
      azathioprine (2mg/kg/day) or 6 cyclophosphamide pulses (0.6g/m2 D1, D15, D30 then every
      month)
