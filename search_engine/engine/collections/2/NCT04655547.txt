      to weightloss due to insufficient energy- and protein intake, and a reduction in ADL.

      ADL will in this project have its focus on the eating situation.

      The projects research questions are:

        -  Will dietary guidance with texture implementation increase energy intake in patients
           being examined on an outpatient basis for dysphagia, based on the Fiberoptic Endoscopic
           Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) recommendation?

        -  Can a dietetic guidance with texture implementation increase quality of life and ADL in
           patients with dysphagia?

      Recruitment and data collection will take place at Hammel Neurocenter, DK.

      Each patient will be included for eight weeks, after their first FEES examination. The
      participants will be randomized to control or intervention, and strata into three groups
      based on Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) 1, 2-3 and 4.

      Within the eight weeks, participants have to show up three times to measurements, interviews
      and questionnaire, in addition to this, the intervention groups will have three follow-up
      phone meetings.
