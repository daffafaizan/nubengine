    
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine if survival to hospital discharge is
      improved with early therapeutic administration of a new Captisol-Enabled formulation of IV
      amiodarone (PM101) compared to placebo.

      The corresponding null hypothesis is that survival to hospital discharge is identically
      distributed when out-of-hospital VF/VT arrest is treated with PM101 or placebo.

      The secondary objectives of the trial are to determine if survival to hospital discharge is
      improved with early therapeutic administration of:

        1. Lidocaine compared to placebo

        2. PM101 compared to lidocaine The corresponding null hypotheses are that survival to
           hospital admission is identically distributed when out-of-hospital VF/VT arrest is
           treated with lidocaine as compared with placebo, and with PM101 as compared with
           lidocaine.
