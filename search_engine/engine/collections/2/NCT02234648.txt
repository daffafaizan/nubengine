      post ingestion. Additionally, vascular measurements including laser Doppler imaging (LDI),
      pulse wave analysis (PWA), pulse wave velocity (PWV), digital volume pulse (DVP) and blood
      pressure (BP) were performed with the participant in a supine position. LDI, PWV, PWA, and
      DVP were measured at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8h intervals. BP was performed at hourly intervals. All
      vascular measurements took place on the non - cannulated arm. No additional food or fluid was
      provided during the study period except for low-nitrate mineral water. Following a minimum of
      two weeks washout, the participants were required to return to the laboratory to repeat the
      procedure with the other intervention drink.
