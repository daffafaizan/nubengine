      include medical history and physical exam, lipid profiles and other standard blood tests,
      dietary evaluation and counseling, cardiology evaluation including EKG and
      echocardiogram,ultrasound of carotids and femoral arteries, CT angiogram and, if indicated,
      intracoronary angiography (ICA) with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and stress echo or
      nuclear stress testing.

      The recommendation for treatment will be individualized. Current options are a) FDA approved
      cholesterol-lowering medications: statins, ezetimibe b) LDL-apheresis c) liver transplant d)
      portacaval shunt e) investigational drugs. Treatment of vascular and/or valvular disease may
      include aspirin, beta blockers, clopidogrel, angioplasty with metal stent, coronary artery
      bypass surgery, aortic valve repair/replacement.

      Research procedures will include medical photos of skin xanthomas, blood assays
      (apolipoproteins A and B, LDL particle size, homocysteine, TNF, IL-6, insulin, glucose, ICAM,
      VCAM, P and E selectin, and endothelial progenitor cells), and DNA analysis of the genes for
      the LDL receptor and other lipid-related genes.
