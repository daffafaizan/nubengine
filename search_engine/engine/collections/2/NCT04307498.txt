    
      Intensive Outpatient Prolonged Exposure (IOP-PE) is a three-week, intensive, individualized
      program that combines massed Prolonged Exposure with military-relevant treatment
      augmentations to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Peterson et al., 2018). Recent
      findings indicate that IOP-PE significantly decreased combat-related PTSD in post-9/11
      service members and veterans (Peterson et al., 2019). However, IOP-PE is costly and requires
      a considerable commitment from the patient. Being able to prospectively identify which
      patients benefit most from IOP-PE will help treatment providers and patients make
      well-informed decisions about clinical care. The primary aim of this prospective, exploratory
      clinical study is to investigate potential predictors of treatment outcome following 15
      sessions of IOP-PE delivered over 3-weeks in a sample of 55 military service members and
      veterans (i.e., individuals who have retired or separated from the US Armed forces, active
      duty personnel, reservists, and National Guardsmen/women) with significant PTSD symptoms. A
      follow-up assessment will be conducted one-month following the completion of treatment.

      Predictor variables will include the following:

      Aim 1: The PTSD Beliefs Inventory, the Dispositional Resilience and Disability Inventory, and
      the Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire.

      Aim 2: The Disability-Recovery Implicit Association Test.

      Aim 3: The Treatment Motivation Questionnaire and Service Connection Status

      Aim 4: The Insomnia Severity Index, the Dimension of Anger Reactions-5, Patient Health
      Questionnaire-9, the Quick Drinking Screen, and the Pain Intensity, Enjoyment, and General
      Activity (PEG) Scale.
