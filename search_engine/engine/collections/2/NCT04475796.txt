      cholecystectomy (LC) is a commonly performed treatment modality for concomitant common bile
      duct stones (CBDs) and gallbladder stones. There has been a debate about the appropriate
      timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy after ERCP. The present study aimed to compare early
      and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after ERCP for CBDs and gallstones adding new
      parameters like Nassar scale.
