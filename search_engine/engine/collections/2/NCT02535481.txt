      therapy, SSG. In a pilot study carried out in our centre (unpublished data), the
      investigators noted that this technique offers a method of autologous skin harvesting with
      minimal or no pain and a scar free donor site. Moreover, complete wound epithelialisation was
      achieved while maintaining patient independence. Therefore, this device has the potential to
      save healthcare resources, by eliminating the need for theatre space and a hospital bed, and
      result in better Patient Reported Outcomes Measures.
