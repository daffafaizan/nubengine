      adolescent girls' HIV risk. Dating violence has been associated with less condom use, younger
      age at first intercourse, having multiple sex partners and alcohol use prior to sexual
      encounters. Thus, prevention strategies that address dating violence and HIV risk may hold
      promise for reducing sexual risk behavior among a particularly at-risk population. In this
      study, a cognitive-behaviorally based intervention named "Skills to Manage Aggression in
      Relationships for Teens" (Date S.M.A.R.T.) is being developed and compared to a
      psychoeducational program for dating violence and HIV prevention. The program is being
      implemented with a sample of underserved youth, as economic disadvantage and minority status
      have been found to be related to increased rates of adolescent dating violence. A primary
      focus of the intervention is to address mental health problems (i.e. psychological distress
      and behavioral dysregulation) that underlie the development and maintenance of both dating
      violence and sexual risk behavior among adolescent girls.
