    
      Primary objective: To evaluate in patients with HER2 + breast cancer, treated only by
      trastuzumab, the impact of three months individualized physical activity intervention (55
      minutes, 3 times per week) on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the impact of physical activity intervention on body
      composition, muscle function, metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory responses, pain, fatigue
      and quality of life.

      This study examines patients aged 18 to 85 years, diagnosed with early breast cancer with
      HER2 overexpression confirmed histologically and eligible to receive treatment with
      trastuzumab (adjuvant).

      This study includes 3 assessments phases: baseline (T0), 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T6) for
      both arms.

      The programme is organised as follows: Arm A "standard oncologic care coupled with physical
      activity intervention (3 times / week) " for 3 months ; Arm B (control group) "standard
      oncologic care".

      Between T3 and T6, volontary physical activity level will follow by actimetry.
