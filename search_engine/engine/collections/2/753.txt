red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency--a newlyrecognized cause of neonatal jaundice and kernicterus in canadaseven male newborns of chinese, greek anditalian origin presented with severe hemo-lytic jaundice due to red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) defi-ciency.  in five, the hemolysis was precipi-tated by inhalation of mothball vapours inthe home.  kernicterus was evident uponadmission in six infants and was fatal infour of these.g-6-pd deficiency should be suspected asa cause of jaundice in all full-term maleinfants of these ethnic groups.  the diag-nosis can be confirmed in any hospital bythe methemoglobin reduction test.  in areassimilar to toronto, canada, where thesehigh-risk ethnic groups prevail, the follow-ing measures are recommended: (1) detec-tion of g-6-pd deficient newborns byscreening cord bloods of all infants of theseethnic groups: (2) protection of affectedinfants from potentially hemolytic agentssuch as naphthalene, certain vitamin kpreparations, and sulfonamides; and (3) ob-servation of serum bilirubin levels to assessthe need for exchange transfusion for hyper-bilirubinemia.
