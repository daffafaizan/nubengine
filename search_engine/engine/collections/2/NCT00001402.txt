      congestive heart failure, appears to be a multifactorial process. Beta-blockers appear to
      reverse the deterioration and frequently improve left ventricular function in patients with
      both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The mechanism by which beta-blockers improve
      ejection fraction is not known. Although it is well established that regional flow, function
      and metabolism may improve after coronary revascularization whether beta-blocker therapy will
      have similar salutary results in patients with congestive heart failure is unknown. The aim
      of this study is to: 1) quantitate regional glucose uptake and regional blood flow before and
      after chronic beta-blocker administration to patients with congestive heart failure using
      positron emission tomography, 2) determine if alteration in either regional glucose or lipid
      uptake or regional blood flow correlate with improvement in wall motion and global left
      ventricular function, and 3) determine if ischemic and nonischemic myocardium differ in blood
      flow or metabolism.
