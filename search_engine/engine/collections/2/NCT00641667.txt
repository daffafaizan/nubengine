    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center
      (conducted in more than one center) and non-comparative study of fentanyl one-day transdermal
      patch. The study consists of 3 periods: Pre-treatment observation period (4-7 days),
      Treatment period (10 days) and Follow-up period (2 days). Treatment will be initiated at 12.5
      microgram per hour (mcg/hr) and the initial dose of fentanyl will be determined based on the
      daily dose of the opioid analgesic taken by the participant before entering the study and
      will be maintained for 2 days to ensure safety of participants. Dose escalation or reduction
      will be as per the Investigator's discretion from Day 3 to Day 7 and thereafter dose will be
      again maintained from Day 7 to Day 9, ranging from 12.5 mcg/hr-100 mcg/hr and the maximum
      application dose will be 300 mcg/hr. The patch will be applied on areas including the chest,
      abdomen, upper arm or thigh and will be replaced daily for 10 days (a total of 9
      applications; including the day of final patch removal). Efficacy will primarily be evaluated
      by visual analog scale (VAS) score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
