salt and water distribution in hereditary and in induced hypothalamicdiabetes insipidus in the rat.salt and water metabolism and the distributionof na, k, and water in gastrocnemiusand in aorta were measured in spontaneoushereditary hypothalamic and in surgicallyinduced diabetes insipidus in the rat.the degree of severity in the 2 types of thedisease was estimated in terms of saltand water handling.  water turnover in 24 hr.was about equal to body weight in thehereditary disease and about 60% of body weightin the induced disease.  skeletal musclena increased more than 20% in the familialdisease, and the gain involved both cellsand environment.  there was no correspondingloss of k.  similar changes oflesser degree were noted in the induceddisease.  the degree of na accumulationappears to be partially dependent on theduration of the disease.
