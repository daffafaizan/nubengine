    
      For one year, all patients, adults and children hospitalized in a post-intensive care
      rehabilitation unit (SRPR) of Ile de France and Rouen will be offered to participate in the
      SRPR Cohort in order to have a completeness of data on a new practice.

      The study of these data will make it possible to know the future of the patients and to
      establish criteria prior to the admission in the SRPR which could make it possible to predict
      this future and to select the patients as well as possible. It will also make it possible to
      know the impact of care on the outcome of patients at discharge, at 28 days, 90 days and 1
      year of their admission to SRPR to improve practices.

      This research will focus on the collection of data from patients' medical records. General
      information about their stay in the intensive care unit - including the patient's ventilatory
      status - will be collected upon arrival at the SRPR units, during their stay (weekly
      follow-up), at the exit of the SRPR, at D28, and in the longer term. (J90 and J365 of the
      entry into the SRPR unit) where will be listed more comprehensive data with, in addition to
      general information, data on nutritional, neurological, neuromuscular, respiratory and
      biological hemodynamic assessments will be collected.

      In addition to the common data base, each type of SRPR (respiratory and pediatric neurology)
      will collect data that is specific to its specialty.
