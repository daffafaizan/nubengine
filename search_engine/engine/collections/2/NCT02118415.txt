    
      Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in stage III A and III B showing at least
      stable disease after RCTx will be enrolled into the clinical trial. The aim of the study is
      to show the efficacy of an adjuvant treatment with Hsp70-peptide TKD/IL-2 activated,
      autologous NK cells following completion of standard radiochemotherapy
      (Cisplatin/Vinorelbine). Patients will be randomized 1:1 either to the interventional study
      group to receive 4 cycles of autologous immunotherapy with activated NK cells or to the
      control group (BSC).
