      opioid-tolerant cancer patients.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying the side effects of fentanyl sublingual spray and
      to see how well it works in treating opioid-tolerant cancer patients with or without oral
      mucositis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare the absorption/distribution kinetics of a single dose of fentanyl sublingual
           spray in opioid-tolerant cancer patients with or without oral mucositis.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients fast for at least 8 hours before and at least 4 hours after and no water is allowed
      for at least 1 hour before and at least 1 hour after study drug administration. Patients
      receive a single dose of fentanyl sublingual spray while in an upright position in clinical
      care recliners or beds, and remain in an upright posture for at least 4 hours after
      administration. Patients are instructed not to swallow for at least 5 minutes after
      administration and not to expectorate the drug.

      After study drug administration, 10 blood samples are collected over a 12-hour period for
      pharmacokinetic and other analyses.
