      stroke. However, it is also an important cause of peptic ulcer bleeding worldwide. In England
      and Wales, low-dose aspirin is estimated to account for about 10% of ulcer bleeding in people
      aged 60 and over [Weil 1995]. The problem of aspirin-related ulcer disease is expanding with
      the increasing use of aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.

      No dose of aspirin is entirely free of risk. Using a daily dose of aspirin as low as 75 mg,
      the risk of ulcer bleeding doubles that of non-users [Weil 1995]. Previous ulcer disease and
      concurrent major medical illnesses are important risk factors for ulcer bleeding with
      low-dose aspirin. Among aspirin users, those with previous ulcer disease have a 5-fold
      increased risk of ulcer bleeding [Lanas 2000].

      Various strategies have been used to prevent recurrent ulcer bleeding in high-risk aspirin
      users, such as eradication of Helicobacter pylori, the use of prophylactic anti-ulcer drugs
      or enteric-coated aspirin. Recently, the investigators have shown that the eradication of H.
      pylori is comparable to maintenance treatment with omeprazole, a potent acid suppressant, in
      preventing recurrent ulcer bleeding for high-risk aspirin users [Chan 2001]. However, about
      50% of aspirin users are not infected with H. pylori.

      The optimal strategy to prevent ulcer complications for high-risk aspirin users who are not
      infected with H. pylori remains undefined. Although co-therapy of aspirin with an acid
      suppressant reduces the risk of ulcer bleeding, drug compliance may limit its clinical
      usefulness particularly in patients who are already receiving multiple drugs.
