      of the real-time smoking intervention and to assess the preliminary efficacy of the real-time
      intervention as an adjunct to standard tobacco treatment. Rates of adherence, participant
      satisfaction, and perceived usefulness will be evaluated through post-treatment interviews
      and ratings. Biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence will be compared
      between the experimental and control groups at the end of treatment (week 8).
