      Xofluza may reduce household exposures to influenza among susceptible individuals.This study
      is a pilot study of a home-based approach to influenza infection control, utilizing self-test
      kits and rapid home delivery of an antiviral. Households with at least 3 individuals residing
      there at least 4 days a week, including at least 2 household members that are eligible to
      take antiviral, will be monitored throughout the influenza season for the onset of a cough.
      This study will be conducted in households in the Seattle, WA area for one influenza season,
      beginning November 1, 2019 and ending May 1, 2020. Household will self-monitor for onset of
      symptoms throughout the influenza season. When symptoms develop, the participant will
      self-test for influenza infection using a prepositioned home-testing kit. If negative, the
      ill participant will provide one self-collected nasal swab specimen. If positive, the ill
      participant will connect with a healthcare provider via the tele-health app on their
      smartphone to confirm the influenza diagnosis. Next, if eligible to receive Xofluza, the
      influenza-positive individual will receive a rapid home delivery of Xofluza within 6 hours of
      the positive test result. All influenza-positive participants will provide a self-collected
      nasal swab specimen at Study Day 0, Study Day 2-3, and Study Day 5-7. For all illness
      episodes, the ill individual will complete a questionnaire regarding symptom duration and
      severity, as well as behavioral changes due to illness.
