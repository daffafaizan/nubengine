      Standard culture media for fertilizing oocytes (unfertilized eggs) is commonly used in IVF
      which closely resembles tubal fluid. Efforts to create optimal culture conditions for
      fertilization of human embryos for women with poor quality embryos and/or repeated
      implantation failures have been developed at our center by using AECC. AECC involves placing
      a patient's fertilized eggs on top of a layer of cells from her own uterine lining, creating
      a more natural environment for embryo development and maximizing the chance for IVF
      pregnancy. The investigators will prospectively randomize young patients (â‰¤ age 38 years)
      poor ovarian reserve to AECC or no AECC with standard culture media to study pregnancy
      outcome.
