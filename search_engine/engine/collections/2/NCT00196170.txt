      isthmus-dependent atrial flutter: The (standard) radiofrequency (RF) ablation technique and
      the cryo-ablation technique. The RF ablation of typical atrial flutter has become a standard
      approach with very high curing rates and low complication incidence. However, ablation with
      RF is painful since the underlying cardiac tissue heats up (up to 70-80°C inside the tissue)
      and especially the target of ablation in typical atrial flutter, the so-called cavo-tricuspid
      isthmus, is a very pain-receptive area. Cryo-ablation, which destroys tissue by freezing it
      down to -80 to -90°C, is thought to be less painful or even painless with the same efficacy
      than RF ablation.

      The acute and long term (6 months follow-up, non-invasive) efficacy and safety is the
      combined endpoint.
