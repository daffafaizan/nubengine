      anesthetist change the randomized treatment conditions (called a "rescue intervention"), if
      surgeon considered surgical conditions to be unacceptable. This was to be done systematically
      as follows: If the participant is on standard NMB, the preferred rescue intervention should
      be to increase the NMB to a depth of 1-2 PTCs; for such a participant the second option (if
      participant is also on low insufflation pressure) should be the increase of insufflation
      pressure by 4 mmHg. If the participant is already on deep NMB, the preferred option should be
      (if participant is also on low insufflation pressure) the increase of insufflation pressure
      by 4 mmHg.
