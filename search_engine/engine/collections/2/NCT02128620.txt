    
      - Compliance with strategic documents: This project is in line with recommendations made by
      the Norwegian Public Health Authorities, that state that Ã¬change of sexual practice, i.e.,
      increased used of condoms and fewer partners, will be the main focus of containment (of
      sexually transmitted diseases).

      - Relevance to society: The premise guiding the development of the Game-Based Appointment
      System is that Information and Communication Technology may facilitate the access to health
      services to youth regarding sexual health and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, as
      well as increase their exposure in an educative environment. Early triage of health service
      consumers is now more and more used as an effective way to reduce expenses and the use of
      healthcare staff resources.

      - Environmental perspectives: The project will provide a health related social network aimed
      at empowering the citizens to better understand and prevent sexually transmitted diseases,
      therefore minimizing the number of travels to visit the doctor at the healthcare service.

      - Ethical aspects: The research activities will strictly follow the regulations provided by
      the Health Register Act (Helseregisterloven) and the Health Personnel Act
      (Helsepersonelloven). Both acts (with accompanying regulations) being supervised by the
      Ministry of Health and the Norwegian Board of Health. To guarantee approval regarding any
      possible use of data in a personal way, this project will pursue conformance to the
      regulations of the Personal Data Act (based on the European Data Protection Directive). The
      Personal Data act and other relevant acts and regulations are enforced and supervised by the
      Norwegian Data Inspectorate (Datatilsynet).

      - Gender equality and gender perspectives: The planning of the this research project has
      stressed that the selection of participants and the conduct of the trial will all be
      gender-neutral.
