amino acid transport in the lens in relation to sugar cataracts .the steady state distribution of free amino acids between the lens andaqueous humor is significantly reduced in diabetic rabbits and also inrats fed rations containing high concentrations of xylose or galactose .the reduction in the level of amino acids in the lens is apparently adirect effect of the high concentration of sugars, but it is doubtfulwhether it is related to cataract formation .
