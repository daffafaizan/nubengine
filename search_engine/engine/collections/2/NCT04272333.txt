    
      CIVO is a research tool composed of a hand-held single-use sterile injector coupled with
      fluorescent tracking microspheres called CIVO GLO that mark the sites of drug microdose
      injection, enabling rapid assessment of multiple oncology drugs or drug combinations
      simultaneously within a patient's tumor. In this Phase 0 intratumoral microdosing study in
      human patients with pathologic diagnosis of HNSCC with at least one lesion (primary,
      recurrent, or effaced metastatic lymph nodes) for which there is a planned surgical
      intervention, we will evaluate motolimod's ability to activate immune effector cells within
      the local tumor microenvironment. Additionally, this study will examine motolimod in
      combination with nivolumab to study whether motolimod enhances the localized immune responses
      compared to those of either immunotherapy alone. Motolimod singly and in combination with
      nivolumab will be delivered intratumorally in subtherapeutic microdose quantities via CIVO.

      The CIVO device penetrates solid tumors and delivers subtherapeutic microdoses of up to eight
      anti-cancer agents or combinations of anti-cancer agents co-injected with CIVO GLO into
      discrete regions of the tumor. At the time of the planned surgical intervention (at least
      four hours to up to four days after the CIVO microdose injection), the injected tumor tissue
      is then excised and tumor responses are assessed via histological staining of tumor
      cross-sections sampled perpendicular to each injection column. Co-injection with CIVO GLO
      enables identification of each injection site during resection as well as in tissues stained
      for analysis. Because the platform delivers microdose amounts of each test agent or
      combination directly into the patient's tumor tissue, hypotheses can be tested earlier in the
      drug development process, consistent with the goals of the 2006 FDA Exploratory IND Guidance
      for Industry.
