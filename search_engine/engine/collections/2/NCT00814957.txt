      healthy male volunteers. The time course and degree of D3 receptor occupancy (RO) after
      single doses of GSK618334 will be determined using 11C-PHNO as a PET ligand labeling dopamine
      receptor. The PK/PD relationship between plasma concentrations of GSK618334 and D3 RO will be
      described. Potential relationships between D3 RO and functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) endpoints will be assessed as an exploratory aim.
