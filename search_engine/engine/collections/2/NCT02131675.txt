        1. To determine if C-peptide is detectable in the sera of children that have had type 1
           diabetes for more than 1 year using an ultrasensitive assay.

        2. To correlate C-peptide levels with duration since diagnosis, current age, antibody
           titers at diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c, total daily insulin dosage.

        3. To determine responsiveness of residual C-peptide to mixed-meal testing.
