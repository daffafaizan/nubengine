    
      This is a Phase 4, single arm, open-label, study designed to demonstrate the safety,
      tolerability, efficacy, antiviral and immunological activity of Maraviroc in combination with
      Raltegravir and Darunavir/Ritonavir in patients with limited to no treatment option in HIV-1
      infected subjects ≥ 21 years old.

      The trial population will comprise 60 HIV-infected subjects with history of triple class
      antiretroviral failure, naïve to CCR5-inhibitors, integrase-inhibitors and darunavir will be
      evaluated. Single arm, stratified according to plasma viral load at screening (> or < 100,000
      copies/ml).

      Those with evidence of R5 viruses and susceptibility to darunavir in the resistance testing
      analysis, plus history of failure to NRTIs, NNRTIs and at least one PI, plus a genotype
      analysis showing evidence of resistance to NRTIs (at least 2 TAMS and/or Q151M and or 69ss),
      resistance to PIs (at least 2 major mutations), will start a regimen of maraviroc,
      raltegravir and ritonavir boosted darunavir.

      This trial will consist of a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a 48-week treatment period,
      with interim analysis at 16 and 24 weeks. Followed by a 4-week post-treatment follow-up (FU)
      period.

      Virologic response, CD4 count change, clinical outcomes and safety will be followed
      throughout the study.
