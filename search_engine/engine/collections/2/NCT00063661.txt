      underlying neural correlates of the problem are not understood. In the present study, to
      investigate the brain activity contributing to this disorder, we will use specially designed
      dual-task paradigm and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Thirty
      patients with PD will be asked to perform sequential finger-tapping movement with the right
      hand; results will be analyzed from 20 patients who achieve automaticity as defined in the
      study. In addition, we will use a dual-task paradigm to evaluate automaticity by having
      subjects perform either a distraction task (involving visual memory) or an interference task
      (tapping with the left hand) simultaneously with the sequential movements. Patients will
      practice to achieve automaticity. fMRI will be obtained before and after achieving
      automaticity. By analyzing fMRI results, we will explore the brain regions associated with
      deficiency of automatic movements in PD patients.
