      lengthening surgery were enrolled in the study (9 females, 11 males, 19-65 years old, mean
      age:45.2) Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups. For the
      first group of patients (A), prosthetic restoration started 6 weeks whereas for the second
      group (B)14 weeks after surgery. After recording of pre-surgical measurements, intrasulcular
      or internal bevel incisions were performed buccally and lingually, and full-thickness
      mucoperiosteal flaps were raised. Buccal flaps were reflected to a level beyond the
      mucogingival junction. The osseous crest and subgingival tooth structure were exposed. The
      osseous resection was performed after considering the amount of additional tooth structure
      required for restorative purpose and the preoperative Supracrestal Tissue Attachment at each
      site with hand and rotary instruments in a manner of establishing positive bone architecture.
      After root planing, suturing of the surgical sites was performed. The flap margins were
      placed at or apical to the anticipated crown margin after suturing and as far from the
      osseous crest as possible and necessary postoperative instructions were given. Patients were
      recalled 1 week post-surgery for suture removal, oral hygiene reinforcement and healing
      assessment. Healing was also evaluated at the end of the second post-operative week. All
      patients were reevaluated at 3 and 6 months after the prosthesis delivery.
