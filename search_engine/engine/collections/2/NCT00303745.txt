      Primary

        -  Compare the objective response or stable disease rate in elderly patients with
           unresectable, progressive, metastatic colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan
           hydrochloride with vs without capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life and ability to maintain self-sufficiency of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), number of associated
      comorbidities (Charlson index 0-2 vs > 2), and age (75-79 vs â‰¥ 80). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 2 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral capecitabine on days 1-14 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV
           over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study.
