        -  To determine if topical myristyl nicotinate (MN) is a safe, tolerable treatment in
           healthy volunteers.

        -  To determine if topically administered MN cream is associated with any significant local
           or systemic toxicity in normal human subjects in a one-month period.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and serve as their own
      controls.

        -  Arm I: Participants apply topical myristyl nicotinate to one forearm and topical placebo
           to the other forearm once daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive treatment as in arm I but on opposite forearms. All
           participants undergo blood collection for chemistry analysis (SMA-20 and CBC) at
           baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks.
