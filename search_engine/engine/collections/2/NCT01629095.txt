      United States. It includes a wide spectrum of conditions from benign hepatic steatosis to
      cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a term that describes
      specific histological characteristics of liver inflammation and seems to be a determinant
      step in the progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and liver failure. The overall purpose of this
      study is to increase our understanding of the genetic background and pathophysiology of NAFLD
      through detailed review of physical, radiologic and pathology characteristics, when
      available. We will perform genetic analysis of known and candidate genes and will assess
      inheritance through evaluation of unaffected relatives. Most patients will be seen by
      hepatologists in transplant centers and hepatology clinics across the country. A subset of
      patients and their families may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center.
