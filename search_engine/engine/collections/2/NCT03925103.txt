      stage non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC). Indeed, VATS is thought to represent an optimal
      minimally invasive surgical option which is deemed superior to conventional thoracotomy since
      it enables smaller incisions with no rib spreading thus minimizing both postoperative pain
      and hospital stay.

      For over than three decades, several thoracic surgeons adopted VATS for anatomical lung
      resection using two-dimensional (2D) display systems. However, a 2D image lacks depth of
      perception which may negatively affect surgical manoeuvring.

      Three dimensional (3D) display systems for VATS can offer superior magnified vision of the
      surgical field and better perception of depth during surgical manoeuvring potentially
      shortening learning curve, which may thus overcome some optical limitations of 2D systems.

      In this single center randomized trial our aim is to comparatively assess ergonomics of 3D
      versus 2D VATS lobectomy for early stage (stage I-II) NSCLC. For this purpose we compared
      three ergonomical domains: exposure, instrumentation and maneuvering with the aid of a
      scoring scale entailing analysis of 5 main technical steps: vein, artery bronchus, lymph node
      and fissure score.

      The evaluation process of the five surgical steps was carried out by 4 thoracic surgeons who
      individually scored all recorded operations.
