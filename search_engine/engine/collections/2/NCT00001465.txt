      Most of them are females of childbearing age. Currently, there is no proven effective therapy
      and the prognosis is variable. This study is designed to (a) define the clinical course of
      the disease and (b) elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease at the cellular and molecular
      levels, in order to develop more effective therapy. To accomplish this, we intend to identify
      the proteins and genes that contribute to the process of lung destruction in affected
      individuals.
