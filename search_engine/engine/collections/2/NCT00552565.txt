    
      We have fulfilled our enrollment requirements for this study.

      This study has been designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      parallel dose group trial. The study will be open to both women and men. At screening the
      patient will be assessed to see if they meet the Rome III criteria for IBS-D. After
      screening, patients will undergo a 14-day run-in period evaluation, during which eligibility
      to be randomized to drug or placebo will be determined. Patients will complete daily
      telephone diaries during the run-in and double-blind phases of the study. Patients will be
      evaluated at regularly scheduled clinic visits during double-blind phase of the study.

      Patients who complete the study may have the opportunity to rollover to the open-label
      one-year safety study (ARDIS-3).
