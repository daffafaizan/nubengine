    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (combined complete remission [CR] and partial
      remission [PR]) of AZD6244 hyd-sulfate anti-MEK (selumetinib) therapy for patients with
      relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MEK inhibitor therapy. II. To determine the
      progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, duration of response, and overall
      survival with AZD6244 hyd-sulfate therapy.

      III. To examine biomarkers through down-regulation of phosphorylated extracellular
      signal-related kinase (pERK) and several relevant target substrates (e.g., monocarboxylate
      transporter-1 [MCT-1], Menkes disease-associated protein [MNK], ELK, c-v-myc avian
      myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog [c-MYC], and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha
      [HIF-1a]) in peripheral blood studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample and tumor tissue collection at baseline and at day 15 of course
      1 for biomarker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years.
