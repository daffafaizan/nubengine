      in female genital tract. But these studies are yet not well designed and the results should
      be interpreted cautiously. Although some of these studies advocating the Vitamin D deficiency
      as an negative circumstance on pregnancy rates some of the others don't agree. According to
      contradictory results understanding the actual role of those receptors needs more
      observation.

      Latest retrospective analyse postulated that, vitamin D deficiency in fresh single embryo
      transfer cycles may reduce pregnancy rates mediated by endometrium or ovarian reserve and
      stimulation characteristics.

      For this reason the investigators aimed to explore the effect of serum Vitamin D levels on
      pregnancy rates in infertile population undergoing frozen embryo transfer.
