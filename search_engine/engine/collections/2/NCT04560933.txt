    
      This is a single-center, decentralized, patient-centered, prospective, observational study
      utilizing biospecimen samples collected from hemophilia A subjects across the United States
      to evaluate and characterize seroprevalence and the rate of seroconversion of antibodies
      against AAV serotypes and exploratory vectors, and to investigate the associated factors that
      may influence the vector titers.

      Relevant medical findings will also be collected from the subject, as well as symptoms
      related to hemophilia A. The collection of medical history may include major illnesses,
      diagnoses, and surgeries.
