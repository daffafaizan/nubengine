      during the start of the 21st century. Subsequently reports raised concerns regarding adverse
      reactions due to elevated chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) concentrations as well as high rates
      of other complications and revisions.

      This was a single center parallel-group randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome was
      to compare Cr and Co concentrations at 5-years follow up following MoM-LDH total hip
      arthroplasty (MoM-LDH-THA) or MoM-LDH hip resurfacing (MoM-LDH-HR).

      Secondary outcomes were radiological findings, patient reported outcome measures and revision
      rate at 5-years follow up.

      The study was prematurely terminated in 2012 due to alerts and safety communications from the
      Danish national regulatory agency regarding early failure rates and high incidence of ARMD in
      patients with MoM hip implants [13]. At that time the study population consisted of 75
      patients out of 200 planned for inclusion.
