      the INR.

      The evaluation will consist of make several INR measurements using the device and compare
      these measures to the reference value.

      The INR will be measured using the study device on capillary blood drops taken from the
      fingertip. In the same way a venous blood sampling will be carried out to measure a reference
      INR.

      A total of 20 healthy subjects and 180 patients treated with vitamin K agonist will be
      enrolled in the study.
