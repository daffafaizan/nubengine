      risk factors for heart attack and to control the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Ideally
      angina is well controlled with medications alone, but invasive procedures are a valuable
      option for patients with persistent angina. The amount of angina among patients with stable
      CAD in the outpatient setting, however, is unknown. An Australian study reported that almost
      1 in 3 patients with stable angina being treated by primary care doctors had angina at least
      once a week, which was associated with worse quality of life. We propose to examine the
      burden of angina in outpatients with stable CAD who are being medically managed by
      cardiologists in the United States through administration of a one-time survey. The
      information from this study could ultimately help improve management of stable CAD and angina
      and illuminate potential underuse of revascularization. While cardiologists are generally
      expected to provide better angina control than primary care doctors, establishing the
      prevalence of angina among the best providers will help with a framework for interpreting
      symptom control among other practitioners.
