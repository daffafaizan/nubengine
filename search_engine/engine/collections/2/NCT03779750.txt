      population (pmp) worldwide, which has increased 1.7 times from 165 pmp patients in 1990.

      In Egypt, the prevalence of dialysis patients has increased from 225 pmp in 1996 to 483 pmp
      in 2008(according to last Egyptian renal registry) and the main causes of ESKD in Egypt,
      other than diabetic nephropathy, included hypertensive kidney disease, chronic
      glomerulonephritis, unknown etiology, chronic pyelonephritis, schistosomal obstructive
      uropathy, and schistosomal nephropathy .

      It is well established that diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause or in
      combination with hypertensive nephropathy are the most common causes of end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) in developed and developing countries. Patient survival in diabetics on
      maintenance renal replacement therapy including hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD)
      and kidney transplantation is significantly lower than that seen in nondiabetics with ESRD.
      The poor prognosis of diabetic patients with ESRD is partly due to presence of significant
      cardiovascular disease, problems with vascular access, more susceptible to infections, foot
      ulcer, and hemodynamic instability during HD.

      Hemodialysis (HD) is the first line of renal replacement therapy in the investigator's
      country. It is well known that patients on RRT are of greater risk for complications and
      worse prognosis in comparison to patients with the same co-morbidities but not on RRT.

      The most common complicatons of hemodialysis are hypotensive episodes, muscular cramps,
      itching, arrhythmias,and anaphylactic responses during the sessions.
