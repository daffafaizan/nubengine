      versus non-platinum-based chemotherapy.

      Endothelial function was evaluated via Angioscan( the apparatus that evaluate the stiffness
      of vessels by pulse wave velocity) and serum levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
      (ENOS),endothelin1.

      Patients with gastrointestinal, ovarian, bladder and brest cancer would be included.

      Patients with malignancies were followed-up from 2 weeks to 3 month after start of
      chemotherapy, Medical records and hospital databases were searched for all the patients
      treated with different chemotherapy treatment for any kind of cancer.
