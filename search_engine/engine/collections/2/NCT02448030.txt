      protocols. On the first day, the metaboreflex activation in upper limb will be randomly
      assigned to isometric exercise or FES intervention. On the second day, at least two days
      apart, random isometric exercise or FES intervention will be performed in the upper limb. On
      the third day, at least one week apart, all participants will be assigned to perform
      metaboreflex in a lower limb induced by isometric exercise or FES intervention. On the fourth
      day, at least two days apart, random isometric exercise or FES intervention will be performed
      in a lower limb. To evaluate the isometric exercise and FES intervention the post-exercise
      ischemia will be randomly performed to evaluate the accumulation of metabolites in response
      to activated limb (PECO +) and evaluation control without ischemia (PECO-). The experiments
      between PECO+ and PECO- will be separated by a 30 min interval. During isometric exercise and
      FES protocols the blood flow and peripheral vascular resistance will be assessed by venous
      occlusion plethysmography. Fatigue will be determined every minute by the 10-point Borg scale
      to assess rate of perceived exertion and by blood lactate. Blood lactate will be evaluated
      through capillary action at pre, immediately post exercise and at 5 minutes during the
      recovery period. Hemodynamic variables such as BP and HR will be recorded every minute during
      the protocols.
