      medication administration. In this study, investigators will be assigning families to either
      a control (current standard education) or and intervention group. In the intervention group,
      participants will receive interactive education based on learning theories that are thought
      to enhance long term memory. Participants in the interactive group will build their own
      action plan using colored templates and pictures. Participants will also learn to use their
      inhaler using teach-back methodologies. Investigators will then compare the two groups in
      terms of ER visits, hospitalizations, family confidence in managing asthma, asthma knowledge,
      and quality of life.
