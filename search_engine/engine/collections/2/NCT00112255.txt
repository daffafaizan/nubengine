      infections. Reports of new chlamydia infections have increased by 66% in the past five years.
      A National Chlamydia Screening Programme in England, and increasing primary care provision of
      sexual health care are part of the United Kingdom Government's strategy for tackling
      increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections. New strategies for managing chlamydia in
      non-specialist settings are urgently required: genitourinary medicine clinics are failing to
      cope with their increasing workload; and 45% of cases detected in the chlamydia screening
      pilot studies were diagnosed in general practice.

      Partner notification involves informing the sexual partners of someone with a sexually
      transmitted infection of the possibility of exposure, offering them diagnosis and treatment,
      and providing advice about preventing future infection. In the United Kingdom, this is
      usually done by specialist sexual health advisers in departments of genitourinary medicine.
      The effectiveness of partner notification in non-specialist settings in developed countries
      is not known. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of
      practice nurse-led partner notification with referral to a genitourinary clinic for partner
      notification conducted by a specialist health adviser, and to compare the resources used by
      each strategy.

      Comparisons: Partner notification at the time of receiving diagnosis and treatment by general
      practice nurses who received a one-day training course and ongoing support by telephone calls
      or visits from a specialist adviser in sexual health, compared with referral to a
      genitourinary medicine clinic for partner notification by a specialist adviser in sexual
      health.
