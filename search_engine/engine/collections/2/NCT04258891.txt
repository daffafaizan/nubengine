      HIV/AIDS affect 422, 42, and 37 million individuals, respectively. End stage renal disease
      (ESRD) hence places a heavy burden on health systems worldwide. Linked to that, the
      kidney-disease-associated mortality rate worldwide has risen over the past decade, now
      causing the death of 5 to 10 million individuals every year.

      In kidney transplantation, numerous parameters such as demographic, clinical and functional
      factors drive the deterioration of the kidney, sometimes leading to graft failure. Current
      approaches for investigating the relationship between these factors and graft failure have
      been limited by standard statistical approaches and by registries with an overall lack on
      granular data, including infrequent kidney function measurements for a single patient and
      convenience clinical samples. Identifying the determinants of graft failure with a dynamic
      approach may bring an original perspective to the traditional graft survival risk prediction
      model that are impeded by their reliance on low-granularity datasets, cross-sectional
      parameters, and limited follow-up.
