      caused by sodium overload or water deficit. In spite of several interventions to reduce
      sodium intake and optimize fluid balance, critically ill patients still develop
      hypernatremia. These patients also seem to have an inability to excrete sodium, hence develop
      a positive sodium balance. In animals sodium storage in the third compartment was found. Our
      hypothesis is that sodium storage in the third compartment is different in critically ill
      patients and this difference could play a role in the development of ICU-acquired
      hypernatremia.
