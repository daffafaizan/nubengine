      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or NeuroMyelitis Optica (NMO) spectrum disorder. Numerous questions
      have emerged regarding the management of immunoactive therapy in the case of infection or
      suspected infection related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, the recommendations issued by
      the French MS Society are to maintain the disease modifying therapies (DMT) for MS and NMO,
      but a case-by-case discussion with the expert neurologist for suspected or confirmed COVID+
      patients remain highly recommended. Besides DMT, neurological disability could also be a risk
      factor for severe infection, regardless of the age of the patient.

      It is therefore essential to have epidemiological data to describe the characteristics of the
      clinical expression of coronavirus infection (Covid-19) and factors enhancing the occurrence
      of severe forms in patients with MS or NMO during of the 2020 pandemic.

      This study involves all hospital and neurologists ensuring the follow-up of patients with MS
      and NMO via the 23 CRC-SEP and associated hospital centers. This multicenter study is based
      on an already functional network organization, grouping together around forty hospital
      centers, participating either in the French MS registry (OFSEP), or in the French MS Society
      (SFSEP). It also benefits from the support of the French clinical research network (FCRIN)
      through the thematic clinical research network on MS and related diseases (FCRIN4MS). Each
      day, participating centers will enter data from MS or NMO patients newly tested positive for
      SARS-CoV-2 or strongly suspected to be diagnosed with COVID-19 using a specific computerized
      record (CRF Redcap).
