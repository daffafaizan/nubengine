    
      Each period of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment,
      2-period, crossover trial includes a 7-day Baseline period, a 3-week treatment period
      (comprising a 2-week titration phase and a 1-week maintenance phase).

      Eligible participants will enter the 7-day baseline period of each treatment period. During
      baseline, participants will maintain their optimized oral MS antispasticity medication
      regimen and record their 11-point NRS spasticity score and spasm count using an electronic
      daily diary. On Day 1, eligible participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      sequences, each composed of 2 treatment periods, with administration of multiple doses of
      nabiximols or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

      Participants will be advised to titrate the investigational medicinal product (IMP),
      beginning with 1 spray/day, to an optimized dose or to a maximum of 12 sprays/day over the
      first 14 days of treatment. Participants should continue at the same dose level achieved at
      the end of the titration phase Â±1 spray divided into a morning dose and an evening dose for
      the remainder of the treatment period.

      Lower limb muscle tone, health-related quality of life, safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics will be evaluated during the treatment period.

      Participants who complete the trial will participate for a total of approximately 11 weeks
      (77 days), including the 7-day baseline period.
