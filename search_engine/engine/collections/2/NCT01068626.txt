      development of the metabolic syndrome and associated metabolic disturbances and it has been
      hypothesized that a selective reduction of visceral fat tissue would improve the symptoms of
      the metabolic syndrome. Treatment with statins decrease levels of LDL-cholesterol and reduce
      coronary artery disease (CAD) events. Although it is widely accepted that the majority of
      benefit obtained with statins is a direct result of their lipid-lowering properties, they
      also demonstrate additional cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects. The results of
      experimental studies have now shown that statins decrease fat mass in the visceral region in
      an animal model. In the present study, we will investigate whether statins can decrease
      visceral obesity in humans.
