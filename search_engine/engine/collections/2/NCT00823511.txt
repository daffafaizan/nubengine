      participants in the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) Study. The enrollment period is from June 2006
      through May 2008 and participants will be followed through May 2010. At all study visits
      participants will undergo interviews, a physical exam and laboratory analysis for HPV for a
      total of 5 clinical visits scheduled every 6 months over 2 years of follow-up. In addition,
      at each study visit, participants will provide blood for HPV antibody analyses. At
      enrollment, visit 3 and visit 5 a Pap smear test will be done. At the enrollment visit, study
      participants will complete a questionnaire designed to assess social and behavioral risk
      factors for the acquisition of HPV. At each subsequent study visit, participants will be
      asked to provide updated information to assess changes in risk behaviors such as condom use,
      relations with new partners, and tobacco use.
