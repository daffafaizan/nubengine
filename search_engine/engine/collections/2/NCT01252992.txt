    
      Primary objective :

      Search for predictive factors of tuberculous paradoxical reaction (PR), with assessment of
      clinical, radiological and biological factors.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Descriptive study of PR : incidence, clinical and radiological presentation, clinical
           course ; characterization of mycobacteria strains- Search for genetic predictive factors
           of PR

        -  Characterization of the specific immune antigene response during PR et analysis of
           different cell subsets implicated in peripheral blood and locally- Characterization of
           the anti-bacterial immune response before and after antituberculous treatment

        -  Preliminary search for new diagnosis criteria including clinical, biological (immune and
           genetic) and radiological factors.Methodology : Multicentric cohort study for a total of
           5 years (4 years of enrolment and one year of follow-up, with biological collection for
           scientific purpose

      Inclusion Status of patients (determined by a validation comity at M6)

        -  PR+ : PR with clinical symptoms

        -  rPR : pure radiological PR

        -  PR- : absence of RP after 6 months of treatment Development of the study

      Primary outcome :

      - Association between PR+ occurrence and clinical, biological and radiological factors
      harvested at the diagnosis of tuberculosis..

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  Association between PR+ and rPR

        -  occurrence and the above quoted factors.- Descriptive study : clinical, biological, and
           radiological presentation of PR+ and rPR, characterization of isolated BK strains in PR+
           patients

        -  Immunological study in 20 PR+ patients and 20 RP- : 20 patients per group will allow a
           80% power to detect, by means of bilateral Mann-Whitney test with alpha=5%, any
           difference in the count of specific cells corresponding to at least one standard
           deviation of the primary immunological outcome

        -  controls: variation between tuberculosis diagnostic and either PR time or M2 (in absence
           of PR), of the specific cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, gamma-delta lymphocytes, NK
           et CD4 cells counts

        -  Preliminary search for diagnostic criteria that can be used at the time of PR
           occurrence: variation between D0 and the PR of clinical, biological, radiological
           immunological et genomic of PR+ patients.

        -  Evolution specific and non specific immune response of mycobacterial antigen at
           tuberculosis diagnosis during tuberculosis treatment and after. Sample size calculation

        -  prognostic study : Patients will be recruited and followed until the achievement of a 20
           PR+ sample. The investigators will have to analyze 200 patients.
