      surgery has dramatically improved since with a mortality of now around 1-2%. Individual
      centres postulate that a perioperative mortality close to 0% should be the standard of major
      liver resection. Despite these claims, epidemiological studies showed a mortality rate of 6%.
      Outcomes in liver surgery are likely influenced by indications, complexity, centre and
      surgeon skills, equipment, centre and surgeon experience. The aim of LiverGroup.org is to
      develop an international data set on the outcomes of liver resections among a large number of
      international surgeons. The 'collaborative' model for 'snapshot' clinical audit is now well
      established and such research is a novel approach for assessing current practice in a short
      period of time. The primary objective of the study is to provide a verified record of the
      true perioperative morbidity and mortality of a representative set of liver surgeons
      worldwide in 2019. Secondary objectives include risk factors for mortality and morbidity
      using multivariable regression models. Any surgeon performing liver resections is eligible to
      participate in LiverGroup.org. All consecutive cases will be included and there are no
      minimum patient numbers per centre. Liver transplantation is excluded. There will be 3 months
      of prospective patient enrolment and 3 months follow up within the 12-month frame, January to
      December 2019. All liver resections, all indications, as well as all co-morbidities will be
      included. Liver transplantation, imaging-guided ablations and liver biopsies are excluded.
