      In this study, individuals will undergo an assessment that includes taking a history of their
      previous exposure to traumatic events, an assessment of current mental health symptoms
      including those associated with PTSD, and an assessment of physiologic measures, such as
      blood pressure and pupillary responses to light. For individuals who have current symptoms of
      PTSD and for whom use of the medication prazosin is a reasonable and safe option, a second
      phase of the study will be offered. In this second phase, how the individual's PTSD symptoms
      change when taking prazosin will be assessed. In addition, to test whether any changes are
      related to the prazosin itself or are part of a placebo effect, the individual will be
      randomly assigned to periods where he or she is taking a pill that looks like prazosin but is
      actual placebo (a pill with no active ingredient), and periods where he or she is taking a
      pill that looks the same but this time is actual prazosin.
