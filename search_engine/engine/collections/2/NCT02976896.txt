      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma.
      Prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is usually poor and surgery is the only
      radical treatment. Cisplatin (DDP, cisplatin), 5 - Fluorouracil (5 - Fluorouracil, 5 - FU)
      and taxane are the most adopted chemotherapy agents, with efficacy rates of 33%-40% as
      first-line treatment for metastatic or recurrent esophageal squamous carcinoma and a median
      overall survival of 6-10 months. New agents were needed. Apatinib Mesylate is a small
      molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The anti-tumor mechanism of Apatinib is inhibiting
      angiogenesis in malignancy by inhibiting VEGFR. Apatinib Mesylate was approved by CFDA (China
      Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. In the previous
      clinical practice, we observed that part of the patients with esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma were resistant to conventional treatments benefited from Apatinib Mesylate. Based
      on the research situation mentioned above, we decided to conduct a phase II clinical trial to
      further explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate in treating recurrent or
      metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after the failure of conventional treatments.
      An exploratory molecular marker analysis will be performed in order to find out the
      beneficial population of Apatinib Mesylate.
