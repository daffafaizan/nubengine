      must not have been using CGM regularly for past 6 months. Once consented and enrolled,
      baseline demographic and psychosocial data will be obtained. Participants will receive 12
      weeks of CGM supplies at no cost to them and provided with initial standard CGM introduction
      and education. Participants will then be randomized to receive ONBOARD or CGM-only. Those
      randomized to the ONBOARD condition will schedule 4 60-minute sessions with study
      interventionist (every 2 weeks). Hemoglobin A1c values, CGM usage data, and psychosocial data
      will be collected at baseline, 3-months (post-intervention), and 6- and 12-months
      post-baseline.
