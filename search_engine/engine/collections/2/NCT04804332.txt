        -  Multicenter

        -  Randomized controlled

        -  Parallel group design

        -  Superiority trial

        -  Non-blinded

      Primary Objective

      To compare the effectiveness in terms of time to next pregnancy between operative
      hysteroscopy and expectant management in patients with sonographic evidence of RPOC after
      primary non-surgical management of miscarriage.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Effectiveness objectives

           To compare the effectiveness between operative hysteroscopy and expectant management
           with respect to:

             -  Generic quality of life (QOL) (as measured by SF-36, HADS (Hospital Anxiety and
                Depression Scale)) and EQ-5D-5L 6 months after randomization

             -  Course of pregnancy in those women who have an ongoing pregnancy after
                randomization during the study follow-up period (including miscarriage, ectopic
                pregnancy and live birth)

        2. Safety objectives

           To compare the safety between operative hysteroscopy and expectant management with
           respect to:

             -  Necessity for additional treatment

             -  Out-of-protocol/unscheduled visits to the outpatient clinic or general practitioner

             -  Complications

        3. Cost-effectiveness objectives To compare the health related costs between operative
           hysteroscopy and expectant management.
