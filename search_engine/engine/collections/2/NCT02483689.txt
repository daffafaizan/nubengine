    
      This is a prospective randomized-controlled pilot study of 100 pediatric subjects, recruited
      through Phoenix Children's Hospital and Pediatric Surgeons of Phoenix, who will undergo a
      laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) for acute non-perforated appendicitis. The reviewer and
      subject will be blind to the treatment to help prevent bias. The subjects will be randomized
      by envelope using a random number generator, and the infiltrated solution will be given to
      the surgeon by the pharmacy.

      The subjects will be approached preoperatively and will be divided into three groups:
      pre-incisional injection of local anesthetic, post-incisional injection of local anesthetic,
      and (pre or post) injection of saline as the control.

      All patients will have a standard 3 port laparoscopic appendectomy, port placement, port and
      instrument type, and operative technique will be determined by the surgeon's usual practice.

      On induction, the following protocol will be utilized: a 2 mg/kg bolus of propofol, 1.5 mg/kg
      of lidocaine, 0.1 mg/kg of morphine, and 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium. A standardized anesthetic,
      using a mixture of sevoflurane in oxygen and air, will be utilized. Once the appendectomy is
      complete, a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg of ketorolac will be given prior to extubation. A total
      of 0.5 mL/kg of 0.25% Bupivicaine or saline, up to a maximum of 30 cc, will be injected using
      a 22g needle. Pre-incision: local will be to be given intradermally and onto the peritoneum
      under direct vision; post-closure local will be injected intradermally after closure.

      The subjects will be assessed for postoperative pain immediately upon wakening, and then 1,
      2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the LA procedure by the bedside nurse by using the VAS and by
      measuring the total amount of opioid use.
