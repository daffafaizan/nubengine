    
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively collect and analyze data on the FLUENCY® PLUS
      Vascular Stent Graft to summarize and describe real-world experience, and long-term data
      regarding its safety and efficacy and to compare these findings with published data on
      stent-treatment in iliac artery disease. The present study aims to collect clinical data
      about FLUENCY® treatment of atherosclerotic disease (stenosis, occlusion, dissection) as well
      as to explore safety and effectiveness data for off-label use in additional indications in
      the iliac segment that have been described in the scientific literature (vessel rupture,
      aneurysm).
