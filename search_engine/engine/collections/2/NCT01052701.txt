      inhibitors. Ribavirin is a drug used to treat hepatitis C infection. Both abacavir and
      ribavirin are approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA). The doses of abacavir and
      ribavirin used in this study are also FDA approved.Some individuals who have HIV infection
      also have hepatitis C. It is possible that they may need to take both abacavir to treat HIV
      and ribavirin to treat hepatitis C. Recent studies suggest that abacavir decreases the level
      of ribavirin in the body, in the blood and in cells named peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC's). Thus, taking ribavirin and abacavir together could lead to treatment failure for
      hepatitis C. Therefore, it is important to understand whether ribavirin levels are affected
      when the two medications are taken together.
