      approximately 20 United States centers proficient in these procedures that have provided
      informed consent for the above mentioned data collection (symptom questionnaires, medical
      treatments, complications, side-effects and costs). The observational registry will obtain
      the patients clinical data related to gastrointestinal symptoms for three years post-consent.

      At baseline and for a three-year period following a clinically indicated TIF or LNF
      procedure, data will be obtained from phone calls and/or during office-visits made at
      specified intervals. During these data collection periods, patients will be asked to complete
      standard validated symptom questionnaires as well as report on episodes of care related to
      their procedures along with financial costs of care.
