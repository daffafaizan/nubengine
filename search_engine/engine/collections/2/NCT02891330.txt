      the most commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide.The postprandial dumping syndrome
      is a frequent consequence of gastrojejunal anastomosis due to the rapid emptying of the
      stomach remnant in to the intestinal lumen. Dumping-related symptoms occur very early after
      eating (within 30 minutes), are not associated with concurrent hypoglycemia, and are most
      prominent in the early postoperative period. The symptoms of dumping syndrome include nausea,
      abdominal cramps, diarrhea, dizzy spells, weakness and cold sweats either with or after
      eating.This syndrome very debilitating for the patient can be improved by dietary and
      nutritional recommendations. We hypothesize that an individualized approach based on dietary
      and nutritional recommendations and monitoring of patients conducted by a nurse in the first
      three months after surgery would likely to decrease these problems and improve the
      postoperative quality of life of patients.
