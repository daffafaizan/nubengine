      infertility, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain. 10-25% of endometriosis
      patients need artificial reproductive techniques (ART) to become pregnant. Endometriosis is
      estrogen dependent, and in theory this means, that the increased levels of estrogen during
      fertility treatment will worsen endometriosis symptoms. Endometriosis is a benign disease,
      and treatment is guided by the patient's symptoms. Worsening of endometriosis symptoms during
      fertility treatment may result in cessation of the treatment, operation and risk of
      complications.

      This project will investigate worsening of symptoms in endometriosis patients undergoing
      artificial reproductive techniques (ART). The study compares endometriosis patients
      undergoing ART to two relevant reference groups; one group consisting women undergoing ART
      with infertility because of factors other than endometriosis, and one group consisting women
      with medically treated endometriosis not undergoing ART. Symptoms of endometriosis during ART
      will be monitored using a questionnaire that among other questions includes the validated
      questionnaire Endometriosis Health Profile 30® (EHP-30®). The questionnaire is administered
      before starting ART and later in the cycle before the patient gets to know if she is
      pregnant. The questionnaires as well as data collection will be administered electronically
      in REDCap® which is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and
      databases.
