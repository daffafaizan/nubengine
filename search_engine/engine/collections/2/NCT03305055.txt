    
      Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC)
      are funding this RCT for the following reasons:

      Primary Aims:

        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl +
           ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during twice daily burn wound care
           across a 7-day study period and 30 day outcome period.

        2. To evaluate the opiate sparing effect of fentanyl (usual care) + placebo versus fentanyl
           + ketamine (low-dose, sub-anesthetic, slow-infusion) during the 7-day study period and
           30 day outcome period.

      and

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To determine the short and long term effect of the Ketamine Augmentation Condition
           versus the Usual Care Condition on symptoms and syndromes of posttraumatic stress
           disorder and of depression,

        2. To evaluate several established and hypothesized moderators of the relationship between
           the Ketamine Augmentation Condition versus the Usual Care Condition on: 1) pain severity
           reported during wound care, 2) opiate use during wound care, 3) posttraumatic stress and
           4) depression.
