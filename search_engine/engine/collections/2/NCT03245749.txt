      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are beneficial to cardiovascular and cognitive health
      and the concentration of EPA and DHA present in blood and tissue lipids is positively
      correlated with these effects.

      As a result, national and global authorities recommend regular consumption of oily fish in
      order to provide approximately 500 mg EPA+DHA per day in a healthy population. However, the
      associations between EPA and DHA intake and blood and tissue status, and therefore
      physiological benefits, are highly variable and the factors influencing this heterogeneity
      are not well understood.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of habitual oily fish intake as well as sex, age,
      BMI, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on LC n-3 PUFA status in plasma
      phosphatidylcholine, non-esterified fatty acids, cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols in
      order to obtain greater knowledge of the determinants of LC n-3 PUFA status with the
      potential to develop more robust, and perhaps subgroup specific, recommendations for EPA and
      DHA intake.
