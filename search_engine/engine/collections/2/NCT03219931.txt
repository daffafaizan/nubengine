    
      Type of Study: Interventional single-center, double-blind, randomized study, with treatment
      and placebo controlled.

      Population: Only healthy babies were accepted. They were not treated with antibiotics,
      enrolled within 15 days from birth, and with an informed consent signed by the parents.

      Parents were asked to make an initial recruitment examination within 15 days from birth and a
      second one at the 91st day of age, at the clinic of Pediatric Gastroenterology.

      During the 90 days of the study, parents were asked to give 5 drops of active product (108
      viable cells/strain) or placebo and to daily take note of minutes of crying, number, color,
      and consistency of evacuations, and number of regurgitations or vomits.

      Probiotical S.p.A. (Novara, Italy) supplied the active product and the placebo. All data were
      collected in a database. Randomization was performed by an external operator of the study.

      STATISTIC ANALYSIS:

      Categorical variables were analyzed with the Fischer exact test. Comparisons between numeric
      variables between various groups were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test (in the case of
      >2 groups) and with the Wilcoxon test for independent samples (in the case of only 2 groups
      being compared). A probability value of P<0.05 was considered as the limit of statistical
      significance.
