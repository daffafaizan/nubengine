      in non-responder hepatitis C genotype 1 patients. Three escalating dose levels will be
      evaluated. Each cohort of 6 subjects will enroll sequentially. Each cohort will be
      administered PHN121 orally daily for 12 weeks. Subjects will be requested to return on Week
      2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 9 for evaluation and medication. Subjects will also be asked to
      return for follow-up evaluation for adverse events on Week 12 and Week 16.

      Three doses are planned and include: 2.91, 4.85, and 7.77 g/day. Subjects will be assigned to
      a dose level in the order of study entry. Initially, 6 subjects will be enrolled at each dose
      level; up to 8 subjects may be assigned to each dose level, depending upon dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) seen.

      Six subjects will be started on treatment with dose level 1. After the sixth subject
      completes 84 days of treatment, if no dose-limiting toxicity occurs, then the next group of 6
      subjects will be treated at the next higher dose regimen. If 1 of the 6 initial subjects
      experiences a DLT, the cohort of subjects will be expanded to 8 subjects. If fewer than two
      DLTs occur in 8 subjects, then the next higher dose group will be initiated. If 2 of the 6
      initial subjects or 3 or more (of a cohort of up to 8) subjects experience DLTs, no further
      dose escalations will occur; the study will be discontinued and the MTD will have been
      exceeded.

      No subject may participate in more than 1 cohort.
