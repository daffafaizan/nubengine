104. hyperbasophilic cells as anindication of proliferation ofbone marrow transplanted toirradiated dogsa study was made of hyperbasophilic cellswhich appeared following transplantationof bone marrow to 20 irradiated mongreldogs of both sexes.  in the main series ofexperiments the animals were irradiatedwith a dosage of 600 r., using a four-tuberum-3 x-ray machine  voltage 200 kv,current 10 ma, filters 0.5 cu mm + 1.0mm.al, target distance 60 cm., rate18-22 r./min.  at 1-2 days after irradiation,a suspension of bone marrow cells in adosage of 10 9 - 5 x 10 9 nuclear cells wasadministered i.v.  the marrow wasobtained by aspiration from various skeletalbones or by compression from thesternum, ribs and other bones.  a study was madeof the morphological compositionof the blood and bone marrow before irradiationand at 1-5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30days after irradiation and transfusion of bone mar-row, and thereafter at 10-15 daysintervals.  smears of blood and marrow werestained with azure-ii-eosin.  it wasfound that distinctive cells with basophilic proto-plasm and frequent incidence of animmature nucleus were present in the blood ofdogs following irradiation with 600 r.and transplantation of bone marrow.  hyper-basophilic cells appeared in the bloodat 2 - 4 days after transplantation and attaineda maximum 14 - 21 days later; thereaftertheir number diminished rapidly.  thetrend of number of hyperbasophilic cellscoincided with that of other donor elements(leukocytes, erythrocytes).  hyperbasophiliccells were not found during acute radia-tion sickness in dogs which were not giveninjections of bone marrow.  they werefound 3 mth. after transplantation of bonemarrow to nonirradiated puppies at 2-3days of age.  when the irradiation dosagewas increased to 800-1,000 r., the numberof hyperbasophilic cells increased andattained a peak sooner than after the 600 r.dosage.  such cells were formed fromthe donor cells.
