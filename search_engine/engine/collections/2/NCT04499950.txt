      medication, Contrave® (Naltrexone/Bupropion), is associated with achieving ≥5% weight loss.
      All patients will receive the POWER-remote behavioral weight loss intervention (BWL) and have
      a behavioral coach for the duration of the 6 month study. During months 1-3, the behavioral
      coach will call weekly. From months 4-6, the behavioral coach will call monthly. At week 9,
      those who lose ≥5%, designated fast responders, will continue with BWL alone (FAST-BWL) while
      those who lose <5%, designated slow responders, will continue BWL and initiate Contrave
      (SLOW-BWL). The SLOW-BWL arm will receive at least 16 weeks of Contrave (as per Federal Drug
      Administration [FDA] recommended administration) starting at week 9 and discontinue if ≥5%
      weight loss is not achieved at month 6. During month 3, all participants continue to have
      weekly calls with the behavioral coach and will be asked about symptoms, which may be related
      to initiation of pharmacotherapy; any symptoms are reported to the PI for further evaluation.
      In addition to total weight loss, the investigators will evaluate biomarkers associated with
      obesity, microbiome and cardiometabolic factors.
