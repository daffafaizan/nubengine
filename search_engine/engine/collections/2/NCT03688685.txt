    
      This is an open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      CAD-1883, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the SK channel, administered twice daily
      orally to adult subjects with ET. Positive modulation of the small-conductance
      calcium-activated potassium channels (SK) present in different regions of the brain aims to
      increase the channel sensitivity to calcium resulting in reduction in neuronal firing rate.
      In patients with ET, improving the regularity of firing of action potentials in the
      olivo-cerebellar network can lead to improvement in motor function.

      During the Screening period, each subject will undergo full assessment including medical and
      treatment history for ET, physical examination and other screening assessments. Patients with
      the diagnosis of ET based on the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria with a documented
      severity of tremor based on the clinician-administered TETRAS Performance Subscale are
      eligible to be enrolled in the study. The study consists of treatment groups receiving twice
      daily oral dosing of CAD-1883 for a treatment period of 14 days.

      This study is designed to enable the assessment of safety and tolerability of CAD-1883 in
      patients with ET as well as the determination of early treatment effect on reducing the
      magnitude and severity of tremor while limiting the potential risk associated with a novel
      investigational drug.

      Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study duration including in-clinic
      assessments of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs, 12-lead ECG,
      urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry, and CAD-1883 plasma concentration level on Days
      1, 7, 14 and 21.

      Efficacy will be evaluated using the clinician-administered TETRAS Performance Subscale as
      well as the use of a wearable sensor in the clinic and at home.
