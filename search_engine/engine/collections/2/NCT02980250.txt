    
      the premature infant have been divided into four group.The first group take the 0.2mg/kg/tds
      domperidone as treatment ,while the other group take the 0.4mg/kg/tds
      domperidone,0.6mg/kg/tds domperidone and the placebo respectively .

      An objective index has been decided to evaluate the severity of feeding intolerance in the
      premature infant. 3kg/kg 5% glucose will be injected into the gastric tube .The residual
      glucose will be drawed out from the gastric tube. The residual percentage is the main result
      of the study.

      The main result will be compared by the secondary result to help to explain the accuracy. The
      secondary result is the percentage of residual milk drawed out from the gastric tube from how
      many milk the infant take 3 hours ago.

      Any adverse effect will be recorded and analysed to figure out whether is associate with the
      domperidone.
