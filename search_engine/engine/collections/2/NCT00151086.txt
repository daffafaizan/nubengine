      responds to conventional hormonal treatment. When hormone therapy is no longer successful,
      chemotherapy is a treatment option. However, current single-agent treatment has shown to have
      limited benefit. In this clinical trial, investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of
      combining two chemotherapy drugs, Estramustine and Vinorelbine (Navelbine), in the treatment
      of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Estramustine has been used in the treatment of
      prostate cancer for many years. Vinorelbine has shown activity in prostate cancer. In
      addition, the effect of this treatment on the quality of life of patients will be evaluated
      as measured using the FACT-P.
