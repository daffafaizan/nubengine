      Primary objective: to identify which plaque features on HRMRI in patients with symptomatic
      ICAS are related to recurrent stroke.

      Secondary objectives: To compare plaque features in subgroups.

      Patients enrollment please see Eligibility part.

      Methods:

      A 3T GE (DISCOVERY MR 750, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a 3T Siemens Trio MR scanner
      (Siemens Healthcare, Ehrlangen, Germany) will be used in this study. The multiple sequences
      will include 3D time of flight (TOF) MR angiography, 3D T1-weighted imaging, proton
      attenuation weighted imaging, magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient-echo
      sequence (MPRAGE), and contrast enhancement on T1-weighted imaging.

      The parameters of multiple sequences on GE MR Scanner are followed. 3D TOF: repetition time
      (TR) = minimum, echo time (TE) = minimum; field of view (FOV) = 240×220 mm2, matrix =
      288×192, slice thickness = 2 mm, flip angle (FA) = 20, and scan time = 1:53 minutes. 3D CUBE
      T1: TR = 600 ms, TE = minimum, FOV = 240×220 mm2, matrix = 480×480, slice thickness = 0.8 mm,
      FA = NA, and scan time = 3:33 minutes. 3D CUBE PD: TR = 1500 ms, TE = 40 ms, FOV = 240×220
      mm2, matrix = 384×384, slice thickness = 0.8 mm, FA = NA, and scan time = 2:40 minutes. MP
      RAGE: TR = minimum, TE = 3.3 ms, FOV = 240×240 mm2, matrix = 256×256, slice thickness = 0.8
      mm, FA = 12, and scan time = 2:18 minutes.

      The parameters of multiple sequences on Siemens MR Scanner are followed. 3D TOF: TR= 24 ms,
      TE = 4.32 ms; FOV = 140×140 mm2, matrix = 256×256, slice thickness = 0.9 mm, FA = 18, and
      scan time = 2 min 14 s. 3D SPACE T1: TR = 800 ms, TE = 22 ms, FOV = 180×168 mm2, matrix =
      256×251, slice thickness = 0.8 mm, FA = NA, and scan time = 4:4 minutes. 3D SPACE PD: TR =
      1700 ms, TE = 23 ms, FOV = 180×180 mm2, matrix = 320×304, slice thickness = 0.6 mm, FA = NA,
      and scan time = 4:25 minutes. MP RAGE: TR = 776.13 ms, TE = 5.8 ms, FOV = 144×144 mm2, matrix
      = 240×240, slice thickness = 1 mm, FA = 15, and scan time = 2:39 minutes.

      IMAGING EVALUATION In this study, plaques will be identified as focal or diffuse but
      eccentric wall thickenings compared with normal vessel wall.

      Plaque composition will include hemorrhage and calcification. The anatomical location of
      plaque will be recorded as either one of the four quadrants of the vessel wall on
      cross-sectional images.

      Plaque that is distributed across ≥3 quadrants of the lumen perimeter will be defined as
      diffuse and that involving ≤2 will be defined as focal.

      In this study, enhancement analysis will include both grades and patterns. Enhancement will
      be classified into 3 different grades: non-enhancement, mild-moderate enhancement, and strong
      enhancement. Mild-moderate enhancement is defined as less than that of the pituitary
      infundibulum. Strong enhancement is equal to or stronger than that of the pituitary
      infundibulum. The pattern of enhancement will be categorized as focal, heterogeneous, or
      homogenous.

      The vessel and wall areas at the maximal lumen narrowing (MLN) site will be measured. The
      plaque volume will be calculated as the product of the plaque area and the thickness of the
      slices containing the plaque. The plaque/wall ratio was defined as the plaque area divided by
      wall area ×100%. The remodeling index was calculated as the ratio of the vessel area at the
      MLN site to that at the reference site. The reference site was selected based on the
      Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease trial method.

      STROKE MECHANISMS The stroke includes hypoperfusion, perforator (branch atheromatous
      disease), artery-to-artery embolism, or co-existing (combinations of these ischemic
      mechanisms).

      FOLLOW-UP At the 2 years follow-up, patients were contacted monthly by phone to determine
      whether any events had occurred at the first year and three months at the second year. Every
      three months, patients were examined face-to-face by two neurologists at the first year and
      every six months at the second year. The follow-up information included transient ischemic
      attack and ischemic stroke (in any vascular territory), brain hemorrhage, and all-cause
      death. If these events but death suspected, patients underwent brain computed tomography or
      MR imaging.
