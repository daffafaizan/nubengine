      Since different regimens (fed, fasted and moderate versus vigorous) will be compared in the
      same subjects, no control group is necessary. Subjects will perform a cycling test with 5 min
      incremental intensity exercise and 1 h cycling test exercising at a moderate-intensity (load
      will be selected after the incremental intensity exercise). The expiration of carbon dioxide
      (CO2) and consumption of oxygen (O2) will be measured, to determine the total fatty acid and
      carbohydrate oxidation during cycling. Concomitantly, it is planned to measure blood lactate
      and glucose concentrations during exercise experiments as well as a wide range of blood
      biochemistry parameters before and after exercise.

      The investigators expect to find optimal conditions for the sedentary population for burning
      of fat, which is the major source of energy during moderate-intensity exercise. Measurements
      of the fat and carbohydrate oxidation in healthy volunteers with a sedentary lifestyle will
      contribute to the understanding of exercise regimens for the most effective fat oxidation.
