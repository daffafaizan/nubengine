    
      Two-month randomized non-inferiority trial (the margin of non-inferiority is 20%) comparing
      three groups: self-refraction with adjustable glasses, receiving adjustable glasses;
      subjective refraction by an expert refractionist after computer optometry and receiving
      custom standard glasses; subjective refraction by an expert refractionist after computer
      optometry and receiving ready-made glasses. The main outcome of this study is the rate of
      glasses wear on twice-weekly covert evaluation by head teachers. And the continuous teacher
      assessment of wearing study glasses will be calculated as the number of times wearing
      glasses/ Total number of separate observations.
