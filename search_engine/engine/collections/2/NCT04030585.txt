      distribution parameters between groups. Pearson chi-square test, Yates Continuity Correction,
      Fisher-Freeman-Halton Exact Test, Fisher Exact Test and Marginal Homogeneity Test will be
      used to compare qualitative data. The results will be evaluated at 95% confidence interval
      and p <0.01 and p <0.05.
