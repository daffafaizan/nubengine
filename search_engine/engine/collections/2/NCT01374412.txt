      (morphological, DCE- and DWI) and VCT. Mice were not used for imaging purposes due to the
      small size. Rats were shown to be of optimal size for small imaging studies.

      147 patients with (suspected) asymptomatic MM were recruited for dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of the vertebral column as well as
      whole-body MRI using T1tse and STIR images every 6 months until progression and/ or
      occurrence of first osteolysis.

      While during planning and initiation of this prospective trial MM was defined by
      CRAB-criteria only, in 2014 the SLIM-CRAB-criteria were proposed by the International Myeloma
      Working Group (Rajkumar et al., Lancet Oncology, 2014) with the goal to treat patients before
      development of osteolysis or other CRAB-criteria. These criteria were consequently introduced
      in clinical practice at our institution during the observation period of this study, which
      affects both inclusion and progression criteria of this study. In order to obtain a
      conclusive cohort with homogenous inclusion and progression criteria, SLIM-CRAB-criteria
      where retrospectively applied to restage all patients regarding inclusion and progression to
      MM defined by SLIM-CRAB-criteria.
