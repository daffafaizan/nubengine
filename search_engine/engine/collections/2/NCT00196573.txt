      full-thickness tear exists, is subacromial decompression (acromioplasty). This procedure is
      based on the theory that primary acromial morphology, (an extrinsic cause), is the initiating
      factor leading to the dysfunction and eventual tearing of the rotator cuff.

      Subacromial decompression involves surgical excision of the subacromial bursa, resection of
      the coracoacromial ligament, resection of the anteroinferior portion of the acromion, and
      resection of any osteophytes from the acromioclavicular joint that are thought to be
      contributing to impingement.

      Several studies have indicated that the vast majority of partial-thickness tears are found on
      the articular surface of the rotator cuff which is not in keeping with the theory that
      rotator cuff impingement is primarily a result of acromion morphology.

      Burkhart proposed that pathologic changes in the supraspinatus tendon occur primarily as a
      result of overuse and tension overload (an intrinsic factor), resulting in superior migration
      of the humeral head during active elevation.

      Budoff et al., suggest that since the coracoacromial ligament stabilizes the rotator cuff to
      prevent uncontrolled superior migration of the humeral head, resection of the coracoacromial
      ligament during arthroscopic subacromial decompression may cause, in the long-term,
      additional proximal migration of the humeral head.

      Arthroscopic bursectomy with debridement of rotator cuff tears alone, without acromioplasty,
      addresses the primary anatomical pathology and may offer similar success rates to subacromial
      decompression, without the risk of future instability caused by resection of the acromion and
      coracoacromial ligament.
