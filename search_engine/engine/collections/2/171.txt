identification of species-specific and organ-specific antigens in lensproteins .the species-specific and organ-specific antigens of lens wereinvestigated by gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis techniques . itwas found that rabbit antiserum to bovine lens showed cross reactionwith other bovine tissues . these cross-reacting antigens were the b- -and y-crystallins . there were two major and a minor organ-specificantigen in lens . both the major antigens had a mobility and wereidentified as the a-crystallin of lens .
