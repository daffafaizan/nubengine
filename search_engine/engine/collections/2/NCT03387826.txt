    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single blind, single center, crossover study. Eligible
      patients undergoing P2Y12 receptor antagonist therapy before screening will undergo a 14-day
      minimum washout period before randomization. Following screening/washout period (visit 1),
      patients will be randomized (visit 2, time 0) in 1:1 fashion to either prasugrel 5 mg od or
      ticagrelor 60 mg bid. Following 14Â±2 days (visit 3) patients will receive alternate treatment
      for additional 14 days (visit 4). Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed with the
      VerifyNow P2Y12 reaction assay at time 0, prior to first study drug dose. At visit 3 platelet
      function will be assessed at 2-4 hours post dose and prior to crossover. At visit 4 also
      platelet function will be assessed at 2-4 hours post study drug post dose. All patients will
      receive concomitant aspirin (100 mg/d) and standard secondary prevention medication.

      The primary endpoint is the platelet reactivity measured in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) at the
      end of the 2 study periods (pre-crossover and post-crossover).
