      SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated or not with IMUNO TF® and a combination of
      nutraceuticals and who have tested positive in a COVID-19 diagnostic test based on the
      duration of symptoms.

      Sample size calculation was established according to the ICH guidelines, where it was
      specified that the number of patients should be sufficient to provide a safe response about
      the issues raised.

      The mean duration of mild/moderate symptoms of COVID-19 was 11.5±5.7 days. A sample of 18
      patients would be sufficient to estimate, with a 95% confidence and a precision of +/- 2.8
      days, a mean duration of symptoms with a standard deviation of 5.7 days. Assuming a loss of
      10% of patients, the sample size was 20 patients. Considering the two groups of patients
      (treated with IMUNO TF® / not treated with IMUNO TF®), the sample size was 40 patients, 20
      patients per group. The calculations were performed with the help of the PASS package,
      version 2011.

      DATA PROCESSING Study data were collected in a CRD and inserted the data in a database
      specifically designed for the study. The database included internal consistency ranges and
      rules to ensure data quality control.
