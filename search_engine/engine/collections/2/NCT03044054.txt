      HIFU is a completely alternative to surgery which utilizes high-energy ultrasound to deliver
      a large amount of sound energy to a focal point to rapidly induce tissue heating to
      85-90Â°C.This initiates tissue coagulation followed by tissue necrosis ablating the targeted
      area.
