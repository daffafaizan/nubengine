      standardized breakfast of a cereal bar, orange juice and fruit cup, participants will consume
      isocaloric snacks of white chocolate, 2 types of dark chocolate or control (water), followed
      by an ad libitum pizza lunch 90 minutes later. Upon arrival, at baseline (0 minutes),
      participants will be asked to complete the motivation-to-eat, global vigor and subjective
      emotion visual analogue scales (VAS), a battery of cognitive performance tasks and have blood
      samples taken, as reported and validated in our previous studies. Over the 90 minute testing
      period, blood samples will be taken,the VAS questions will be completed and cognitive tasks
      will be completed. Cognitive performance assessments will include learning and memory,
      spatial memory, attention and processing speed, and executive functions. VAS measuring
      physical comfort is completed pre- and post-meal. Ad libitum food intake from a test meal
      will be measured.
