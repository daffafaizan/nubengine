      assess potential mobility-associated outcomes of PD. Investigators compare acute changes in
      gait and balance that occurred after repeated administration of two interventions: A specific
      real EA and a sham EA. The design of the experiments uses a control that accounts for both
      placebo and possible some active components of a generalized needle-insertion-based
      procedure. By using a sham control, the investigators were able to more fully test whether
      the specific EA intervention could lead to changes in objective gait and balance parameters,
      or subjective self-reported improvements that are beyond placebo induced effects and the
      natural course of the disease.
