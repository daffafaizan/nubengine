      spirit, and promoting strength, balance, and flexibility. The physical aspect of yoga
      includes poses, breathing techniques, and relaxation. Inflammatory arthritis, a chronic
      disease characterized by inflammation of the lining of the joints, can cause long-term joint
      damage, resulting in chronic pain, loss of function, and disability.

      The primary objective of this study is to learn how people with inflammatory arthritis and
      knee osteoarthritis respond to an exercise program of yoga. To accomplish this, 30 persons
      with inflammatory arthritis or knee osteoarthritis will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. Group one will begin an immediate 8-week program of yoga classes consisting of
      60-minute sessions, twice a week. Group two, or the "waitlist" control group, will receive 8
      weeks of arthritis education followed by the same 8-week yoga program as group one.
      Participants also will have blood drawn, and complete various tests. The yoga classes will be
      taught by an experienced, certified yoga instructor, and are designed especially for the
      needs of people with inflammatory arthritis and knee osteoarthritis.

      This study will provide important data on integrating mind-body activities into the treatment
      of inflammatory arthritis and knee osteoarthritis.
