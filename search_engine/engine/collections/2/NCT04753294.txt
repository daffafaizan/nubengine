    
      This investigation is designed as a prospective, open and non-comparative PMCF investigation
      to confirm the safety and performance of Avance速Solo and Avance速Solo Adapt in low to moderate
      exuding chronic wounds. This is a multi-center study that will take place in approximately 5
      European countries. The target subjects are male or female, 18 years or older with low to
      moderate exuding chronic wounds (pressure ulcers (N=68), diabetic foot ulcers (N=34), and
      venous leg ulcers (N=34)) suitable for NPWT as deemed by the investigator. Two different
      options of Negative Pressure Wound Therapies (NPWT) will be evaluated through this clinical
      investigation

      A total of 136 subjects will receive treatment with the investigational devices within the
      intended use according to Instructions for Use (IfU): Group 1: 102 subjects in total, 34
      subjects per indication (pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and venous leg ulcers)
      treated with Avance速Solo and Group 2: 34 subjects with pressure ulcers treated with
      Avance速Solo Adapt. Subjects will be managed and monitored for a maximum of 4 weeks or until
      withdrawal from investigation for any reason.

      The primary performance endpoint will include assessment of wound progress compared to last
      visit during a maximum 28 days investigation period. Wound progression is determined by the
      Investigator and will take into account all aspects of wound characteristics. Wound
      progression will be assessed by the Investigator at each follow-up visit and measured by
      three outcomes:

        -  Deteriorated

        -  No change

        -  Improved
