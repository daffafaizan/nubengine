      physical activity (PA) policies in preschools on PA and indicators of health in young
      children. The proposed project is a unique collaboration between the applicants and Stockholm
      stad which will result in PA policies, that will be implemented in all 658 public preschools
      within the Stockholm region, having the possibility to affect more than 38 000 children.

      The current study is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions
      (intervention vs. control) and preschools serving as the unit of randomization. Measures of
      primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at baseline and at 6-months on an individual
      level.

      This study will provide robust evidence of the effect of structural changes, at the
      organizational level of preschools, on children's PA and indicators of health. Notably, such
      robust evidence is urgently warranted as Swedish preschool children's PA levels are low which
      will have long-lasting effects on their lives. Finally, as the intervention has been
      developed in co-creation with Stockholm stad it has the possibility to, if proven effective,
      be implemented rapidly within preschools.
