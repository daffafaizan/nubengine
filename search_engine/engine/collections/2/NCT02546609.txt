    
      This is a randomized, 16-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the effect
      of two fixed-dose combinations of leucine, metformin and sildenafil, NS-0200 compared to
      placebo, on the reduction of liver fat in patients diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD). Subjects meeting all the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will
      be randomized to one of three study arms.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change in hepatic fat content assessed
      by proton-density-fat-fraction (PDFF) employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subjects
      from : Screening/Visit 2 (Day-7/Week-1) to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 112/Week 16)
      receiving two fixed-dose combinations of leucine, metformin and sildenafil compared to
      placebo. Secondary objectives will also assess changes in serum alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) activity, change in circulating cytokeratin 18, a surrogate marker of
      necro-inflammation, change in HbA1c, change in fasting glucose, insulin and insulin
      sensitivity, change in blood lipids such as cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and changes
      in in C-reactive protein. In addition this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      NS-0200.

      Patients will have two screening visits, the first to determine their eligibility based on
      lab tests and the second based on the percentage of hepatic fat assessed by MRI imaging. Once
      qualified, patients will be randomly assigned to either one of the treatment groups or the
      placebo control group and monitored for a total of 16 weeks. Patients will return to the
      clinic each month for lab tests, and routine examinations. At the conclusion of the treatment
      period patients will again undergo an MRI scan to examine the percentage of hepatic fat.
