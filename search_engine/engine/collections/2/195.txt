the isolation and morphology of some new bacteriophages specific forbacillus and acetobacter species .the best natural habitat for bacteriophages is probably a semi-solidmedium containing actively dividing host bacteria . such conditions areprovided for bacillus and acetobacter species in rotting grass andapples, respectively . the bacillus phages found included one with alarge head and a contractile tail, and also a so-called killer particle,which had a 350 a head and a long contractile tail . this particle hadthe property of killing but not multiplying within a sensitive cell . anew morphological type of virulent bacillus phage was also isolated,.its head was oblong and the tail consisted of a short needle and a platethe one acetobacter phage found resembled coliphage t3 but was ofparticular interest because of the prominence of the head capsomeres andthe three-pronged tail .
