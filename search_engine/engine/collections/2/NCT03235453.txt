      Each session will last 45 minutes for each modality, twice a week, over a period of 12 weeks.
      Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate will be seen at the beginning and end of each class. In
      addition to the Effort Perception Scale - Borg Scale used to assess the intensity and / or
      discomfort during physical activity practice in both protocols. In both modalities of
      intervention, the evolution of the movements will always respect the limit of each patient.
      The binary rhythm protocol will be performed through forr√≥, meringue and bolero rhythms, this
      type of methodology was selected, because it is a stimulating rhythm that brings harmony of
      the movements, being able to be associated to improvements in the mobility, balance and
      quality of life of the individuals who Practice it, benefiting patients directly.

      The binary protocol classes will be divided into: heating (10 minutes) focused on dance
      styles that contemplate the binary rhythm, with walks in the marking of the musical rhythm,
      muscular release, breathing, movements for upper and lower limbs, always working musicality .
      The main part (30 minutes) will be divided into two moments, first individually so that the
      teacher can show and teach in a clear way the steps that will be performed then the
      participants will form pairs and perform the steps that were taught them. Every 5 minutes the
      participants will change their pair, so that everyone can have the experience of dancing with
      their colleagues. And to finish it will be carried out a calm return (5 minutes) to provide
      muscular relaxation with stretches and massages.
