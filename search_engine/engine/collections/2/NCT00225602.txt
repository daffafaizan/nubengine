      regarding their social situation. They were interviewed after one year and asked about user
      satisfaction and followed up in Danish registers. Register information was extracted
      concerning vital status, cause of death, use of psychiatric services and criminal record. The
      same procedure was carried out for a comparison group, carefully matched, from other regions
      in Copenhagen, where assertive community treatment was not implemented.
