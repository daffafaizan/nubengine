    
      Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder which results from reduced activity
      of the enzyme Î±-galactosidase A. This reduced enzyme activity results in accumulation of
      globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), which causes disturbances in multiple organ systems. Patients
      often complain of acroparesthesia, caused by small-fiber neuropathy. Limited information is
      available regarding effective treatments for small-fiber neuropathic pain in Fabry disease,
      and no standard-of-care has yet been established. Opioid analgesics are often used because of
      their pharmacokinetic properties. While effective, the use of opioids has complications such
      as constipation, physical dependence and addiction. The purpose of this study is to determine
      efficacy of gabapentin vs. placebo at controlling peripheral neuropathic pain and reducing
      the use of opioid analgesics. The investigators are conducting a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled, single center, cross-over study. The primary endpoint is percent
      reduction in hydrocodone-acetaminophen use.
