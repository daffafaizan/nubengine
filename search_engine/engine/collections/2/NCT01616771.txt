      blade can be placed more anterior and cephalad. The angle of camera would be optimized by
      inserting the blade further with the blade tip directed toward the larynx. This optimization
      may be more remarkable with smaller blade because it can be inserted with rotation.
      Furthermore, the location and the angle of camera are different according to GVL blade size.
      Considering that patient with difficult airway has hypognathia and more cephalad larynx, it
      may be helpful with smaller sized GVL (GVLs) rather than GVL selected by weight (GVLw) for
      improvement of laryngoscopic view in patients with difficult airways. We hypothesized that
      GVLs can provide better laryngoscopic view than GVLw and DL in patient with difficult airway.
