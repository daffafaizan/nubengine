      ablation to treat atrial fibrillation. Additionally, electrophysiological procedures not
      related to pulmonary vein isolation are also followed. The aim of the study is finding
      biomarkers that are able to predict short-term outcome of the procedure.The primary endpoint
      is defined as reoccurrences of atrial fibrillation within the first three months after
      pulmonary vein isolation.
