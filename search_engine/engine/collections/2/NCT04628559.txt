    
      A total of 63 patients 18-55 years undergoing septorhinoplasty, who were graded as American
      Society of Anesthesiologists physical status were randomly allocated into three groups,
      receiving dexmedetomidine (n=21, Group D), ketamine (n=21, Group K) and saline solution
      (n=21, Group S). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, cisatracurium and fentanyl.
      Maintenance anesthesia was done with 2-2.5% sevoflurane mixture, 50-60% oxygen and N2O. The
      groups were compared in terms of hemodynamic values, recovery times, postoperative agitation,
      sedation, activity, modified Aldrete and pain scores, side-effects and additional analgesia
      requirements at postoperative 24h.
