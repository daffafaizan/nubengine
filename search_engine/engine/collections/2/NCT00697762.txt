      1990's, there still exist those patients who cannot control seizures, and thus the advent of
      newer antiepileptic drugs is being desired. This is a multicenter, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind (neither the study physician nor the patient knows the name of the study
      assigned medication), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), parallel-group study. It
      consists of three periods: Pretreatment Phase (screening and baseline periods), Double-Blind
      Treatment Phase, and Posttreatment Phase (transitional period or dose-tapering/withdrawal
      period). Patients who complete Double-Blind Treatment Phase will be qualified to participate
      in the long-term extension study (Study 333369-KJ-03) following the present study. The
      primary hypothesis is that at 400mg/day of RWJ-333369 is effective in the adjunctive
      treatment of patients with partial onset epilepsy, as measured by the percent reduction from
      baseline in monthly seizure frequency of partial onset seizures. Safety is evaluated based on
      the following variables; Adverse event, Lab test, Electrocardiogram, Vital signs, Pregnancy
      test, Physician Withdrawal Checklist. Patients will receive the assigned dose (placebo, 200
      mg/day, or 400 mg/day) twice daily orally for 12 weeks (85 days)
