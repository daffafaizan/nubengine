    
      This study is performed using a multiphoton microscopy-based tomograph (MPTflex) developed by
      JenLab, GmbH (Germany) to image non-invasively normal and lesional skin. Skin lesions are
      imaged by multiphoton microscopy and images are compared to those obtained from
      histopathology through standard of care processed skin biopsies.

      Any biopsies will be performed by the health care provider as a standard of care procedure.
