      polyethylene glycol (lactose), and the other will receive dummy sennosides capsules (lactose)
      plus polyethylene glycol, with the same dosing protocol. After three weeks of one active
      treatment the patients will switch to the alternate active product and dummy preparation. The
      total duration for the study will be 6 weeks for each patient.
