      compared to observation without treatment. Patients were assigned to laser treatment or to
      observation with equal probability. The first set of MPS randomized trials, the Argon Study,
      focused on the effectiveness of photocoagulation with argon blue-green laser in eyes with
      discrete extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization. The study investigators, who began
      recruiting patients in 1979, estimated that 550 patients with AMD and 750 with POH would be
      required. Follow-up was to continue for 5 years to determine whether argon laser
      photocoagulation treatment could prevent or delay visual acuity loss in these patients.

      After the initiation of the Argon Study, a new krypton red laser became available. The new
      wavelength offered theoretical advantages over the argon laser for treating CNV that extended
      inside the FAZ of the macula. The Krypton Study design was analogous to the Argon Study, with
      the investigation of three underlying conditions, except that CNV was closer to the FAZ
      center.

      The third set of MPS clinical trials, the Foveal Study, was designed to determine whether
      laser photocoagulation was effective for delaying or preventing further visual acuity loss in
      AMD patients who have subfoveal CNV. Among patients assigned to laser treatment in the Foveal
      Study, argon laser treatment was compared with krypton red laser treatment of these lesions.
      The investigators originally projected that about 350 patients would be required for each
      clinical trial of the Foveal Study.
