    
      Participants admitted to inpatient stroke rehabilitation for physiotherapy services will be
      randomly assigned to either the Exoskeleton Program or Usual Care Program.

      Individuals in the Exoskeleton Program will have their usual physiotherapy sessions replaced
      with the exoskeleton intervention. The exoskeleton will allow standing and walking from the
      first sessions in rehabilitation, as the exoskeleton provides the physical support to allow
      walking in full weight-bearing without being limited by therapist fatigue and lifting
      requirements. Individuals in the Usual Care Program will receive standard physiotherapy care,
      which is individualized and hands-on with their therapist to regain walking, mobility, and
      independent function.

      Both groups will be conducted 3-5 days a week, 30-60 minutes per session until discharge (to
      a maximum of 8 weeks). Participants will be assessed at baseline, discharge, and 6-months
      after starting rehabilitation.
