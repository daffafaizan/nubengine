      assess and compare the effectiveness of Propolis and Chlorhexidine mouthrinse on gingivitis.
      Subjects with chronic generalized gingivitis with age group of 18-30 years will be selected
      for the study as the target population. Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be selected and screened for the plaque and gingival status before including
      them in the study. They will be randomly divided into three groups.

      Group 1: 15 subjects (Placebo mouthwash) Group 2: 15 subjects (Propolis mouthwash) Group 3:
