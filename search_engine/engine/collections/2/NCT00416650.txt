      Primary

        -  Determine the major objective response rate (partial response and complete response) in
           patients with advanced bronchoalveolar cell non-small cell lung cancer treated with
           erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
