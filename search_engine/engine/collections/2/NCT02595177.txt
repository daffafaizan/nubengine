      bilateral multifocal IOLs, monofocal IOLs with monovision with emmetropia in one eye and 1.50
      D of myopia in the other eye, or monofocal IOL in the dominant eye and multifocal IOL in the
      non-dominant eye, then evaluate visual and refractive outcomes, as well as independence for
      glasses after bilateral surgery with 1 year of follow up.
