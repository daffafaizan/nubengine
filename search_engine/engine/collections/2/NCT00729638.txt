           combination that can be given safely so small groups of people will be enrolled in steps
           in this trial. The first group will be given a certain dose of RAD001 and a certain dose
           of lenalidomide. If they have few or manageable side effects, the next small group of
           people will be enrolled with a higher dose of RAD001 and/or a higher dose of
           lenalidomide. This will continue until the highest dose of the drugs used is determined.

        -  Study treatment will be given in 28 day cycles. Both RAD001 and lenalidomide are pills
           that are taken orally. Both drugs will be started on the same day. RAD001 will be taken
           either every other day or every day for the first 3 weeks (days 1-21) of each 28-day
           cycle. Lenalidomide will be taken daily for the first 3 weeks (days 1-21) of each cycle.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic weekly during the first cycle to monitor side
           effects. The following will be performed at these clinic visits: physical examination,
           medical history update, questionnaires, and blood work.

        -  On cycles 2-8, participants will come to the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle. The
           following will be performed at this clinic visit: physical examination, medical history
           update, questionnaire, and blood word.

        -  At the end of cycle 8, a skeletal survey, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be
           performed to check response to study treatment.

        -  Participants may continue to receive RAD001 and lenalidomide beyond 8 cycles if their
           cancer does not get worse and they do not have unacceptable side effects.
