      to cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis whereas many studies have been reported liver damage in
      mice. The goal of this study is to know if co-exposition to chlordecone can induce evolution
      to cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis due to alcohol or viral hepatitis. At first, we will assess
      a group of patients with chronic hepatitis B, C or due to alcohol without fibrosis. And they
      will be compared to patients with cirrhosis exposed to chlordecone too. Patients will be
      included in 2 hospital centers. All these patients should have an active liver disease. The
      activity will be defined by histology or elevated transaminases (>2N), fibrosis will be
      defined by histology or an association of fibroscan and biological markers. Exposition to
      chlordecone will be evaluated by a blood chlordecone measure for every patient.
