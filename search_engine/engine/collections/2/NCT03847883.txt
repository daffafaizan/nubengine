      identify the important factors predicted stroke outcomes in acute stroke patient received
      intravenous rtPa. In Cohort A, During 2011-2012, 78 patients were randomly assigned to
      received intravenous rtPa 0.6 mg/kg , 0.75 mg/Kg, or 0.9 mg/Kg (1:1:1). After interim
      analysis during 2012-2017, in Cohort B, 330 patients were assigned to receive standard-dose
      rtPa 0.9 mg/kg. The good outcomes were defined as improvement of modified Rankin scale (mRS)
      by final score 0-1 or improvement > 4 points at discharge or 3 months follow up, absent of
      intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours treatment, 90-day post-stroke survival , and short
      hospital length of stay.
