      measure of treatment tolerability. While treatment with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)
      improves survival, it is associated with significant toxicities that lead to physical
      function (PF) decline. The average age of incident prostate cancer is 66 years, and in this
      older group of men, chronic comorbid conditions often co-occur with diagnosis, further adding
      to the risk for PF decline. With over 2.9 million prostate cancer survivors in the US, there
      is an increasing demand for adequate symptom monitoring and PF assessment throughout cancer
      care. However, there are currently no validated methods to systematically evaluate and
      predict PF decline. Thus, the overarching objective of this proposal is to determine whether
      the use of wearable technology to monitor objective daily activity combined with routine
      symptom reporting can predict PF decline. To accomplish this, we propose a mixed-methods
      approach that will provide quantitative information to help identify PC survivors at higher
      risk for PF decline as well as a qualitative aim gain a deeper understanding of the perceived
      relationships that PC survivors have with their physical activity levels and treatment
      symptoms.
