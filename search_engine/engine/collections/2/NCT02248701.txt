      influences the neural, muscular, skeletal, and body composition deficits that occur after
      injury. It remains unknown whether testosterone administration improves bone mineral density,
      muscle mass and muscle function, and body composition / metabolic health in hypogonadal men
      who have experienced ambulatory dysfunction subsequent to incomplete spinal cord injury. In
      addition, it is unknown whether testosterone or the 5-alpha reduced metabolite
      dihydrotestosterone (an endogenous metabolite of testosterone) mediate effects in these and
      other tissues.

      For this study hypogonadal men with motor incomplete spinal cord injury who present with
      ambulatory dysfunction will be randomized to receive testosterone plus the 5-alpha reductase
      inhibitor finasteride or a placebo treatment for 12 months. Testosterone or placebo injection
      will be administered weekly; finasteride or placebo will be administered daily. Participants
      will be assessed at study entry and at 1-6 month intervals thereafter. Assessments will
      include measurements such as a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, MRI scan, and
      muscle performance tests. Participants will also have several safety tests, including
      electrocardiogram (EKG) for cardiac electrophysiology, prostate digital rectal exam and
      prostate ultrasound sizing for prostate health, and blood tests to assess hematocrit, liver
      enzymes (AST and ALT), prostate specific antigen (PSA), cholesterol, and other health
      markers.
