      prevalence of 12-61% of the population. At present, there are no unanimous clinical criteria
      to achieve and accurate diagnosis and the imaging findings do not show a direct correlation
      with the clinical symptoms.

      Facet syndrome treatment is also controversial and, although most clinical guidelines
      recommend nerve block as a diagnostic test, followed by neurolysis as therapeutic technique,
      there are many detractors of this therapeutic sequence.

      The confusion is even greater when considering the variability of specialists who perform
      these techniques, the variability of methods used ranging from blind injections to injections
      guided by ultrasound, fluoroscopy or CT, or the amount of medication injected.

      The investigators have long experience in the percutaneous treatment of pain and in the use
      of different imaging techniques. Although the investigators objectives are multiple, the main
      one is to know if there are any difference in the outcome of the facet syndrome treated by
      intra-articular injections and the block of the medial branch of the dorsal branch of the
      spinal nerve.

      Along with the collaboration of other specialists the investigators want to address secondary
      objectives such as the usefulness of ultrasound and fluoroscopy in the treatment of facet
      syndrome and its comparison with those performed under CT guidance that is considered as the
      standard technique for its greater precision.
