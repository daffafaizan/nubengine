      To compare coverage rate of community based volunteers and rural school teachers in the
      distribution of praziquantel and albendazole to scholl-aged children To determine the cost
      effectiveness of using community based volunteers to distribute praziquantel and albendazole
      to school-aged children in rural Ghana.

      Study methods:

      A list of all school-aged children (6-15 years) in the study area will be generated from the
      Navrongo Demographic Surveillance System database and registers produced and given to all
      school teachers and community based volunteers who will be responsible for the distribution
      of the antihelminithics. The school teachers and community based volunteers will provide the
      drugs to both enrolled and non-enrolled school-aged children. Percentage coverage of
      school-aged children will be the outcome measure and compated between the school teachers and
      the community based volunteers. Stool and urine samples will be collected from a
      representative sample (916) of the children for laboratory analysis before the administration
      of the drugs for baseline data. Sample collection and laboratory analysis will be repeated 6
      and 12 months after the first round of chemotherapy.
