      "geriatric giants" (immobility, instability, incontinence, sensory deficiency, cognition and
      mood disorders) which lead to frailty, disability and dependence. Monitoring of health
      status, health behaviors and identifying socio-economic factors favoring successful aging
      will be significant. As the polypragmasy and adverse drug reactions remain a significant
      issue in the geriatric care, pharmacotherapy and medical adherence will also be examined.

      The additional purpose of the study is to evaluate the utilization and access to health care
      and social services in respect to needs for assistance and long-term care, as well as the
      level and different forms of these needs.

      The project is planned as a cross-sectional survey of representative sample of 6000 people
      aged 60 years and over. The study protocol consists of questionnaires (medical,
      socio-economic, dietary), comprehensive geriatric assessment, anthropometric and blood
      pressure measurements and laboratory tests. The data are collected by well-trained nurses
      during three visits at respondents homes.
