    
      Phase I open-label dose escalation study of topical artesunate, formulated as ointment, in
      the treatment of adult females with biopsy-confirmed HSIL VIN2/3. Fifteen (15) subjects will
      undergo up to a total of three cycles of topical artesunate. The first cycle will be
      initiated on Day 0, the second at Week 2, and the third and final cycle at week 4.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of artesunate ointment applied topically on VIN2/3
      lesions

      To measure the effect of artesunate ointment on histologic regression of HSIL/VIN2/3 to VIN1
      or less, confirmed by a colposcopically-directed biopsy, at study week 15.
