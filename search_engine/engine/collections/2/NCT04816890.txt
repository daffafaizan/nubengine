    
      After a run in period in case of basal insulin switch or Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)
      initiation, eligible subjects will enter a 3 weeks baseline recording period.

      Subjects will then be randomized to either M1 Pram P037 treatment or active comparator
      treatment (insulin lispro). Both investigator and enrolled subjects will be unblinded to
      treatment. Study participants will use CGM until follow-up visit.

      Treatment period will last 16 weeks. Throughout the 4-month treatment period, basal insulin
      and investigational products administration will be individually adjusted. Treatment
      Satisfaction Questionnaire and WHO-5 well-being index will be completed by subjects at day 0
      and after 2 months (Visit 9) and 4 months (Visit 11) of treatment.

      A safety follow-up visit, 7 to 14 days after the last administration of IMP, will mark the
      end of the clinical trial for the subjects.
