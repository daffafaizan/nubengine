      be used to determine autonomic response as psychological indicators by measuring the
      electrical resistance of the skin. The EPIC ClearView is a non-invasive digital
      bioelectrography instrument that is used to assess the electrophysiology of humans. The
      measurements are digital photographs taken in a brief exposure to an electric field. These
      measurements are quantified to produce a standardized Response Scale.
