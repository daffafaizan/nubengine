      impairments such as traumatic brain injury, post traumatic stress disorder and polytrauma
      which has lead to sub optimal medication self management. TRMDU is a medical device developed
      by INRange Systems Inc. that delivers medications and emits a sound alert to assist the
      patient. It can be used in a hospital, clinic, or residential setting. It can be remotely
      accessed by the health care professionals, and it allows physicians and other prescribers to
      remotely change scheduling or adjust prescriptions.

      Use of TRMDU in hospital settings is expected to improve outcomes by improving medication
      self management, increasing adherence, reducing medication errors, and thereby associated
      costs. Further, it may contribute to overall improvement in a patient's psychological
      well-being and quality of life.
