      therapy through a drug combination of Tenofovir (TDF) and Emtricitabine (FTC) can decrease
      endogenous retroelement accumulation, and alter interferon signaling in Aicardi Gouti√®res
      Syndrome (AGS) patients is reasonable and warranted at this time, based on existing in vitro
      and animal data. Additionally, this trial will further the investigators understanding of
      this disorder, measuring for the first time retroelements in human participants, exploring
      the retroviral burden in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the Interferon (IFN) signaling response,
      as well as evaluating antigen targets of autoimmunity and cytokines. If successful, this
      approach will clearly demonstrate the need for a larger trial of antiretrovirals in AGS with
      more clinically relevant outcomes.
