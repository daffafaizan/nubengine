      management of gestational diabetes. We hypothesize that glucovance will provide improved
      glycemic control and a lower failure rate with no increase in neonatal adverse outcomes.
      Sixty-seven patients will be randomized by computer to each arm of the study. Outcomes will
      be glycemic control, failure rate of the drug to achieve glycemic goals, and neonatal
      outcomes.
