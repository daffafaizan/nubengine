      time-limited behavioral intervention (HealtheLifestyle Program) as a supplement to standard
      HealtheTech products. Approximately 130 participants will be recruited and randomized to
      either the HealtheTech Program (focusing on calorie and exercise goals using the BalanceLog
      for tracking), the HealtheLifestyle Program (using step counters, monthly email letters and
      calls providing information on activity, nutrition, and weight loss), or a delayed treatment
      program (after 3 months undergo the intervention above).
