      350 patients in 12 months, the duration of participation of each patient is 24 months.

      An orthopaedist will see patients in consultation to take their measurements, patients
      complete a quality of life questionnaire (the SF 36), when they are admitted for surgery.

      After surgery, patients begin wearing their belts according to the instructions given by the
      surgeon during hospitalization:

        -  Start wearing the belt as soon as possible.

        -  wear it according to its recommendations: all day, every day of the week and for two
           months.

      Patients should record the number of hours they would have worn their belts in the EVINOV
      logbook each day.

      The studu Co will contact patients by phone every two weeks for the 2 months they will be
      wearing the belt.

      At the one-month post-operative consultation, the patient will complete a quality of life
      questionnaire again (the SF 36).

      Two months after surgery, patients receive a final SF 36 questionnaire by mail, with a
      satisfaction scale to evaluate their overall feeling around the period of wearing the
      abdominal belt. Patients are asked to return these two documents, as well as the EVINOV
      logbook.

      The latest health data collection is the imaging data from the abdominal CT scan at 24
      months, which will show the presence or absence of an incisional hernia.
