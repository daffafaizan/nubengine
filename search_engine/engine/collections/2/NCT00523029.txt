      Depression can severely impact people's lives, causing them to often feel sad and hopeless as
      well as affecting their sleep patterns, concentration, and energy levels. Treatment typically
      includes a combination of antidepressant medication and talk therapy. This study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of an adapted group education program typically used for chronic
      medical illness in improving the health status, health behaviors, and use of health care
      services among people with depression and a chronic illness.

      Participants in this open-label study will attend a group education program used to manage
      chronic medical illness. Group sessions will be held for 2.5 hours, once a week, for 6 weeks.
      Group leaders, also suffering from a chronic medical condition, will lead discussions based
      on the following topics: nutrition; exercise; appropriate use of medications; ways to
      communicate effectively with family, friends, and health care professionals; and how to make
      informed treatment decisions. Participants will also complete two surveys: one at the
      beginning of the study and one at the end. The first survey will ask basic questions related
      to participants' health status and any feelings of stress, anxiety, or sadness. The second
      survey will include a brief interview that will require participants to describe their
      experience in the group sessions and to suggest ways of improving the program to better
      accommodate people with depression and chronic illness. Responses to questions will be used
      to enhance the effectiveness of the group education program for treating people with both
      depression and a chronic medical condition.
