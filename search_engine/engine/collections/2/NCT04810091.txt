    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the percent change in N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) at
      6 month visit from baseline after initiation of study drug in each arm and to compare the
      percent change between the two study arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the change in functional capacity from baseline at 3 and 6 month visits as
      assessed by a 6 minute walk test (6MWT) in each arm.

      II. To evaluate changes in echocardiographic parameters (Carcinoid Valvular Heart Disease
      [CVHD] score, global longitudinal myocardial strain assessment of the left and right
      ventricle/tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE]) from baseline to 3 and 6 month
      visits in each arm.

      III. To evaluate the change from baseline to 3 and 6 month visits in plasma
      5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in each arm.

      IV. To evaluate the change from baseline to 3 and 6 month visits in high sensitivity troponin
      T in each arm.

      V. To evaluate the change from baseline to 3 and 6 month visits in health related quality of
      life with using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) in each arm.

      VI. To evaluate compliance of medications.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive telotristat ethyl orally (PO) three times daily (TID) and
      somatostatin analog therapy (SSA) for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO TID and SSA for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
