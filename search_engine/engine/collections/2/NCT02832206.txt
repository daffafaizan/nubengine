    
      Hybrid ablation (i.e. surgical thoracoscopic ablation, followed by catheter endocardial
      ablation) represent a new treatment option for patients with atrial fibrillation.

      60 patients will undergo a two-stage, hybrid ablation, all of them will have an ECG
      monitoring device implanted and will be followed for up to three years. Neurological safety
      of both surgical and catheter procedures will be assessed by three examinations. Magnetic
      resonance will be performed before surgery, 5 days after surgery and at the 180 days visit to
      search for (subclinical) cerebral ischemia. Complex neuropsychological examination will be
      performed before surgery, afer 1 month after surgery and at 180 days visit to search for
      changes in cognitive functions, behavioral functions etc. Transcranial Doppler will be
      performed during surgical and catheter ablation to detect microembolic signals.
