      I. Assess the durability of response to brentuximab vedotin (BV) plus nivolumab (nivo) by
      24-month progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with 1st relapse of classical
      Hodgkin lymphoma (RcHL) who achieved early complete metabolic response (CMR) (CMR after 4
      cycles).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate CMR and overall response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles and at the end of BV-nivo
      therapy.

      II. Estimate the PFS and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort and for subgroups of
      patients defined by their response.

      III. Estimate the PFS and OS separately for responders who did and did not receive
      radiotherapy.

      IV. Evaluate the toxicities of BV-nivo in the study population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the second PFS after salvage therapy for patients who progress after study
      therapy, and for the subset of these patients who proceeded to autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT).

      II. Explore the association between clinical outcomes and pathological tumor characteristics.

      III. Explore the association between clinical outcomes and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic
      acid (ctDNA) characteristics (mutation profile, kinetics of clearance).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over
      30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 6, 12, 18, 24,
      36, 48, and 60 months.
