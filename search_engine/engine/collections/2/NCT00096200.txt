      I. Compare the progression-free and overall survival rate of patients with recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer treated
      with sorafenib with or without carboplatin and paclitaxel. (Arm I [sorafenib only] closed to
      accrual 10/01/2008) II. Evaluate the response rate and time to disease progression in
      patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status
      and participating center.

      ARM I (closed to accrual 10/01/2008): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days
      1-28.Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with disease progression crossover to arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 2-19. Patients also receive
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
