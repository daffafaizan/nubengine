      on the results of phase III randomised trials. The current standard radiation therapy dose
      has remained 60- Gy at -2 Gy/fraction for nearly four decades (60Gy), with local disease
      control rates of approximately 50% and a median overall survival of only 18 months.These
      results are suboptimal and more effective treatment regimens are needed.

      We hypothesize that hyperfractionated radiation dose escalation to residual tumor volumes
      after standard chemoradiotherapy as defined by positron emission tomography (PET) /computed
      tomography (CT) would improve local control and overall survival while reducing the acute and
      late normal tissue toxicity.
