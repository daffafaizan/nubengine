      palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, fatigue and exercise intolerance. AF is
      also associated with a high risk of complications like thrombo-embolism and stroke, heart
      failure, dementia. The presence and severity of these symptoms and complications adversely
      affect a patient's health related quality of life. Improvement in quality of life (QOL) is an
      important measure for evaluating response to treatment in AF patients. Depression and anxiety
      are significant part of the psychosocial burden faced by approximately one-third of AF
      patients, and are important components that effect QOL in these patients. In this study the
      investigators will apply the 3RP (Relaxation Response Resiliency Program - developed at the
      Benson Henry Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital) intervention among AF patients to
      assess the reduction in their stress, anxiety and depression levels and the reduction in AF
      symptom burden and severity.
