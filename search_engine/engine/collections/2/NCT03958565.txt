    
      This is an observational study involving two arms of NSCLC with metastatic bony disease at
      the time of enrollment in the study. One group will have an actionable driver oncogene and
      initiate treatment in any line with a TKI as standard of care and concurrent to participation
      to this study; expected to have an objective response rate in â‰¥40% who have not previously
      seen anti-bone resorptive therapy. The other group will not have actionable mutations and
      initiate treatment with chemotherapy/immunotherapy along with new onset therapy with IV
      zoledronic acid 4mg Q4 weeks or subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg Q12 weeks for bone disease,
      which is standard of care and would be concurrent to participation in this study.

      Baseline and on-treatment imaging and serum total alkaline phosphatase will be performed per
      SOC.

      Additional non-SOC bone turnover markers including , urine N-telopeptide (NTX) and serum
      C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), will be checked at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
