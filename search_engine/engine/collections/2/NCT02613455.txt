      epicondylitis at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. While corticosteroid
      injections have been shown to be moderately effective in the short term for the condition, a
      significant minority of patients remains symptomatic. Low energy ESWT has mixed results in
      the orthopaedic literature, but to date no study has specifically examined the effects of
      high energy ESWT. The investigators plan to randomize a total of 80 patients with the
      diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis to either corticosteroid injection or high energy ESWT,
      and follow them for a total of 12 months. Primary outcomes will be Disabilities of the Arm,
      Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, Patient Reported Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) score, Mayo
      Elbow Score, Veterans Rand-36, and return-to-work status. Patients will be surveyed at
      baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. All assessments will be done by an independent
      physician examiner who is blinded to the treatment received.
