      Aggregometry method(LTA). Secondary clinical endpoints included a 30-day major adverse
      cardiovascular endpoint (MACE) defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent
      myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation or stroke and individual components of
      the MACE. Safety endpoints of 30-day TIMI major and minor bleed were also evaluated.
