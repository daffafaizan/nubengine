      more than 50% of blindness and visual impairment in the developing world. One of the most
      important features of a blade for cataract surgery is its predictable and repeatable
      behavior. The surgeon repeatedly and reliably needs to create similar tunnels of the proper
      length. Aurolab is producing surgical blades (Aurosleek) intended for making incision in
      cataract surgeries.
