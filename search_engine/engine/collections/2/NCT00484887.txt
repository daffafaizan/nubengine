      occur in the materials in vivo to use the information to help design new mesh made from novel
      materials. We will have evidence that our current options are not only inadequate but can
      lead to complications. One of our main goals is to convince our colleagues to change their
      surgical practice by publishing and educating them with this data. The objectives of this
      study are to establish the largest collection of explanted mesh materials in the country;
      demonstrate by common testing utilized by materials engineers, that in vivo exposure of mesh
      to the oxidants produced by phagocytosis may lead to chain scission, production of free
      radicals, and overall degradation of the material both physically and chemically; test mesh
      materials for a decrease in compliance, which would account for a tendency of mesh to stiffen
      while in the body reducing abdominal mobility and leading to chronic pain; characterize the
      histologic reaction of tissues to mesh; and utilize de-identified patient demographics to
      identify possible clinical characteristics which affect mesh degradation.
