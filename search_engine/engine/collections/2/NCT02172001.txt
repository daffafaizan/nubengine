      (QoL) burden on the subjects and the treatment of these subjects includes replenishing lost
      iron. Oral iron administration is often used in the clinical practice at many clinics;
      however, oral iron may not be tolerated by all subjects. Hence, there is a need for an
      alternative iron treatment in subjects, who do not tolerate oral iron.

      This study is planned to compare the efficacy and safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 with
      placebo in subjects with IDA and who are intolerant or unresponsive to oral iron therapy..
