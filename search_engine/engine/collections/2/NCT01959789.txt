      usually with one week interval between sessions, without a scientific and plausible reason
      for this recommendation (. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tooth sensitivity (TS)
      risk using a shorter interval between clinical sessions. Methods: In this randomized,
      single-blind study, 40 young patients with color C2 or darker were selected and randomly
      divided in two groups. In the 7-day group, two bleaching sessions with a 35% hydrogen
      peroxide gel (Whiteness HP Blue Calcium - FGM) were performed with a one-week interval and in
      the 2-day group, the same protocol was performed but with a 2-day interval. TS was recorded
      on a 0-10 visual analog scale up to 48 h after bleaching. The color evaluation was performed
      at baseline and 30 days after bleaching with a value-oriented shade guide and a
      spectrophotometer. The absolute risk of TS (%) was evaluated by Fisher´s exact. The TS
      intensity was evaluated by two-way repeated measured ANOVA and color changes (ΔSGU and ΔE)
      were evaluated by Student´s t-test (alpha = 5%).
