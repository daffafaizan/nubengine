      year period which corresponds to 5 -7 mm mainly from the buccal rather than palatal\lingual
      aspects. Several calcium phosphates from bovine and synthetics sources are used for
      preservation of extraction socket; however with variable degrees of success. The aim of the
      present study is to evaluate clinically, radiographically and histologically the effect of
      Silica-calcium phosphate composite (SCPC) granules on new bone formation qualitatively and
      quantitatively following socket augmentation. This case series study was performed in five (n
      = 5) participants (one male and four females), all participants underwent socket augmentation
      procedures and dental implant placement in a staged approach. All participants were fully
      informed about the procedures, including the surgery, bone substitute materials and implants.
      Each participant had one extraction socket to be grafted with silica-calcium phosphate SCPC
      dental bone graft granules and the contralateral socket served as ungrafted control.
      Clinical, radiographic and histological evaluation was assessed.
