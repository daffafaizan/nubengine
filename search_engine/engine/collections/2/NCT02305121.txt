      purpose of this focused registry is to investigate how the newly developed implant called
      Trochanteric Fixation Nailing with anti-rotation feature (TFNA) is performing clinically and
      radiologically in terms of surgical technique, intra- and postoperative complications and
      short term outcome.

      All investigated procedures are part of the standard of care treatment. Only the parker
      mobility score is study-specific. All patients included are followed up from the time point
      of enrollment until three months after surgery.
