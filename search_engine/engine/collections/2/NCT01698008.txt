    
      Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects who know how to operate and own an iPhone, are
      between the age of 19 to 75, and are on a basal/bolus insulin regimen will be included in the
      study. Subjects will be randomized to two groups - iPhone versus standard of care and seen in
      our clinic at an initial/baseline and three month clinical visit. The control group will
      e-mail, fax, or call their blood glucose log results once a month for an insulin regimen
      adjustment through verbal communication with a certified diabetic educator once a month as is
      already implemented at the Diabetes Center. This group will be compared to the intervention
      group who will submit their blood glucose log results through an iPhone mobile application,
      called Diabetes Doctor, once a month for an insulin regimen adjustment by a physician with a
      text message response. The two groups will have their HbA1c, hypoglycemic events, blood
      glucose dispersion compliance, quality of life, usability and satisfaction with the use of a
      mobile application will be assessed at each visit with surveys.
