      periodontitis. Periodontitis causes systemic inflammation by the entry of oral pathogens and
      their virulence factors that adversely affect diabetic control in terms of elevated HbA1c
      levels.

      Host modulatory therapy (HMT) is a strategy prescribed as an adjunct to conventional
      periodontal treatment by downregulating inflammation and promoting protective or regenerative
      responses. Different drugs have been evaluated as HMT including NSAIDS, Doxycycline,
      Bisphosphonates.

      Aspirin has the unique position as HMT drug. It inhibits prostanoid production and induces
      15- epi- lipoxins which are bioactive than native lipoxins.

      Omega 3 fatty acids including Docosahexaenoic acid and Eicosapentaenoic acid due to their
      anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, hypolipidemia and vasodilator effect, reduce the
      inflammatory mediators to levels of healthy tissues.

      Pentraxins(PTX3) are classic acute phase proteins. They are a superfamily of evolutionarily
      conserved proteins considered to be the markers of acute phase inflammation. PTX3 is also
      known as TNF stimulated gene. It is produced abundantly in periodontal tissue by neutrophils,
      fibroblasts, monocytes and epithelial cells. The plasma levels of PTX3 is raised in
      inflammatory conditions. Hence it is taken as a biomarker.
