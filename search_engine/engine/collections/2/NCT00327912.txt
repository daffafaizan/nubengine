      long lasting weight loss. There are few studies comparing different surgical techniques,
      especially in a randomized setting.

      Superobesity (BMI > 50 kg/m2) demands an efficient surgical approach to result in satisfying
      weight loss. Laparoscopic techniques have been established to perform Roux-en-Y Gastric
      bypass and Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch which both are good options for
      treating superobesity.

      This study aims to compare the outcome after surgery in a broad perspective (weight loss,
      metabolic normalization, gastro-intestinal side effects, eating patterns, body composition,
      health economics). Patients will be randomized to either surgical procedure and will be
      followed for five years.
