      scintigraphic study. A total of 28 healthy male participants will be randomized (14
      participantper treatment arm) in order to have 24 evaluable participants (12 participants per
      treatment arm). Participants will be randomized to receive either a single dose Treatment A
      (Theraflu daytime Severe Cold & Cough powder) or single dose of Treatment B (Theraflu
      ExpressMax Daytime Severe Cold and Cough caplets). This study will consist of screening visit
      (Visit 1), followed by a treatment visit (Visit 2). Visit 2 includes two days: Day -1 and Day
      1. On visit 2 (day -1) of the study, the study participants will be admitted to the unit at
      approximately 7 pm on the evening before study drug administration and will receive a
      standardized meal. Participants will be required to fast (nothing to eat or drink except
      non-carbonated water) from 10 hours prior until 4 hours after study drug administration.
      Water will be permitted until 1 hour prior to investigational product administration, and no
      additional fluids until the lunch meal will be served at approximately 4 hours post dose.
      Participants will then be given a standard lunch at 4 hours post-dose, a standard dinner at
      10 hours post-dose on Day 1. Participants will be discharged from the unit after the last
      scintigraphic imaging is performed, blood sample for laboratory test will be taken as well as
      a brief physical examination. Scintigraphic acquisitions will be taken beginning after dose
      administration until 10 hours post-dose.
