      patients with clinical remission (inactive disease for at least 24 continuous weeks) on
      canakinumab treatment without concomitant corticosteroids (CS) or methotrexate (MTX). The
      study was also to collect long term safety and tolerability data on SJIA patients treated
      with canakinumab.
