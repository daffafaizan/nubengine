      rehabilitation, physical performance maintenance, and fall prevention in community dwelling
      older adults with neurodegenerative disease or at risk of fall. These reviews also show
      however that classical exergames are not adapted for rehabilitation of patients with
      functional limitations, which could explain their relatively moderate benefits in those
      patients.

      To overcome this lack, a serious game has been co-developed with medical to be adapted to the
      specific needs and characteristics of nursing home residents In this study , the
      investigators propose to compare the effects on physical performance, falls incidence, and
      quality of life of a 12-weeks serious game based exercise program and a classical exercises
      program
