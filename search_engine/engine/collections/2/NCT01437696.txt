      evaluate the impact of 2000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplementation (tablets or liquid form) on
      correcting low vitamin D status and the associated impact on biochemistry, bone health
      markers and markers of inflammation in a Fall period (Before and After, 8 weeks) and, 2)
      evaluate which food-based supplementation will maintain vitamin D3 status thereafter from
      winter through spring by measuring serum 25(OH)D concentration following intake of vitamin D
      delivered (with liquid form vitamin D3) using foods as the vehicle providing an additional
      1000 IU/day or 500 IU/day compared to regular meals offered at Ste-Anne's Hospital (SAH)
      (Randomized Controlled Trial, 3 groups, 24 weeks). Anthropometry (weight, height, BMI,
      mid-arm and mid-calf circumferences), grip strength, biochemical markers of bone health
      (25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, ionized calcium and phosphate), assessments of cognitive and
      functional status (Mini-Mental State Evaluation, Frail Elderly Functional Assessment,
      Physiotherapy Functional Mobility Profile and Pain Assessment Checklist) as well as
      volumetric bone mineral density using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) will
      be gathered.

      The long-term goal of the research program is to use novel food-delivery systems and
      approaches to enhancing vitamin D intake that meets the needs of this population. For years,
      medications have been delivered through foods but few studies have applied this to natural
      health products such as vitamin D. In chronic care, the number of prescription pills is high
      often 13 or more not accounting for multiple administrations over a day. Further
      documentation of health related indicators such as capacity to perform daily activities and
      chronic pain intensity would relate to quality of life and improve our understanding of
      vitamin D in more than bone health related issues. The reality of long-term care facilities
      (financial, human and material resources) needs to be addressed for the newly developed
      delivery modes to meet the needs of these residents and the projected increase in care
      required for our aging Canadian population. Large scale interventions will need to take place
      to give more insight on efficacy and efficiency of this new food delivery approach.
