some intraspecies differences in antigens onthe surface of certain living human cellssurface antigens of several types of living cells of humanorigin were partially characterized with hyperimmune antisera prepared inthe rabbit against living hela cells and living, uncultured, full-term, humanamnion cells.  hemagglutination, mixed-agglutination, and direct andindirect immunofluorescence (fab) techniques were employed.  withthese techniques and fractional absorption procedures, common and specificcell antigens were detected on the surface of several human living cells:uncultured and primary amnion, two established human cell lines (rp am 1and u amnion) of presumed normal origin and two (hela and hep-2) ofpresumed malignant origin, and human erythrocytes.  none of the antigenswere found on nctc 2555 mouse cells.  the human cells possessed species-related antigens demonstrable by hemagglutination.  after removal ofthe hemagglutinins by absorption with human erythrocytes, antibody in hightiter for the homologous cells was detected by fab methods.  in addition,some changes in antigens on the surface of amnion cells during primaryculture were observed.  finally, an antigen was found on hela and hep-2cells, by use of anti-hela serum absorbed with human erythrocytes and rpam 1 cells, that was not found on either human erythrocytes, unculturedamnion cells, or on the cells of the two established amnion cell lines.  atthe dilutions used in the tests, antibodies to the abo blood group isoanti-gens, forssman hapten, or adsorbed serum proteins could not account forthe antigens detected.  the possibility that mycoplasma sp. antigenswere responsible for the reactions was inconsistent with the results.  thespecificity of the fab methods on living cells was confirmed.
