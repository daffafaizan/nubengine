    
      Purpose: To determinate the incidence, pathological significance and risk factors associated
      with the presence of solitary dilated duct visualized at mammography exam.

      Methods: Mammograms performed at the Diagnostic Imaging Department of the "Instituto
      Brasileiro de Controle do CÃ¢ncer" (IBCC - Brazilian Cancer Control Institute) will be
      prospectively evaluated. Patients who present a solitary dilated duct visualized by
      mammography will be included in the study. These patients will be recalled in order to be
      submitted to an ultrasonography directed to the mammographic finding. Patients who present
      lesions on ultrasonography will undergo method-guided percutaneous biopsy.

      Patients with ductal ectasia, without evident lesions, will be followed for 2 years to
      evaluate stability by means of mammography or ultrasonography every 6-month intervals.
