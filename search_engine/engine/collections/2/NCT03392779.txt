    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind phase 1 trial including 3 parts: single ascending
      dose(SAD) part,multiple ascending dose(MAD) part and postprandial pharmacokinetics part.The
      primary aims of the study as below:

      Evaluating the safety and tolerance of single and multiple dose of ZSP1601 in healthy
      volunteers.

      Evaluating the fasting and postprandial pharmacokinetic parameters of ZSP1601 in healthy
      volunteers.

      Eligible participants will be admitted to the trial center on Day -1. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to either experimental groups or placebo groups, according to a
      randomisation schedule in a (4:1) ratio (8 in per experimental group). Subjects in SAD will
      receive 25、50、100、175、275、350 mg once daily respectively.Each dose will be administrated
      after assurance of safety for the former dose. Subjects in MAD will receive 50 or 100 mg once
      daily for 14days respectively.The treatment in food effect consists of 2 periods,and subjects
      will receive 100mg on fasting and postprandial states respectively. There will be a 7-day
      wash out period between treatment periods.To monitor AEs,record abnormalities (12-lead
      ECG,Vital signs,Physical examination,Clinical Laboratory),and detect the pharmacokinetics of
      ZSP1601.
