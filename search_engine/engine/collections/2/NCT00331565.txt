      operations on atorvastatin bioavailability.

      Secondary objectives are to determine the relative change in atorvastatin bioavailability
      following gastric bypass as well as BPD+DS operations. In addition will the individual
      CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and P-gp activity in the different organs from where biopsies can be obtained
      be descriptively compared with atorvastatin pharmacokinetic variables.
