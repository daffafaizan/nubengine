    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine safety, tolerability, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IL-21
      expanded, off the shelf, third-party natural killer (NK) cells and mogamulizumab in patients
      with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
      (ATLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS) in same patient population treated with IL-21 expanded, off the shelf,
      third-party NK cells and mogamulizumab.

      II. To determine impact of treatment on quality of life (QOL) by skindex-16 score.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study CCR4 expression in lymphoma cells. II. To study serum cytokine levels. III. To
      study trafficking of third-party NK cells to skin and tissues. IV. To study the persistence
      of IL-21 expanded, off the shelf, third-party NK cells by chimerism studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of natural killer cells.

      Patients receive mogamulizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day -7 and fludarabine
      IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3. Patients receive NK cell infusion every 2 weeks
      for six infusions total starting on day 0. Patients then receive mogamulizumab IV over 60
      minutes on days 0, 7, 14, and 28, then every 2 weeks thereafter in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28-35 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
