      for DSM-5 depressive disorders, randomized to PaCT (n=31) or waitlist (n=31). The primary aim
      is to assess changes in depressive symptoms and diagnoses following PaCT vs. waitlist, and as
      a function of therapeutic dose in order to determine effect sizes which can be used in power
      calculations for future large-scale clinical trials. Moreover, the investigators assess
      feasibility of PaCT in young children with depression (e.g., retention rates), adherence to
      the PaCT manual as well as treatment acceptability among children and their caregivers.
