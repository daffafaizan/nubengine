    
      This is an open-label, single institution, Phase I, 3+3 dose escalation study of LDE225 in
      patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh A Cirrhosis who
      are intolerant to sorafenib. The investigational treatment cycle (21 days) will consist of
      daily oral LDE225.

      Dose escalation will be performed in serial patient cohorts. Up to six patients can be
      studied at each dose level. Safety and clinical data will be tabulated and the decision to
      open the next cohort level will be the responsibility of the principal investigator. Dose
      escalation will be based on the dose-limiting toxicities encountered through Day 42 of
      investigational treatment.

      Patients will be dosed on a flat scale of daily dosing of LDE225 prescribed by the dose
      cohort.
