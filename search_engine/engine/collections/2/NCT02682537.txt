      Nevertheless, there is still no accurate, scientifically validated and practical bedside
      tool.

      The reference method for energy expenditure measurement is indirect calorimetry (IC). High
      costs, time requirements and the need for trained personal are main reasons for its limited
      use in clinical practice. Also arithmetical calculations, such as the Harris-Benedict
      equation, are not widely accepted.

      In general energy expenditure is often estimated by so called rules of thumbs, a method
      requiring only one multiplication with body weight (for example: 25 kcal/kg body weight).
      Sex, age and BMI are usually not considered, although they are independent predictors of
      energy expenditure. Thus, energy expenditure estimations are often inaccurate, especially in
      older and overweight/obese persons.

      Therefore, it is important to develop a bedside tool that is more accurate but simple enough
      to be accepted by practitioners. In 2004, the Austrian Society of Clinical Nutrition
      published the first BMI, aged and sex adapted rule of thumbs, called BASAROTs (BMI Age Sex
      Adjusted Rule Of Thumbs). Those were, however, based on results of the Harris Benedict
      equation.

      The main objective of the present study is, therefore, to replace the existing BASAROTs by
      BASAROTs based on actual measurements of resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry
      (IC-BASAROTs).
