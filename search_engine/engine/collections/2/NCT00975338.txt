      or acquired brain injury can expect to live normal lifespans. As children, these individuals
      are cared for by expert healthcare providers working in coordinated teams in specialized
      pediatric settings. As these children reach adulthood, the availability of services and
      expertise drops dramatically because the adult health care system has not evolved to meet
      their specialized needs. In addition, transitioning from pediatric to adult services is often
      very difficult and stressful. Young people and their families must leave familiar healthcare
      settings and providers, and secure care in unfamiliar adult health care environments.

      This proposed project will describe and evaluate the impact of a unique partnership model
      designed to coordinate transfer of care by formally linking pediatric and adult health care
      services. The LIFEspan model aims to (a) prepare youth and their families to adapt to adult
      healthcare provision, (b) provide a coordinated transfer process from pediatric to adult
      providers, and (c) establish sustainable access and appropriate adult care. The project will
      detail the specific service delivery that occurs with respect to preparation for transition
      and transfer of care in a process evaluation. An outcome evaluation will measure the
      effectiveness of the model in terms of its abilities to enable youth to maintain continuity
      within the health care system after transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Secondary
      outcomes, including how health, well-being, social participation, transition readiness, and
      health care utilization are affected by the LIFEspan model, will also be explored.
