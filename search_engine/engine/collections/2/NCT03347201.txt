      bloodless heart while maintaining circulation to the rest of the body. Anticoagulation with
      heparin prevents the body's clotting system from being activated when blood comes into
      contact with the walls of the bypass circuit. The amount of heparin given to achieve this
      effect is determined on a weight-based dosing and monitored with a point-of-care monitor
      called ACT (activated clotting time). However, there remains a high level of variability in
      the concentration of heparin in the blood and the ACT is affected by hypothermia and dilution
      of the blood, both of which commonly occur during CPB for cardiac surgery.

      The Hemostasis Management System (HMS Plus) offers an alternative way of dosing and
      monitoring heparin by aiming to achieve a pre-determined heparin concentration throughout
      CPB, rather than being determined by the ACT. It also aims to determine the dose of
      protamine, the drug used to reverse heparin at the end CPB, required based on residual
      heparin concentration rather than on a 1:1 ratio of the total dose of heparin given which is
      the common current practice. The benefits of using this system are proposed to be more
      effective anticoagulation during CPB meaning less of the body's reserves of clotting factors
      are consumed. This could mean potentially less bleeding and decrease requirement of blood
      products following surgery.
