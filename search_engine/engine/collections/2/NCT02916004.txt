      starting form 10 milliamperes (mA) up to 60mA. Pupillary diameter was measured before, during
      and after stimulation.

      Nociception flexion reflex: tetanic stimulations at the nervus suralis were performed
      starting form 0.5mA in increasing steps via an automated RIII (NFR) threshold tracking model.
