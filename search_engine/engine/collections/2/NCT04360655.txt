    
      This study is a randomized, prospective study, which will analyze the efficacy and safety of
      the first-line treatment in advanced central non-small cell lung cancer patients by anti-PD-1
      / PD-L1 monoclonal antibody and chemotherapy versus anti-PD-1 / PD-L1 monoclonal antibody and
      chemotherapy combined with bronchoscopic microwave intervention. The efficacy will include
      objective response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival, and overall
      survival. The safety will include adverse events and quality of life.
