    
      Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is the most common cause of death
      from cancer (almost 20 percent [%] of cancer deaths); NSCLC accounts for 80% to 85% of lung
      cancers. Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372) is a low fucose, fully human immunoglobulin G1
      (IgG1)-based bispecific antibody directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
      mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) tyrosine kinase receptors that is being developed for
      the treatment of solid tumors. The hypothesis is that amivantamab, when given in combination
      with standard of care carboplatin-pemetrexed chemotherapy, will prolong PFS compared with
      carboplatin-pemetrexed in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC characterized by
      EGFR Exon 20ins activating mutations. The study will include a Screening phase (28 days), a
      Treatment phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 [21-day cycle] till end of treatment [30 days after last
      dose]) and a Follow up phase (from the end of treatment visit and until the end of study,
      death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent from participation in the study, whichever
      comes first). An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be commissioned for the
      periodic review of safety and tolerability data, as well as planned efficacy analyses.
      Efficacy assessments will include disease assessment, symptomatic progression and
      patient-reported outcome. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and
      clinical safety laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and
      urinalysis). The total duration of the study is up to 48 months.
