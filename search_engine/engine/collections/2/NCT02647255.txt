      a highly variable clinical course and diverse histopathological lesions. Although most
      affected individuals develop chronic, slowly progressive renal injury, a subgroup of patients
      (<5% of all IgAN patients) with diffuse crescent formation, which is termed as crescentic IgA
      nephropathy (CreIgAN) and often leads to rapidly progressive kidney failure. The recent
      Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest high-dose steroids and
      cyclophosphamide therapy for CreIgAN. However, this suggestion is mainly based on several
      small observational studies, and the 1- and 5-year renal survival rates of patients treated
      with this regimen were as low as 65% and 28%, respectively, in one large cohort of CreIgAN
      patients. The efficacy of plasma exchange (PE) in severe CreIgAN is not well evaluated,
      although several anecdotal reports have indicated benefit of PE in combination with
      immunosuppressive therapies in IgAN patients. Retrospective cohort study in our unite also
      supported the benefit of PE as additional therapy for CreIgAN patients. However, randomized
      controlled trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plasma exchange as
      adjunctive therapy for crescentic IgA nephropathy compared to pulse methylprednisolone on a
      background of oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide in prevent kidney failure.
