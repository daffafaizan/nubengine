    
      To compare embryonic quality and other clinical outcomes when using human menopause
      gonadotropin (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) to the ovarian
      stimulation in IVF cycles with the GnRH antagonist protocol.

      Design: open randomized single center study with infertile patients submitted to IVF
      comparing IVF outcomes between hMG and rFSH when controlled with GnRH antagonist.

      Setting: A single private center of reproductive medicine in association with Universidade
      Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

      Patients: Infertile women with normal ovarian reserve with IVF indication. Intervention: The
      patients were randomized in two groups, 85 received rFSH and 83 received hMG to ovulation
      induction, both groups used GnRH antagonist to prevent ovulation.

      Main Outcome Measure: Total embryonic score and best embryonic score. Secondary outcomes:
      Total dose of gonadotropins, number and size of follicles in the end of the stimulation,
      number of mature oocytes, number of embryos, pregnancy rates.
