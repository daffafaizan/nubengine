    
      Patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for active PDR with TRD will receive a single
      intravitreal pre-operative 0.3mg Macugenâ„¢ prior to surgery versus sham injection.

      Specific timing of the injection will be at no sooner than 7 days and no longer than 14 days
      prior to surgery.

      Patients will receive a preinjection fundus photo and another post injection photo the day of
      surgery as dictated by the operative schedule.

      Some photos may be limited secondary to vitreous hemorrhage. Follow up visits after surgery
      will be one day, one week, one month, and three months.
