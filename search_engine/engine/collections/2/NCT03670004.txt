      substantially increased risk of falling as compared to able-bodied age-matched controls and
      have reduced confidence in their balance, both contributing to their restricted mobility and
      daily activity. This risk increases with progressing age, as aging affects musculoskeletal
      and somatosensory systems that are vital to controlling upright balance (i.e., maintaining
      the body center-of-mass (BCoM) within the limits of the base-of-support) and are already
      compromised in persons with TTA. An important consequence of elevated fall incidence is an
      increased risk of fall-related injuries that may lead to lost participation and independence.
      The effects of reduced sensory-motor function on upright balance in older adults has been
      extensively studied and led to development of effective assessment tools and intervention
      strategies to minimize fall risk. However, the dearth of similar studies and relatively poor
      understanding of the effects of additional complications from TTA on upright balance have
      significantly hampered progress towards addressing this important concern for Veterans with
      TTA. Consequently, this limits knowledge of predictive factors of falls among these
      prosthesis users and for informing therapeutic interventions that enhance functional balance.
      Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to develop an improved understanding of
      the sensory-motor mechanisms underlying upright balance and fall risk in older Veterans with
      TTA. The proposed study will compare differences between three age- and gender-matched
      groups: 1) amputees who reported two or more falls in the past 12 months, 2) amputee controls
      (one fall or less in the past 12 months), and 3) able-bodied controls.
