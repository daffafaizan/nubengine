      and Europe. Smokers who were willing to quit smoking within the next 30 days at the Screening
      Visit were enrolled to reach approximately 950 subjects continuously abstinent from smoking
      from Actual Quit Date (AQD) onwards at week 2, in order to achieve at least 190 successful
      quitters expected to complete the study. Once approximately 950 subjects reached week 2,
      screening and enrollment were stopped.

      Compliance with smoking abstinence was verified by self-reporting, CO breath tests, and urine
      cotinine tests. Smokers who were not continuously abstinent from smoking [i.e., free from
      tobacco product use (e.g., CC, pipes, cigars, snus) or any nicotine-containing product
      (including electronic cigarettes) other than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)] from their
      AQD onwards were discontinued from the study. At the end of the study, 358 subjects were
      verified as continuously abstinent from their AQD.
