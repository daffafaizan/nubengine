      training programs (2 kinds of exergame systems and 1 conventional weight-shifting training
      program) on cognitive function of subjects with chronic stroke. We hypothesized that the
      exergaming program using weight shifting as game controller is better than the weight
      shifting only program. The investigators further hypothesized that exergames designed for
      entertainment (such as Wii Fit) are more beneficial than exergames for rehabilitation purpose
      (such as Tetrax biofeedback) in gain of cognition function for patients with chronic stroke.
