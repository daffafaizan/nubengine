      treatments show little improvement and side effects may reduce patient compliance. Regimens
      are usually administered at a fixed dose that doesn't incorporate high patient variability,
      leading to sub-optimal responses.

      Effective cognitive training can improve cognitive performance. Artificial intelligence
      platforms show great potential for training personalisation. The CURATE.AI platform can be
      used to identify N-of-1 (single subject) training profiles that can be used to optimise
      learning trajectories through individualised calibration and training regimens, potentially
      leading to improved outcomes compared to standard static or adaptive training strategies.
      CURATE.AI uses only a subject's own performance data to identify the intensity needed for
      his/her best output. As the subject evolves during the course of intervention, the training
      intensities are dynamically modulated to maintain performance within a given range.

      Here the investigators propose to test the feasibility of CURATE.AI, with a digital cognitive
      test battery as the interface, as an adaptive training platform for cognitive training
      addressed to improve brain cancer radiotherapy patients' cognitive performance. The
      acceptability, implementation and limited efficacy of the digital intervention (DI) will be
      explored. In addition, the investigators propose to test the feasibility of the digital
      cognitive test battery potential as a digital diagnostic (DD) tool as compared to traditional
      cognitive evaluations performed by a clinician. User experience and usability will also be
      explored.
