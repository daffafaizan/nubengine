    
      The goal of this study is to ascertain whether there is a regulatory relationship between the
      novel phosphorus-regulating polypeptide fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), ionized calcium
      (iCa), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. In addition, we will determine if there is an
      inverse relationship between Fetuin A levels and inflammatory markers, interleukin 6 (IL-6)
      and C-reactive protein (CRP), during a hemodialysis treatment.

      All patients participating in this study will be off Zemplar and/or Sensipar for a washout
      period of approximately 4 weeks as these medications will interfere with the study. Patients
      will go through one designated research hemodialysis time for a blood draw. Blood draws will
      be taken during 4 separate intervals at 0, 45, 90 and 150 minutes. At each interval, 4 tubes
      of blood will be drawn.

      There are no further required blood draws once each designated research HD session has been
      completed. At the conclusion of the designated research HD session, vitamin D analogue
      (Zemplar®) and/or Cinacalcet (Sensipar®) will be restarted, and the dose will be adjusted to
      reflect the subject's recent biochemical markers (Ca, Phos, and iPTH).
