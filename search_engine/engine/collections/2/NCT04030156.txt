      tonsillitis, snoring and obstructive sleep apnea is among the most important indications for
      this surgery. Tonsil volume, in addition to recurrent tonsillitis frequency, are both
      considered in deciding tonsillectomy operation. Moreover, recent studies showed a correlation
      between tonsil hypertrophy and tonsillitis frequency. For this reason, a reliable assessment
      of tonsil volume is crucial both during clinical follow-up and surgery decision.

      Today, a number of clinical staging systems are used to assess tonsil volume; with 'Friedman
      Scale' and 'Brodsky Scale' being the most commonly used systems. Those staging systems employ
      physical examination and are graded on palatine tonsils' midline extension. In other words,
      clinical staging uses just the transverse length of tonsils and vertical length and depth are
      dismissed. In addition, other factors such as patient non-compliance, size of the tongue and
      tongue base, hyperactive gag reflex and trismus make a clinical assessment difficult. For
      those reasons, a correct clinical assessment of tonsil volume is not always conceivable.

      Ultrasonography (USG) was used in a limited number of studies about tonsil tissue assessment
      despite high patient compliance, low cost and its non-radioactive nature. Also, those studies
      include only the pediatric population.In this study, we would like to assess the success of
      USG in objective measurement of tonsil volume in both pediatric and adult populations and
      comparison of those results with clinical findings
