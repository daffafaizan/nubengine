      pathological subtype of lymphoma, and its incidence rate is only next to diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL). The initial remission rate is high, but the tumor generally recurrent,
      making it difficult to be completely cured. This study attempts to explore the efficacy and
      safety of rituximab monotherapy maintenance after BR, RCHOP, R2 regimen induction therapy in
      the treatment of follicular patients, and to find the best way to maximize survival benefit
      and reduce treatment toxicity for FL patients. The study can improve the quality of life,
      prolong the survival and avoid the transformation to invasive lymphoma in patients with
      follicular lymphoma.
