      Patients receive oxidized glutathione (NOV-002) IV twice on day -1 of course 1 and once on
      day 1 of courses 2-8. Patients receive NOV-002 subcutaneously once daily on days 2-21 of
      courses 1-8. Patients also receive chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and
      cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 of courses 1-4 followed by docetaxel IV on day 1 of courses 5-8.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo definitive surgery 3-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

      Blood samples are obtained at baseline and periodically during study to measure serum and
      plasma protein glutathionlylation. Additional blood samples are collected from some patients
      for immunological correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days.
