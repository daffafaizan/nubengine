      platelets have high granule content and a residual amount of mRNA. An increased mean platelet
      volume (MPV) and the fraction of RP have been shown to be correlated to cardiovascular events
      like myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. However, there are no trials so far
      investigating how surgery impacts the fraction of RP and how this fraction correlates with
      the outcome after noncardiac surgery.

      Patients with an age above 18 years undergoing high-risk or intermediate-risk noncardiac
      surgery are to be included. The fraction of RP is to be investigated in routinely acquired
      blood samples preoperatively, postoperatively in the recovery room, as well as 24-72 hours
      after anaesthesia and surgery.

      A primary common endpoint are major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), as
      well as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. MACCEs are defined according to Sabat√©
      et al. as: cardiac death, cerebrovascular death, nonfatal cardiac arrest, acute myocardial
      infarction, congestive heart failure, new cardiac arrhythmia, angina or stroke. Secondary
      endpoints are lengths of hospital stay and intensive care stay as well as mortality after 3
      months. All participants are to be contacted by phone three months after discharge and their
      health situation is to be determined.

      1000 patients will be enrolled in a defined time frame of six months
