      mechanism of postoperative delirium is not well understood, there are several studies to
      report alternation of plasma melatonin levels after general anesthesia and suggest the link
      between delirium and abnormal tryptophan-serotonin-melatonin metabolism. However, there are
      few studies to assess the association of perioperative plasma melatonin levels with
      postoperative delirium and/or general anesthetics.

      The investigators designed a prospective observational study to investigate the association
      of perioperative plasma melatonin levels with postoperative delirium and general anesthesia.
      The investigators included 33 patients required intensive care more than 48 hours after
      sevoflurane anesthesia in an academic tertiary care hospital. The investigators measured
      plasma melatonin levels and assessed postoperative delirium using Confusion Assessment Method
      for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). The investigators compared perioperative plasma
      melatonin levels between patients with and without delirium, and assessed associations of
      patients' demographics and anesthesia with plasma melatonin levels.
