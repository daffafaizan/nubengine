      interdisciplinary endoscopy unit (IEU, gastroenterological endoscopy, surgical endoscopy, and
      bronchoscopy) at the University Hospital Tübingen, a center for tertiary care in
      South-western Germany. First, preparations for COVID-19 pandemic with respect to the IEU are
      presented, and compared with those of other endoscopy units (7, 8). Additionally, the direct
      impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the staff of the IEU will be shown, together with a point-prevalence
      analysis of SARS-CoV-2 of the staff at the end of the SARS-CoV-2 wave in Tübingen. Finally,
      to our knowledge for the first time, we conducted a prospective single center analysis of the
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which required a diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopic
      intervention.
