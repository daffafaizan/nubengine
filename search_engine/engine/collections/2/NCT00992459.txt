    
      This was a randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study designed to enroll
      subjects with UCDs who are being treated with NaPBA. Subjects were randomly assigned to
      receive either HPN-100 + NaPBA placebo or NaPBA + HPN 100 placebo for 2 weeks, and then
      crossed over to receive the other treatment for 2 weeks. Venous ammonia was the primary
      outcome measure. Subjects were admitted to the clinical research unit for 24 hours of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) blood and urine sampling (including an overnight stay) at the end of
      each treatment period, by which time the study drug had reached steady state.

      Subjects followed a stable diet throughout the study as prescribed by the investigator and
      dietician. Throughout the study, diet diaries were completed by the subject and dietary
      protein intake were assessed by a dietician based on completed dietary diaries and
      consultation with the subject.

      Subjects who completed this study and met the study entry criteria, were offered the
      opportunity to enroll in the HPN-100 open-label safety protocol (HPN-100-007).
