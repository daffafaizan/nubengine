      act through key prefrontal regions that subserve inhibitory and executive functions, although
      different medications may achieve these effects via distinct mechanisms. The objective of
      this research is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a face go/no-go
      task to test the prefrontal mechanism of action of the medical food Vayarin. Participants are
      not treated at the Icahn School of Medicine, but instead will be recruited from trials of
      Vayarin that are enrolling and treating participants at New York University and The Medical
      Research Network.
