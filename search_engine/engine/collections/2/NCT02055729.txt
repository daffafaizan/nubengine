      A. To compare bacterial communities collected from superficial versus deep samples of stage 3
      or 4 sacral bedsores using metagenomics and standard culturing methods.

      B. To characterize the evolution of digestive bacterial flora in the same patients over a
      period of 28 days. Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      will be described, as well as the appearance of resistance phenotypes.

      C. To characterize the evolution of urinary bacterial flora in the same patients over a
      period of 28 days. Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      will be described, as well as the appearance of resistance phenotypes.
