      for women Veterans. This research study will examine the effects of two mobile health
      technologies on improving bladder symptoms, as part of a randomized clinical trial. The study
      includes 260 women Veterans recruited from 3 sites: the Birmingham VAMC, the Atlanta VAHCS,
      and the Durham VAMC (86 per site). Women will receive first-line treatments for urine leakage
      through randomization to one of two delivery methods for direct treatment: (1) a web-based
      mobile health application that delivers content daily for 8 weeks compared to (2) a single
      video session delivered by VA Video Connect. At 8-weeks, women who do not have improved
      symptoms will have the ability to continue the treatment or receive an initial or booster
      video session. The investigators will measure bladder symptoms (3 questions by self-report
      over the phone or via survey) at baseline, 8-weeks, 12-weeks, and 6-months. Additionally, the
      investigators will interview 54 women Veterans and 12 providers to learn about their
      experiences with the technologies using 1:1 telephone interviews at 12-weeks. The findings
      from this study will inform the best technology to improve access for bladder leakage among
      women Veterans across a wider array of VHA facilities.
