    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, unbalanced design, parallel
      group study with a two-step titration regimen or a one-step titration regimen. The study is
      double-blind with regard to active and placebo treatments; however neither the study drug
      volume nor the titration regimens (that is, two-step or one-step) are blinded.
