      two introduction modes, followed by a noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factor survey. The
      two modes were computer assisted telephone interview (CATI), in which a call-center employee
      read the introduction to a participant and received oral consent from them, before sending
      them the NCD risk factor survey via IVR, or the entire survey, including the introduction and
      consent, being obtained via IVR. In IVR surveys, participants use their touch tone key pad to
      answer pre-recorded questions. (i.e. If you are male, press 1; If you are female, press 2).
      This study was conducted in both Bangladesh and Tanzania.
