      succinylcholine or rocuronium by utilizing the Dixon's up and down technique. For patient
      safety, the first dose of either agent will be defined by the anesthesiologist providing
      care, and subsequent doses will be incrementally increased or decreased by 10% based on the
      assessment of a psychiatrist blinded to dose, who uses a dichotomous scale to assess the
      quality of the ECT (acceptable and not acceptable). The investigators will switch to the
      second compound as soon as the patient has received one neuromuscular blocking agent dose
      that resulted in 'acceptable muscle relaxation', and another dose that resulted in
      'unacceptable' conditions'.

      Acceleromyography will be used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission. Following induction
      of general anesthesia, the TOF-Watch SX will be calibrated (mode 1, 50 mA), and train-of-four
      (TOF) stimulation (every 15 seconds) will be initiated and maintained until recovery of the
      T1 to 100% baseline. Non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation
      (SpO2), and time to recovery of spontaneous breathing will be measured during the procedure.
      In addition the investigators will measure stimulation parameters used to initiate ECT, as
      well as the duration of seizure as well as the entire procedure time.
