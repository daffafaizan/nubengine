      coagulation system. Hypothermia is also known to inhibit the coagulation profile. The aim of
      the study is to assess and compare the early postoperative (PO) haematological and
      coagulation profile of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with
      Hypothermic (HT) versus normothermic (NT) bypass Methods: eighty-six patients were divided
      into two equal groups: NT group included patients received warm bypass and using warm blood
      cardioplegia from bypass and HT group included patients received cold bypass and using cold
      cardioplegia given by the anaesthesiologist. PO monitoring included the activated clotting
      time (ACT) prior to wound closure and 2-hr changes in the haemoglobin concentration (Hb),
      platelet count (PC), ADP-induced platelet aggregation (IPA), INR in relation to preoperative
      profile and amount of PO daily blood loss and number of transfused blood units. The primary
      outcome was the PO alternations in the coagulation and haematological profile. The secondary
      outcome was the amount of PO daily bleeding, number of transfused blood units and incidence
      of re-opening surgery due to bleeding.
