      pediatricians to address the secondhand smoke exposure of children. We will gather pediatric
      staff responses to the specific components of the online training and refine this training
      for a range of outpatient pediatric office settings. We will test the feasibility and
      efficacy of implementing the online training and dissemination system within the pediatric
      office setting. We will also gather parental responses to specific components of the
      pediatric visit, which will be impacted by the online training for pediatric offices.

      The following hypotheses will be tested:

      Primary Hypothesis

      H1. The following measures of physician behavior, as assessed by exit interviews, 3 month
      follow up telephone interviews of parents or guardians who smoke or parents or guardians who
      live with a smoker and chart review of 20 charts, will increase more in the intervention
      practice than in the control practice:

        -  Screening for home no-smoking rule

        -  Screening for car no-smoking rule

        -  Advising parents about the need for a strictly enforced no-smoking in the home rule

        -  Advising parents about the need for a strictly enforced no-smoking in the car rule.

      Secondary Hypothesis H2. Compared to the control practice, the intervention practice will
      have a greater increase in the summary scores that measure the key processes of practice
      implementation shown to predict successful practice change. This implementation process will
      be measured by administering previously validated surveys to physicians and key practice
      staff before and following the implementation of the office system.
