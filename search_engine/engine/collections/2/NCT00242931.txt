    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the treatment-related mortality in patients with hormone-refractory,
           progressive metastatic prostate cancer treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning
           comprising fludarabine and total-body irradiation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic
           stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2
           and total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT): After TBI, patients undergo
           AHSCT on day 0.

        -  Immunosuppression: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 56
           followed by a taper until day 81. Patients also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice
           daily on days 0-27 (if patient has a related donor) OR three times daily on days 0-29
           and then twice daily on days 30-149 followed by additional tapering until day 180 (if
           patient has an unrelated donor).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
