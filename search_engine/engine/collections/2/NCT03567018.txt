      protocols for various perforators commonly used in flap surgery with phantoms and healthy
      volunteers and to obtain clinical validation of the optimized protocols with a group of
      patients receiving flap surgery at The OSU Wexmer Medical Center. Data obtained in this study
      may also serve as the basis for statistical planning of future clinical trials. Based on
      previous experience with other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, the investigators
      hypothesize that optimal MRA images can only be obtained with a carefully selected
      combination of imaging hardware, acquisition, and postprocessing factors. The main objective
      of this pilot study is to determine this optimal combination through the comparison of image
      between different combinations. The secondary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate,
      both qualitatively and quantitatively, the quality of the optimized MRA images and compare
      them with clinical CTA images. The primary hypothesis is that the quality of the optimized
      MRA images is at least comparable to that of the CTA images. The quantitative measurements
      obtained from this pilot population will also serve as the preliminary data for future
      studies and be used in statistical calculations that determine their study population.
