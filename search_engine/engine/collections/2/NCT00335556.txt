    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate whether a treatment regimen containing cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and
      etoposide alternating with vincristine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide
      (regimen UH-1) improves the event-free and overall survival of patients with diffuse
      anaplastic Wilms' tumor (DAWT) as compared to historical controls.

      II. Evaluate, in a phase II "window" study, the antitumor activity of a combination of
      vincristine and protracted-schedule irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with metastatic
      DAWT.

      III. Evaluate whether regimen UH-1 improves the event-free and overall survival of patients
      with malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) as compared to historical controls.

      IV. Maintain the excellent event-free survival of patients with stage I clear cell sarcoma of
      the kidney (CCSK) without the use of abdominal irradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the outcomes of patients with stage I DAWT or stages I-III focal anaplastic
      Wilms' tumor (FAWT) treated with vincristine, dactinomycin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and
      flank radiation.

      II. Describe the outcomes of patients with stage IV FAWT or stage IV CCSK treated with
      regimen UH-1.

      III. Describe event-free and overall survival of children and adolescents with localized
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (including patients with local lymph node involvement) treated
      with surgical resection without adjuvant therapy.

      IV. Describe response rate, event-free survival, and overall survival of patients with
      unresectable or distantly metastatic RCC treated according to institutional preference.

      V. Correlate histologic and molecular cytogenetic findings with outcome in pediatric RCC.

      VI. Evaluate the frequency of germline and inherited INI1 mutations in renal and extrarenal
      MRT and correlate the presence of detectable INI1 mutation with clinical outcome.

      VII. Determine the frequency of TP53 mutations in anaplastic Wilms' tumor and correlate the
      presence of detectable TP53 mutation with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 treatment regimens
      according to tumor histology, stage of disease, and response to treatment.

      SURGERY (renal cell carcinoma [RCC]): Patients with completely resectable stage I-IV RCC
      undergo surgical resection. Patients with incompletely resectable stage III-IV RCC undergo
      treatment as per physician's choice.

      REGIMEN UH-1 (stage II-III or stage IV [with no measurable disease] diffuse anaplastic Wilms'
      tumor [DAWT], stage I-IV malignant rhabdoid tumor [MRT], stage IV focal anaplastic Wilms'
      tumor [FAWT], or stage IV clear cell sarcoma of the kidney [CCSK]): Patients receive
      vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1-3, 10-12, 13-15, 22-24, and 28-30; doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and cyclophosphamide (CPM2) IV over 15-30 minutes
      on day 1 in weeks 1, 10, 13, 22, and 28; and cyclophosphamide (at lower doses [CPM1]) IV over
      1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4 and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 in
      weeks 4, 7, 16, 19, and 25. Patients whose primary tumors were initially resected undergo
      radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 4-5Â½ weeks beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients
      with delayed primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy beginning on day 1 in week 13. If
      the primary tumor was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in
      week 13. Patients with unresectable CCSK receive no further study therapy.

      IRINOTECAN/VINCRISTINE WINDOW THERAPY* (stage IV DAWT with measurable disease at diagnosis):
      Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 2. Patients with progressive disease (PD) are treated with regimen
      UH-1. Patients with stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR)
      receive another course of irinotecan hydrochloride/vincristine window therapy beginning on
      day 22. After the second course, patients with SD or PD are treated with regimen UH-1 and
      patients with PR or CR are treated with regimen UH-2.

      NOTE: *Patients who are eligible for but who are unwilling to receive window therapy, receive
      therapy on regimen UH-1.

      REGIMEN UH-2 (DAWT with CR/PR to irinotecan hydrochloride/vincristine window therapy):
      Patients receive vincristine on day 1 in weeks 1-3, 10, 11, 16-21, 25, 26, 28-30, and 34-36
      and doxorubicin hydrochloride and CPM2 as in regimen UH-1 in weeks 1, 16, 19, 28, and 34.
      Patients also receive CPM1, etoposide, and carboplatin as in regimen UH-1 in weeks 4, 7, 13,
      22, and 31 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 10, 11, 25,
      and 26. Patients whose primary tumors were initially resected undergo radiotherapy as in
      regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients with delayed primary tumor resection
      undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 7. If the primary tumor
      was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in week 7.

      REGIMEN I (stage I-III CCSK): Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1-3, 5-9,
      8-9, 11-14, 19, and 25; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 in weeks 1, 7, 13, 19, and 25; and
      cyclophosphamide IV and etoposide IV on days 1-5 in weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22. Patients whose
      primary tumors were initially resected (except those with stage I CCSK) undergo radiotherapy
      as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients with delayed primary tumor
      resection undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 13. If the
      primary tumor was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in week
      13.

      REGIMEN DD-4A (stage I DAWT or stages I-III FAWT): Patients receive dactinomycin IV over 1-5
      minutes on day 1 in weeks 1, 7, 13, 19, and 25; vincristine IV on day 1 in weeks 1-10, 13,
      16, 19, 22, and 25; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1 in weeks 4,10,
      16, and 22. Patients whose primary tumors were initially resected undergo radiotherapy as in
      regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients with delayed primary tumor resection
      undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 13. If the primary tumor
      was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in week 13. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years.
