      collected within 24 hours prior to their scheduled visit for urea breath test. Patients
      should not have been treated for H. pylori prior to stool collection. Stool samples will be
      tested using ELISA for the presence of the H. pylori GGT antigen using monoclonal antibodies
      against GGT. Stool samples will also be tested for the presence of H. pylori DNA using PCR
      and Western blot analysis respectively.

      Presence of the GGT antigen in stool will be compared between H. pylori-positive and H.
      pylori-negative patients. Rapid urease test results will be used as the gold standard of H.
      pylori diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the stool antigen test will be
      established.
