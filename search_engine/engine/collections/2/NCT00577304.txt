      topical formulation of Nitroglycerin, MQX-503, to improve the patient's health assessment as
      indicated by patient and physician assessments, decrease the frequency of Raynaud's events,
      decrease the duration of Raynaud's events, and decrease the symptoms (pain, tingling,
      numbness) in the fingers of Raynaud's patients. The study will include patients with moderate
      to severe primary Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP) and with moderate to severe Raynaud's Phenomenon
      secondary to autoimmune diseases, such as scleroderma.
