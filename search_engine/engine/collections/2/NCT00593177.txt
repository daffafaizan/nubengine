      by Dr. Michael Holick using a different dosage form. The secondary objective is to determine
      if there is a dose dependent difference or trend in response between the two concentrations
      of PTH (1-34) peptide gel.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of three treatment groups on a 1:1:1 basis. The
      three treatment groups are:

        -  Treatment Group 1: 0.05% PTH (1-34) Gel

        -  Treatment Group 2: 0.10% PTH (1-34) Gel

        -  Treatment Group 3: Placebo Gel
