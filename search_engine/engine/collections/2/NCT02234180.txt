      I. To compare the disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with resected esophageal and
      gastroesophageal (GE) junction adenocarcinoma treated with regorafenib vs. placebo in the
      adjuvant setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the safety profile of adjuvant regorafenib vs. placebo in patients with locally
      advanced resectable esophageal and GE junction adenocarcinoma.

      II. To compare the overall survival (OS) for patients with resected esophageal and GE
      junction adenocarcinoma treated with regorafenib vs. placebo in the adjuvant setting.

      III. To compare the DFS in those patients that receive at least 1 cycle of therapy.

      IV. To collect tumor samples for future genomic analysis to explore the biology of locally
      advanced esophageal and GE junction adenocarcinoma.

      V. DFS will be compared between the arms from the time of surgery as well.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Within 6-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) on days 1-21.

      ARM II: Within 6-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-21.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      every 6 months for up to 5 years.
