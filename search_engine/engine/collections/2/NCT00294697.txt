      genetic markers, immune responses to injury and infection (sepsis), and post injury clinical
      outcomes. Specifically, we will investigate the clinical impact of mutations involved in the
      innate immune response, which likely influence host response. To accomplish this goal we will
      collect and analyze data from patients with acute thermal injury, the most quantitative
      inflammatory stimulus experienced by humans. In addition, we propose to further characterize
      the immunologic response parameters to injury and infection, and their role in complicated
      sepsis. In this way, we will identify parameters associated with unfavorable clinical
      outcomes, and determine how these parameters differ among individuals with different
      genotypes. We propose to 1) evaluate associations between candidate SNPs within the NOD2/RIP2
      signaling pathway and clinical outcome following burn injury, 2) evaluate the functional
      effects of alternate alleles at candidate SNPs; finally 3), we will use genetically
      engineered animal models to determine whether mutations in the NOD2 or RIP2 genes alter
      myocardial signal transduction mechanisms shown to play a role in myocardial
      inflammation/dysfunction after burn trauma. These approaches should allow us to evaluate more
      extensively clinically relevant interactions between specific genetic polymorphisms, the
      cellular expression of immune mediators, and burn-induced immune dysfunction. The proposed
      research should uncover genetic and/or acute immune-inflammatory parameters that identify
      patients who are at "high risk" and could as a result make possible the targeted design of
      pharmacologic intervention strategies that will inhibit the toxic effects of LPS and other
      bacterial pathogen components without paralyzing the host immunity of patients
