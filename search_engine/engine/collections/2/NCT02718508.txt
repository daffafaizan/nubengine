      intervention at three pediatric trauma centers. The investigators will randomize up to 75
      dyads of injured adolescents (12-17 years old) who screen positive for alcohol use and their
      parent to receive either standard trauma center care (a brief intervention with the
      adolescent) or standard trauma center care (a brief intervention with the adolescent) plus an
      e-parenting skills intervention consisting of a computerized intervention for parent skill
      building, a series of text messages and a web-based message board. The primary aim of this
      study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting the e-parenting
      intervention protocol across three pediatric trauma centers in preparation for a larger fully
      power trial. The central hypothesis for our future fully powered randomized control trial is
      that adolescents whose parents receive the e-parenting skills intervention will decrease
      their alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences over the 6 months following the
      intervention more than adolescents who receive only standard trauma center care. Therefore, a
      secondary aim of this proposal is to calculate a preliminary effect size that could be used,
      along with other relevant data, such as the acceptability data and findings in the
      literature, to calculate sample size in a future fully powered randomized control trial. The
      investigators will also examine adolescent's conjoint use of marijuana. This project advances
      translational research in collecting preliminary data on an e-parenting skills intervention
      that can be easily adopted with high fidelity across pediatric trauma centers. Its findings
      have the potential to directly impact best clinical practices for intervening with alcohol
      using injured adolescents
