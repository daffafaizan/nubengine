      resynchronization therapy, the research personnel will take 1 teaspoon of blood before and
      after the scheduled cardiac procedure for comparison.

      Once subjects agree to participate in this study and are scheduled to have a catheter
      ablation procedure, research personnel will take 1 teaspoon of blood during the scheduled
      cardiac procedure.

      These samples will be taken from catheters already placed during the scheduled cardiac
      procedure.

      Blood will be sent to a lab at the Sanford-Burnham Metabolomics Core Facility in Orlando,
      Florida for analysis.
