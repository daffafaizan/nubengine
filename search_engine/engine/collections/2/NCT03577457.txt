      and decision making in human. The aim of this study is to determine whether they interact in
      those essential human behaviors by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject,
      pharmacological fMRI design, in which 4 groups of healthy males will be administered with a
      random combination of nasal oxytocin (24 international units, IU) or placebo and acute
      tryptophan depletion (ATD, 75.2g) or placebo (a tryptophan-balanced mixture, 78.2g). The
      social-reward related neural activity and behavior will be assessed by a series of social
      reward task in and out of fMRI scanner and the decision making will be assessed by reversal
      learning task, ultimatum game (UG) and loss aversion task. The interaction between serotonin
      and oxytocin on brain networks will also be tested by resting state.
