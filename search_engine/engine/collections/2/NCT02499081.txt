    
      This is a phase II study designed to examine the bone anabolic effect of the next generation
      proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, in relapsed/refractory myeloma patients. Treatment consists
      of Ixazomib 4 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28 day cycle, for a maximum of 6 cycles.
      Determination of relapsed/refractory disease as an entry criterion may be based on patient
      data obtained during or following the patient's most recent prior antineoplastic therapy.
      Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles. Patients will be seen at regular
      intervals while they are participating in the study.
