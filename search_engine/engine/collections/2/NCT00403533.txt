      cholesterol lowering medication will be recruited by the study investigators from
      Massachusetts General Hospital.

      The study investigators will approach the potential subject after the referring doctor has
      ascertained that the potential subject is interested in meeting with the investigator.

      Each subject who consents will undergo phlebotomy of 10 cc of blood three times. Once prior
      to the initiation of atorvastatin to measure the patients viral load. In addition, patients
      will undergo phlebotomy 4 and 12 weeks after the initiation of atorvastatin. The week 12
      phlebotomy is required in all patients started on atorvastatin to monitor for side effects.
      Therefore patients who enroll in this study will undergo one additional phlebotomy. As part
      of our study an extra 10 cc of blood will be taken at these times to measure the patients HCV
      viral load.
