      other standard secondary prevention therapies, was effective for the prevention of
      cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary disease. An experiment conducted by Li
      et al. showed that twenty-four-hour urinary albumin excretion was reduced after 6 months
      colchicine treatment in rats with diabetic nephropathy.As both micro and macrovascular
      complications of diabetes are closely associated with inflammation,with the anti-inflammation
      property,colchicine might reduce risk for micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes.

      STUDY DESIGN-Patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria(30mg/g Cr≤UACR≤300mg/g Cr)
      who have received stable dosage of ACEI/ARB for at least 3 months will be randomized to
      receive colchicine 0.5 mg/day or placebo.

      This trial includes four phases:

        -  Phases 1: A prospective, randomized，double-blind, control study, aims at evaluating
           microvascular events from date of randomization until the third year. Other parameters
           included evaluating changes of UACR, eGFR, CIMT from baseline to the follow-up.

        -  Phases 2: A prospective observational study, aims at evaluating macrovascular and
           microvascular events from date of randomization until the 6th year.

      SAFETY AND DATA MANAGEMENT-Independent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee has been set up
      to monitor the safety and tolerability of the subjects; this committee will analyze data
      independent of investigators at the end of any one phase.
