      and has been proved to be effective in ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction(MI).The
      possible mechanisms of RIC protection is complicated.RIC leads to local ischemia and hypoxia
      and has been demonstrated to play a role in vital organs through hypoxia inducible
      factors(HIF) against stroke and MI.Besides HIF, hypoxia or high-altitude hypoxia could also
      change glycolytic process in erythrocyte through adenosine or
      sphingosine-1-phosphate(S1P).Accompanying with alternating glucolysis,
      2,3-diphosphoglycerate(2,3-BPG) in erythrocyte increases and it also facilitating oxygen
      release to tissues.Thus,we hypothesize that whether RIC could also increase 2,3-BPG in
      erythrocyte.There are 8 arms in this trial: All arms are RIC treatment. The level of 2,3-BPG
      in erythrocyte will be assessed by ELISA before and after the treatment.
