    
      It's a randomized, double-blind, prospective study including patients over the age of 18
      years old, programmed for potentially hemorrhagic thoracic surgery, such as pulmonary
      resection for aspergilloma, pulmonary tuberculosis, pleural decortication, lobectomy with
      parietectomy or redux. Demographic, clinical, biological data as well as transfusion
      requirements, blood loss and perioperative complications were identified.

      Two groups of patients:

        -  TA group: receiving tranexamic acid (25mg/kg) in bolus at induction followed by 2mg/kg/h
           in continuous infusion until the end of the act.

        -  Serum saline isotonic (SSI) group: placebo with isotonic saline serum.
