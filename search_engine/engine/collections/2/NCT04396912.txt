      carcinomas and benign disorders such as multinodular goitre, since it minimizes the risk of
      recurrence and eliminates the complication risks of repeat or completion surgery. Vocal cord
      paralysis due to injury to recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is the most dreaded complication
      of total thyroidectomy. The reported incidence of temporary RLN injury (RLNI) varies between
      0 and 12 %, while the incidence of permanent RLNI has been reported to be much lower (0-3.5
      %). In case of bilateral RLNI, respiratory distress and aspiration can develop rapidly and
      may result in mortality. Therefore, all precautions including close monitoring and
      tracheostomy should be undertaken without any delay. The best known technique to avoid injury
      to RLN is meticulous dissection of the nerve throughout its anatomic pathway. However,
      functional impairment of RLN is not visible macroscopically and intraoperative nerve
      monitoring (IONM) has been developed to monitor the nerve to avoid unnecessary dissection.
      Meticulous hemostasis can be achieved with harmonic sealing instrument, since improper
      hemostasis is known to increase the risk of RLNI. Despite the lack of evidence to support an
      advantage of IONM over the standard anatomic dissection of RLN, surgeons have adopted it in
      increasing ratios. The second most feared compliation of thyroidectomy is iatrogenic
      hypocalcemia. Transient symptomatic hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy occurs in
      approximately 7% to 25% of cases, but permanent hypocalcemia is less common (0.4% to 13.8%).
      Size and invasion of tumor, operative trauma and vascular compromise determines the severity
      of symptoms.
