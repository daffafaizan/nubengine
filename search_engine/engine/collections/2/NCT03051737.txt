        -  to measure the influence of different factors as environmental or structural and to
           identify the modifiable factors, then to allow us to test by simulation, impact of
           various interventions (for example: opening of hospitals and reinforcement of ED teams)
           on arrival flows or regenerated tension inside ED teams.

        -  to study the relation between the flows (arrival patients, hospitalized patients) and
           the time of ED visit or the indicators of tension of ED team.

        -  Typology of ED in the region of Paris permitting afterward comparison the benchmarking
           type between similar structures.

      This retrospective study will be performed on database: individual data in the region of
      Paris of summation of ED visits and data on the structures of health cares, as well as
      environmental data (principal given cares, weather, moves, circulations, pollution, strikes,
      vacations, etc.)
