    
      Randomized clinical trial, according to CONSORT standards, with newborn preterm gestational
      age <34 weeks and birth weight <1500 g, admitted to the intensive care unit. Newborns will be
      randomized. Those selected for the control group (CG) will be placed in the incubator
      following the service routine. Babies in the intervention group (IG), will be positioned
      supine in a hammock in the incubator, with the appropriate postural adjustments. The
      evaluation of muscle activity will be carried out through surface electromyography.
      Evaluations shall be performed immediately before the intervention; immediately after 24
      hours of intervention; and within 24 hours without intervention, in order to compare the
      values before and after the intervention of the two groups, as well as if the effects of the
      intervention are maintained after its removal.
