      health population of subjects taking anti-depressants and/or anti-psychotics with a new or
      current primary or secondary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Depressive
      Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DDNOS). Prospective data will be collected on all subjects
      until study completion at 24-25 weeks post enrollment. Claims data may be reviewed per pay,
      if such data are readily available in a timely manner.
