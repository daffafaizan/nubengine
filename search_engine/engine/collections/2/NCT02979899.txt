      target highly expressed on tumor vessels that is distinct from VEGFR. Endoglin is also
      expressed directly on tumor cells in angiosarcoma and is upregulated following VEGF
      inhibition. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models
      and complements the activity of bevacizumab and multi-kinase inhibitors that target the
      VEGFR.

      Pazopanib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma
      concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
      cancer progression.

      By targeting a non-VEGF pathway that is upregulated following VEGF inhibition, TRC105 has the
      potential to complement VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and could represent a major
      advance in the treatment of angiosarcoma. Together, the use of TRC105 with pazopanib may
      result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that
      seen with pazopanib alone.
