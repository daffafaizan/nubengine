      Real-time Myocardial Contrast Stress Echocardiograms) that are in routine clinical use. The
      information, including the digital images that are collected during the stress tests is used
      to determine if the usse of specialized imaging techniques and ultrasound contrast can better
      detect blockage in blood flow to the heart and predict how patients outcome may be affected
      by this detection of a blockage.
