      developed a laboratory model to investigate the effects of potential treatment medications on
      cannabis withdrawal and on the subjective and reinforcing effects of cannabis in non
      treatment-seeking cannabis smokers. In this study, the investigators are interested in
      testing how lorcaserin influences the effects of cannabis in a human laboratory model of
      cannabis use.
