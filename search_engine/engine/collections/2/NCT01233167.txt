      patients receiving sirolimus drug-eluting stent implantation. If aspirin plus clopidogrel
      reduced MACE rates without increasing blood events, the investigators will evaluate
      risk-benefit ratio. The investigators will observe all cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial
      infarction, or clinical-driven target vessel revascularization TVR in a 1-year trial
      duration. In addition, strokes, stent thrombosis, cardiac re-hospitalizations,
      dialysis/hemofiltration, duration of hospitalization and bleeding events will be observed.
