    
      This study is a prospective, multi-center (2), single arm, open label US-based feasibility
      study.

      The clinical hypothesis for the study is that the CyberHeart treatment approach will be safe
      and with further study will not be shown to be inferior to current treatment options, may
      lead to a survival benefit and improved quality of life.

      The ablation to be performed with the CyberHeart System will be targeting the anatomical site
      of the clinically presenting VT. The application site will be determined by morphological
      criteria on the 12 lead ECG along with anatomical data from MRI or CT scan imaging. Ablation
      will be performed at the designated location with the intention to produce substrate
      modification.

      The Study will enroll a maximum of 10 patients.
