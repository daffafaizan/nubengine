      A study nurse will draw 3 teaspoonfuls (15 ml) of blood. Two teaspoons (10ml) will be drawn
      for basic blood work and one teaspoon (5ml) will be drawn for genotyping. The study physician
      will perform a physical exam and discuss all medical history.

      The study will be randomized to one of two groups like flipping a coin.

        -  Study Sequence A- start with brand name metoprolol ER, switch to Generic B metoprolol,
           switch back to brand name metoprolol ER, then switch to Generic A metoprolol

        -  Study Sequence B- start with brand name metoprolol ER, switch to Generic A metoprolol,
           switch back to brand name metoprolol ER, then switch to Generic B metoprolol.

      Each study sequence will consist of treatment with brand name metoprolol ER for 2 periods,
      treatment with Generic A metoprolol ER for one period, and treatment with Generic B
      metoprolol ER for one period. The generic drug periods will be in a different order for each
      study group. During the times the switch will take place the following tests will be
      performed: 24-hour pharmacokinetic parameter assessment, 24-hour heart rate monitoring,
      24-hour blood pressure monitoring, 24-hour holter monitoring, exercise treadmill to induce
      heart rate, and a 24-hour gastric potential hydrogen (pH) monitoring via a wireless capsule.
