      Unites States for 2007, with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) constituting the mainstay of
      local therapy for an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed patients. Despite improvements
      in the delivery and reduction in associated toxicity of external beam radiotherapy, local
      persistence or recurrence of disease remains prevalent in 25-51% of patients. Local disease
      after EBRT is a risk factor for subsequent metastatic progression and prostate
      cancer-specific mortality, and is a cause of morbidity including hematuria, obstructive
      uropathy, and chronic pain. Given its prevalence, and the lack of satisfactory local salvage
      treatments, fear of prostate cancer recurrence has been shown to impose a substantial burden
      of suffering in patients.

      Stereotactic needle placement under MRI-guidance enables two critical steps in tumor-targeted
      brachytherapy: 1) directly guiding brachytherapy catheters to sites of tumor recurrence, and
      2) permitting treatment planning and delivery to be based on 3D MRI images. MRI-based HDR
      brachytherapy will precisely identify the location of brachytherapy catheters relative to the
      target volumes and adjacent normal structures at risk of radiation injury, obviating the need
      for invasive saturation (24-100) mapping biopsies.

      This study will build the evidence supporting the concept of MRI-guidance and tumor-targeted
      HDR brachytherapy in the management of prostate cancer. This trial will strive to demonstrate
      improvements in technical performance under MRI-guidance, while exploring a novel paradigm of
      patient-specific modulation of dose intensity based on regions of tumor burden.
