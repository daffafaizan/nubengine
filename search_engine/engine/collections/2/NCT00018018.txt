    
      This is a clinical gene transfer study that aims to verify the safety and efficacy of the use
      of retroviral vectors to introduce the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into the
      hematopoietic progenitors of patients affected with severe combined immunodeficiency due to
      ADA deficiency. In addition, this protocol will examine the effects of the ADA gene transfer
      on the immune system of treated patients. Patients with ADA deficiency and ineligible for
      matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are eligible to participate to the
      study. To increase engraftment and selective advantage of gene-corrected cells, busulfan will
      be used as cytoreduction agent and enzyme replacement (PEG-ADA) therapy will be discontinued.
      CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors will be isolated from the patient bone marrow or cord blood,
      exposed to retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer and reinfused into the patient through a
      peripheral vein. Clinical, immunological and molecular follow-up studies will assess safety,
      toxicity, and efficacy of the procedure.
