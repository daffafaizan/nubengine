      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (the viral organism responsible for COVID-19
      disease) is evolving on a daily basis. Reports from China indicate that a subset of patients
      with the worst clinical outcomes may manifest cytokine storm syndrome. Hypotheses that excess
      cytokines may trigger a secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) have been
      proposed. Indeed, cytokine profiles consistent with this picture were observed in Chinese
      patients with severe pulmonary involvement. Specifically, elevated ferritin and interleukin-6
      (IL-6) were associated with fatalities among the infected patients. A role for targeted
      anti-inflammatory and anti-cytokine therapies in the treatment of pulmonary hyperinflammation
      has been proposed.

      Clazakizumab is a genetically engineered humanized immunoglobulin-1 (IgG1) monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to human IL-6. This investigational agent is
      currently being studied as a treatment for chronic active antibody mediated rejection of
      renal allografts.

      In this study investigators propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with
      life-threatening pulmonary failure secondary to COVID-19 disease.
