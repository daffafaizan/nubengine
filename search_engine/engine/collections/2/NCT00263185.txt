    
      This is a pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with the following aims:

        -  To compare the effects of high dose vitamin D versus standard dose vitamin D on
           musculoskeletal pain in breast cancer patients receiving anastrozole when vitamin D
           levels are in the insufficient but not deficient range (10 to 29 ng/ml).

        -  To evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in post-menopausal
           women with a history of breast cancer who are treated with anastrozole and have
           musculoskeletal symptoms versus those who are asymptomatic.

        -  To establish correlations between levels of vitamin D, the levels of PTH, the degree of
           bone loss and the severity of musculoskeletal symptoms.

        -  To evaluate the effect of standard dose versus high dose Vitamin D replacement on bone
           density in post-menopausal women with a history of breast cancer who are treated with
           anastrozole and have musculoskeletal symptoms.
