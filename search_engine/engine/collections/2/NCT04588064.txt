      for an initial assessment. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value
      (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive
      value (NPV) and accuracy of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT were calculated and compared to
      evaluate the diagnostic efficacy. In addition, the investigators further investigate the
      performance of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for differentiating invasive adenocarcinoma from
      adenocarcinoma in situ (pre-invasive lesion) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma in
      participants with solitary ground-glass opacity nodules.
