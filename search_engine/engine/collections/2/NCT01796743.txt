      fast Spin Echo T2 mapping)developed by Dr. Maria Altbach at the University of Arizona, has
      been tested clinically. It demonstrated a high sensitivity to the heart muscle swelling
      ("edema") in different types of heart injury, including heart attacks. The investigators have
      successfully tested the reproducibility of the new method in a series of healthy volunteers.
      The Phase I study revealed a robust clinical performance of the T2-Map sequence in multiple
      cardiac disorders.

      Based on these promising results, presented on several international Cardiac Imaging
      meetings, the investigators propose to use T2-Map methodology in patients with acute heart
      attacks and to compare value of this method with other clinical and imaging parameters in
      predicting short-term (30 day) clinical outcomes of these patients.

      If successful, the project will provide an effective risk-stratification tool to identify
      patients with heart attack as a result of atherosclerotic disease, who require more
      aggressive therapeutic approach and closer follow-up after initial hospitalization.
