      Chronic heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of impaired ventricular function resulting in
      clinical symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and decreased exercise capacity. These symptoms lead
      to a cyclical pattern of an increasing sedentary lifestyle with accompanying deconditioning
      and deterioration of muscle function. Until recently, the prescription for individuals with
      HF was rest and minimization of physical exertion.

      Objectives:

      The primary objectives of this randomized clinical trial were to determine whether subjects,
      with moderate to severe chronic HF, who completed a 12-week individualized program of
      cardiopulmonary training (exercise group) would have significantly greater (i) quality of
      life, measured by the Rand Short Form-36, and (ii) aerobic fitness, measured by oxygen uptake
      during symptom limited maximal metabolic treadmill testing, than subjects who met weekly with
      an investigator and received vital sign measurements (non-exercise group).

      Methods:

      A randomized controlled clinical trial was utilized. Individuals who met the inclusion
      criteria were randomly assigned to either an exercise or control group. Individuals in the
      exercise group received 36 weeks of exercise training (primary outcome variables were
      measured at 12 weeks). Participants in the control group received weekly visits with a nurse
      for 12 weeks.

      Status:

      Ongoing data analysis for publication. Final report submitted.
