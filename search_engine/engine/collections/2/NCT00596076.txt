      estimate that this prospective study will include almost one third of the 70 workers in the
      factory. The study provides objective data and subjective information from patients. The
      clinical benefits of back school on low back pain and quality of life will be reported at the
      beginning and the end of intervention and after a period of 6 months follow up.
