      suffer an opioid overdose (fatal or nonfatal) learn of this event (intervention) or practice
      usual-care (control). The AESOPS-2 trial will take place in 3 diverse health systems in the
      U.S. - Northwestern Medicine, AltaMed Health Services, and The Children's Clinic. At
      Northwestern Medicine, clinicians in the intervention group receive a letter notifying them
      of their patient's fatal or nonfatal ED overdose. At AltaMed Health Services, and The
      Children's Clinic, clinicians in the intervention group receive a letter notifying them of
      their patient's nonfatal ED overdose. The primary outcome is the change in clinician weekly
      milligram morphine equivalent (MME) dose prescribed in 6-month periods before and after
      receiving the letter. The secondary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients
      prescribed at least 50 daily MME. Group differences in these outcomes will be compared using
      an intent-to-treat difference-in-differences framework with a mixed-effects regression model
      to estimate clinician MME weekly dose. The AESOPS-2 trial will provide new knowledge about
      whether increasing prescribers' awareness of patients' opioid-related overdoses leads to a
      reduction in opioid prescribing. Additionally, this trial may better inform how to reduce
      opioid use disorder and opioid overdoses by lowering unnecessary population exposure to these
      drugs.
