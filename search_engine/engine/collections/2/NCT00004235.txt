      adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and gastric cardia treated
      with docetaxel and irinotecan. II. Determine time to progression and overall survival of
      patients treated treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen
      in these patients. IV. Assess treatment response in these patients by determining the
      prevalence of dysphagia, anorexia, and swallowing ability at diagnosis and during treatment
      with this regimen.
