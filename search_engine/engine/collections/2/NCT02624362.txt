      inhalation, accompanied by either an asthmogenic suggestion (nocebo), or a therapeutic
      suggestion (placebo). Airway inflammation, lung function, and asthma symptoms are measured in
      response to the odor/suggestion, up to 24 hours after odor inhalation. The investigators are
      also measuring worry and heart rate variability as potential mediators of the response.
