      will be randomized to either MaldiTof or routine diagnostics ('diagnostic pipelines').
      Randomization to MaldiTof or routine diagnostics will be 1:1 with stratification by hospital
      and specimen type (blood vs. other). Isolates grown from all eligible specimens of the same
      patient will be assigned to the same diagnostic pipeline as the first randomized specimen of
      that patient.

      Allocation to diagnostic arm will be assigned by a web based randomization program. When a
      pathogen is isolated from a positive eligible specimen, the laboratory technician will log
      onto the secure randomization program and enter the patient and specimen code. The random
      diagnostic pipeline allocation will then be generated, informed to the laboratory technician
      and logged in the study database. In the case of multiple specimens with pathogen growth for
      a single patient, the unique patient code will trigger the randomization program to generate
      the same diagnostic arm allocation as the previous sample(s).
