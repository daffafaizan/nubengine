      Selection and inclusion of patients will be done by principal investigator of Rheumatology
      Department. After verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria by principal
      investigator and signature of consent, patients will be randomized by 1: 1 randomization
      (centralized randomization by statistician into 2 groups at Month 0). They will participate
      in sessions in a deferred manner due to two per week for each group:

        -  Interventional "A" group: 32 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from Month 0 to
           Month 4 in 15 patients.

        -  Control "B" group: 16 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from Month 2 to Month 4 in
           15 patients.

      Patients of "B" group will be not performing sessions with "A" group patients. Sessions
      lasting about 45 minutes will be proposed from Monday to Friday in a room planned from this
      activity within the CHU. Exercises will be adapted and personalized according to each one.
      Evaluations will be carried out for group 1 (interventional) before the first session of tai
      chi at Month 0, before the session at Month 2 and at the end of the protocol at Month 4. The
      same evaluations will be carried out for group B (control) at Month 0, before first session
      of tai chi at Month 2 and at the end of the protocol.

      Assessment of pain and stress will be done before and after each session. Final assessment
      will be done at 4 months after randomization. Fitness assessment and tai chi sessions will be
      conducted by APA student. Clinical examination of patient, installation and removal of cardio
      frequency meter will be performed by nurse. Data entry will be done by Clinical Research
      Associate of the Rheumatology Department. Statistical analysis will be carried out by
      biostatistician affiliated to the study.
