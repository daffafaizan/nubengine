      patients with diabetic foot ulcers will be screened, randomized, treated, and followed for
      complete ulcer closure.

      After screening, qualified patients will be treated for up to 12 weeks. Patients who achieve
      complete ulcer closure will be followed for an additional 12 weeks.

      All patients will receive standard-of-care treatment. After randomization some patients will
      be treated with topical Selinexor gel twice weekly and some patients will be treated with a
      topical placebo gel twice weekly. Patients receiving Selinexor will be assigned to a
      sequential treatment cohort, either a 10 μM (μmol/L), 30 μM, or 70 μM dose.
