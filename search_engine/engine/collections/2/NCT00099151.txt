      humans as it is known to do in animals, by measuring a variety of factors dealing with
      metabolism and oxidative stress, through physical evaluations and laboratory tests.

      Participants will receive dietary counseling and free medical evaluations. In addition, each
      volunteer will be asked to do one of the following:

        1. Follow a reduced calorie diet

        2. Follow a reduced calorie diet using a liquid diet

        3. Increase physical activity while on a reduced calorie diet

        4. Follow a standard diet.

      Three separate five-day inpatient stays are required.
