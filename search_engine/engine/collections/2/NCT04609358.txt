      nutrition support algorithm is lack. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the the efficacy
      and safety of the implementation of an algorithm for enteral nutrition support compared with
      usual standard practice in children with malnutrition status with congenital heart disease.
      The usual standard practice for feeding often interrupted by retention in the gut and then
      choose the parenteral nutrition support especially in the patients with unstable hemodynamic
      status. Actually tiny and continuous feeding would improve the gut function and reach the
      adequate energy supply.
