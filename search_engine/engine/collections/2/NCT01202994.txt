      binding of 18F-Flutemetamol using PET imaging in community-dwelling functionally intact
      elderly subjects. Understanding the biodistribution and binding of this radiopharmaceutical
      in normal patients with various levels of potential for cognitive decline will help determine
      its appropriate role as a disease biomarker and aid in the interpretation of images produced
      with this agent. Comparison with FDG-PET is essential to correlate metabolic changes and for
      anatomic co-registration of 18F-PIB images necessary for group analysis.

      We will use 18F-Flutemetamol and FDG-PET to compare subjects with low and high practice
      effects with the following aims and hypotheses:

      Specific Aim 1: Examine the relationship between practice effects and amyloid burden in a
      community sample.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine whether FDG-PET or 18F-Flutemetamol better distinguish individuals
      with high and low practice effects.

      Hypothesis 1: Practice effects will be negatively correlated with amyloid deposition, so that
      higher levels of practice effects (i.e., better repeat testing) will be associated with lower
      levels of brain amyloid deposition and lower levels of practice effects (i.e., poorer repeat
      testing) will be associated with greater levels of brain amyloid and these two groups are
      more clearly distinguishable with 18F-PIB than FDG-PET.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients with increased amyloid deposition shown with 18F-PIB will have an
      FDG-PET scan with more pronounced temporal and parietal hypometabolism as noted on visual
      review of images and on statistical image analysis.
