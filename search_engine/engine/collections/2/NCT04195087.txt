      anesthesia in cesarean section. However, as a result of the sympathetic blockade in spinal
      anesthesia, vascular tone decreases and hypotension occurs. The incidence of hypotension
      increases up to 70% in pregnant women due to increased sensitivity to local anesthetics and
      increased intraabdominal pressure. Improper management of postspinal hypotension may lead to
      maternal and fetal complications. Predicting the risk of hypotension in patients undergoing
      spinal anesthesia may allow applications such as volume loading or prophylactic vasopressor
      use. The perfusion index, measured by pulse Oximeters, correlates with blood flow changes at
      the tip of the finger so that it can detect hypotension and thus decrease in blood flow after
      spinal anesthesia. Pleth variability index (PVI) is a non-invasive value found in the new
      generation pulse oximeters. It is a parameter used in the dynamic measurement of response to
      fluid therapy in intensive care units. PVI can dynamically give an idea about the fluid
      status of the pregnant woman. Previous studies have shown that PVI may be a marker for
      predicting hypotension following spinal anesthesia.
