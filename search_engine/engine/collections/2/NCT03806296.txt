      substance use (SU) and SUDs. However, the exact nature of this link and the mechanisms
      underlying it remain unclear. Circadian misalignment, a mismatch between late sleep hours and
      early school start times, is a compelling potential contributor to elevated SU in adolescent
      DSP with plausible neurobehavioral mechanisms. The investigators hypothesize that
      DSP-associated circadian misalignment decreases impulse control and increases reward
      sensitivity, thereby increasing SUD risk.

      This study will, for the first time, (1) comprehensively characterize the SUD risk profile
      associated with adolescent DSP, and (2) probe whether SUD risk is diminished by altering
      sleep/circadian timing. The study will assess both established markers of SUD risk and
      putative neurobehavioral mechanisms (impulsivity and reward sensitivity). Specifically, the
      investigators will employ a comprehensive, multi-method approach to examining DSP's role in
      SUD risk, combining laboratory, experimental, and longitudinal studies. The investigators
      will recruit a sample of 150 eleventh and twelfth graders (16-19 y/o), divided between 100
      DSP and 50 normal phase teens. The investigators will focus on cannabis and alcohol use given
      their prevalent use in adolescents and evident links to DSP.

      In the experimental study, the investigators will probe whether stabilizing circadian phase
      in the DSP group (n=100) by using sleep scheduling and chronotherapeutic approaches (i.e.,
      dim light in the evening and bright light in the morning) improves sleep and neurobehavioral
      function relevant to SUD risk.
