      central investigational tool of the homeopathic drug proving is the journal kept by each
      subject from DAY 1-35. The subject describes the symptoms they experience in their own words
      in the journal daily. During the 7 day run-in phase, the subject notes in their journal their
      current state of health, the daily rhythm of their life, and any other signs or symptoms that
      occur on a daily basis. This will also enhance familiarity with self-observation and the
      recording of signs and symptoms. After completion of this run-in phase an evaluation
      including journal check will occur on DAY 7. During the following 4 weeks (observation
      periods DAY 8-14, 22-28; wash-out period DAY 15-21 and 29 - 35) the subject documents all
      signs or symptoms that occur in his/her journal on a daily basis. During this period, subject
      interviews will take place on DAY 15, DAY 21. DAY 29 and DAY 36. During the 7 day follow up
      (post observation period, DAY 36-42) the subject will be contacted to check if any additional
      symptoms and/or adverse events occurred.
