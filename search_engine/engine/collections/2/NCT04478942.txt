      membranes (PROM) at or beyond 34 weeks gestational age.

      Objective 1: To determine if there is a decrease in time from initiation of induction of
      labor to vaginal delivery in women with an unfavorable cervix with the use of oral
      misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin.

      Hypothesis: Cervical ripening with misoprostol will be beneficial in women with an
      unfavorable cervix.

      Sub objective 1: To determine if the use of oral misoprostol for cervical ripening decreases
      the rate of postpartum hemorrhage in women with PROM.

      Hypothesis: Misoprostol use will result in significantly lower rate of postpartum hemorrhage.

      Sub objective 2: To evaluate the rates of infectious morbidity in peripartum women and
      neonates exposed to misoprostol versus oxytocin in PROM.

      Hypothesis: The use of oral misoprostol will result in lower rates of infectious morbidity in
      mother and neonate.

      Sub objective 3: To analyze patient satisfaction surveys. Hypothesis: Patients in the oral
      misoprostol group will be more satisfied with their labor experience.

      Exploratory Outcome To determine if there is a difference in cost between induction of labor
      in women with an unfavorable cervix with the use of oral misoprostol versus intravenous
      oxytocin.

      Hypothesis: The use of oral misoprostol will be cost effective in women presenting with PROM
      and an unfavorable cervix.
