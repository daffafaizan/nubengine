      patients.

      Although current treatment options are available for patients in the relapsed state, once
      these therapies fail or are not tolerated, treatment options are quite limited.

      Pembrolizumab and bendamustine have both shown activity when used as a single agent as
      treatment for Hodgkin Lymphoma. Their side effect profiles also do not overlap, which makes
      them ideal to combine, with an intent to increase the amount and duration of complete
      responses while limiting the toxicities experienced by patients.
