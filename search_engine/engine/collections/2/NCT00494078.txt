      critically ill patients. Therefore, strict glycemic control with a target blood glucose level
      between 80 and 110 mg/dl is recommended. Intensive insulin therapy requires continuous
      intravenous insulin infusion according to an algorithm and frequent blood glucose
      measurements. Implementation of intensive insulin therapy increases workload for both
      physicians and especially for nurses. The current gold-standard in intensive care units to
      achieve normoglycemia in critically ill patients is intensive insulin therapy according to a
      well established algorithm along with frequent blood glucose measurements. However, applying
      this gold-standard method, normoglycemia, defined as blood glucose levels below 110 mg/dl,
      can be achieved in approximately 50 percent of time only. We hypothesized, that real-time
      continuous glucose monitoring would increase the percentage of time of blood glucose levels
      below 110 mg/dl in critically ill patients.
