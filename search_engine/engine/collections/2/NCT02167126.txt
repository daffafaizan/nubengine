      Micropore® (placebo tape) was applied on the contralateral limb. Different tapes were used to
      evaluate if tape type would affect the findings. The side of application of the different
      tapes was randomized among the participants. Half of the participants (n = 17) had KT applied
      to the left thigh and the other half to the right thigh (n = 17). KT was applied using the
      "V" technique, the knee was positioned at 45º of flexion, the origin of both tapes was
      located 10 cm below the anterior-superior iliac spine with one tape going laterally and one
      medially to the rectus femoris muscle belly, passing around the patella and finishing on the
      tibial tuberosity. The same technique was used for the Micropore tape on the contralateral
      limb, but because it is not elastic, the knee joint was not crossed and the end points were
      the medial and lateral aspects of the patella. The mean force values were calculated for each
      condition (pre, post and 24 hours after tape application). The isometric knee extension force
      was collected using a load cell (EMG System do Brasil Ltda. ®) with a measuring range from 0
      to 200 kg at 1000 Hz, filtered with a low pass filter type Butterworth 4th order and cut-off
      frequency of 15 Hz, obtained through residual analysis.
