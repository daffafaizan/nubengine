    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the autologous NY-ESO-1 redirected T cell
      therapy in combination with decitabine and low-dose IL-2 in patients with treatment
      refractory or recurrent epithelial or non-epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian
      tube carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the persistence of genetically modified cells in the peripheral blood, and at
      tumor sites.

      II. To examine the effect of the treatment on tumor as measured by objective tumor response
      and progression free survival, both assessed by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).

      III. To assess the occurrence of target antigen and/or major histocompatibality complex (MHC)
      loss variants upon disease recurrence.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the post treatment phenotype and functionality of genetically modified T cells
      isolated from peripheral blood and from tumor sites.

      II. To assess changes in immunoscore, Tregs, Myeloid cell subsets, and antigen spreading in
      peripheral blood and tumor site.

      III. To assess the influence of demographic and disease molecular characteristics on
      treatment outcomes of complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      COURSE 1: Patients receive decitabine IV daily over 1 hour on days -8 to Day -6,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -4 and -3, and genetically engineered
      NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV and intraperitoneally (IP) on day 0. Followed by low-dose
      IL-2 for 2 weeks from Day 1 to Day 14..

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly at 3-9 months, every 6
      months for 4 years, and then annually for up to 15 years.
