      trial. After a 14-day baseline to evaluate ulcer healing to ensure DU are chronic, a 4-week
      active treatment followed by 8 weeks of observation and assessment of the treatment will
      compare the effects of two concentrations of DSC127 and placebo (n = 25 evaluable subjects
      per group; n=75 total evaluable subjects) to identify the optimal dose of DSC127. Sustained
      tissue integrity will be evaluated for all subjects during a follow-up period at study weeks
      16 and 24.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups.

      Group 1: Placebo Vehicle Control Group 2: 0.03% DSC127 in Vehicle Group 3: 0.01% DSC127 in
      Vehicle

      The four week treatment period requires daily application of the treatment to the wound site.
      First application each week will be at the clinic and for the remainder of the week the
      patient self-administers the treatment.

      If wound healing occurs during the treatment or assessment periods a final assessment visit
      is conducted and the integrity is assessed four and twelve weeks later (usually weeks 16 and
      24 of the study).
