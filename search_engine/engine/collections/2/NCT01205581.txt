    
      The primary objectives of this study are to compare the immune response of Fluzone HD, a
      high-dose, trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), to Fluzone, a standard-dose TIV, in children
      with cancer and in children with HIV.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  Describe the safety and reactogenicity of high-dose and standard-dose TIV.

        -  Compare the immunogenicity induced by 1 dose, compared to 2 doses, of high-dose and
           standard-dose TIV.

        -  Describe the relationship between baseline lymphocyte numbers/function and
           robustness/durability of the immune response.
