      dermal biopump capable of sustained secretion of therapeutic INF in the body, using a small
      tissue explant from the patient's own skin. The INFRADURE biopump is produced from a
      micro-organ (MO), typically measuring 30 mm in length and 1.5-2.5 mm diameter, which is
      harvested directly from the patient's dermis under local anesthesia. The micro-organ can be
      viably maintained ex-vivo for extended periods of time under standard culture conditions.
      INFRADURE Biopumps, produced by ex vivo transduction of MOs with Helper Dependent Adenoviral
      INF vectors (HDAd-INF), express and secrete INF. INFRADURE Biopump is monitored ex vivo prior
      to re-implantation, to attain true INF dosing. The INFRADURE Biopump is subsequently
      implanted subcutaneously back to the patient in order to provide continuous delivery of a
      known amount of INF. Each implanted autologous INFRADURE Biopump remains localized under the
      skin, and is accessible, so that if necessary, it can be removed or ablated at any time. The
      entire process from harvest to implantation requires 10-14 days
