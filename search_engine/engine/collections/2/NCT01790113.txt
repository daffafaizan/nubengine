    
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Arthrex Eclipse™ Shoulder
      Prosthesis to the Arthrex Univers™ II Shoulder Prosthesis for the treatment of degenerative
      joint disease in subjects who are candidates for total shoulder replacement. Non-inferiority
      in terms of safety and effectiveness will be measured by a 2 year composite clinical success
      (CCS) that requires functional improvement, radiographic success, absence of reoperations and
      revision, and lack of serious device-related adverse events.
