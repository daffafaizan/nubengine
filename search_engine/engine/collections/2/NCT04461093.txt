      of acupressure P6 point with dexamethasone and ondansetron in preventing PONV. It has been
      proven that palonosetron is more superior as single agent when compared with acupressure,
      dexamethasone and ondansetron separately. However, this might not be cost effective as
      palonosetron is more expensive than the other agents. In addition, the combination therapy
      has been reported better in preventing PONV when compared with monotherapy. The investigators
      need to investigate whether the combination of acupressure with dexamethasone and ondansetron
      exert an effect equal or even better than palonosetron monotherapy. The investigators
      hypothesis is the combination of acupressure P6 point with dexamethasone and ondansetron
      provide better prophylaxis againts PONV when compared with palonosetron. The requirement for
      rescue anti-emetics for combination of acupressure P6 point with dexamethasone and
      ondansetron group is lesser than palonosetron.
