    
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical activity of GSK2110183 dosed in combination with
      bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) subjects who have
      failed at least one line of systemic treatment. Part 1 will identify the maximum tolerated
      dose(s) (MTD) of the combination regimen.

      Part 1, Schedule A will assess the safety and pharmacodynamics of GSK2110183 administered
      once daily with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) and dexamethasone (20 mg) given biweekly. It is
      estimated that up to 35-45 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part 1. Part 2 will explore
      further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of
      the MTD(s) identified in Part 1. A minimum of 15 and maximum of 40 subjects will enroll in
      Part 2 Safety/Clinical Activity Cohort for each Schedule explored. The Part 2 PK/PD cohort
      will enroll up to 18 subjects. This pharmacokinetic cohort will explore whether exposure to
      GSK2110183 at the MTD is similar when GSK2110183 is administered alone or in combination with
      bortezomib and dexamethasone. The same relationship will be explored for bortezomib and
      dexamethasone when the two drugs are given by themselves or in combination with GSK2110183.
      The identified MTD(s) and pharmacodynamic results in this study will inform the doses for
      future development of the regimen of GSK2110183 dosed in combination with bortezomib and
      dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed/refractory MM.
