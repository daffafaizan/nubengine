        -  Determine the effects of EGFR inhibitors on the EGFR pathway in the skin of cancer
           patients prior to and after receiving EGFR inhibitors (i.e., tyrosine kinase inhibitors
           and monoclonal antibodies).

        -  Compare the effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors vs monoclonal antibodies on the
           EGFR pathway in the skin of these patients.

        -  Compare changes in the EGFR pathway with grade of rash in these patients.

        -  Compare changes in EGFR pathway effectors in the skin with serum TGFα levels in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo skin punch biopsies and blood sample collection at baseline, within 1 week
      of developing skin rash, and 6 weeks after beginning treatment. Samples are analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry and western blot for phosphorylated MAP kinase, AKT, and EGF levels and
      TGFα levels. Patients also complete diagrams to indicate locations of the rash once weekly
      during the first 6 weeks of treatment.
