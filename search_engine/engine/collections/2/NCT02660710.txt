      CD20-positive DLBCL, using the Indian generic biosimilar for rituximab, Reditux™. The
      investigators will enroll 40 adult patients age 18-60 years (20 HIV-infected with CD4 count ≥
      100 cells/µL, 20 HIV-uninfected) who will receive a maximum of 6-8 cycles of R-CHOP over
      18-24 weeks. The primary goal of this study is to establish the safety of R-CHOP in the
      Malawi population.

      Secondary objectives of the study include estimates of complete response (CR) rates,
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). In addition, quality of life,
      costs of care, study patient characteristics, clinical outcomes and other published data from
      the region will be collected and used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of R-CHOP. If the
      investigators' study supports incorporating rituximab into treatment regimens in sub-Saharan
      Africa, this strategy can be examined in larger trials, and provide momentum to increase
      access to modern cancer medicines globally.
