      crossover study in symptomatic celiac disease patients attempting a GFD for at least one year
      prior to screening. Seropositive patients (blood test confirmed at Visit 0) will be scheduled
      for a Screening Visit (Visit 1) whereas seronegative patients will be discontinued from study
      participation (screen failures). Patients who meet Visit 1 protocol enrollment criteria will
      be enrolled and begin the first of two 6 week periods.
