      consistent access to nutritious and adequate amounts of food). Most weight loss programs
      targeted at low income women do not focus on gaining skills and knowledge to reduce food
      insecurity.

      Eligible participants will be randomized into one of two groups. The two groups will follow
      different weight management programs. One group will follow a standard weight management
      program. The other group with follow the investigations program, the $ensible Weigh Program.
      Participation in the study will last about 9 months.
