      life and prognosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous evidence suggests that subthalamic
      nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) improve off-medication FOG but not on-medication FOG
      in patients with PD. Furthermore, off-mediation FOG persist or even worsen after STN-DBS in
      some PD patients.

      Although visual and auditory cues are known to improve FOG in research setting, it is unclear
      whether these cues are effective for FOG in real clinical setting. Most previous studies have
      used wearable devices to use sensory cues, but such devices are difficult to apply in
      clinical practice.

      Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions based
      on visual and auditory cues in patients with PD after bilateral STN-DBS. Participants undergo
      clinical evaluations including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating
      Scale (UPDRS), Freezing of Gait-Questionnaire (FOG-Q), and the average number of falling over
      the last week. Then, participants receive behavior intervention training that includes how to
      apply visual and auditory cues to freezing of gait in real clinical practice. To investigate
      the education effect, FOG-Q and the average number of falling over the last week are
      repetitively assessed at 2-week and 4-week follow-ups using a phone call.
