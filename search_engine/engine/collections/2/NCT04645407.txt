      spread rapidly. Some of the patients developed into severe or critical illness. It became an
      international concerned public health emergencies and one of the major epidemics seriously
      endangering people's health and public safety after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
      in 2003.

      At present, we lack the specific treatment for NCP. The anti- novel coronavirus drugs are
      been conducting in clinical trials, and the other options includes the symptomatic treatment.
      The pathological mechanism of the disease is not clear, but due to the continuous development
      of inflammation, some cases can become severe or critical, which threatening the life and
      health of patients. Intensive cases with obvious inflammation, after the control of acute
      symptoms and signs, often have the performance of pulmonary fibrosis, affecting the recovery
      of lung function. Therefore, actively reducing lung inflammation, controlling and reversing
      pulmonary fibrosis is of great significance for the life and health of patients Infected
      novel coronavirus.

      Our previous study found that Fuzheng Huayu prescription can reduce the inflammation and
      fibrosis of the lung in the model rats, and improve the lung function of the patients with
      COPD. Therefore, we hope to take Fuzheng Huayu tablet to NCP patients, and observe whether it
      can reduce the lung inflammation of patients, so as to reduce the rate of progression of
      critical illness.
