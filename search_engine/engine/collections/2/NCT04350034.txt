      enrolled from the outpatient clinic in the faculty of physical therapy, Cairo university,
      Egypt. The inclusion criteria were: total body surface area (TBSA) of 40-60%, being
      ambulatory without an assistant. The exclusion criteria included metabolic disorders,
      neuropathy, visual or vestibular disorders, amputation, participation in another study, any
      adverse medication reactions, history of epilepsy, loss of balance, and lower or upper limb
      deformity. All patients received similar standard medical care and treatment from the time of
      admission until the time of discharge.

      Total burn surface area was assessed by the "modified Lund and Browder charts" method during
      excisional surgery immediately following hospital admittance. Informed written consent was
      obtained from each patient's guardian prior to enrollment.

      All procedures were approved by the ethical committee of the faculty of physical therapy,
      Cairo university, Giza, Egypt. After consent was obtained, patients were randomly assigned to
      standard of care group (SOC) or Xbox training group (Xbox).

      The Xbox group participated in a 12-week of routine physiotherapy program supplemented with
      Xbox training program (N=20). In contrast, the SOC group participated in the routine
      physiotherapy program (N=20).

      A normal activity of daily living (ADL), diet and patient's lifestyle were maintained for all
      participants as much as possible.
