      EMA Fentanyl to those patients with breakthrough cancer pain who were treated for at least 2
      weeks in FEN-202, the long term safety study used for worldwide registration. Patients were
      followed in an outpatient setting. Use of BEMA Fentanyl and occurrence of serious adverse
      events (SAEs) were monitored. Throughout the study, all patients continued their background
      opioid regimen and were permitted to use their rescue medication if adequate pain relief was
      not realized within 30 minutes following application of BEMA Fentanyl.
