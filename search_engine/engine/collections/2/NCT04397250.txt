      biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in persons with chronic paraplegia.

      Baseline and follow-up assessments:

      Before each visits, participants will be asked to refrain from any strenuous physical
      activity (2 days prior), consume no caffeine (including tea or coffee) or alcohol (1 day
      prior), and have fasted for at least 10 hours overnight before arriving to the University of
      Bath laboratories.

      There will be measurements of basic anthropometrics (height, weight, waist and hip
      circumference), body composition (via a DEXA scan), resting metabolic rate, sub-maximal and
      maximal exercise capacity, and blood responses following the consumption of a sugary drink.

      Physical activity and diet monitoring:

      Participants will be asked to monitor their normal diet (weighed food diary) and physical
      activity patterns (chest-worn strap) over a 1-week period following the first visit, and in
      the final week of the 6-week intervention/control period.

      Exercise intervention:

      The 6-week exercise programme or control will start two weeks after the first lab visit.
      Participants in the exercise group will be asked to wear a heart-rate monitor for all
      exercise sessions, and upload their data to a smartphone for remote-monitoring by the
      research team.
