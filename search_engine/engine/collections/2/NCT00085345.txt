      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
           myeloma (MM) treated with melphalan, arsenic trioxide, and ascorbic acid.

        -  Determine the response rate (combined complete response, partial response, and minimal
           response) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to response and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on renal failure associated with MM in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral melphalan once daily on days 1-4 of week 1 and arsenic trioxide (ATO)
      IV over 1-2 hours and ascorbic acid IV over 15 minutes on days 1-4 of week 1 and then twice
      weekly during weeks 2-5. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression any time
      after course 1 also receive oral prednisone once daily on days 1-4 and 22-25 of each course.
      Patients achieving a complete response after 6 courses of therapy undergo bone marrow biopsy
      and receive no further therapy. Patients achieving stable disease or a partial response after
      6 courses of therapy continue to receive ATO and ascorbic acid once weekly.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study.
