      will be asked to drink a mixed meal replacement drink (Boost) and will be randomized (like
      flipping a coin) to bolus insulin for the "meal" or to not bolus insulin using their standard
      insulin dose. Glucose will be monitored with a finger prick before they drink the meal
      replacement, 1 hour later and finally 2 hours after drinking the meal replacement.

      Stiffness of the blood vessel of the wrist will be determined using radial tonometry. Radial
      tonometry is safe and does not hurt. A pen like probe is placed on the blood vessel of the
      wrist. When the machine reads a good wave form the computer will calculate the stiffness of
      the blood vessel. This test will be done along with the glucose checks; before drinking the
      meal replacement drink, and 1 and 2 hours after drinking the meal replacement drink.

      During the next study visit, the subject will repeat the exact same study described above.
      However, this time they will receive the other insulin assignment they were assigned during
      the first study (either bolus or no bolus).
