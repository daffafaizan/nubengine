      unintended pregnancy following an act of unprotected intercourse. Orally-dosed EC works by
      delaying ovulation and reduces the risk of pregnancy for a single act of unprotected
      intercourse by 50-70%. Unfortunately, obese women are significantly more likely than their
      normal BMI counterparts to experience failure of orally-dosed EC and in some instances EC is
      equivalent to placebo.

      The PI's preliminary data provides evidence for testing a dose escalation strategy in an
      effort to provide improved efficacy from orally-dosed EC in obese women. The hypothesis is
      that increasing the dose of orally-dosed EC agents will normalize the pharmacokinetics
      resulting in the expected treatment effect (delay in follicle rupture) in obese women. In the
      overall proposal, the investigators plan to perform detailed pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies of ulipristal acetate-based EC in obese women and expand upon the
      preliminary findings of levonorgestrel-based EC. This protocol registration is for the LNG
      aspect of the study procedures focused on the pharmacodynamics of LNG dose escalation
