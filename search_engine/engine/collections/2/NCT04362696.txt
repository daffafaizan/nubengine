      functional dysconnectivity, and by stimulating the brain noninvasively with extremely weak
      levels of electrical current, we may be able to re-synchronize connectivity and stabilize or
      improve memory and cognitive function, measured behaviorally. The experiments of this project
      are proposed as between-subjects, sham-controlled, and double-blind in design, and use
      noninvasive electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements of rhythmic brain activity. The
      experimental intervention involves the application of low-intensity, high-definition,
      transcranial electrical current stimulation while subjects perform a variety of
      computer-based tasks that probe memory and cognitive function.
