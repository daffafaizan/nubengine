      Treatment group: early supplementation of enteral lipid with ML and FO; Control group:
      routine care.

      The primary goal of this study is to obtain pilot data that will inform the subsequent design
      and execution of a large, randomized trial which will test the hypothesis that infants with
      short bowel syndrome or ostomy will experience beneficial growth effects from enteral
      nutrition supplemented with balanced n6/n-3 PUFA, a simple, inexpensive and noninvasive
      intervention. This pilot study will confirm the safety of PUFA supplemented enteral
      nutrition, establish the length and amount of enteral versus parenteral nutrition required,
      and determine the impact on infant growth and intestinal adaptation by measuring expression
      of four key genes that play a crucial role in intestinal adaptation.
