      obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and hyperglycemia, is associated with the
      development of type 2 diabetes and CVD. It has become one of the major public health
      challenges in China due to rapidly nutrition transition and the nature of obesity epidemic.
      Treatment of MetS in China is very important for the prevention of the epidemic of its
      consequences (such as CVD and type 2 diabetes).

      Compelling evidence from recent human studies has demonstrated that diet modifications are
      effective means in MetS management. Consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods such as rice
      affects blood glucose and influences diabetes risk. Specifically, eating polished white rice
      may increase diabetes risk, whereas eating brown rice, a whole grain product, may decrease
      risk. This is likely related to the different ability of white and brown rice to raise blood
      glucose levels, as measured by their glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), and to the
      higher levels of dietary fiber, vitamin B complex, magnesium and other micronutrients in
      brown rice.

      A total of 200 participants with MetS (defined by ATP-III criteria) will be randomly assigned
      to a brown rice diet or an isocaloric white rice diet for 16 weeks. Effects of substituting
      brown for white rice will be evaluated by measuring metabolic profile (BMI, blood pressure,
      total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C and HDL-C, fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1C).
