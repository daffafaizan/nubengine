      albumin is able to modify the concentration of beta-amyloid peptide in cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) in patients with AD.

        -  There was two weeks for screening and randomization of both groups (treatment and
           control).

        -  The subjects were randomized in a 1:1 proportion.

      After screening and randomization, treatment proceeded as follows:

        -  three weeks of intensive treatment with two plasma exchanges per week

        -  followed by a month and a half of maintenance treatment with one weekly plasma exchange,
           and

        -  finally, three months of treatment with one plasma exchange every two weeks.

      The control group followed the same program, except for the plasma exchanges. After the
      treatment period ended, subjects followed-up for a 6-month period of time.

      The trial comprises a global multicenter (Spain and US), blind, randomized, controlled
      design. The trials key coordination is based in Spain where Dr. Boada (see Study
      Officials/Investigators) is the main study official.
