      alignment with the mission of the organization to provide high value care to their members.
      The Lay Health Worker Engages, Educates, and Encourages Patients to Share intervention is an
      innovative program that will strengthen provider-patient relationship and facilitate whole
      person care about matters important to Unite Here Health members who are diagnosed with
      cancer and important to support network and family. The project is intended to help establish
      Goals of Care Plan with appropriate documentation, develop, deploy, and evaluate a model of
      care for persons with cancer that is intended to improve clinical outcomes and experience of
      care for individuals. The intervention provides patients with lay health coaches who assist
      patients and their families in discussing goals of care and engage in shared-decision making.
      The goal of the project is to demonstrate that there is improved documentation of goals of
      care, patient experiences, patient activation and quality of life outcomes, and that the
      program helps to reduce utilization of health care resources at the end of life.
