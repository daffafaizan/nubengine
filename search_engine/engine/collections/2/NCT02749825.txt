      to receive either continued treatment with the drug they have been on, or will be randomized
      to Trelstar for a period of 3 months. At the end of that period, testosterone and prostate
      serum antigen (PSA) levels will be drawn and compared to their previous levels to determine
      if Trelstar is as effective as the previous treatment.
