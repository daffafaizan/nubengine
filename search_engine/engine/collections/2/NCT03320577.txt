      kidney failure. Hypertension, is a modifiable risk factor that may be successfully treated
      using one or a combination of treatment options, including medication, diet, exercise,
      tobacco cessation, or complementary and alternative medicine such as breathing exercises. A
      well-established cascade of adverse health outcomes are associated with hypertension as well
      as increased mortality rates. For patient-centered care, providing patients with additional
      strategies for their health care also has the potential to empower the patient, augment
      patient-physician team approach to the patient's health care, and support the standards of
      care for treating hypertension. As explained by McCaffrey et al from their focus group work
      with patients, "Participants do not want prescription medications except as a last resort and
      feel that conventional medicine overemphasizes prescription medicines. This may be because of
      a combination of factors including distrust in conventional medicine, fear of side effects
      from medicines, and an underlying belief that the body can heal itself given the right
      nutrition, rest, and time"

      Using a randomized controlled trial study design with a 1-month and 3-month follow-up, the
      investigators hypothesize that practicing breathing at least 5 times per week will show a
      mean reduction in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures in uncontrolled
      hypertensive patients compared to control patients. Participants will be randomized into one
      of three arms of the study. For the intervention arm, participants will be either assigned to
      a weekly class for the pranayama breathing instruction and practice or given a DVD that
      contains instructions on the breathing exercises and the 15-minute practice session.
