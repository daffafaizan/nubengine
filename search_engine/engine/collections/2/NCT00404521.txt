    
      Phase I single-institution, open-label, dose-escalating, clinical and pharmacokinetic study.
      The purpose is to determine the safety, tolerability and to identify the dose limiting
      toxicities(DLT) and recommended dose (RD) of PM02734 administered every 3 weeks,
      intravenously, over 30 minutes to subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors. Secondary
      objectives are to determine preliminary Pharmacokinetics of PM02734, to explore the
      relationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To evaluate the preliminary
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics correlation and to evaluate the preliminary antitumor
      activity of PM02734. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and
      applicable regulatory requirements.
