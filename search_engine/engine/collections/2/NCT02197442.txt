    
      Tablet in healthy, adult human subjects under fasting condition, with a screening period of
      28 days prior to dose administration in Period-I. In each study period, twenty-four (24)
      blood samples, including two (02) predose blood samples, each of 02 mL were collected from
      each subject except for the discontinued / withdrawn subjects to analyze the pharmacokinetic
      profile of the test as well as the reference product.

      The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the drug concentration vs. time profile
      by non-compartmental model using WinNonlin Professional Software-Version 5.3 (Pharsight
      Corporation, USA) for Valsartan. Statistical comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      the two formulations was carried out using PROC MIXED of SASÂ® Version 9.3 (SAS Institute
      Inc., USA) to assess the bioequivalence of both the formulations.
