      Canada for use in combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, the
      combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a neoadjuvant treatment prior to gemcitabine
      and radiation is experimental. Surgery to remove or reconstruct the major artery is also
      experimental.
