      are screened for exclusion via telephone interview, and if eligible, a health background
      interview. Initial contact will come from the subject's response to recruitment materials.
      Subjects may withdraw at any time.

      These safe laboratory studies with healthy volunteers are designed to help us figure out how
      to maximize the effectiveness of virtual reality when used with severe burn patients at
      Harborview Burn Center
