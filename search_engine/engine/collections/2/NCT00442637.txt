      of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. With this approach the median overall survival is
      approximately 20 months, and progression-free survival in first-line approximately 9-11
      months. The optimal duration of treatment is unknown. Current data suggest that the efficacy
      of bevacizumab is dependent on concomitant use of chemotherapy. However, oxaliplatin almost
      invariably gives rise to neuropathy after 6-8 cycles. Prolonged use of capecitabine is
      associated with e.g. hand-foot syndrome. Lastly, the prolonged use of these agents is
      associated with considerable costs.

      Evidence, mainly preclinical, suggests that continuous dosing metronomic chemotherapy may be
      more efficacious than interval-chemotherapy given at MTD. In this study the concept of
      metronomic chemotherapy is explored by administering a continuous daily instead of the usual
      2 weeks-on/1 week-off oral dosing regimen of low-dose capecitabine plus bevacizumab as
      maintenance therapy after induction combination chemotherapy given at MTD plus bevacizumab.
