    
      trabeculectomy is an ocular surgery intended to reduce intra-ocular pressure the surgery
      creates a sub-conjunctival filtering bleb which filters aqueous humor fluid out.

      a rather common adverse event of the surgery is increasing vascularity of the conjunctiva
      overlying the bleb. this leads to adherence of the conjunctiva to the sclera and fibrosis and
      finally failure of the bleb (and of the surgery) this study wishes to demonstrate that post
      operative subconjunctival bevacizumab injection will reduce incidence of bleb vascularity and
      ultimately, bleb failure.

      during the study, one study group will be given subconjunctival bevacizumab 1 week after
      surgery, another study group will be given subconjunctival bevacizumab 2 week after surgery,
      and a third group will serve as control and will not receive bevacizumab. if bleb vascularity
      will be diagnosed all patients will be treated according to current guidelines.
