    
      This is a single arm, Phase 2, open label, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      weekly carboplatin in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in subjects with
      previously untreated triple negative breast cancers who are candidates for potentially
      curative surgery.

      Subjects will receive carboplatin (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 2 mg/mL/min) + paclitaxel (80
      mg/m2) Carboplantin plus Paclitaxel (CbP) followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC).
      All subjects will receive CbP on Day 1 of 12 weekly cycles (Visits CbP1 - CbP12) via infusion
      during Chemotherapy Segment 1 as indicated in the Study Schema. Dose interruptions and dose
      modifications are allowed based upon tolerability and may extend Chemotherapy Segment 1
      duration to a maximum of 16 weeks. Beginning with Chemotherapy Segment 2 all subjects will
      receive doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) on Day 1 of four 14-day
      cycles (Visits AC1 - AC4). For subjects who experience toxicities due to carboplatin,
      paclitaxel, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide, the appropriate dose modifications or dosing
      delays should be managed according to Section 11.2. Dose modifications may result in the
      total duration of therapy being greater than the planned 24 weeks. The objective of this
      study is to determine efficacy and tolerability of low dose, weekly carboplatin in
      combination with weekly paclitaxel followed by standard doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide as
      neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.
