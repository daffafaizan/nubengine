      with single-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). To minimize inappropriate
      shock delivery, ICDs should sense both atrial and ventricular intracardiac signals.
      Dual-chamber ICDs are used for this purpose, but are associated with increased postoperative
      complications due to the implantation of a separate atrial lead. It has to be shown that a
      novel single-lead dual-chamber ICD-system with enhanced SVT discrimination can achieve the
      same specificity in discriminating SVT episodes as conventional dual-chamber ICD, without the
      disadvantage of the implantation of several leads. In this study patients eligible for
      dual-chamber ICD therapy who do not need atrial pacing will receive either a single-lead
      dual-chamber ICD (Belos A+ and Kainox A+ electrode) or a dual-lead dual-chamber ICD (Belos
      DR). SMART detection algorithm will be used in both study groups for discrimination between
      atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Atrial tachyarrhythmia episodes are facultatively
      induced in both groups at implantation or predischarge via a bipolar stimulation catheter.
      Induced episodes and the corresponding ICD intervention (detection and therapy or inhibition
      of therapy) are documented. Follow-ups are scheduled for 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after
      implantation. ICD intervention, particularly related to spontaneous SVT episodes, will be
      evaluated based on ICD diagnostic memory data interrogated at follow-up controls.
