      demonstrated great clinical potential in treating chronic and acute B cell leukemias. B cell
      lymphomas, similar to B cell leukemias, express CD19 surface molecules, and the majority of
      the B cell lymphoma patients cannot be cured by standard chemo-radiotherapy. CD19 CAR-based
      adoptive T cell therapy is associated with an unwanted adverse effect, the loss of CD19 B
      cells, which results in humoral immune deficiency. This study will evaluate a novel 4th
      generation CD19 CAR engineered with a self-withdrawal genetic mechanism (19273-4SCAR) for
      both efficacy and safety in lymphoma patients. The 4th generation design of the CAR
      incorporates the intracellular signaling domain of cluster of differentiation antigen 27
      (CD27), known to be associated with T cell activation, survival and longevity. The inducible
      caspase 9 self-withdrawal design allows for rapid elimination of the infused CAR T cells upon
      complete eradication of the tumor cells, which will be followed by the recovery of humoral
      immunity. Patients receiving the 19273-4SCAR T cells will be closely monitored for infusion
      response, tumor eradication effect, longevity of the CAR T cells, and the recovery of B cell
      functions after withdrawal of the CAR T cells.
