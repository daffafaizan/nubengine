      international guidelines in order to avoiding Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP). Despite
      being a simple and cheap measure, the literature describe a low compliance. Globally, every
      intensive care unit tends to use different maneuvers that help or improve compliance of this
      recommendation. However, there are multiple factors in daily work that hinder compliance.
      Before taking actions, it would be convenient to know the current state of the unit.

      Investigators aim to evaluate the quality with which the recommendation is carried out in the
      unit in order to maintain a semirecumbent position. To conduct the Trial it will be used a
      device that measures continuously (every 5 minutes) the angle of the bed without giving any
      information to caregivers. Once patients are extubated the data will be collected.
