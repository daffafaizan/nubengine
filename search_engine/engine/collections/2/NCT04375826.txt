      thoracic epidural analgesia (or epidural analgesia) was considered to be a key analgesic
      method because it not only effectively controls pain, but also lowers insulin resistance and
      helps restore bowel movement. However, epidural analgesia can cause a number of side effects
      despite of effective pain control. Epidural analgesia reduces peripheral vascular resistance
      by blocking sympathetic nerves with local anesthetics and may cause hypotension and
      decreasing heart rate. In addition, it can cause orthostatic hypotension, which can interfere
      with early ambulation after operation. In rare cases, there are potential complications of
      epidural abscess, meningitis, and epidural hematoma.

      Continuous peritoneal analgesia using local anesthetics has recently been used as an
      alternative analgesic to epidural analgesia in open abdomen surgery. This is easier to
      perform than epidural analgesia and is known to have fewer side effects. Recently, a
      non-inferiority comparison study have revealed that peritoneal analgesic was not inferior to
      epidural analgesia in terms of pain control. However, this study included a variety of
      operations other than PD, and most of the incisions were substernal, not midline. In
      addition, the method for mounting the epidural catheter was not described. The failure rate
      of the epidural catheter was reported to be 15%.

      The investigators will examine the effect of continuous peritoneal analgesic postoperative
      pain control in patients undergoing open PD to improve postoperative pain management and to
      create an our own ERAS program. To this end, The investigators will test non-inferiority
      between epidural analgesia and peritoneal analgesia.
