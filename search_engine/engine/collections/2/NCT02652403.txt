      Brazil and described in some clinical trials as a conventional technique for dentures
      fabrication. On simplified technical functional molding step is deleted, and thus the
      orientation planes are made directly on the resulting models of the initial molding alginate,
      and the mounting of the models is performed in semiadjustable articulators random with the
      aid of an auxiliary table 15 degrees with semiadjustable articulators fixed to the slope. To
      evaluate the impact on oral health quality of life of individuals will be used the Brazilian
      version of Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous patients (OHIP-Edent) for evaluation of
      patient satisfaction will use a specific questionnaire assessing the quality of the
      prostheses will be carried out through a specific exam, to assess the presence of TMD, all
      subjects will be evaluated through the RDC / TMD, for assessing the efficiency masticatory
      chewing capsules are used, the costs involved in the manufacture of prostheses will be
      calculated according to the material consumption used during the making of the prosthesis.
      All subjects will be assessed before making the prostheses and 90 days after installation of
      new dentures during this period will be held regular control visits. The data will be
      evaluated in order descriptive by numbers and proportions, moreover, it will be statistically
      evaluated by means of suitable tests.
