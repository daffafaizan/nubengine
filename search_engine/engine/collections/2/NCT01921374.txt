      alteration, whose consequence is the progression of muscle degeneration. The mother-caregiver
      dedicates herself entirely to her son, putting aside the care of their physical and
      psychological health. The responsibility and workload to care for the child is high. Because
      of this extreme amount of work associated with other factors such as stress, this
      mothers-caregivers are more likely to develop hypertension, respiratory disease,
      susceptibility to infections, depression, anxiety, insomnia, impaired immune and
      cardiovascular problems. Moreover, they are more likely to develop sleep disorders, those who
      may cause a high health risk, since many sleep disorders are related to cardiovascular,
      respiratory, neurological and immune systems.
