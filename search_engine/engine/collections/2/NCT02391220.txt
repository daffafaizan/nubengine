    
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common digestive disorders in the developed
      world which. It is associated to numerous symptoms, of which the most characteristic are
      recurrent pain or discomfort in the abdominal region, changes and difficulties related to
      bowel movements, and bloating. Although not dangerous, the disease may significantly impair
      the patients' quality of life. Treatment is symptomatic, but currently not very efficient.
      The use of probiotics in the treatment of IBS is a promising approach and has been the
      subject of much research in the last two decades.

      The purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled study is to assess changes in
      health-related quality of life in patients with constipation-predominant IBS after regular
      consumption of symbiotic fermented milk (containing probiotics and dietary fibres) and to
      assess its effects on some symptoms, like abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, and chronic
      constipation.
