      traumatic event. It involves symptoms such as poor sleep, nightmares about the trauma,
      unwanted daytime memories of the trauma (flashbacks), jumpiness, and trouble looking forward
      to things in the future. Once people develop PTSD, the symptoms tend to last a very long
      time.

      We are testing the idea that mifepristone, which blocks the effect of the hormones
      progesterone and cortisol, will help treat PTSD. Progesterone is a hormone made in the bodies
      of both men and women and its main role is in regulating the menstrual cycle and in
      pregnancy. Cortisol is also a hormone made in the body of both men and women and helps the
      body respond to stress. Cortisol also has a role in making emotional memories more intense
      than other memories. We are testing whether blocking the effect of cortisol with mifepristone
      as you recall your trauma may be able to decrease the intensity of your traumatic memories.
      This medication will not completely block out your memories of the traumatic experience but
      may decrease how much your thoughts are drawn back to the memory of the traumatic event.
