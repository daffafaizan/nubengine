      subjects who experienced sports-related concussion. The investigators aim to better describe
      the underlying oculomotor anomalies present in this cohort that lead to increased K-D test
      time. Understanding these anomalies will allow for better understanding of the effects of
      sports-related concussion and may provide a rapid and reliable metric for diagnosing
      concussion as well as monitoring long-term recovery.

      The main objectives include:

        1. Describing the oculometric deficits present in subjects with acute sports-related
           concussion.

        2. Analyzing and quantifying the oculometric changes that occur during subject recovery.

        3. Identifying possible oculometric features as potential biomarkers that may lead to
           reliable, rapid method for recognizing acute concussion.
