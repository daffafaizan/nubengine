      lateral lymph node before surgery. The main purpose is to recognize the track and variance of
      pelvic and iliac blood vessels. The investigators want to explore whether this method can
      help reduce operative time, unexpected injuries and blood loss, and The investigators also
      want to study whether it can help improve the lymph node harvested and positive rate during
      lateral lymph node dissection. Besides, The investigators want to perform node-by-node for
      enlarged lateral lymph node and CT three-dimensional reconstruction can help the
      investigators to localize and label the interested lymph node during operation. After
      node-by-node, The investigators can explore the accuracy of radiologists' and surgeons'
      judgement for lateral lymph node metastasis, and The investigators also want explore the best
      cut-off value of shorter diameter to predict lateral lymph node metastasis. Besides, The
      investigators want to perform texture analysis by combination radiology and pathology to find
      some useful parameters to predict lateral lymph node metastasis.

      The investigators also want to explore the feasibility of dissecting the unilateral visceral
      branch of internal iliac vessels when performing lateral lymph node dissection.

      The investigators will have a close follow-up for patients who have enlarged lateral lymph
      node but do not meet the criteria for lateral lymph node dissection. CT three-dimensional
      reconstruction can help The investigators recognize which parts' lateral lymph nodes have
      more potential possibility to metastasis and recurrence.
