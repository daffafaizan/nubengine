      I. To identify key adverse events developing in patients (cases) with a primary cancer
      diagnosed at age 21 or younger.

      II. To characterize the key adverse events with respect to the nature of the primary
      malignancy (pathology, stage) and coded details of the therapeutic protocol.

      III. To identify treatment-related and demographic risk factors through a direct comparison
      of the case-group and controls identified from the remaining patients with the same primary
      diagnosis.

      IV. To compare the frequency of mutations or polymorphisms in specific candidate genes in
      cases and controls, using constitutional deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) from the cases and controls.

      V. To explore the role and nature of gene-environment interaction in the development of key
      adverse events.

      OUTLINE:

      DNA and RNA from peripheral blood or buccal sample of patients is analyzed for the presence
      of polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with an increased risk of late-occurring
      complications.
