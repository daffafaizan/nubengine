        1. Establish a Family Resource Center (FRC) that builds on school-wide behavior management;

        2. Extend the intervention model to explicitly address the high school transition;

        3. Develop intervention components specifically focused on the cultural enhancement with a
           broader youth population, and test the efficacy of these interventions for reducing risk
           and enhancing positive adjustment for youth and their families;

        4. Evaluate the preventive impact of family engagement on individual differences in the
           growth of deviant peer involvement, antisocial behavior, and tobacco, alcohol, and
           marijuana use during the critical transition to high school; and

        5. Develop a training and fidelity model related to change.
