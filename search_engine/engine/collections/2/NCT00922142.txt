      disadvantages of three postoperative pain management methods identified by obstetrical
      patients.

      Participants will be introduced to study by anesthesia personnel in labor and delivery. The
      subject will be informed of the desire for their input on their perceived satisfaction with
      their chosen method for post-operative pain management and will be asked to participate in an
      anonymous survey by their second day after surgery. They will be informed that this is
      voluntary. Method of post-operative medication administration will be determined by attending
      physician to be either: epidural, IVPCA, or oral medication. Methods will be initiated in
      recovery room or the operative suite.

      Subjects will be identified on a postpartum admission log and a screening log will be created
      for study purposes.

      Informed Consents will be obtained. The screening log entries will be numbered corresponding
      to a numbered survey. The screening log will contain demographic and other patient
      identifiers including age, ethnicity, parity, presence of labor prior to cesarean, admission
      status of baby, cost associated with method and presence of rescue drugs and costs of rescue
      drugs and method services. Refusal information, exclusion criteria, and time/date of survey
      completion will also be recorded. This log will be maintained under lock and key.
