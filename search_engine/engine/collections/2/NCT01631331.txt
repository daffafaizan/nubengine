      I. The percent reduction in surgical defect area/size surrounding BCC tumor pre and
      post-vismodegib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Recurrence rate post treatment II. Safety, tolerability and percent drop-out after 3 vs. 6
      months of vismodegib in otherwise healthy patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 3 months if the initial BCC
      size is < 2 cm and superficial or for up to 6 months if the initial BCC size is >= 2 cm or
      non-superficial. After completion of vismodegib treatment, patients undergo Mohs surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for an average of 24 months.
