      directly via its effect on broad antiviral activities and indirectly via activation of innate
      and adaptive immune responses leading to HBeAg seroconversion and eventually HBsAg loss
      and/or seroconversion.

      This study proposes to compare the effect of 48 weeks exposure to pegylated interferon alpha
      vs. NA on HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg levels in NA controlled HBeAg-positive CHB patients
      who have an undetectable HBV viral load at least 1 years.
