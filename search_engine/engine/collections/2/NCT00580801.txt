    
      This is a Phase 2a, partially-blind, randomized (study drug assigned by chance) and
      multiple-dose study to evaluate the activity and safety of telaprevir on HCV early viral
      kinetics in treatment-naive participants who are chronically infected with HCV Genotype 4.
      The study consists of 4 parts: Screening period (6-week); Investigational Treatment period
      (consisting of 2-week treatment with telaprevir or telaprevir+standard treatment or placebo);
      Standard Treatment period (consists of 46 or 48-week standard treatment); and Follow-up
      period (24-week). The activity of telaprevir will be evaluated by early viral kinetic
      parameters along with viral response and pharmacokinetic assessments during the
      investigational treatment phase. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
