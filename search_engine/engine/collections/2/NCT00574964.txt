      to a dose of 61.2 Gy with concomitant daily temozolomide. Up to 8 wafers will be implanted
      into the tumor resection cavity (depending upon its size) after maximal tumor resection.
      Between days 10 and 30 all subjects will begin a standard course of post-operative limited
      field radiation therapy to the tumor site and a surrounding margin, with concomitant daily
      temozolomide (75mg/m2 x 7 d/wk for 6 weeks, concomitant chemoradiotherapy phase). Beginning
      no later than 45 days following completion of radiation, temozolomide will be given at a
      dosage of 200 mg/m2 daily for five days on a 28 day schedule, for a total of 6 cycles
      (adjuvant chemotherapy phase). Subjects will be monitored weekly during chemoradiotherapy
      with CBC with differential and brief clinical assessment, and monthly during the adjuvant
      chemotherapy phase. Toxicity reports will be assessed every three months. Dose limiting
      toxicities (DLT) are defined in section 4.2. If toxic events unresponsive to planned dose
      modification exceed 20% of enrolled subjects the stopping rule will be met and the study will
      be discontinued. MRIs will be obtained no more than 72 hours post-op, and then prior to the
      first, third, and fifth cycles of monthly temozolomide. Additionally, a stealth MRI or CT
      scan (with or without contrast) will be done one week prior to radiotherapy for treatment
      planning at the discretion of the treating Radiation Oncologist. Following completion of the
      entire course of treatment subjects will be monitored clinically as well as with MRI every 3
      months for survival and evidence of progression.
