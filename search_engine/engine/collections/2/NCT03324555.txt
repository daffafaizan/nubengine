    
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, single ascending dose study in healthy
      male subjects and healthy female subjects of non-child bearing potential.

      Subjects will receive a single administration of ORIC-101 oral suspension on a single
      occasion and will be followed in the clinic for at least 96 hours post-dose. Total subject
      participation will be approximately 5 weeks from screening until discharge from the study.

      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of oral
      ORIC-101 administered as a single dose in adult healthy subjects. The secondary objective of
      the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ORIC-101 and its metabolites M1 and M2. The
      exploratory objective of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamics of ORIC-101 by
      measurement of serum and urine levels of cortisol and other biological markers in healthy
      subjects
