      subjects with advanced solid tumors will be followed by an expansion phase in subjects with
      solid tumors having a NTRK fusion.

      The objectives of the study are to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, recommended
      dose and efficacy of orally administered larotrectinib in patients with NTRK fusions.
