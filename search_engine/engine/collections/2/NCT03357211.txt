      criteria (dental occlusion, lip position, breathing...). These surgeries are planned only
      after the end of the growing period and in association with orthodontics. It is necessary to
      wait the end of facial growth to expect a stable result especially concerning mandibular. The
      age limit seems to be around 15 to 16 years old for retromandibular deformities and around 18
      years old for premandibular deformities.

      These surgeries are planned using clinical, radiological and dental cast data. Occlusal
      splints are made using all these results; these occlusal splints are used during the
      orthognathic surgery to maintain bones in the planned position.

      Since 1993, a navigation system (Orthopilot™) is used, which allow to track jaw position, in
      real time, with an accuracy around one millimeter and one degree, during orthognathic
      surgery. This system is routinely used for condyle repositioning after mandibular sagittal
      split osteotomies; but it is also useful for maxillary navigation and positioning.

      The investigator propose to measure the accuracy of the operative results compared to the
      planned ones, using the Orthopilot™ system.
