    
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a minimally invasive treatment technique that allows
      for ultra-high doses of radiation to be delivered to small areas with precision not
      previously possible using older equipment. The CyberKnifeÂ® Robotic Radiosurgery System
      (Accuray, Sunnyvale California, USA) is a radiation unit specifically designed to focus beams
      of radiation accurately anywhere in the body. It is able to track, detect and correct for any
      tumor movement during treatment by using a sophisticated image guidance system.
