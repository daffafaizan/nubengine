      excitability of ipsilateral as well as contralateral motor cortical neurons controlling
      homologous and surrounding muscles. Transcallosal and surrounding inhibitions are well known
      phenomenon to suppress unwanted movements during voluntary action, which is often disturbed
      in various movement disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to
      investigate these inhibitory mechanisms, but the inhibitory influence during and after
      voluntary movement has not been well elucidated yet. In normal volunteers, we plan to
      determine if voluntary movements of one finger influence the cortical excitability
      responsible for surrounding as well as contralateral homologous muscles, using voluntary
      movement-triggered TMS. The primary outcome measures would be any changes in motor evoked
      potential (MEP) size and intracortical inhibition (ICI) parameters.
