      combination, rather than singly because one drug may cause changes in the tumor that will
      make the other drug more effective. The drugs docetaxel and capecitabine may work in synergy,
      based on laboratory studies in tumors. These laboratory studies show that docetaxel increases
      the levels of a critical enzyme, called thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which is necessary to
      activate the capecitabine. This study will use this promising chemotherapy combination in
      patients with breast cancer. Before, during, and after chemotherapy, the participants' breast
      tumors will be examined to see if TP increases, as predicted by the laboratory studies. The
      study will also look at other factors in tumors and blood that may be able to predict how
      effective the chemotherapy will be for each individual, so that in the future we may better
      select the best chemotherapy for an individual's cancer.
