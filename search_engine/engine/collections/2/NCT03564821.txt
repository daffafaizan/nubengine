      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ivosidenib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      Ivosidenib is an inhibitor of the protein IDH1. Ivosidenib is currently being studied as a
      treatment for myeloid cancers like acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes with
      an IDH1 mutation. This study is examining whether or not ivosidenib is beneficial and
      well-tolerated as an agent to prevent the relapse of IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia or
      other myeloid neoplasms after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. IDH1 is an enzyme
      that, when mutated, can overproduce metabolites (substances that help with metabolism) and
      compounds that contribute to the growth of tumors and cancerous cells. Ivosidenib may help
      block the over production of these substances and possibly reduce the chances of relapse.
