    
      The purpose of this double-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial is to
      investigate the effects of high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)
      on an experimental prolonged pain model in healthy subjects. Forty healthy participants are
      administered the compound Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in the right first dorsal interosseous
      muscle (FDI), which produced prolonged muscle soreness and hyperalgesia.

      The forty participants are randomly allocated to either the control group receiving a
      Sham-tDCS paradigm, or the intervention group receiving three consecutive days of multimodal
      HD-tDCS targeting primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      simultaneously.

      The somatosensory profile is assessed at baseline, before administration of NGF as well as
      prior and post each HD-tDCS session using standardised quantitative sensory testing.

      It is hypothesised that the active HD-tDCS will modulate the neurological changes induced by
      the experimental pain condition, which will alleviate the hyperalgesia and hypersensitivity.
