    
      -  There were several randomized clinical trials confirmed that concurrent
           chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is superior to radiotherapy (RT)alone for locally advanced NPC,
           most of the patients in the trials were treated with conventional radiotherapy
           technique.

        -  As the new technique of IMRT used more and more in the clinical practice, the role of
           concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) seems blurred, in two of Hongkong phaseIII
           studies(NPC9901/9902), half of the patients were treated by 3-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy (3DCRT)/IMRT,the results showed that there were no significant different in
           terms of overall survival between RT alone and CCRT groups. Furthermore, several large
           sample size retrospective studies from China, showed that there were no advantage of
           CCRT over RT alone when treated by SIB-IMRT.

        -  In an analysis of who will benefit from CCRT,( Lin, et.al, IJROBP,2004; 60:156-164), the
           author divided the locally advanced NPC patients into two groups, with the high-risk
           group defined as patients met at least one of following criteria: nodal size >6 cm, (2)
           supraclavicular node metastasesN3, T4N2 and multiple neck node metastases with 1 node
           >4cm.

        -  Based on these information, we hypothesize that, for low-risk locally advanced NPC
           patients, there may no need CCRT under SIB-IMRT treatment.
