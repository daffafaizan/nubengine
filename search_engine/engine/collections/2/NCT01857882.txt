      patients to provide surgical restoration of the breast mounds. The breast reconstruction
      discussions can be highly complex, as there are many different techniques, timing, and
      complications that are unique to each procedure. However Â¼ of women report being dissatisfied
      with some component of their cancer or reconstructive care. Failure of the physician to
      provide adequate information about treatment options is the most frequent source of cancer
      patient dissatisfaction and breast reconstruction patients have expressed a need for further
      information regarding the complex decision to pursue breast reconstruction. In such scenarios
      of complex medical decision-making, decision support techniques may be an effective solution
      to information provision and shared decision-making. As a result, the investigators developed
      a pre-consultation educational group intervention delivered in a group setting for women
      considering breast reconstruction, with the aims to fill an existing information-gap, promote
      high-quality decision-making and enhance decision self-efficacy and other decision measures.
      This pilot study will be the first step in the evaluation of the educational group
      intervention and the results will be used to determine the feasibility and inform the optimal
      design for a definitive randomized controlled trial. This study will first examine the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention through implementation in a pilot,
      mixed-methods, 1:1 allocation parallel-arm randomized controlled trial.
