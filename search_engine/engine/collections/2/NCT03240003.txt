      acceptability, efficacy, and mechanism of a recently developed eye-tracking-based therapy
      (GC-MRT) in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). The purpose of this study is to
      assess whether a brief computer-based research treatment, provided in 30 minutes sessions
      twice a week for 4 weeks, helps improve social anxiety symptoms, and by what mechanism. The
      study will also assess the effect of research treatments on brain activity using a scan
      called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
