      a ratio of 1:1:1 (Control Group, Intervention Group 1, Intervention Group 2). Randomisation
      reduces selection bias and controls for unknown variables that may affect the outcome.
      Treatment allocation will occur through the use of sealed, opaque envelopes and will be
      implemented by the Graves Move More reception team as the patient attends the clinic. The
      reception staff will hand an opaque envelope to the subject for them to open. Randomisation
      undertaken by an independent third party improves internal validity. Patients will be treated
      according to the group they have been randomised to.

      Data Collection, Analysis & Statistical Opinion Prior to undertaking the study, baseline
      socio-demographic data will be recorded (E.g. age, sex, weight, height, occupation and
      duration of symptoms). Pre and posttest outcome data will also be recorded for the
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI).
      Long-term data (I.e. 6-12 months post-treatment) will not be recorded as treatment effect is
      not being analysed as part of the pilot study.
