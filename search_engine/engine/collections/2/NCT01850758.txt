    
      Prospective, randomized, controlled to include 25 subjects treated with Regenexx SD and 25
      subjects treated with exercise therapy alone with the exercise group crossing over to the
      injection group at 3 months.

      Subjects will have a partial or complete, non-retracted ACL ligament tear as evidenced with
      MRI.

      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to Regenexx-SD injection or initiation of
      exercise therapy and take part in follow-up visits for two years following treatment. A
      preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the
      clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post injection.

      The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted once all subjects reach the 3 month endpoint.
      Subjects will continue to be followed through the 2 year endpoint with data analysis
      performed at the 1 year and 2 year time points.
