      messaging system, named "Annie". The investigators aimed to describe early experiences using
      Annie and subsequently pilot and evaluate an augmented implementation strategy to improve
      implementation of the system. Then, seven new facilities implemented Annie. The investigators
      focused on specialty clinics serving patients with hepatitis-C virus (HCV). Working in
      collaboration with clinical team members and other Office of Connected Care stakeholders, the
      investigators developed a texting protocol for Veterans with HCV that included motivational
      messages, medication and lab appointment reminders. This protocol was made available to the
      seven new facilities. Four facilities were randomized to serve as intervention sites to
      receive augmented implementation strategy. These facilities had regular facilitation calls, a
      site visit to assist with implementation, and were given the toolkit, in addition to
      receiving usual implementation assistance, described below. An additional three comparison
      sites received usual implementation of Annie only, which involves an orientation/training
      meeting and the option of attending twice-monthly Annie clinical adoption calls run by the
      Office of Connected Care. Two control sites did not receive Annie. The investigators
      conducted a mixed-methods evaluation including pre and post patient and provider surveys and
      semi-structured interviews, medical chart abstraction, and process measure analysis. The
      investigators collected data on patient and clinician experiences with the Annie system,
      including usability, clinical workflow fit, and clinical benefits such as improved HCV
      medication adherence and rates of appropriately timed lab tests.
