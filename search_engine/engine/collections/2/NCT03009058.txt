      provide informed consent, will participate in a Screening period of up to 28 days to
      establish eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will enter the Treatment Phase
      of the study.

      In the Treatment Phase all patients will receive IMM-101 for 28 weeks.

      At Week 32, if the Investigator considers it in the patients' best interest patients will
      progress to the Maintenance Phase of the study and will continue to be dosed every 4 weeks
      (or as close to this interval as permitted due to practical or logistical considerations).
      Patients will be followed up for assessment of safety, response to treatment, survival, and
      immunological markers for up to 4.5 years.
