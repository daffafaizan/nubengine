    
      A composite 'axial score' including the major clinical and anamnestic items on gait, posture
      and balance function from UPDRSII (items 13-15) and UPDRS III (items 27-31) constitutes the
      primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include specified clinical and anamnestic
      assessments on freezing of gait, balance, quality of life, non-motor symptoms, impulsivity,
      impulse control and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The aim of the present trial is to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of combined stimulation on subthalamic and nigral electrode contacts
      [STN+SNr] in refractory hypokinetic gait disturbances compared with [STNmono] (active
      comparator). The results will clarify, whether the combined [STN+SNr] stimulation improves
      otherwise refractory gait disturbances in PD.
