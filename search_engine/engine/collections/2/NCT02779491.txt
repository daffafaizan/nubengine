      portions of different FV per day for health reasons. Recent research suggests that the
      details of the message are poorly understood by the population as a whole, by low consumers
      of FV and by those in demographic groups of traditional low FV consumption, and that this
      poor knowledge impacts on implementation of the message to result in low FV intakes. To aid
      implementation of the recommendations, investigators have developed a 5-a-day FV mobile phone
      application (app) prototype. The basic prototype app will provide information on the 5-a-day
      message, allow users to input consumption, and provides consumers with accurate knowledge of
      their adherence to the recommendations. This study will investigate the use and impact of the
      prototype app on FV intakes over a two or four week period. For significant impacts on
      health, sustained user engagement and use will be required. Up to 100 participants will be
      randomised to either receive or not receive the app, and will be asked to use the app for the
      following two or four weeks. FV intake will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks.
      Measures of app use will also be taken at these time points. Measures of FV knowledge will
      also be measured at these time points. Measures of FV attitudes were initially planned but
      not undertaken to reduce demand characteristics for participants. The investigators
      anticipate that changes in intakes will be mediated by changes in knowledge and attitudes.
