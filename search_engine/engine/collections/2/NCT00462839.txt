      simulate whole blood with a hematocrit of 33%. A total of eight isolated study stations will
      be set up (study participants will only be able to visualize the vaginal delivery drape for
      one station at a time). The simulated blood will be mixed with urine and sponges and be
      placed in suspended blood collection drapes which are used during vaginal deliveries at
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Two types of drapes will be used: drapes without calibrated
      markings and drapes with calibrated markings. Calibrated volume markings will begin at 500 mL
      at 500 mL intervals to 2500 mL.

      Study participants will be randomized to one of two groups. Randomization will occur in
      blocks depending on provider type. Group 1 will view the unmarked vaginal collection drapes
      first and Group 2 will view the collection drapes with the calibrated markings first. Both
      groups will analyze the initial four study stations in random order. At the completion of the
      four study stations, the group which evaluated the drapes without markings will cross over to
      view the stations with calibrated markings and the group that views uncalibrated drapes will
      then view the calibrated drapes.

      Each study participant will view a station and write his/her estimation of blood loss on a
      data card. Study participants will NOT be allowed to change answers once they have been
      recorded.

      Demographic data on study participants will include provider type, level of training/years of
      practice, and gender.
