      a safety evaluation and preliminary assessment of the efficacy of hematopoietic gene therapy
      consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched cells transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying
      the ITGB2 gene in subjects with severe Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (LAD-I). Subjects will
      undergo mobilization and collection of peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor or bone marrow harvest in select
      circumstances.

      HSCs will then be transduced with the therapeutic vector (Chim.hCD18-LV), with the intent of
      enabling stable integration of the provirus in the genome of stem and progenitor cells.

      If the number of CD34+ cells that are cryopreserved is at least 4Ã—10E6 total CD34+ cells/kg,
      subjects will receive myeloablative conditioning with intravenous busulfan. The gene-modified
      CD34+ cells will be then transplanted back into the subject.

      Once engrafted, it is anticipated that the gene-modified stem and progenitor cells will
      enable hematopoiesis, generating blood cells in which the integrated therapeutic gene (ITGB2)
      will be transcribed and translated to produce the therapeutic CD18 protein with a
      preferential high expression in mature myeloid cells. Leukocytes expressing a functional CD18
      will have the capability to arrest on endothelial surfaces and extravasate to infectious
      sites, enabling a competent antimicrobial response and reversing the clinical disorder.
