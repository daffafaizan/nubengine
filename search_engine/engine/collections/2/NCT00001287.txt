      neuropathy characterized by subacute onset of muscle weakness, distal sensory deficit,
      elevated spinal fluid protein, and slow nerve conduction velocity with or without conduction
      block. A monoclonal gammopathy is at times present in the serum of some patients. Because
      immune-mediated mechanisms against peripheral nerve myelin are thought to be primarily
      responsible for the clinical manifestations of CIDP, the treatment of choice is with
      corticosteroids, plasmapheresis or immunosuppressive drugs. Although many patients initially
      respond to these agents, a large number of them become resistant or develop unacceptable side
      effects that necessitate their discontinuation. The need for a more effective and safe
      immunotherapy in CIDP patients prompted the present study using high-dose intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIg). IVIg is an immunomodulating agent which has been recently shown to be
      effective and safe in the treatment of a number of patients with immune-related neuromuscular
      diseases.

      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, trial involving 60 patients, half of
      which will receive IVIg and the other half placebo (D5/W). Because IVIg is prohibitively
      expensive, a controlled trial is needed to provide convincing evidence of efficacy, and
      ensure that the benefit is not due to spontaneous improvement or to observer bias. The dose
      of IVIg is 2 GM/Kg divided into two daily doses administered monthly for six months. The drug
      will be considered effective if patients experience an increase of more than 25% in their
      baseline muscle strength. Muscle strength will be assessed with a series of objective
      dynamometric measurements performed before and after each monthly infusion.
