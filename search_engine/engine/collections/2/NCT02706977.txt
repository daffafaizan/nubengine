      handheld system, RETeval, and evaluate contrast sensitivity testing in detecting pre-clinical
      retinopathy on a tablet device.

      Investigators also seek to assess if a medication called Sinemet™ CR can improve the
      electrical functions of the eye in participants with diabetes mellitus. This study will
      include a total of 45 participants; 30 with diabetes mellitus and 15 age-matched non-diabetic
      controls. Participants with diabetes mellitus and electroretinogram (ERG) delays will be
      randomized to a low or high dose Sinemet™ CT group.

      Age-matched controls will not receive Sinemet Ct drug treatment.

      The study involves four visits over the course of 4 weeks, each visit consisting of 2-3
      hours. Visual testing will be performed at 1 day and 2 weeks following treatment. The drug
      treatment will be halted and testing repeated again after a 2 week wash-out period.
