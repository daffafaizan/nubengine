    
      Specific Aim 1: To identify associations between neural, psychological, and hormonal appetite
      control pathways using subjective and objective measures of appetite and neurocognitive
      assessments of reward pre-intervention.

      Hypothesis 1: There will be significant cross-modulation of appetite across neural (brain
      activation), psychological (subjective hunger), and hormonal pathways (satiety biomarkers),
      though the temporal relationship between each in response to feeding is unknown.

      Specific Aim 2: To assess the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention on eating
      behavior in adolescents; OW/OB inactive adolescents will be randomly assigned to a 3-month
      exercise intervention (Exercise +Newsletter), or a control condition (Newsletter).

      Hypothesis 2a: Those exposed to the exercise intervention will have greater improvements
      (compared to control group) in appetite (subjective self-reported hunger and palatability
      responses, and, objectively, satiety and appetite hormones glucose, insulin, ghrelin, and
      leptin, and calories consumed during ad libitum meal).

      Hypothesis 2B. Compared to pre-intervention, OB/OW youth in the exercise group will show
      decreased reward activation in regions of the brain when making decisions about appetizing
      foods compared to post-intervention when hungry and when fed. In self-control regions,
      compared to pre-intervention, the investigators will observe increased activity in both
      hungry and fed conditions.

      At the end of the proposed study, it is the expectation that the investigators will have
      collected important preliminary data regarding how long-term structured exercise acts upon
      appetite and neural mechanisms related to food reward in adolescents. Findings are key not
      only to interventions targeting OW/OB youth, but also to public policy and health
      recommendations for the importance of physical activity in children.
