        -  Compare the incidence and severity of oral mucositis in children undergoing
           NASA-developed light-emitting diode (LED) therapy during a pre-transplantation
           myeloablative conditioning regimen (chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy) and
           continuing through the post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) phase versus LED therapy
           during the post-BMT phase only.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center and cheek being treated (right vs left). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 schedules of light-emitting diode (LED) therapy.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo LED therapy for 71 seconds once daily beginning on day 1 of the
           myeloablative conditioning regimen comprising chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy
           and continuing for 14 days after bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo LED therapy as in arm I beginning on the day of BMT (day 0) and
           continuing for 14 days after BMT.

      Photographs are taken of the right and left buccal mucosa at baseline and then every 3 days
      beginning on day 1 of LED therapy.

      Pain and xerostomia are assessed using the Wong-Baker "smiley-face" pain scale at baseline
      and then periodically for 14 days after BMT.

      Patients are followed monthly for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      2 years.
