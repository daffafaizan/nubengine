      dramatically the prognosis of CML, with high rates of cytogenetic and molecular remission and
      increase of overall and progression-free survival. However, the long-term treatment of CML
      has a high cost to the health system, due to the price of these drugs and the need for
      continued use. In addition, chronic adverse effects may compromise the quality of life of
      patients. Discontinuation trials of TKIs have been developed in order to identify groups of
      patients who may benefit from treatment discontinuation if they have obtained deeper
      molecular responses.The primary objective of this study is to evaluate treatment free
      remission (TFR) after imatinib discontinuation in patients treated for more than 3 years with
      imatinib and with deep molecular response stable for two years (defined in the present study
      as a molecular response of 4.5 log reduction in breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-Abelson
      murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1(ABL) transcripts levels according to the
      international scale (MR 4.5; BCR-ABL/ABL ratio < or = 0.0032%). Patients with these criteria
      will receive pioglitazone for 3 months concomitant with imatinib, prior to discontinuation.
      After imatinib discontinuation, patients will be evaluated by molecular assessment of BCR-ABL
      transcripts levels by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) monthly
      during the first year, every 2 months in the second year and then every 3 months. The
      criteria for restarting treatment will be the loss of major molecular response (MMR),
      documented by a single RQ-PCR test > 0.1%, or confirmed loss of 4 log reduction molecular
      response (MR4.0), by 2 consecutive RQ-PCR tests > 0.01%.
