      diseases, overweight and premature deaths. Despite the evidence that physical activity is
      beneficial to health,it is often ignored and underused aspect in diabetes care. The aim of
      the study is to investigate the effects of two levels of primary care physical activity
      interventions on metabolic control and cardiovascular risk factors, compared to usual care in
      patients with pre- and type 2 diabetes.
