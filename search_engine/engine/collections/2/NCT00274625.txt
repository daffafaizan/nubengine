      of Surgisis Gold Graft for tissue reinforcement, as compared to suture closure alone in
      evaluating incidence of incisional hernias. Prior to undergoing open bariatric surgery,
      patients will be randomized to receive either Surgisis Gold Graft or suture closure alone.
      Subjects will be seen for follow-up visits at six weeks, three months, six months, one year
      and two years post-operatively. Patients may see their primary care physician for the one and
      two follow-up visits.
