      explain the association of obesity with asthma morbidity, and develop and pilot test
      educational and counseling modules, based on self-regulation theory, that take an integrated
      approach to asthma and obesity self-management support.

      The Specific Aims are to:

        1. Compare the longitudinal relationship between L-arginine/ADMA balance and morbidity
           (lung function, asthma control, acute resource utilization, and quality of life) between
           obese adults with late onset asthma vs. (a) obese adults with early onset asthma and
           non-obese asthmatics with early (b) or late (c) onset disease. Age of asthma onset is as
           categorized as early when developed â‰¤12 years of age or late when developed >12 years of
           age.

        2. Evaluate the interrelationship between obesity- and asthma-related illness beliefs, and
           the impact of cognitive function, on patients' management of these conditions over time
