      compounded by breathing instability due to an immature respiratory control function.

      Premature infants present with significant oxygenation instability in the form of frequent
      spontaneous episodes of hypoxemia during the first weeks after birth. As a result, these
      infants receive oxygen supplementation but this is often excessive and these infants are also
      exposed to hyperoxemia. The extent to which these episodes of hypoxemia or the exposure to
      hyperoxemia impact on the maturation and function of the control of breathing system in
      extreme premature infants during the evolving stages of their respiratory disease is unknown.
      This is a prospective study that will systematically evaluate such association in extreme
      premature infants.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the extent to which exposure to frequent
      episodes of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia in extreme premature infants during the early stages of
      their evolving lung disease is associated with altered maturation and function of their
      respiratory control system.

      This study is part of the Prematurity-Related Ventilatory Control (Pre-Vent): Role in
      Respiratory Outcomes Clinical Research Centers (CRC) (U01) cooperative program of the
      National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
