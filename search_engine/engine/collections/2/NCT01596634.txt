      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin (bovine lactoferrin) supplementation on self-reported
      taste and smell disturbances in patients with colorectal cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the baseline lipid peroxidation
      byproducts in saliva in these patients as measured by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive
      substances (TBARs) assay.

      II. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the ability of these patients to
      generate increased lipid peroxidation byproducts when challenged with a weak iron containing
      solution.

      III. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on self-reported general quality of
      life and on specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issues in patients with established
      chemotherapy-induced taste disturbances.

      IV. To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with oxaliplatin-based
      therapy induced taste changes

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bovine lactoferrin orally (PO) (rinse or tablet) thrice daily (TID) for 1
      month. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 4 weeks.
