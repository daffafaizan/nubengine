      immunosuppressive medications.

      The purpose of this protocol is to collect additional follow-up for safety and efficacy from
      CIT subjects with graft function after their completion in their CIT parent study. It is
      expected that most subjects will retain measurable islet function and, in the islet-alone
      studies, continue to receive immunosuppressive medications at the time of completing their
      CIT parent study.

      *CIT parent studies: CIT02 (NCT00464555), CIT03 (NCT00434850), CIT04 (NCT00468403), CIT05
      (NCT00468442), CIT06 (NCT00468117), and CIT07 (NCT00434811)
