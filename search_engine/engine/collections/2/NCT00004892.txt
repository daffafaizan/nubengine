      in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. II. Evaluate the safety and tolerance of
      increasing duration for up to 2 weeks of continuously infused O6-benzylguanine at a dose that
      will completely suppress tumor AGT activity combined with intracranially implanted
      polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implants (Gliadel wafers) in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG). Patients in the first
      cohort receive O6-BG IV over 1 hour followed by continuous infusion of O6-BG for 2 days prior
      to surgery. Patients undergo surgical resection and receive up to 8 polifeprosan 20 with
      carmustine implants (Gliadel wafers) in the resected tumor cavity. Cohorts of 14 patients
      receive escalating doses of O6-BG until 11 out of 14 patients in a cohort have complete
      suppression of AGT levels. Once the dose of O6-BG that completely suppresses AGT has been
      established, subsequent patients receive O6-BG IV beginning at least 1 hour prior to surgery
      followed by the established continuous infusion dose beginning on the day of surgery. The
      infusion continues for up to 14 days postoperatively. Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive
      lengthened durations of continuous infusion O6-BG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined or the length of the infusion reaches 14 days. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 3 of 6 or 5 of 12 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.
      Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 38 patients will be accrued for this study over 9.5 months.
