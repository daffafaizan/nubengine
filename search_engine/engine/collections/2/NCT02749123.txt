      back pain and arthritis, subjects had to qualify by meeting various inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Subjects signed an informed consent and were randomized in a double blinded fashion
      to one of the three arms. After randomization subjects completed a baseline questionnaire
      regarding how pain affects their lives. Then they began therapy with their blinded product.
      This same questionnaire was administered after the second day of therapy and after the final
      day on day 10. Responses at the day two and ten endpoints were compared to baseline to access
      the response of each arm.
