      environments affect Arkansas children's health. Children from Central Arkansas ages 7-10
      years will be recruited to participate in a variety of physical activity tests including
      strength, flexibility, balance and endurance. During these tests, participants will perform
      tasks such as cycling on a stationary bike and extending and flexing their knees on a special
      type of chair. Body composition will be measured and blood, saliva, urine and stool samples
      collected. Participants and parents will be asked to complete questionnaires on physical
      activity, home and neighborhood environment as well as sleeping habits. Finally, participants
      will wear an accelerometer based monitor that will track their physical activity and sleeping
      patterns. One in person visit will take place at Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center (Little
      Rock, AR) and will last up to 8 hours. Reimbursement will be provided.
