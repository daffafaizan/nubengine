      Title Survey about oral anticoagulant peri-procedural management in patients undergoing an
      oral surgery, implantology or periodontology

      Acronym PRADICO

      Investigator Coordinator Isabelle MAHE

      Number of investigational sites 100

      Number of patients 2000

      Population Patients receiving oral anticoagulant undergoing an oral surgery, implantology or
      periodontology

      Research calendar Duration of inclusions: 1 year Duration of follow up: 30 days Study
      duration: 13 months

      Selection criteria

      Inclusion criteria :

      Patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant (defined as duration of treatment of at least
      1 month) and referred for an invasive procedure (oral surgery, implantology or
      periodontology) to an oral surgeon member of the SFCO (Société Française de Chirurgie Orale)
      or a periodontologist member of the SFPIO (Société Française de Parodontologie et
      d'Implantologie Orale) taking part to the study.

      Each investigator will include 10 patients treated with long-term DOAC, and 10 consecutive
      patients treated with long-term VKA. For the DOAC group, inclusion will be continued until
      the inclusion of 333 patients for each molecule (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban).

      Non-inclusion criteria :

      Patients receiving both VKA and antiplatelet agents Patients receiving both direct oral
      anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents

      Objectives

      Primary aim:

      To assess the composite rate of thromboembolic and bleeding events occurring within the
      peri-procedural period, in patients on long-term DOAC and VKA and undergoing an oral surgery,
      implantology or periodontology.

      Secondary aims :

        -  To identify risk factors for bleeding during the peri-procedural period

        -  To identify risk factors for thromboembolic events during the peri-procedural period

        -  To describe the peri-procedural management of each treatment (VKA or DOAC)

        -  To identify prescribers involved in the possible change of anticoagulant prescription
           prior the oral surgery

        -  To compare the risk of bleeding on DOAC and on VKA

        -  To compare the risk of thromboembolic complications on DOAC and on VKA

        -  To evaluate the net clinical benefit of DOAC compared to VKA treatment

      Endpoints

      Primary endpoint :

      A composite outcome: the occurrence rate of hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events during
      the peri-procedural period.

      Secondary endpoints :

        -  Incidence of bleeding events

        -  incidence of thromboembolic events

        -  net clinical benefit of DOAC compared to VKA

      Methodology Prospective observational non interventional multicentric cohort study in adult
      population under long-term anticoagulant treatment (DOAC or VKA) and undergoing an oral,
      periodontal or implant surgery, by liberal practitioners or oral specialists at hospital.

      Statistical analysis The occurrence rate of hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events during
      peri-procedural period will be calculated globally and in each group (VKA or DOAC) as a
      percentage with 95% CI.
