      Disorders - PDDs), repetitive behaviors are common and frequently interfere with functioning
      in the home as well as in social and educational settings. These behaviors may involve
      repetitive movements, rigid routines, repetitive play, and even repetitive speech. These
      behaviors may be associated with high levels of anxiety, severe tantrums. Self-injury can
      occur when these behaviors and routines are interrupted.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive citalopram or placebo (administered as
      liquid), and carefully followed every two weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, children who have
      responded to treatment will be given the opportunity to continue in the study, with monthly
      visits, for an additional 24 weeks. Children who received placebo and did not respond to
      treatment at 12 weeks will be given the opportunity to receive a carefully monitored 12 week
      course of citalopram.
