    
      Subjects with mild to moderate papulopustular rosacea (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]
      grade 2-3), a Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) score of 2-3 and 6-30 inflammatory
      lesions (papules and pustules) were randomized to treatment with DFD-04 ointment or Vehicle
      ointment in a ratio of 2:1.

      During the 12-week treatment period subjects used the IMP twice daily with approximately 12
      hours between applications. Subjects were instructed to treat affected skin in a defined
      treatment area on the face.

      The investigator assessed efficacy by using an IGA 5-point scale and CEA 4-point scale and by
      counting the number of inflammatory lesions on the face at Baseline (Day 1) and Weeks 4, 8
      and 12 (End of Treatment [EoT], defined as complete clearance of inflammatory lesions or Week
      12, whichever was earlier). Furthermore, a non-invasive biomarker assessment was done by
      using a Transdermal Analysis Patch (TAP) at Baseline (Day 1) and Weeks 4 and 12.

      Safety assessments included investigator's assessment of application site reactions at
      Baseline (Day 1) and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 for all treated areas.

      Other safety assessments included vital signs (blood pressure [BP] and pulse rate) and urine
      pregnancy tests (UPTs) (only for females), clinical laboratory parameters (serum and urine),
      extent of exposure, and Adverse Events.

      In addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed to evaluate the systemic exposures
      of itraconazole and its active metabolite, hydroxyl-itraconazole, with blood samples drawn
      from the first 12 subjects at various pre-specified timepoints.
