      Type 2 diabetes. Fasting hyperglucagonemia induces hepatic glucose release resulting in
      elevated fasting levels of plasma glucose. Furthermore, lack of postprandial suppression of
      glucagon secretion - exchanged for a paradoxical postprandial hypersecretion of glucagon -
      results in increased levels of postprandial plasma glucose. Additionally, type 2 diabetes is
      characterized by decreased postprandial responses of the insulinotropic (and glucagonostatic)
      peptide hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Recent studies from our group suggest that
      the intestines are involved in the diminshed suppression of glucagon following ingestion of
      nutrients. Thus, suppression of glucagon during oral glucose ingestion diminishes and
      reverses to stimulation while suppression during intravenous administered glucose sustains
      along with development of glucose intolerance. In the small intestines mucosal endocrine
      L-cells secrete GLP-1, which is processed from its precursor, proglucagon, by prohormone
      convertase 1 (PC1). In the pancreatic alpha-cells proglucagon is processed to glucagon via
      prohormone convertase 2 (PC2). We plan to examine biopsies from the mucosa of the small
      intestines from patients with type 2 diabetes and from healthy subjects for glucagon
      production. Furthermore, the volunteers will be subjected to a standard meal test in order to
      correlate the gene expression studies with the level of postprandial hyperglucagonemia of the
      subjects.
