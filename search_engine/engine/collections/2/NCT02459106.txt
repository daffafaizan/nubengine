        1. To establish and optimize the methodology for measuring adipose tissue miRNA release.

        2. To establish and optimize the methodology for measuring the effect of adipose
           tissue-released miRNA on skeletal muscle biology and insulin sensitivity.

        3. To profile adipose tissue-released miRNA in lean insulin-sensitive and obese
           insulin-resistant healthy individuals.

        4. To examine the effects of adipose tissue-released miRNA from lean insulin-sensitive
           individuals and obese insulin-resistant individuals on skeletal muscle biology and
           insulin sensitivity.
