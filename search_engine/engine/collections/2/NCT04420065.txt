      AdaptivCRTÂ® algorithm and in conjunction with automated V-V delay adjustments, will lead to
      improvements over standard biventricular pacing (BVP) in the function of all cardiac
      chambers, reduce arrhythmic burden, improve ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC), and patient
      functional status. It would be interesting to study what changes in right-side VAC (RVAC) can
      be appreciated with the activation of the preferential LV pacing algorithm and how they
      relate to each other, i.e. whether LV is driven towards maximizing output whilst RV shifts to
      optimizing energy efficiency.

      READAPT is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial of heart failure patients eligible
      for CRT according to current European heart failure guidelines. Informed written consent is
      required from all study participants.

      Adult (aged 18-80 years old), consenting patients with any cardiomyopathy type, diagnosed at
      least 6 months prior (to exclude recent myocarditis cases that may remit and confound
      outcomes), on optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months, and an existing I/IIa indication
      for a cardiac resynchronization therapy - defibrillator (CRT-D) device will be enrolled and
      randomized into 2 groups, one receiving standard CRT (Group 1 - G1), and one with activation
      of the preferential LV pacing algorithm (Group 2 - G2). Enrollment date will amount to the
      baseline assessment date, with device implantation occurring preferably within 48 hours.
      READAPT will include patients with both new CRT-D implantation and an upgrade from an
      existing defibrillator or pacemaker with no prior left ventricular lead placement.
