        1. Assessment of cognitive function, quality of life, and/or personality using cognitive
           tests and questionnaires.

        2. Measures of frailty and disability selected to capture the multi-dimensional aspects of
           frailty including functional status and physiologic reserve:

           Fried Frailty Score: weakness (test of grip strength), exhaustion (patient interview),
           slowness (gait speed), low activity (patient interview) Short Physical Performance
           Battery: repeated chair stands, balance testing with feet together, 13-foot walk

        3. Laboratory tests will all be obtained from the medical record: creatinine, total
           bilirubin, INR, sodium, albumin. All of these tests are necessary for listing for liver
           transplantation.

        4. Blood draw, urine and stool samples will be collected for a sub-group of 1000 patients.

        5. Adipose, muscle, liver tissue, and blood will be collected during the liver transplant
           surgery for a sub-group of 1000 patients.
