    
      Up to 500 subjects undergoing standard endoscopy / pouchoscopy, or having ileostomy or
      colostomy bags or having an ileal pouch and who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled to this study during up to three years at up to 4 clinical sites. GI fluids samples
      will be collected from: (i) fluids suctioned during standard endoscopy procedures /
      pouchoscopy, (ii) from ileostomy/colostomy bags removed for bag replacement and (iii) from
      stool samples collected by patients after pouchsurgery.

      The samples will be collected into sealed plastic containers, clearly labeled with
      "Biohazard" stickers and patient's code and be kept on ice for up to 30min and then freezed
      in -20deg to -80deg.

      Characterization and quanification of small molecules- and protein biomarkers of GI diseases
      such as IBD will be performed.
