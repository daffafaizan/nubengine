    
      Name of Drugs: Niaspan (niacin extended-release tablets), Lipitor® (atorvastatin), Zocor®
      (simvastatin), Zetia™ (ezetimibe), and Crestor® (rosuvastatin)

      Study Treatment: Four open-label parallel treatment groups for 12 weeks of observation

        -  Niaspan and atorvastatin combination treatment titrated to 2000 mg and 40 mg,
           respectively;

        -  combination treatment of simvastatin titrated to 40 mg and ezetimibe maintained at 10
           mg;

        -  rosuvastatin monotherapy treatment titrated to 40 mg; and

        -  Niaspan and rosuvastatin combination treatment titrated to 1000 mg and 20 mg,
           respectively.

      Objective: To evaluate the relative efficacy of first-line therapy using the combination of
      Niaspan and atorvastatin versus the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe versus
      rosuvastatin monotherapy versus the combination of Niaspan and rosuvastatin in patients with
      dyslipidemia.

      Population:

        -  Male or female patients 21 years of age or older

        -  Patients who are eligible for treatment based upon National Cholesterol Education
           Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) recommendations at the end of the
           Qualification period;

        -  All patients must have mean triglycerides (TG) ≤ 300 mg/dL.

      Design: A Phase IV, 12-week, randomized, multi-center, open-label, four-arm, parallel-group
      study evaluating the efficacy of Niaspan and statin therapy versus other lipid-modifying
      therapies preceded by a four-week washout of any previous lipid-lowering therapy.
