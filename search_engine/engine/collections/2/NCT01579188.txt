      (after prostate cancer) and women (after breast cancer). It accounts for about 15% of all new
      cancers. Lung cancer is the world's leading cause of cancer death with more than 1.6 million
      new cases diagnosed each year.

      About 85 percent of lung cancer patients have Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC ) and are
      usually diagnosed with advanced disease and have few treatment options and a very low
      survival rate.

      Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in the successful treatment of stage III NSCLC.
      However, the 5-year survival for stage III patients treated with radiotherapy alone is less
      than 10%. Several types of chemotherapy treatments have been investigated, however, progress
      has been limited. Most patients die from relapsed disease.

      The peptide telomerase vaccine, GV1001, is under development for use as active immunotherapy
      in the treatment of cancer. Normally, the immune system is tolerant to self-proteins and
      peptides, while being able to react to foreign pathogens. However, cancer cells are
      degenerated cells and many of their peptides and proteins are self-proteins or peptides. By
      using vaccination, the immune tolerance towards a specific peptide or protein can be
      circumvented.
