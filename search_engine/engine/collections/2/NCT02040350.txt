      moderate to severe poisoning by dividing them into two comparable groups in all aspects and
      using WHO recommended dose of pralidoxime (30mg/kg bolus I.V over 20 min followed by
      8mg/kg/hr continuous infusion). This dose and continuous infusion protocol is more likely to
      maintain adequate blood concentrations of pralidoxime throughout 24 hours and thus would
      avoid any failures in effectiveness of pralidoxime because of inconsistent blood levels.
