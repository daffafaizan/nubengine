      combination product containing fluticasone propionate 100 mcg / salmeterol 50 mcg (as
      xinafoate salt) and reference listed drug (RLD) AdvairÂ® Diskus 100/50 in adult patients with
      chronic but stable asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
      Expert Panel Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines [2]. To ensure adequate study sensitivity the test
      and reference products should both be statistically superior to placebo (p<0.05) with regard
      to the BE study primary endpoints.

      A secondary study objective is the safety and tolerability of the test compound.
