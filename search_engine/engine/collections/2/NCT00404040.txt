    
      Two days following disimpaction (Part I of the clinical trial) patients were assigned (based
      on their randomisation number) to receive either Movicol or Lactulose as maintenance therapy
      for the remainder of the study. At discharge all patients received the appropriate supply of
      study medication. This includes 1 week's overage should they miss their next visit to the
      ProMotion clinic. They did not know whether they have been randomised to receive Movicol or
      Lactulose Dry.

      Following discharge patients were contacted after 3-5 days by telephone or home visit
      (whichever was appropriate) to encourage treatment and to ensure compliance. Parents were
      instructed to contact the Pro-Motion team who would advise appropriately if patients had any
      difficulty i.e. none, irregular and/ or uncomfortable or very loose bowel movements.

      The daily use of Movicol or Lactulose Dry during Part II was recorded in the diary. If the
      dose of Movicol or Lactulose was changed by the Pro-Motion team at any time then it was
      documented appropriately in the patient notes and the case report form.
