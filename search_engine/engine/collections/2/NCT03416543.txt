      several drugs but none target dendritic cells even if it seems they play a major role in the
      physiopathology.

      One of the unit of research of Tours recently develop a new format of bispecific antibody
      which target dendritic cells. The first results in PBMC (unpublished yet) show an increase of
      the production of IL-10 In this study, we are going to first evaluate the cellular
      composition of synovial fluid from patients with RA and patients with gout (for the
      comparison, because the inflammatory mechanisms are different) and with osteoarthritis
      (comparison with a non inflammatory disease) Then, we will use this new antibody and evaluate
      the response by dosing Il-10, IL-6, IL-12, IL1B and IFNy The aim is to verify in vitro if,
      with this new drug, it is possible to reverse the inflammation and induce a tolerance.
