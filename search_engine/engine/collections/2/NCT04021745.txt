      difficult. Individuals often believe that they simply need to "restrain" their eating
      impulses in order to eat more healthily. However, such an approach has not only been shown to
      be quite ineffective over long time spans, it is also associated with aversive feelings: It
      simply does not feel good to struggle with one's own impulses.

      Investigators are testing a new approach to overcoming unhealthy eating habits, which
      utilizes mindful eating to change the reward value of unhealthy food. The hypothesis is that
      if people pay attention to how unhealthy food (e.g. "junk" food) makes them feel in their
      bodies, their liking it and desire to eat it will decrease naturally. Participants might
      become aware, for example, that eating a whole bag of chips leads to nausea, while eating a
      salad makes them feel fresh and energetic.

      Investigators will assess whether and how the anticipated and actual satisfaction associated
      with unhealthy food will decrease the more often participants use this intervention.
