      risk predictions for postoperative complications. Individual risk factors are then linked to
      best-practice interventions tailored to the individual patient. The investigator aims to test
      the hypothesis that using CALYPSO-augmented postoperative care will reduce complication rates
      in patients undergoing elective general surgery. Subjects undergoing surgery will be assigned
      to the CALYPSO intervention in the postoperative period.
