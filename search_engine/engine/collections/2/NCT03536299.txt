      The 40 adults without MS will undergo the two baseline testing sessions only for the first
      phase of the study. 20 of those individuals with MS will be randomly selected to undergo the
      intervention phase of the study.

      The research design will include two groups, the intervention and control group. Both groups
      will undergo a screening process, two baseline testing sessions, and be randomly assigned to
      one of the two groups. The duration of the study is 6 weeks in length for a total of 18
      training sessions. The intervention group participants will undergo gait training with a
      specific concomitant cognitive task (dual-task) for a total walking time of 20 minutes and
      with rest breaks the total session time is ~60 minutes with a physical therapist. The control
      group will undergo gait training, but without the cognitive task. Feedback from the therapist
      will be provided to each participant concerning gait mechanics and ways to improve gait
      regardless of group membership.

      Outcome measures data will be collected twice at baseline, once at mid-intervention, once at
      post-intervention, and once at one-month follow-up.
