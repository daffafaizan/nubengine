    
      This is a two-arm single-center pilot phase II clinical trial. Patients will be screened at
      the time of hospital admission and will be required to be enrolled within the clinical trial
      within 48 hours of hospital admission.

      In the individualized, biomarker-concordant arm, all patients will receive steroids once at
      the time of admission, then a daily morning dose. In order to account for varying turnaround
      time at different laboratories, CRP levels will be drawn with early morning labs, and used to
      determine the steroid dosing for the day. Patients will receive daily CRP measurements for
      the first 5 days of the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge. CRP measurements will
      be discontinued once the CRP is less than 50mmol/L.

      Steroid administration will be facilitated using standardized computerized physician order
      entry. The patients, treating physicians and outcome assessors will be blinded to the group
      assignment. Steroid order sets will include 6 hourly point of care glucose monitoring, and an
      insulin sliding scale for glucose levels to facilitate glucose management. The need for
      insulin drip will be determined by the treating physician. Additional testing including serum
      and urine ketones will be informed by the glucose level, serum anion gap and bicarbonate
      levels in routine basic metabolic panels and determined by the treating physician.

      In the usual care arm, patients will receive daily CRP measurements for the first 5 days of
      the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge.
