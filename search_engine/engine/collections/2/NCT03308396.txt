    
      A total of up to 58 subjects will be enrolled on both phases.

      Phase Ib: 6-12 subjects; enrolled into either Cohort 1 or 2. Phase II: 46 subjects; enrolled
      into either Cohort 1 or 2.

      Cohort 1 (36 subjects): received 0-1 prior therapy and no prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA4.

      Cohort 2 (16 subjects): received up to 2 prior therapies, one of which must include an
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to which they did not respond. Only one prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy
      is allowed.

      Patients from Phase Ib treated at the eventual phase II dose will be combined with patients
      in Phase II in the efficacy analysis.

        -  Therapy will start with guadecitabine on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle. Guadecitabine will
           be dosed subcutaneously on days 1-5 at either dose level 0 (60 mg/m2) or dose level -1
           (45 mg/m2), based on the recommended phase II dose.

        -  Durvalumab will be started on day 8 of the 28-day cycle. Durvalumab will be administered
           intravenously at a flat dose of 1500mg every 28 days.

        -  Study treatment may continue for up to 13 cycles (52 weeks) in the absence of confirmed
           progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

      Phase Ib Treatment Plan

        -  Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated within the first cycle (i.e., within
           the first 28 days).

        -  Six patients will be enrolled at dose level 0. If 2 or fewer patients experience a dose
           limiting toxicity, the study will continue to the phase II portion at dose level 0.

        -  Alternately, if 3 or more patients have a dose limiting toxicity at dose level 0, 6
           patients will be accrued at the lower dose (dose -1). If 2 or fewer patients experience
           a dose limiting toxicity, the study will continue to phase II at dose level -1.

        -  If 3 or more subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity at dose level -1, the
           treatment will be considered unsafe and the trial will be stopped. In this case,
           durvalumab and guadecitabine will be permanently discontinued and the subjects followed
           per protocol.
