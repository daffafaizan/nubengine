      which participants may present for screening for prevention services. At the sites,
      eligibility criteria will be assessed, HIV, Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and laboratory
      testing will be performed, and HIV prevention service referrals will be initiated. Follow-up
      will be on a monthly basis for the first three months, and then de-escalated to an
      every-3-month interval.

      The program stratifies participants into two cohorts on the basis of sexual risk behavior: a
      low-moderate risk cohort (LM) and a high-risk cohort (H). Participants in the LM cohort will
      be provided a customized prevention package (CPP) including access to PEP for emergency HIV
      prevention in the event of unanticipated HIV exposure. Participants in the H cohort will be
      provided a CPP including daily Truvada-based PrEP. All participants will be followed for 48
      weeks. Participants in the LM cohort who, on longitudinal sexual risk behavior surveillance,
      report increased levels of sexual risk-taking such that they meet enrollment criteria for the
      H-cohort will be transitioned to the H-cohort.

      At each follow-up visit, a careful safety assessment will be made, including signs/symptoms
      and laboratory assessments. STD testing will be performed at 3 month intervals. An
      escalating-intensity adherence intervention will be implemented based on real-time plasma
      tenofovir levels. A computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) will be used to capture detailed
      sexual risk, adherence, and substance use behavior.
