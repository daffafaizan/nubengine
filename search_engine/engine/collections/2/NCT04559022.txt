      grafting for the treatment of acne scarring. Overall assessment of clinical outcome and
      safety will be based clinic visits and evaluation of pre- and post- procedural photos. In
      conjunction with standard and close-up photography, we will also be using 3D imaging,
      cross-polarized imaging, UV imaging, high-resolution ultrasonography, optical coherence
      tomography, transepidermal water loss measurements, and/or BTC 2000 measurements.
      Additionally, we will be utilizing 0.33 mm skin biopsies to assess histological and genetic
      changes that occur below the skin surface as a result of this treatment. The subject's
      assessment of satisfaction will be characterized using a non-parametric assessment scale at
      each follow-up period.
