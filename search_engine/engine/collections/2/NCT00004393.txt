    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Initially,
      all patients receive placebo capsules twice daily in a single blind fashion during the first
      2 weeks of study.

      Then, patients are randomized to receive either risperidone (RIS) or placebo for 8 weeks. The
      dose of RIS is increased weekly over the first 4 weeks of treatment, as tolerated.

      Patients continue RIS for 4 additional weeks at the dose prescribed during week 4.

      All patients receive diagnostic evaluations at the beginning and end of the 2 week initial
      single blind phase, and at the end of weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the active treatment phase.
