        -  Determine the feasibility of a randomized trial to determine the impact of the timing of
           surgery and chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian epithelial,
           primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (primary surgery): Patients undergo radical surgery. Within 6 weeks after primary
           surgery, patients receive chemotherapy comprising carboplatin alone or in combination
           with paclitaxel or another chemotherapy agent on day 1. Chemotherapy repeats every 3
           weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients may undergo interval debulking surgery after the third course of
           chemotherapy.

        -  Arm II (neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I for 3
           courses. Within 3 weeks after chemotherapy, patients undergo radical surgery. Within 6
           weeks after surgery, patients receive an additional 3 courses of chemotherapy as in arm
           I.

      Patients are followed at 9 months after randomization, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100-150 patients will be accrued for this study within 18
      months.
