    
      This study was conducted at the outpatient clinics, faculty of physical Therapy, Kafrelsheikh
      University to compare between the effects of slider, tensioner neurodynamic mobilization
      techniques and stretching exercises on pain, Range of motion (ROM) and functional disability
      for patients with chronic discogenic sciatica.

      Design of the study:

      A pre-test post-test three-armed comparative study design was used for comparison between the
      effects of slider, tensioner neurodynamic mobilization techniques and stretching exercises
      for patients with chronic discogenic sciatica.

      Selection of patients:

      Sample size:

      Using G-power software program and regarding F test study , alpha level of 0.05, confidence
      interval 95% and effect size of 0.25 (to detect small effects ), three groups and 6 dependent
      variables, the total sample size will be 36 patient (twelve in each group).

      To reach the specific sample size, forty-three patients were screened regarding the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thirty-six patient with unilateral chronic discogenic sciatica
      from both sexes (….male and … female) were recruited from the outpatient clinics, faculty of
      physical Therapy, Kafrelsheikh University. Their age ranged between 21-50 years.

      They were randomly allocated by simple random method; to avoid selection bias, patients were
      asked to choose a card of three wrapped cards representing the three treatment groups:

      Group (A): received Slider technique only. Group (B): received Tensioner technique only.
