      device (JUUL)/supplies (JUULpods) along with directions to switch over from combustible
      cigarettes to e-cigarettes exclusively, or 2) the combination of an e-cigarette device
      (JUUL)/supplies (JUULpods) and incentives for combustible cigarette cessation. In all groups,
      cigarette smoking will be monitored over a 8-week period to characterize reductions in
      cigarette smoking and rates of smoking cessation. It is anticipated that individuals who are
      provided with an e-cigarette device and supplies, and are also incentivized for completely
      switching from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use will show the greatest reductions in
      cigarette smoking and be the most likely to stop smoking combustible cigarettes altogether.
      The long-term objective of the sub-study is to identify strategies to help homeless adults
      quit smoking or switch to e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy.
