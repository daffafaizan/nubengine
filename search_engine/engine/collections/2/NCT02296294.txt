      administration.

      As a prerequisite the investigators will test a recently developed whole-body bioimpedance
      spectroscopy device to determine fluid status in volunteers after an intravenous fluid
      therapy.

      The correlation of infused fluid and change of the fluid status measured with Body
      Composition Monitor (BCM, Fresenius Medical Care, Germany) is still unknown.

      Using a three-compartment physiologic tissue model, BCM determine total body fluid volume
      (TBV), extracellular volume (ECV), intracellular volume (ICV) and fluid overload (FO) as
      surplus or deficit of 'normal' extracellular volume. The BCM device measures resistance and
      reactance at 50 discrete frequencies covering the frequency spectrum from 5 to 1000 kHz
      through the entire patient via 4 electrodes placed on the wrist and ankle.

      Fifteen volunteers will be enrolled in a randomized, blinded cross over study. After
      randomisation into one of two treatments the volunteer will receive either an iv isotonic
      fluid therapy of Elo-melÂ® (Fresenius Kabi Austria) at a rate of 0,50ml/kg/min for one hour or
      no fluid therapy. At the second study day the volunteer will obtain the opposite treatment.

      We will perform BCM measurements every 10 minutes before, during and after the treatment for
      6 hours or until the BCM results return to baseline. The results are stored on a BCM patient
      card automatically.

      The main objective of this study is to detect the administered iv fluid in the extracellular
      compartment respectively in FO, TBV and ICV.

      Secondary outcome parameters include the change over time of ICV, ECV, TBV and FO after the
      iv therapy at the study day "Fluid Therapy".
