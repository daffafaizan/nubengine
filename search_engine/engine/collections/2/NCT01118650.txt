    
      Public school based study for children ages 8 through 14 years of age.

      Children previously identified and currently receiving an Individualized Education Program
      (IEP) or 504 accommodations in the classroom setting for symptoms of ADHD.

      Open enrollment of 30 subjects, both male and female.

      One study visit in which subjects will perform/receive the following assessments/evaluations:

        1. Quotient ADHD System Test

        2. Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Teacher Rating Scale

        3. Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale

      The primary analytical goal is to examine the extent of agreement of the Quotient ADHD
      System(either individual measures or in combination) with standard measures (Vanderbilt ADHD
      Diagnostic Teacher Rating Scale and Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale) and to
      compare this agreement with that seen between the standard measures.
