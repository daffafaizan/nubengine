      laboratory markers of CSS (eCSS: leucopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin, d-dimer,
      LDH, CRP, and AST/ALT) in patients admitted to the hospital with respiratory compromise in
      the setting of Covid-19 infection can accurately identify patients with CSS as defined by
      validated CSS case definitions (H-Score, aHLH-2004). Confirmation of eCSS predictive of
      evolving CSS will identify patients at risk for rapid deterioration of lung function and
      inform early initiation of treatment for CSS. Genotyping studies will also be performed on
      patients with confirmed CSS to determine whether perforin pathway mutations commonly present
      in CSS associated with other disorders are present. The second aim is to determine whether
      early treatment with rhIL-1Ra (anakinra) in patients admitted to the hospital with markers of
      CSS improves or prevents deterioration of respiratory dysfunction and prevents the
      development of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
