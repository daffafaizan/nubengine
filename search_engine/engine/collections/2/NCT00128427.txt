    
      The postpericardiotomy syndrome is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery affecting
      from 20 to 40% of patients. The etiology of this complication is a subject of debate. It is
      commonly believed to be an autoimmune response to pericardial and/or pleural bleeding or
      surgical trauma. Colchicine is safe and effective in the treatment and prevention of
      pericarditis and preliminary data have shown that it may be effective also in the primary
      prevention of the postpericardiotomy syndrome.

      Comparisons: The study will compare the safety and efficacy of colchicine in the primary
      prevention of the postpericardiotomy syndrome in addition to optimal standard care.
