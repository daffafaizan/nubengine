    
      This study is designed as comparative, sequential, non-randomized, multi-center
      investigation.

      Up to four sites will recruit approximately 88 subjects. Each site is expected to implant the
      ATTUNE primary cemented total knee in approximately 22 subjects. The sequential design
      requires all ATTUNE TKA with reusable instruments be completed before doing any ATTUNE TKA
      with single use instruments.

      The mechanical axis alignment will be assessed at the 3 month follow-up by independent
      radiographic review.
