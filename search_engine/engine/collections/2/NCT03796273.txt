    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if ketoconazole alters the tGLI1 activation signature (tGAS) which is
      consisted of eight validated tGLI1 regulated genes (CD24, CD44, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR2, TEM7,
      OCT-4. and heparanase) in tGLI1 expressing brain biospecimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if pre-treatment with ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the tGLI1 pathway in
      tissue culture and animal models, reduces circulating tGLI1 associated exosomal miRNA
      expression (miR1290 and miR1246) in brain tumor patients.

      II. To describe the safety of ketoconazole when administered peri-operatively to patients
      with primary and secondary brain tumors.

      III. To measure the blood brain penetrance of ketoconazole in serum relative to enhancing
      brain tissue.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure blood brain penetration of ketoconazole in serum relative to cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) and serum relative to non-enhancing brain tissue (exploratory recurrent glioma
      patients only).

      II. To compare tGLI1 expression and pathway modulation with ketoconazole pre-treatment in
      patients with recurrent gliomas relative to breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM).

      III. To determine the overall survival and toxicity outcomes for patients that continue
      ketoconazole after surgery, at the discretion of the treating physician.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ketoconazole orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-4 before standard
      surgery in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
