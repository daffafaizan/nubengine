    
      Phase II study of 5-aza maintenance after allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)
      for high-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Early studies
      indicate 5-aza is a hypomethylating agent that has shown immune modulating properties that
      may enhance the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, including upregulation of
      tumor-associated antigen and costimulatory molecule expression. 5-aza also has properties
      that suggest protection against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary objective is to
      evaluate relapse rate at one year. Secondary objectives will include the incidence of both
      acute and chronic GVHD as well as relapse-free survival, overall survival and toxicity.
      Correlatives will be performed to evaluate the effect of 5-aza maintenance on the immune
      system.

      Subjects must be transplant candidates with MDS or high risk characteristics of AML. Subjects
      are consented, screened, then transplanted. Those showing complete response and no active
      GVHD after transplant can proceed to maintenance with 5-aza. Bone marrow biopsies are
      performed for response assessment after transplant as well as every three cycles (1 cycle=28
      days) while on treatment. Dosing starts at 32mg/m2 and can be increased every 2 cycles
      without a serious adverse event (SAE), or reduced per toxicity for up to 12 cycles.
