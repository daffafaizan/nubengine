      compared to a lower protein intervention which use the USDA MyPlate nutrition guide.

      It is hypothesized that participants randomly assigned to the higher protein dietary
      treatment will lose more weight based on BMI-Z score over 12 weeks compared to participants
      in the lower dietary protein treatment.

      Aim 2 is to test if changes in subjective ratings of appetite differ by dietary treatment
      (i.e. protein intake).

      It is hypothesized that participants in the higher protein intervention will report a
      decrease in hunger and an increase in fullness compared to participants in the lower protein
      intervention.

      Aim 3 is to test if change in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) measured at the rate
      limiting step of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) and glycosylation
      measured as O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) differ by dietary
      treatment.

      It is hypothesized that participants randomly assigned to the higher protein dietary
      treatment will have decreased change from baseline levels of GFAT and glycosylation (OGT) due
      to decreased carbohydrate intake compared to the lower protein treatment.

      Exploratory Aims: As exploratory aims, the investigators will test if the higher protein or
      lower protein dietary treatments differentially alter glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and
      triglycerides (markers of the metabolic syndrome).
