      given excellent results of current early clinical trials (ORR â‰¥ 67% in pancreatic cancer).
      This will change standard of care for front-line therapy in patients with stage IV pancreatic
      cancer. In this cohort of patients' tolerability after 6 cycles of therapy will be a
      challenge. Investigators hypothesize that developing a maintenance strategy with TTF+G will
      be cutting edge approach and can potentially transform front-line standard of care therapy in
      patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. If this pilot study proves fruitful then a larger
      study to confirm findings can be conducted.
