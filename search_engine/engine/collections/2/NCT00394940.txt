    
      COPD is a term that encompasses both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, two diseases that are
      characterized by airway obstruction that interferes with normal breathing. Airway
      inflammation can stem from exposure to harmful fumes in the air, chronic bacterial infections
      in the airways, and a genetic predisposition to an inflammatory response to these agents. In
      people with COPD, the airway inflammation may extend beyond the lungs and contribute to
      systemic symptoms and, ultimately, to an increased mortality risk. Markers of systemic
      inflammation have been identified, but the relationship between these markers and when and to
      what extent COPD develops has not been determined. This study will use data collected during
      the TESAOD and its 33-year follow-up to determine the relationship between COPD and the
      expression of various inflammatory proteins, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.,
      IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) and acute phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein, soluble CD14).

      This study will not recruit any new participants. Detailed respiratory phenotypic information
      and serum samples that were collected during the TESAOD study will be evaluated in
      conjunction with newly generated biomarker and protein information. No new phenotypic data or
      biological specimens will be collected in this study.
