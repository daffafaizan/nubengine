      retinal diseases for possible participation in new CGMH clinical trials and epidemiological
      protocols. Also, by providing long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of corneal or
      retinal disorders, the relevant specialists and basic scientists at CGMH will be better able
      to identify research hypotheses about these diseases in addition to maintaining their
      clinical skills. The availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of corneal or
      retinal disorders will be valuable for the training of fellows in external eye or intraocular
      diseases, an important mission of the CGMH. The ability to provide long-term follow-up and
      care will also facilitate referral efforts for new CGMH protocols.

      The corneal or retinal specialists at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital will be free to choose
      those ocular disorders that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be
      enrolled in the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new
      treatments. Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current
      standard of care for each corneal or retinal diseases.

      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for
      potential eligibility in any new CGMH clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,
      they will not be required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be
      entirely voluntary. No more than 200 patients will be accepted in this "Evaluation and
      Treatment Protocol."
