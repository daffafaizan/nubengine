    
      This is a double-blind, safety and infectivity study of experimental human Norovirus
      genogroup GII.4 administered to 48 healthy non-pregnant adults, 18-49 years of age,
      inclusive. Subjects will be admitted to Cincinnati Center for Clinical Research (CCCR)
      inpatient facility and challenged with a dose of human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain. The
      challenge study will be conducted in 3 cohorts of approximately 16 subjects each, 15 subjects
      will have a functional FUT-2 gene (secretor positive) and 1 subject will have a
      non-functional FUT-2 gene (non-secretor). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 3.5x10^3 copies
      of norovirus, in Cohort 2 will receive 3.5x10^4 copies of norovirus and in Cohort 3 will
      receive 3.5x10^5 copies of norovirus. Based on the illness rate of subjects meeting the
      primary outcome measure in secretor - positive subjects of the initial cohort, the decision
      will be made with regards to dosing of the second and the third cohorts. Subjects will remain
      in the inpatient facility for at least four days following the challenge and assessed daily
      for clinical and virologic evidence of norovirus infection. After the discharge, subjects
      will return to the site for evaluation on Days 6, 15, 30, 45, and 60 post challenge. A final
      phone call will be performed at day 180 to obtain an interim medical history. Study duration
      is approximately 12-18 months with subject participation duration of 6-8 months. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine the optimal challenge dose of Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3
      Batch No.: 01-16C3 to achieve illness in > / = 50% of subjects (illness is defined as
      norovirus infection determined by positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and either: a) > /
      = 3 loose or liquid stools, in a 24-hour period, b) > / = 300 gm of loose or liquid stool in
      a 24-hour period or c) and/or any episode of vomiting), during the inpatient period. The
      secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the safety of the Norovirus GII.4 CIN-3 Batch No.:
      01-16C3 challenge strain; 2) To determine the rate of infection at different challenge doses
      by detection of norovirus GII.4 in the stool using specific qRT-PCR and Anti-norovirus GII.4
      serum IgG by Enzyme-Linked Immunnosorbent Assay (ELISA) (> / = 4-fold rise from baseline
      through Day 30); 3) To measure the severity of acute gastroenteritis; 4) To determine the
      quantity and duration of virus shedding in stool by qRT-PCR.
