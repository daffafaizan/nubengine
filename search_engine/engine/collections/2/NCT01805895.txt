      be randomly assigned to minocycline or control (1:1). The first dose will be given
      intravenously. Subsequent doses will be given orally every 24 hours for a total of five
      doses. The study will test to see if the medication is safe in intracerebral hemorrhage. The
      pharmacokinetics of minocycline in intracerebral hemorrhage will be determined and the impact
      of minocycline on blood biomarkers.
