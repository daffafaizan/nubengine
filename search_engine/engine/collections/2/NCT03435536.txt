      peripheral and portal blood. Moreover, circulating tumor DNA will be measured during 12
      months after surgery in peripheral blood. They will use a gene mutation detection technique
      called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) which is more specific than a simple Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (PCR).
