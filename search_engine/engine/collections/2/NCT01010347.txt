    
      Methods: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in children 2 to 17 years old with a
      radio graphically confirmed distal radial buckle fracture. Exclusion criteria will include
      skeletal maturity, previous distal radius fracture, concurrent other fracture(s),
      osteogenesis imperfecta or other metabolic bone disease. Enrolled subjects will be randomized
      to receive either a short arm cast or a volar wrist splint. The pediatric emergency
      department attending physician will be responsible for applying or directly supervising the
      immobilization technique. All subjects' radiographs will be reviewed by a pediatric
      orthopaedic surgeon with 1 day to confirm diagnosis and measure fracture angulation. Those
      subjects with unacceptable angulation will be called and asked to return to the ED or
      orthopaedic clinic for re-evaluation.

      Outcomes Measures: The primary outcome measure will be the Peds QL questionnaire to assess
      impact on daily function. This will be assessed at baseline in the ED, by phone at 1 day, 3
      days and 1 week after the ED visit, and at the orthopaedic clinic follow-up visit 3 weeks
      after the ED visit. Secondary outcome measures will include questionnaires assessing
      demographic data (baseline), pain, satisfaction, adverse effects (baseline, immediately after
      immobilization applied, 1 day, 3days and 1 week after ED visit by phone, and at the 3 week
      orthopaedic clinic follow-up visit), and ED treatment time (in ED prior to discharge). At the
      3 week orthopaedic surgery clinic follow-up visit, an assessment of the integrity of the
      immobilization technique will be conducted by a cast technician and fracture
      alignment/healing and range of motion of affected arm will be conducted by the pediatric
      orthopaedic surgeon who will be blinded to treatment group.
