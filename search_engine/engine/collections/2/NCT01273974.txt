      status.It is recommended to immunize them against influenza annually.in intradermal
      vaccination antigens directly present to the large numbers of antigen-presenting cells in the
      skin and it may cause greater immunogenicity than in the intramuscular method. Reduced-dose
      intradermal influenza vaccine is immunogenic in healthy adult, patients with solid cancer and
      three groups of immunocompromized patients including Rheumatologic patients treated with
      anti-TNF, HIV-infected and stem cell transplanted patients.

      In this study we compare the efficacy of influenza vaccines in half dose intradermal and
      standard intramuscular methods among hemodialysis patients.
