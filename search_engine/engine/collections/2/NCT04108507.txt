      osteoporotic fractures were randomly divided into two groups. The lumbar spinal nerve branch
      was blocked with betamethasone and ropivacaine in the experimental group during PKP
      operation, while the lumbar spinal nerve branch block was not performed in the control group
      during PKP operation. The low back pain was evaluated at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months
      and 6 months after operation using Visual analogue pain score(VAS)scale.So as to compare the
      effect of lumbar spinal nerve block on residual pain after PKP.
