      predictive value of prenatal diagnostic examinations, the maternal morbidity associated with
      its management, or its psychological effects. Moreover the technical resources necessary for
      the safest delivery of women at risk have not been clearly identified.

      Objectives: The primary objectives are to identify individual risk factors for maternal
      morbidity, as well as risk factors related to types of management and healthcare facilities
      for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Secondary objectives are to 1) determine the prevalence of
      placenta accreta among women at risk; 2) assess the predictive value of ultrasound and MRI
      for the diagnosis of placenta accreta in this population; 3) evaluate psychological impact
      and physical complications; 4) report maternal physical complications during the year after
      delivery.

      Design: Population-based prospective observational study of pregnant women with a placenta
      inserted at a uterine scar Setting; A total of 166 centers in 8 French regions, with 260,000
      deliveries annually.

      Methods: We expect to include 570 women at risk of placenta accreta in two years, of whom
      approximately 100 (20%) will have placenta accreta.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is severe maternal hemorrhage; secondary
      outcome measures are maternal morbidity and deaths, predictive value of ultrasound and MRI,
      and psychological evaluations at 1, 6 and 12 months after delivery.

      Conclusion: This study will be the first prospective population-based study to include women
      at risk of placenta accreta and to investigate incidence, prenatal detection, type of
      management, morbidity and maternal psychological consequences.
