      lesions resulting from a neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate in the absence of infection.
      Pyoderma gangrenosum is associated with a neutrophilic leukocytosis, which is likely to be
      triggered by C5a. This study is set up based on the hypothesis that IFX-1 might be able to
      block C5a induced pro-inflammatory effects such as neutrophil activation and cytokine
      generation, potentially contributing to the local skin inflammation and tissue damage.
