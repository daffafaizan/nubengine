    
      This phase III,randomized controlled trial will enroll 130(65 each arm) newly diagnosed
      patients with active disease from 4 medical centers in East China.

      The participants are randomly equally selected to receive BiCTd regimen arm or CTd regimen
      arm. The treatment consists of eight induction and consolidation therapy followed by
      maintenance therapy.

      BiCTd(Clarithromycin, Cyclophosphamide, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone) regimen arm：

      Induction and consolidation Phase:

      All patients will also receive aspirin 100mg PO QD while receiving BiCTd. Aspirin will
      continue through maintenance.

      Clarithromycin 500 mg orally daily on days 1-28,thalidomide 100-200mg orally on days d1-28,
      dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days on 1,8,15,22, and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2
      intravenously on day 1-3. Eight Cycles were repeated every 28 days.

      If efficacy <PR after 4 cycles of induction， or disease progression at anytime，patients will
      be quitted.

      Maintenance Therapy:

      Patients who complete the induction and consolidation regimen could be started on maintenance
      therapy as follows: Maintenance with CP (cyclophosphamide 200 mg orally on days 1-14 and
      prednisone 30mg twice daily orally on days 1-7,repeated every 28 days) regimen until disease
      progression.

      CTd regimen arm：

      Induction and consolidation Phase:

      All patients will also receive aspirin 100mg PO QD while receiving CTd. Aspirin will continue
      through maintenance.

      Thalidomide 100-200mg orally on days d1-28, dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days on 1,8,15,22,
      and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2 intravenously on day 1-3. Eight Cycles were repeated every 28
      days.

      If efficacy <PR after 4 cycles of induction， or disease progression at anytime，patients will
      be quitted.

      If no further reduction in the serum and urine M protein in the next cycle，patients may cross
      over to BiCTd regimen.

      Maintenance Therapy:

      Patients who complete the induction and consolidation regimen could be started on maintenance
      therapy as follows: Maintenance with CP (cyclophosphamide 200 mg orally on days 1-14 and
      prednisone 30mg twice daily orally on days 1-7,repeated every 28 days) regimen until disease
      progression Then, patients will be followed up for 24 months after chemotherapy. The
      investigators will record all the laboratory and clinical investigations to assess response
      at different points of the study. We also assess adverse events (AEs), as graded according to
      NCI-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) Version 4.0.Response categories were
      based on the International Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria.
