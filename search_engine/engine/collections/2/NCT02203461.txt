      (BMI 18-25) male volunteers before and after 14 days (+/- 2 days) of treatment with STRIBILDÂ®
      (treatment 1, n=10), as compared to TVD, LPV/r (treatment 2, n=10) and TVD, DRV/r (treatment
      3, n=10). The volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. The measurement of
      insulin resistance, lipid and glucose metabolism will be performed; before and immediately
      after the treatment. Furthermore, the therapy compliance will be verified using the method of
      drug counting and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).
