      safe, this route can be associated with significant perineal trauma and subsequent postpartum
      perineal pain. The degree of perineal trauma varies from the minimum of vaginal stretching
      and distension associated with labor, to episiotomy and significant perineal tears. In spite
      of the differences in the degree of injury following vaginal delivery, postpartum pain
      therapy is poorly organized and at best consists of simple analgesics and anti-inflammatory
      drugs. The purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of epidural-administered
      morphine offers additional advantage to an organized program for the management of immediate
      postpartum perineal pain following vaginal delivery.
