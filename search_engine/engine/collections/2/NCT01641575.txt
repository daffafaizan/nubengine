      tumors including NSCLC. Entry of gemcitabine into tumor cells has been shown to be dependent
      on specific membrane transporter proteins, particularly human equilibrative nucleoside
      transporter 1 (hENT1). Patients with low tumor hENT-1 expression may respond poorly to
      gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. Gemcitabine elaidate (CO-1.01) is a fatty acid
      derivative of gemcitabine, and can enter cells in the absence of hENT1. CO-1.01 therefore,
      may overcome hENT1-mediated resistance to gemcitabine.

      CO-1.01 is currently being evaluated as a single agent in a pivotal randomized trial in 360
      patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The appropriate dose of CO-1.01 when
      given as part of combination therapy with a platinum agent such as cisplatin is not yet
      known. The objectives of this study are to:

        -  determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CO-1.01 when combined with a fixed dose of
           cisplatin in patients with solid tumors

        -  select a recommended dose (RD) for dose expansion in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC

        -  explore clinical activity of CO-1.01 in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC
