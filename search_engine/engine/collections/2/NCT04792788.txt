      period in PICU will be studied. They will be endotracheally intubated and spontaneously
      triggering the mechanical ventilator. In each patient enrolled a specially manufactured
      nasogastric tube will be inserted. This nasogastric tube is equipped with ten electrodes. The
      correct position of the nasogastric tube (and of electrodes) will be confirmed checking the
      good quality of Edi trace with the P waves displayed by the central electrodes on monitor of
      Servo I Ventilator (Maquet). All the patients will be ventilated using ventilators with NAVA
      option (Servo-I, Maquet Critical Care, Sweden). After a stabilization period in Pressure
      Support Ventilation (PSV) according with the attending physician, each patient will be
      studied for a duration of 2 hours, divided in three trials of 40-minutes (first 30 minutes to
      washout from the effects of previous ventilation mode and during the last 10 minutes the
      results will be recorded). Each patient will be randomized for ventilation mode sequence
      (PSV/NAVA/PSV or NAVA/PSV/NAVA). The patient tracings of flow, airway pressure, electrical
      activity of diaphragm for the patient-ventilator interaction analysis, blood gas analysis and
      cardiovascular parameters will be recorded during each trial.
