      In this study, in order to improve efficacy and shorten the operation time, personalized
      plate is prepared before surgery. During the surgery, the articular cartilage is scraped,
      then the fusion joint is reset to the functional position; the 2-2mm Kirschner wires are
      drilled with the assistance of the personalized plate,then the position of the fusion joint
      as well as the Kirschner wires are confirmed under the C-arm; lastly, cannulated screws are
      screwed in along the Kirschner wires for effective fixation.

      In the past surgeries without personalized plate, surgeons could only rely on their
      experience to locate the position for drilling and then confirm under the C-arm. This would
      prolong the operation time and be more traumatic to the patients. Using 3D printing
      personalized plate can solve this problem.

      The preparation procedure for the personalized plate: firstly, ankle model are established
      according to the patient's CT scan data, then select modular pieces to prepare the
      personalized plate, sterilize it for future use. Apply conventional surgical treatment to the
      subtalar surface, reset the fusion joint to the functional position, and drill 2-2mm
      Kirschner wires with the guidance of the plate. If the locations of the fusion joint and the
      Kirschner wires are satisfying under the C-arm inspection, drill the hollow screw for final
      fixation.
