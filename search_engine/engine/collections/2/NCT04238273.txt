      distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants and of weaning of ventilated neonates as soon as
      possible to non-invasive modes.

      Yet, little is known about which non-invasive mode is better and the hemodynamic changes that
      occur to the infants secondary to these modes. The study provides an evaluation of the
      efficacy of heated, humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) in comparison to nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in preterm infants. Secondary aim is to assess
      echographic, cerebral blood flow and mesenteric blood flow changes during HHHFNC versus
      nCPAP.
