    
      Double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study with 2 cohorts.

      Cohort 1: Subjects with ARDS and acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2. Arm 1: 25 subjects treated
      with up to 3 doses of 100 million LMSCs. Arm 2: 10 subjects treated with up to 3 doses of
      Placebo.

      Cohort 2: Subjects with ARDS and acutely infected with influenza virus. Arm 3: 25 subjects
      treated with up to 3 doses of 100 million LMSCs. Arm 4: 10 subjects treated with up to 3
      doses of Placebo.

      Each subject will be intravenously infused with 100 million LMSCs or placebo on Day 0. If no
      treatment-related AEs are seen after the infusion, a second infusion will be given on Day 3.
      If no treatment-related AEs are seen after the second infusion, a third infusion will be
      given Day 6.

      Follow-up visits will be conducted: daily until hospital discharge; at Week 4 after treatment
      (with LMSCs or placebo) for patients already discharged; and at Month 6 after treatment (with
      LMSCs or placebo).
