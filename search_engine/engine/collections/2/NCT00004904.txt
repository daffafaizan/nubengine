      before and after partially matched related donor (PMRD) hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      transplantation results in engraftment in patients with high risk hematologic malignancies.
      II. Determine the incidence and severity of acute grade (I-IV) and chronic (limited or
      extensive) graft versus host disease in patients after rigorous T-cell depletion in PMRD HSC
      transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Harvest: Bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested from a
      related 1, 2, or 3 HLA antigen mismatched donor. PBSC are selected for CD34+ cells and
      T-cells are depleted. Conditioning: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on
      days -10 to -7 and once on day -6. Patients receive cladribine IV continuously on days -10 to
      -6; etoposide IV over 2 hours on day -5; and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours, antithymocyte
      globulin (ATG) IV over 10-12 hours, and methylprednisolone IV over 1 hour on days -4 to -2.
      Transplantation: T-cell depleted PBSC and bone marrow are infused on day 0. Patients receive
      G-CSF SQ daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Graft versus
      host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive tacrolimus IV every 12 hours beginning on day -2
      and continuing orally 4 times a day for 6-12 months at the discretion of the protocol
      investigator. Patients receive ATG IV over 10-12 hours and methylprednisolone IV over 1 hour
      on days 5-15 followed by a taper of methylprednisolone. Patients are followed every week
      through day 100 and then at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
