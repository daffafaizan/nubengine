      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib in combination with
      bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) and dexamethasone, up to a maximum bendamustine
      dose of 90 mg/m^2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of carfilzomib in combination with bendamustine and dexamethasone,
      at the MTD.

      II. To evaluate the response rate and duration of response of carfilzomib in combination with
      bendamustine and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carfilzomib and bendamustine hydrochloride.

      Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes on days 1,
      2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of courses 1-3; on days 1, 2, 15, and 16 of courses 4-12; and on
      days 1 and 2 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive bendamustine hydrochloride IV
      over 10 minutes on days 1 and 2 of courses 1-3 and on day 1 of all subsequent courses and
      carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of courses 1-12 and on days 1,
      2, 15, and 16 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
