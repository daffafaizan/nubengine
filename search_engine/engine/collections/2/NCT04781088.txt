    
      PRIAMRY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of lenvatinib,
      pembrolizumab, and weekly paclitaxel as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria in recurrent endometrial and platinum resistant ovarian cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability weekly paclitaxel, lenvatinib, and pembrolizumab
      in study patients.

      II. To measure the progression free survival in the study population. III. To measure the
      overall survival in the study population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore the baseline tumor genetic and microenvironment parameters predictive of
      clinical benefit or resistance to the treatment combination and potential mechanisms of
      resistance.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning cycle 1 day 1, patients receive lenvatinib PO daily, pembrolizumab IV on day 1, and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, on a 21 day cycle in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
