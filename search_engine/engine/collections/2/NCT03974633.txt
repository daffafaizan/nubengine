      by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Research Institute Hospital La Fe. The study included
      100 healthy volunteered, and it was performed in the University and Polytechnic Hospital La
      Fe, Valencia.

      The procedures of the study consisted in the sequential performance of four injections of
      0,1mL of physiologic saline (0,9%NaCl) in the forehead of each subject, 2cm above the
      eyebrows, with a 29G needle, after applying any of the non-invasive anesthetic methods
      studied in the trial, except for the control zone. The anesthetic method utilized in each
      part of the forehead of each patient was randomized through simple randomization. Injections
      always started from the right side of the forehead to the left. The non-invasive analgesic
      methods utilized were:

        -  Control zone: None

        -  Vibration: Application of the vibrating device on the skin below the injection site,
           before and during injection.

        -  Cold: Application of a bag of 50mL of frozen physiologic saline covered with a plastic
           glove on the injection site for 50 seconds prior to performing the injection.

        -  Anesthetic cream: Application of a uniform thickness of 2mm of the anesthetic cream EMLA
           covered with an adhesive transparent plastic dressing for 30 minutes, before injection.
