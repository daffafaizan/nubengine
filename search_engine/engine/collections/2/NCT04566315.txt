      patients with total knee prosthesis. It would be interesting to evaluate, in a therapeutic
      trial with a good level of evidence, this alternative to drug treatments that are often
      poorly tolerated, contraindicated or failing in this population of elderly subjects often
      presenting co-morbidities. This pilot study will be used to calculate the number of patients
      to be included in a comparative, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. In addition to the
      evaluation of the undesirable effects of arterial embolization, the objective of this study
      is to evaluate the effectiveness at 3 and 6 months of embolization of the neovessels on pain,
      stiffness, physical activity, quality of life and consumption of analgesics and
      anti-inflammatories.

      Evaluation criteria: modification of the pain item in the EVA (Analog Visual Scale), EQ-5D
      (quality of life scale), and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
      self-questionnaire collected in the 15 days preceding the procedure and then at 3 and 6
      months ; the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatories; adverse events.

      Study population: Patients aged 40 to 80 years with a painful total knee joint. The visual
      analogue scale (VAS) score must be greater than or equal to 50 mm for at least 3 months
      optimal medical treatment, and for whom, no surgical retreatment is indicated.

      The expected benefits are the improvement of the treatment of patients in therapeutic
      impasse, wearing a total knee prosthesis whose pain is rebellious and disabling. More
      generally, the investigators expect an improvement in the quality of life of these patients
      currently without satisfactory alternative care.
