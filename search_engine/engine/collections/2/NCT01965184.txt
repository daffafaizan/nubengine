      sessions. During CBT children are taught various skills for coping with frustration and
      parents are taught various strategies for managing situations that can be anger provoking for
      their child. This study is conducted to examine whether reduction of behavioral problems
      including anger outbursts, irritability, aggression and noncompliance after CBT may be
      paralleled by changes in areas of the brain responsible for emotion regulation and social
      perception.
