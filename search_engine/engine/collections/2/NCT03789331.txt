      anogenital distance as a sensitive biomarker of prenatal androgen reflection of reproductive
      health and sexual orientation. Anogenital distance is approximately twice as long in male
      animals compared to female animals, and it is routinely used to determine the natal or
      birth-assigned sex.

      Studies have shown alterations in anogenital distance associated with reproductive health and
      sexual orientation. For instance, shorter anogenital distance has been reported in boys with
      hypospadias and cryptorchidism. Men with reduced testicular volume have significantly shorter
      anogenital distance compared with controls. Increased anogenital distance has been indicated
      in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

      The investigators hypothesized that a prenatal pathological androgenic environment, resulting
      in a longer anogenital distance, will be able to be associated with a higher risk of sexual
      orientation disorders like transsexualism. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the
      anogenital distance measurement differences between transgender male persons and normal
      healthy female individuals.
