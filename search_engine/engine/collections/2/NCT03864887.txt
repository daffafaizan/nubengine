      organ supply for transplantation. The noninvasive, sensitive, universally available and
      timely ancillary method to assess brain death has not been established. This study aims to
      evaluate brain death with optical probes. The changes of hemodynamic parameters including
      oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) were detected by near infrared spectroscopy
      probes attached on the forehead of patients. A multiple-phase protocol at varied fraction of
      inspired O2 were utilized during the assessment. The concentration changes ratios of
      oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin (Δ[HbO2]/Δ[Hb]) in the cerebral cortex of brain-dead
      patients were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects.
