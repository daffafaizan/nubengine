      mortality. Even with advanced technology, parents and families still need to put more effort
      into taking care of these premature babies so that they can survive. Empirical evidence
      indicates that baby massage can help parents reduce stress and establish parent-child
      relationships, but few studies have been applied to parents of premature babies during
      hospitalization. Based on this, the purpose of this study is: 1. To explore the effect of
      infant massage on reducing parental pressure; 2. To compare the gender differences of
      parental pressure; 3. To explore the effect of infant massage on parent-child attachment; 4.
      Compare the gender difference of parent-child attachment relationship between parents of
      premature infants. An experimental randomized controlled clinical trial study design was
      adopted to collect data at five points in time, namely before massage (T0), one week (T1),
      four weeks (T2), eight weeks (T3), and 12 weeks (T4 ). Using the parental stress scale and
      parent-child attachment scale. Parents in the experimental group were given massage
      interventions when visiting premature babies, while parents in the control group were
      routinely visiting premature babies. The effects of infant massage on parental pressure and
      parent-child attachment of premature babies at different time points were discussed, and the
      differences gender of parental pressure and parent-child attachment were compared. The
      results can increase the empirical research on baby massage, use the empirical knowledge to
      arouse the attention of nursing staff to baby massage, improve the quality of family-centered
      care, and pay attention to the needs of parents of different genders.
