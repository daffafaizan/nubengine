    
      This was a phase III open label clinical trial to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety
      of lomitapide at the maximum tolerated dose (for each patient) established during the
      clinical trial 733-005/UP1002. Subjects completing the 78-week treatment period in study
      733-005/UP1002 who have not met any of the stopping criteria will be eligible to participate
      in 733-012. The treatment period continued until a decision was made by the local competent
      authority regarding marketing authorization. Lomitapide will be given orally once daily.
      Patient specific doses will be carried forward from 733-005/UP1002, but will not exceed the
      maximum tolerated dose the patient received during 733-005 /UP1002. The maximum dose for any
      patient was 80 mg/day. There was no reference therapy in this trial. The effects of the study
      drug were compared to baseline data (from 733-005/UP1002). Concomitant lipid-lowering therapy
      including plasmapheresis or LDL apheresis is permitted.

      Note that hereafter, Week 0 in Study 733-005/UP1002 will be referred to as Baseline and Week
      48 in Study AEGR-733-012 will be referred to as Week 126 (of overall treatment).
