      samples collected by four different methods: Saliva, Oropharyngeal swab over the tumor site
      (OP), Stool, and Rectal swab (optional).

      This study is investigating the role of oral microbiota as a biomarker in LA-OPSCC. This is a
      minimal risk study involving the analysis of patient samples and does not involve therapeutic
      intervention. This protocol does not determine eligibility to receive treatment with
      concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is anticipated that patient accrual will be
      completed within 12 months.

      The study will involve a prospective cohort of up to 60 patients diagnosed with LA OPSCC
      treated with CRT at Princess Margaret Cancer Center.
