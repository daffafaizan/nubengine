        -  To determine whether the pattern of global and TSG-specific promoter CpG island
           hypermethylation and gene silencing that we have shown characterizes MLL-rearranged
           (MLL-r) infant bilineage ALL is also characteristic of other subsets of MLL-r leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected cryopreserved cells from diagnosis are analyzed for promoter
      methylation via HELP arrays, gene expression arrays, and RT-qPCR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 samples (8 from each of 4 biologically defined cohorts) will
      be analyzed.
