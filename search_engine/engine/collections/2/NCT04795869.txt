    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the antineoplastic efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in combination with
      pembrolizumab in previously treated patients with PTCL, as measured by the overall objective
      response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      II. To assess efficacy using duration of objective response (DOR), time to response (TTR),
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, and
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 3 of cycle 1, day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 16 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles of treatment, patients may discontinue treatment if
      they experience disease progression, are eligible for stem cell transplant, or if they elect
      to not undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 5 years.
