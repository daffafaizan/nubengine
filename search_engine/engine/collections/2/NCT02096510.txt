      (Addison's disease) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia renders the cortisol levels
      unphysiological, which may cause symptoms and long-term complications. This therapeutical
      approach does not enable to restore physiological circadian and ultradian rhythm of
      glucocorticoids. Current studies conclude that constant or unphysiological administration of
      glucocorticoids leads to abnormal gene transcription and causes sides effect of
      glucocorticoids treatment and long standing complications Glucocorticoid replacement is
      technically feasible by continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion, which can mimic not
      only the normal diurnal cortisol rhythm, but potentially also the ultradian cadence.

      This is a pilot trial with an open cross-over design of 3 x minimum 2 weeks in 10 patients
      comparing the effects of tablet treatment versus continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone
      infusion versus ultradian subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion on serum, salivary, tissue
      hormonal response and glucocorticoid related gene expression.
