infantile autism and the schizophreniasin a paper published in 1943, entitled "au-tistic disturbances of affective con-tact," i reported from the children's psychi-atric service of the johns hopkins hospitalobservations of 11 children (8 boys and 3girls) who had in common a pattern of be-havior not previously considered in itsstriking uniqueness.  the symptoms wereviewed as a combination of extreme alone-ness from the beginning of life and an anx-iously obsessive desire for the preservationof sameness.  i concluded the discussion bysaying: "we must assume that these chil-dren have come into the world with aninnate inability to form the usual, biologi-cally provided affective contact with people,just as other children come into the worldwith innate physical and intellectual handi-caps.  if this assumption is correct, a furtherstudy of our children may help to furnishconcrete criteria regarding the still diffusenotions about the constitutional componentsof emotional reactivity.  for here we seem tohave pure-culture examples of inborn au-tistic disturbances of affective contact."in my search for an appropriate designa-tion, i decided in 1944, after much groping,on the term early infantile autism, thusaccentuating the time of the first manifesta-tions and the children's limited accessibility.
