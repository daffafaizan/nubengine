      long-term renal function. Serum creatinine is the most commonly used serum marker of renal
      function. However serum creatinine is insensitive for detecting small decreases in glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR). Another marker for renal function is cystatin C. Dharnidharka et al
      concluded that cystatin C is superior to serum creatinine as a marker of kidney function
      since cystatin C was a more sensitive marker than serum creatinine for detecting decreases in
      GFR. Pirsch et al reported that tacrolimus-treated patients had a lower incidence of severe
      acute rejection and better lipid profiles than cyclosporine-treated patients.

      Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of premature death in renal and other transplant
      recipients. Current immunosuppressive protocols often elevate cardiovascular disease risk
      factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity and diabetes.

      This study is designed to optimize calcineurin immunosuppressive regimens to ensure the best
      possible long-term outcomes after renal transplantation.
