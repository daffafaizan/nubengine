    
      Study design Randomized, single-center, open-label, 96-week superiority study. Patients with
      HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL while receiving DTG plus one RTI will be randomized 1:1 to continue the
      ongoing treatment or to switch to E/C/F/TAF.

      Randomization list will be a computer-generated list (with equal block sizes) and will be
      incorporated within an electronic clinical report form (eCRF).

      Patients will be evaluated at screening, baseline, week 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84,
      96 or premature discontinuation.

      At each visit the following evaluations will be performed:

        1. clinical assessment.

        2. routine laboratory tests (hematological tests and clinical chemistry). Additional blood
           samples will be collected at specified visits for storage and further determinations
           (e.g. RV by a single-copy assay).

      During follow-up, at different timepoints, patients will additionally undergo HIV-DNA
      quantification in PBMCs (BL, 48 and 96 weeks) and quality of life (QOL) and adherence
      assessement (BL, 48 and 96 weeks).

      Viral load will be assessed by Abbott Real time PCR (Abbott RealTime HIV-1) Residual viremia
      (RV) will be defined as any detectable HIV-RNA value below 50 copies/mL Virologic failure
      will be defined as a confirmed rebound in plasma HIV-RNA levels â‰¥ 50 copies/mL

      Subjects who meet a protocol-defined virologic failure during follow-up will be discontinued
      from the study.

      At virologic failure subjects will perform genotypic HIV resistance testing and a
      determination in plasma of elvitegravir or DTG Cthrough.

      HIV-DNA will be extracted from 1x106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by using
      Qiagen DNA extraction kit and quantified by Real Time PCR (ABI Prism 7900).
