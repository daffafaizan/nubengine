      insertion and the endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is reserved for patients with
      obstructive hydrocephalus. However, in the last decade several reports highlighted an success
      of an ETV in communicating hydrocephalus as well. Thus, the aim of the present study is to
      compare ventriculo-peritoneal shunting against ETV in patients with an idiopathic normal
      pressure hydrocephalus, an subset of communicating hydrocephalus, in a randomized, controlled
      multicenter study.
