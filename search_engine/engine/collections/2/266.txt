the lymphocyte in guinea-pig bone marrow .the structure and distribution of lymphocytes in the bone marrow ofnormal 400 g guinea-pigs have been studied by means of light microscopy,electron microscopy, and radioautography . the study of structuralorganization by all three techniques confirms the morphological identityof the marrow small lymphocytes with small lymphocytes in othersituations and affords added proof of the presence of a series of cellstransitional in appearance between small lymphocytes and blast cells .unlike the small lymphocytes, transitional cells show evidence of dnasynthesis . marrow small lymphocytes and transitional cells arediffusely scattered throughout the parenchyma, often situated in closeproximity to the sinusoidal endothelium . they are also foundcharacteristically concentrated within some of the sinusoids,. this istermed /lymphocyte loading/ .the findings are discussed with particular reference to the possibleorigin, interrelationship and fate of these cells .
