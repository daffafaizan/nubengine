    
      Safety follow-up: After discontinuation of study treatment, all subjects were followed for
      safety for 30 days except in the case of death, loss to follow up, withdrawal of consent, or
      discontinuation of study treatment to enroll in the ribociclib rollover clinical trial
      (CLEE011X2X01B).

      Disease progression follow-up: Subjects who discontinued study drug for any reasons other
      than disease progression were followed for efficacy every 8 weeks during the first 12 months.
      After 12 months, they were followed for every 12 weeks until disease progression, death,
      discontinuation from the study for any other reason (i.e. loss to follow-up or withdrawal of
      consent), the initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment, or until all subjects had been
      followed for at least 18 months after their first dose of study drug, or early study
      termination, whichever occurred first.

      Survival follow-up: All subjects were followed for survival via a phone call (or during a
      clinic visit) every 12 weeks and up to one additional time per quarter if a survival update
      was required to meet safety or regulatory needs. The safety follow-up was carried out until
      any of the following occurred (whichever occurred first): death, withdrawal of consent, loss
      to follow-up, at least 18 months had elapsed from when the last subject had started
      treatment, or when 80% of subjects had died or were lost to follow-up, or early study
      termination.
