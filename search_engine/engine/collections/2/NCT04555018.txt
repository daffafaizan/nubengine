      Hormone, sebum production, Propionibacterium acne and inflammatory process are factors
      involved in AV development. The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between
      Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and sebum level in adult female acne. This research
      used cross sectional study with 50 samples, aged 25-49 years by consecutive sampling. The
      degree of acne vulgaris was evaluated using Lehman criteria , and then the sebum level and
      DHEAS were measured objectively using sebumeter and serum, respectively.
