        -  Study and control group: 100 healthy children (ASA 1), ages: 2-6 years, uncooperative
           (Frankl 1-210), that needs at least two similar dental treatments. Exclusion criteria:
           enlarged tonsils (Brodsky's grading scale11 +3 = 50-75% airway obstruction, and +4 =
           >75% airway obstruction), upper respiratory tract infection or nasal discharge.

        -  Randomization: At the first appointment the subjects will assigned randomly to receive
           oral midazolam or nasal midazolam; at the second appointment the other regimen will be
           administered. In this way the study group is also the control group.

        -  Sedation: oral midazolam dose is 0.5mg/kg. Nasal midazolam dose is 0.2mg/kg. During
           treatment 50% nitrous oxide/ 50% oxygen will be administered via nasal hood. Pulse rate
           and hemoglobin oxygen saturation will be continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter
           placed on the patient's finger and recorded every 5 min.

        -  Acceptability of the medication: compliance in taking the medication will be assessed
           and recorded as: willingly, coaxed, forced, or failed (not administered).

        -  Behavior during dental treatment: Houpt scale measures behavior by rating sleep,
           movement, crying and overall behavior. The degree of alertness, movement and crying will
           be assessed before, during (every 5 min) and after the operative procedure. The rating
           will be done by one observer blind to the route of administration. This blind observer
           will also monitor the pulse and oxygen saturation.

        -  Time of onset: recording the time from the moment of midazolam administration until the
           patient is drowsy, composed, calm, and minor resistant.

        -  Maximum working time: recording duration of the dental treatment.
