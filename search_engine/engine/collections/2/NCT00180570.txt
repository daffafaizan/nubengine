      available FineLine II Sterox leads with different fixation mechanisms. This trial has been
      designed to primarily study the difference in repositioning rate between active and passive
      fixation (straight and J-shaped) leads, if any. It will also monitor and document the
      behavior of the study leads, with special reference to electrical parameters and handling.
      Normal measurements are taken at pre-dicharge, 1-month 3-month and 12-month follow-up
