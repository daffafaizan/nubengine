      event, but only a subset of referred patients chooses to participate. An intervention based
      on principles of motivational interviewing may help resolve individuals' ambivalence about
      cardiac rehabilitation. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief motivational
      intervention (MI) for enhancing intention to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation compared to a
      usual care (UC) control condition among patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation. It is
      hypothesized that patients in the MI condition will report greater intention to enroll in
      cardiac rehabilitation compared to patients in UC. A small-scale feasibility trial will
      include patients (n = 100) with acute coronary syndrome who are referred to a standard
      12-week exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program in Calgary, Canada. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to MI or UC. The primary outcome will be self-reported intention to attend
      cardiac rehabilitation. Secondary outcomes will include beliefs about cardiac rehabilitation,
      exercise self-efficacy, perceived barriers, and cardiac rehabilitation enrollment.
