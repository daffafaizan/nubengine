      milligram of IV hydromorphone was administered to adults 21 to 64 years of age who had acute
      severe pain. Fifteen minutes later, patients were asked whether they wanted more pain
      medication. If they answered yes, they received another 1 mg of IV hydromorphone and were
      again asked 15 minutes later whether they wanted more pain medication. The primary efficacy
      outcome was the proportion of patients who had adequate analgesia, defined as declining
      additional hydromorphone within 1 hour of entering the protocol. The primary safety outcome
      was incidence of oxygen desaturation less than 95%. Secondary outcomes included numeric
      rating scale pain scores and adverse events.
