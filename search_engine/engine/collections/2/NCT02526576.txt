      therapeutic potential for many rare and common diseases that impacts millions of patients
      worldwide. The Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) of Adipose Tissue is relatively easy to
      extract with minimally invasive procedures such as elective liposuction in large quantities
      and therefore may be a cost effective source for cellular therapies in a wide range of
      medical specialties.

      The term "Facial Atrophy" describes the lost of subcutaneous fat within the face and can be a
      result of the aging process as well as some pathological diseases. It can be corrected via
      autologous fat transfer but usually the majority of the grafted cells will die after 6-12
      months. Several publications demonstrate that the addition of SVF cells to the graft may
      enhance the graft survival.

      This double blind, randomized study aims to demonstrated the efficacy of Antria Cell
      Preparation Process in autologous facial fat grafting.
