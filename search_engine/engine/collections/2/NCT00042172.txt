      There are currently no definitive treatments for cognitive deterioration. This study focuses
      on elderly individuals with MCI because people at a pre-dementia stage may sustain the
      greatest and most lasting benefit from cognitive-enhancing agents.

      Patients receive either donepezil or placebo for the first 6 months of the study. In the
      second 6 months of the study, patients are randomized to receive either donepezil plus GBE or
      donepezil alone. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which provides a color-coded image of
      the brain's blood flow in a particular area, is used to assess brain activity during memory
      tasks. A PET scan is performed at study entry, 6 months, and 1 year. A vasodilator (a drug
      that dilates the blood vessels) is administered during the PET imaging procedure to determine
      whether vascular disease affects memory function. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is
      also taken to view the brain.
