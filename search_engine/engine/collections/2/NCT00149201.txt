      disease state. Peritoneal metastasis may cause serious complications, such as intestinal
      obstruction, massive ascites, and hydronephrosis associated with the clinical presentation of
      abdominal pain and fullness, vomiting, constipation, malnutrition and renal dysfunction.5-FU
      continuous infusion remains the mainstay for chemotherapy against gastric cancer. On the
      other, sequential MTX+5-FU was reported to be effective in advanced gastric cancer with
      peritoneal metastasis in some phase II studies. Therefore, the randomized phase III study of
      5-FU versus sequential MTX+5-FU in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis was conducted.
