      seems, that it offers short-term moderate benefits, but the long-term outcome is still matter
      of debate. In 2008, the Austrian arm of the MYSTAR study (a prospective multi-center
      single-blind trial) including patients with recent AMI and treated with combined
      (intramyocardial and intracoronary) delivery of autologous BM-MNCs has been completed with
      1-year FUP. The MYSTAR results showed moderate but significant improvement in infarct size
      and LV function similar to other trials, and confirmed safety, feasibility and efficacy of
      BMC treatment in AMI patients. The patients enrolled in the study reach the 5 to 8 years FUP
      at 2011, raising the question whether the combined delivery of autologous BM-MNCs results in
      a long-term benefit for these patients.

      Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term, 5 years clinical outcome of patients enrolled
      into the MYSTAR study.

      Study design: Prospective non-randomized single-center Austrian long-term FUP registry.

      Study patients: A total of 60 patients with previous cardiac stem cell therapy (participated
      in the MYSTAR study) will be included in the present study

      Primary endpoint: occurrence of MACCE (major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events,
      including all-cause death, re-AMI, revascularization and stroke) during the mean 5 years
      follow-up.

      Secondary endpoints: improvements of clinical symptoms, expressed as CCS and NYHA scores,
      change in global LV EF, measured by echocardiography, size of infarction determined by
      stress-rest SPECT, LV and RV volumes, function and cardiac output measured by cardiac MRI.
