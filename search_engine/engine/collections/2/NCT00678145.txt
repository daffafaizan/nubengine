      opioid signaling system as a mechanism for the development of HAAF/EAAF. We have demonstrated
      previously that opioid receptor blockade by acute infusion of naloxone during antecedent
      hypoglycemia can prevent experimentally induced HAAF in nondiabetic and T1DM subjects (JCEM
      94:3372-80, 2009; JCEM 96:3424-31, 2011). We have also shown that opioid receptor blockade
      also abolishes EAAF, and that both effects are regulated by the stress response (hypoglycemia
      and exercise, respectively). Furthermore, recently we have shown that activation of Î¼-opioid
      receptors with IV infusion of morphine reproduces some of the key biochemical and clinical
      features of HAAF in nondiabetic humans.Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the
      opioid system plays a central role in hypoglycemia counterregulation and in HAAF.
