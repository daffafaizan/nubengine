      involving approx. 3000 females who will be subject to an examination using liquid crystal
      contact thermography device as a complementary tool to standard diagnostic imaging procedures
      of the breast glands. The study is conducted in specialist outpatient clinics. Patients are
      eligible to participate in the study upon signing the informed consent form. There is no
      follow up after the thermographic examination.

      The study will comprise of a single registration of thermographic images of the breasts which
      will be subjected to automatic and expert analysis by radiologists.

      Primary objective of the study is to determine and compare the diagnostic efficacy of breast
      thermography using a medical device based on liquid crystal contact thermography to standard
      of care.

      The subjects were divided into three groups based on age and Breast Imaging Reporting and
      Data System (BI-RADS). Thermography was performed as a complementary modality to standard of
      care. In group A, the investigators recruited women aged 18-49, who has a breast ultrasound
      performed and a result of BI-RADS 4b, 4c or 5. In group B, the investigators recruited women
      over 50 years of age with either a result of BI-RADS 4, 4a, 4b, 4c or 5 on mammography or
      BI-RADS 4a, 4b, 4c or 5 on ultrasound. If a positive result was present on one of these
      examinations, the other examination needed to be performed. Lastly, in group C, the
      investigators recruited women aged 18 and above with a BI-RADS score of 1 or 2 on mammography
      and/or breast ultrasound.

      Predicted duration of the study is approximately 24 months.
