      and undergo general surgery. Hyperglycemia in this setting is associated with increased risk
      of postoperative complications. This proposal seeks to identify underlying risk factors in
      the development of stress hyperglycemia, and will investigate the use of a long-acting
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for the prevention of stress hyperglycemia in a
      high-risk surgical population.
