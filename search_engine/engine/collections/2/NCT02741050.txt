      management and prevention. Individuals who adopt a PA routine show significant improvements
      in clinical markers of diabetes, including HbA1c, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity,
      weight and waist circumference, and significant reductions in medication use, and also show
      reductions in cardiovascular risk factors and other related co-morbidities. Incorporation of
      cost-effective PA interventions into primary care for diabetes treatment could therefore
      enhance overall health and quality of life and significantly reduce healthcare costs. The
      primary aim of this study is to conduct a small randomized trial (N=80) to test the efficacy
      of an individually tailored culturally adapted print-based physical activity intervention
      integrated into primary care to increase weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in
      Latinas with type II diabetes, compared to those receiving standard of care.
