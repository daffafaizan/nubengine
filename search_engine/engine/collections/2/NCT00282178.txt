      respect to possible impact on insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and adipose tissue
      function and distribution. For this purpose comparisons will be performed with
      hydrochlorothiazide and placebo treatment. It is hypothesized that candesartan will improve
      insulin sensitivity as compared to hydrochlorothiazide and possibly also in comparison with
      placebo and that this could be explained by altered fat tissue function or distribution or by
      an altered sympathetic to parasympathetic balance in the autonomic nervous system.
      Hydrochlorthiazide is chosen as comparator because thiazides are a recommended firs-line
      therapy in hypertension. This drug class has some detrimental effects on glucose tolerance
      and in insulin sensitivity.
