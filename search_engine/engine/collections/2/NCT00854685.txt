      anti-TNF therapies especially in relation to immunogenicity, safety and administration. In
      addition, due to their high molecular weight, currently marketed products are largely
      confined to the blood stream.

      ART621 is an anti-TNF molecule that contains 2 identical domain "antibodies" that have the
      binding activity of a full antibody but with a substantially smaller molecular size. The
      molecular weight of approximately half that of full size antibodies is predicted to, a) have
      improved tissue penetration and, b) to be less immunogenic than full size antibodies.

      This clinical trial is designed to establish the optimal dose level and dose frequency of
      ART621 in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and to obtain data relating to
      the safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of ART621 when administered with an
      intravenous loading dose followed by subcutaneous administration every week compared to every
      fortnight.
