    
      Multicenter, double-blinded, randomized control trial. Enrollment is based on presentation to
      one of the treating facilities with clinical signs and symptoms of high-altitude pulmonary
      edema with a recent arrival at high altitude, an oxygen saturation below 85%, and
      radiographic evidence of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. A total of 264 patients will be
      randomized 1:1 across 2 study arms: a CPAP mask set to 15cm H2O and an altered CPAP mask in
      which the pressure valve has been modified to deliver no positive pressure. All patients will
      be treated with 30mg nifedipine XR. Except for the application of positive pressure, all
      other interventions are performed in the context of everyday clinical practice, and thus will
      be equivalent for participants in both arms. Patients will be evaluated every 30 minutes for
      their ability to maintain an oxygen saturation of 92% with a normal respiratory rate and no
      signs of increased work of breathing on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen for a total of up to
      a maximum treatment length of 2 hours. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed every
      30 minutes for 2 hours.
