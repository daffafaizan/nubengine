      video-assisted inside thoracic space before chest close.Initiated dose of 0.3ml/kg of
      bupivacaine 0.125%+fentanyl 2 mcg/ml was administered then continued patient-controlled
      analgesia with background rate 3ml/h, bolus dose 2ml, lockout interval 10 minutes.
      Postoperative pain was accessed by Visual Analogue Scale at rest and on coughing; monitor the
