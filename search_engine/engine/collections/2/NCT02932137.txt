      organs.Many feel that glucocorticoid and immunosuppressor are the standard therapy for
      patients with SLE. While it can improve the risk of infection among SLE patients. A novel
      therapy to treat SLE with low-does IL-2 has been identified recently. IL-2 also used to
      against some virus infect. So we hypothesized that low-dose IL-2 could reduce risk of
      infection in SLE patients.

      Methods: A total of SLE patients (n=30) were divided into two groups randomly. One received
      standard therapy, while another one administrate with low-does IL-2 plus standard
      therapy.Each patient will be treated with low-dose IL-2. The end points are clinical and
      immunologic response.

      Expected Results: This trail wlii provide both clinical and basic profe that low-dose IL-2
      plus standard therapy have lower infection risk in SLE patients.
