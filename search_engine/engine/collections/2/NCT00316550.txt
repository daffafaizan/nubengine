    
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to
      assess the effects of AV608 on brain processing of visceral stimuli and emotional visual cues
      in subjects with IBS. Female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age who meet diagnostic
      criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome will be eligible for the study.

      Eligible subjects will complete a baseline fMRI imaging procedure that includes both
      emotional visual cues and visceral stimulation. All subjects who participate in the study
      will receive 3 weeks of treatment with AV608 and 3 weeks of treatment with placebo during the
      course of the study; the order of the two treatments for each subject will be randomly
      determined.
