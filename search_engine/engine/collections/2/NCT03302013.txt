      to evaluate the early outcome of a Total Knee Replacement device that retains both cruciate
      (Vanguard XP) by comparing it with a control group of patients implanted with an established
      single cruciate retaining device (Vanguard CR). The study also aims to examine short and long
      term descriptive cohort outcome data. A small preference cohort group of 60 patients
      receiving the Vanguard XP Knee System will be recruited alongside the RCT group. This data
      will be used to confirm the external validity of the RCT group and to contribute to the
      safety data for the British Orthopaedic Association's Beyond Compliance Programme.

      Evaluation will include intra-operative and post-operative complications, longer term
      survivorship and patient reported outcome measures.
