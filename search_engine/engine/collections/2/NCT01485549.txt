    
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by
      a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic failure, and
      additional signs.

      No effective treatment is available. Together with PD and Lewy body dementia, MSA belongs to
      a group of neurodegenerative disorders, the alpha-synucleinopathies, which are characterized
      by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein.

      The development of biological markers for the diagnosis and prognosis in MSA remains an unmet
      need. Such biological markers are crucial for future disease-modification and neuroprotection
      trials. Alpha-synuclein has a high potential for biomarker development since it constitutes
      the pathological hallmark feature in MSA.

      The oligomeric alpha-synuclein seems to be particularly involved in abnormal protein
      aggregation in alpha-synucleinopathies.

      The study will compare alpha-synuclein levels in CSF and plasma between patients suffering
      from AMS and controls who are patients requiring spinal tap without being affected by a
      neurodegenerative disorder. The MSA patients and controls will receive CSF and blood sampling
      at one study visit.
