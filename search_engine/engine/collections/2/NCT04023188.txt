           Analysis of Photoplethysmographic Signals for Detecting Atrial Fibrillation.

        2. Study type: Investigator initiated study.

        3. Study design: Prospective observational cohort registry design.

        4. Sponsor: Sky Labs, Inc., Republic of Korea.

        5. The aim of the study: To evaluate diagnostic performance of a ring-type wearable device
           for detecting atrial fibrillation.

        6. Study period: From the date of IRB approval to 31th Dec. 2019.

        7. The size of study population: 200 participants

        8. The eligibility criteria:

      (1) Those with persistent atrial fibrillation (2) Those who admitted the institution for
      elective direct-current cardioversion (3) Those aged 19 years or more 9. The exclusion
      criteria:

      (1) Those with other forms of cardiac arrhythmias (2) Those aged less than 19 hears (3) Those
      who are not eligible to perform electrical cardioversion 10. Procedures of the study

        1. A participant is under the routine procedures of direct-current cardioversion.

        2. On admission, a participant is given with detailed information of the study.

        3. After the informed consent, the only additional procedure due to the study is recording
           photoplethysmographic signal by wearing a ring-type device.

        4. Recorded signals are evaluated without encompassing persornal information. 11. Financial
           benefits to the participants: None.
