    
      Chemotherapy-naïve patients high-intermediate TMB (TMB≥10 mutations/MB) and with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients will be selected.
      Enroled patientswill receive 1200 mg of atezolizumab and 15mg/Kg of Avastin® (bevacizumab)
      administered by IV infusion every 21 days (+/- 3 days).

      The treatment will start within 1-5 days from enrolment. Atezolizumab may continue beyond
      disease progression per RECIST v1.1 until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity,
      patient or physician decision to discontinue , or death. Bevacizumab will be administered
      until progression disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to
      discontinue or death.

      For all patients, tumour response data collection will continue until disease progression,
      even if the patient stops study treatment prior to disease progression.

      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of Atezolizumab in combination with
      Bevacizumab as measured by Progression Free Survival according to RECIST Version 1.1.

      PFS after enrolment is defined as the time from enrolment to the first occurrence of disease
      progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

      Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 1.5 years excluding a run-in-period of 46
      months. Treatment and follow-up are expected to extend the study duration to a total of 4.5
      years. Patients will be followed 1.5 years after the end of treatment independently of the
      cause of end of treatment. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.
