      tumors. II. Determine qualitative and quantitative toxicities of oral BIBX 1382 in these
      patients. III. Determine predictability, duration, intensity, onset, reversibility, and dose
      relationship of the toxicities of oral BIBX 1382 in these patients. IV. Determine safe and
      optimal doses of oral BIBX 1382 for a Phase II study. V. Assess the pharmacokinetics of oral
      BIBX 1382 in these patients. VI. Document any antitumor activity in these patients treated
      with oral BIBX 1382.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BIBX 1382 IV over 1 hour followed
      7 days later by oral BIBX 1382. Beginning 3 days later, patients receive oral BIBX 1382 daily
      for 28 days. Courses of daily oral BIBX 1382 repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      oral BIBX 1382. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which dose
      limiting toxicity occurs in at least 2 of 6 patients. Patients are followed for up to 4
      weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-80 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months.
