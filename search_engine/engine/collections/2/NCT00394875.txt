    
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) is a chronic, progressive illness which causes considerable
      morbidity and premature mortality.1-2 The worldwide prevalence of DM2 is high and is
      increasing steadily, also in The Netherlands.3-4 The burden of DM2 on health care has also
      increased because of the intensified cardiovascular risk management being practiced to
      prevent macrovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients.5 In the treatment of DM2,
      tight guidelines are increasingly recommended for optimizing glycaemia, blood pressure and
      lipid profile.6 Therefore, the burden of treatment has increased and will further increase
      per patient as well as per population with DM2. In order to meet this problem, we tested, in
      the current study, the hypothesis that well defined routine aspects in diabetes care,
      previously handled only by medical doctors in secondary care setting, may be safely
      transferred to supervised nurses specialized in diabetes (NSD), including the prescription of
      medication, resulting in at least the same quality of clinical care, health care costs,
      health related quality of life (HRQOL), and patient satisfaction.
