      literature a number need to be significative with a power of 80% and an Alpha risk at 5%, the
      inclusion of 160 patients for our primary analyze of p 22 phox. Those patients are included
      consequentially from the diabetic consultation of the university hospital of Grenoble, if
      they have a history of more than 20 years of diabetes. Those patients have been separated
      according to the existence of DN, and their polymorphism. Then we estimate with the Fisher
      test the prevalence of DN in risky patient, and the prevalence of the risky phenotype in the
      nephropathic patients. Then we investigate with the same statistical test the -429 T/C,he
      -374 T/A AGER and p.Arg261Gln 12 ALOX polymorphisms.
