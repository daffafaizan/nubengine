      study. Pre-assessment includes questionnaires related to stress, emotional labor, resilience,
      sleep, etc., and includes stress-related physiological measures using HRV, 2 lead EEG. After
      the pre-evaluation, the test group will conduct a counseling program with a psychologist for
      50 minutes at a time, once a week, for a total of 4 sessions (one month for a period). The
      place should be placed in a quiet place where the subject thinks comfortably and is
      designated as the same place to exclude the influence by the place, but the subject does not
      have to visit the hospital. In the offline counseling group, four counseling sessions are
      held with the psychologist off-line for a total of 4 counseling sessions, 50 minutes at a
      time, once a week after the same pre-evaluation. As a self-care control, counseling is not
      provided and self-learning materials are provided once a week.

      Mobile counseling group and offline counseling group visit the hospital within one week after
      termination and within 4 to 5 weeks after pre-evaluation in self-care control group. Also, to
      see if the effect of mobile counseling is continued even after counseling is completed, visit
      the counseling clinic one month after counseling is over and conduct the same test. The data
      obtained from this study showed that the mobile counseling program measured the change in the
      clinical scale and heart rate variability and EEG such as the stress and resilience of the
      subjects, and the self-care group using the offline counseling group and stress data and
      stress related psychological and physiological And compare the effects on the improvement of
