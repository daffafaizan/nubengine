      diseases. All samples are linked to annotated clinical data from approved consented
      protocols. This system provides researchers with high- quality biological samples and
      comprehensive clinical, pathological including molecular/genetic information for their
      research. This standardized CU-Med Biobank is a pivotal bridge to improve the translation of
      basic research into clinical applications. These findings will contribute to improve
      prevention, enhance diagnosis, develop new treatment and eventual cure of diseases.
