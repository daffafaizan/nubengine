      MEDI-517 given at 0, 30, and 180 days by intramuscular injection. The volunteers in this
      study will be healthy females 18 through 30 years of age. The study collects safety,
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity data of MEDI-517 with and without adjuvant. Extended
      follow-up will provide long-term immune response data.
