      facing a rise in the number of people who fall under WHO obesity class 2 and 3. Since severe
      obesity is characterized by large alterations in body compartments when compared to
      overweight or non-obese individuals, there is a need for the evaluation of the body
      composition of severely obese persons. There is very few published research available on what
      methods of body composition measurements can be used on this population.

      Other studies have also shown the tendency of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
      instruments to underestimate percentage of fat mass and overestimate the percentage of fat
      free nass, compared with gold-standard techniques. We think that plantar callosities might
      have contributed to the lack of accurate measurements. Thus, the primary aim of this study is
      to determine whether plantar callosities influence the validity of body composition
      measurements obtained by BIA, using the InBody 720. The secondary aim is to assess the
      validity of the body composition measurements obtained by BIA (InBody 720) in severely obese
      individuals, using air-displacement plethysmography (BodPod) as the gold standard.
      Additionally, we will explore various sources of error using test-retest reliabilities by
      measuring body composition with different arm postures. We will examine this further to rule
      out the possibility of "positions of measurement" as a potential confounder of this study.
