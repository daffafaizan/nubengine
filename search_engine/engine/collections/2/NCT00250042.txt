           cells with the t (9,22) (Ph) translocation, that encodes the constitutively active
           tyrosine kinase oncogene, bcr/abl. Patients with chronic phase CML are currently being
           treated with either hemopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or with the recently
           approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Previous data, using interferon in
           patients with CML, has shown that patients who do not achieve a major cytogenetic
           response (defined as >35% Ph+) have a shortened survival. These patients are often
           considered for HSCT. However, due to constraints of age, suitable donor, and patient
           choice, only a minority of patients will undergo this potentially curative procedure.

        -  The aim of this study is to create a uniform approach to the treatment of CML in New
           Mexico, with an aim of achieving complete cytogenetic response as the primary goal. A
           graded approach will be taken, starting out with the standard treatment (imatinib 400 mg
           per day), and then in patients identified as poor responders an imatinib, and arsenic
           combination will be offered to patients. It is hoped to find a complete cytogenetic
           response that exceeds the ~20% response with gleevec 800mg per day.
