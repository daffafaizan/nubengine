      vancomycin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and linezolid in children of bacterial
      meningitis with augmented renal clearance and assess dosage individualization feasibility. In
      this study, the investigator will detect drug concentration in both plasma and cerebrospinal
      fluid to construct population pharmacokinetics.
