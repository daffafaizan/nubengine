      safety and superiority of ablation procedure over antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Long
      term freedom from typical AFLT has been consistently shown after successful ablation, but up
      to 30% of these patients can experience new onset of a different arrhythmia i.e., Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF). AF results from triggers in the back of the left upper chamber in the
      heart (left atrium - LA). These triggers typically arise from in and around the opening of
      the 4 veins (pulmonary veins - PVs) that bring blood from the lungs into the heart. The
      highest incidence of AF in patients undergoing ablation for typical AFLT was observed where
      the follow-up duration exceeded a year after the AFLT ablation. This would suggest that AF
      development in patients undergoing typical AFLT ablation is progressive and inevitable.
