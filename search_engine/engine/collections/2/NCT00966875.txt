      conventional DMARD therapy. The study is a Phase 2 study with 2 parts. Part A is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging design and Part B
      is an optional, open-label extension design. Two participant populations will be evaluated in
      this study: bDMARD-naive participants and TNFα-IR participants. Participants in Part A
      receive multiple subcutaneous injections of LY2439821 [bDMARD-naive participants: 0
      (placebo), 3, 10, 30, 80, or 180 mg; TNFα-IR participants: 0 (placebo), 80 or 180 mg] at
      Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Participants in Part B receive subcutaneous injections of
      LY2439821 160 mg at Weeks 16, 18, and 20, and every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 60.
      Participants who complete both Part A and B have a total study participation of up to
      approximately 72 to 84 weeks.
