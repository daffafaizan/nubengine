      study was calculated based on the recommendations for sample size calculations for cluster
      randomized controlled trials with fixed number of clusters, by using STATA. The following
      assumptions were considered: to detect an increase of postnatal care three utilization from
      16% to 28% from previous study, number of clusters available-30, with 95% confidence interval
      and 80% power, intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.04849 from similar studies, 15
      clusters per arm. The sample size was calculated to determine number of observations required
      per cluster, for two-sample comparison of proportions (using normal approximation), Assuming
      individual randomization, sample size per arm is 194. Then allowing for cluster
      randomization, average cluster size required is 40, and the final sample size is 1200
      pregnant mothers (600 in intervention, and 600 in control). Data analysis will take place in
      two levels (cluster and individual). Risk ration will be computed at cluster level, and the
      results of this cluster summary will be compared using t-test. Primary and secondary outcomes
      will be compared between intervention and control groups with random effects logistic
      regression models, taking account of clustering.
