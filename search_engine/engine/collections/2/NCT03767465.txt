      antiretroviral therapy (ART) is unable to cure HIV infection. Recent work has suggested that
      the expression of immune checkpoint markers, such as the programmed death-1 (PD1) or the
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTL-4), may play a role in viral persistence on ART via
      either suppression of virus transcription and/or reduced HIV-specific T cell activity, but
      the in vivo role of immune checkpoint markers in HIV persistence on ART is not clear.

      Immunological checkpoint inhibitors are humanized monoclonal Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
      antibodies directed against several cell surface receptors, including PD-1 that inhibits
      binding of PD-1, expressed on activated T cells to its ligands PD-L1, overexpressed on
      certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on antigen presenting cells.
      Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion
      from host immunity antigen presenting cells. Immunological checkpoint inhibitors can also
      target CTL-4, which is constitutively expressed in Treg cells but only upregulated in
      conventional T cells after activation, a phenomenon which is particularly notable in cancers.
      These drugs are used to treat oncology diseases, including metastatic melanoma, and have been
      associated with multiple changes in immune function thought to enhance antitumor T cell
      function.

      This exploratory study will include HIV-infected subjects with advanced melanoma or other
      oncological conditions in which the use of immunological checkpoint inhibitors is clinically
      indicated. The study is conceptually observational as the patients will be in regular
      clinical treatment with immunological checkpoint inhibitors for oncological conditions.
