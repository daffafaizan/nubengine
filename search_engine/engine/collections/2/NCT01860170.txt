      bortezomib after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantationin in the setting of
      matched related or unrelated donor transplantation using a standard reduced-intensity
      conditioning regimen is feasible.

      The study is a phase I study. The primary objective of the study is to determine the
      feasibility and safety of increasing doses of bortezomib administered post-transplant in
      conjunction with fixed high dose cyclophosphamide, also administered post-transplant in the
      setting of reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as GVHD
      prophylaxis strategy. Eligible patients will receive a conditioning regimen based on a
      combination of fludarabine and busulfan with or without rATG.
