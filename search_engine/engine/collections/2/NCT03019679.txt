      diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction, which is known to be
      an early marker of atherosclerosis, has also been shown to have an association with poycystic
      ovary syndrome. In this study the investigators aimed to investigate whether there is a
      relation between polycystic ovary syndrome and serum endocan levels. For this purpose the
      investigators designed a prospective study including two groups. The diagnosis of polycystic
      ovary syndrome was made in the presence of ;oligo- and/or anovulation,clinical
      hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. Clinical hyperandrogenism was defined by the
      presence of hirsutism , acne, or the presence of androgenic alopecia, body mass index (BMI)
      was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The two
      groups are compared considering their serum endocan levels,follicle stimulating hormone
      (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), Dihydroepiandesterone sulphate (DHEAS), total testesterone
      (TT), estradiol (E2) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), fasting blood glucose,
      triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.
