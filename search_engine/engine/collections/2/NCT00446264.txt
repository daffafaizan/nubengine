      controlling glucose homeostasis while limiting or even avoiding the nedd for exogenous
      insulin has been established despite protocol modifications in donor selection, islet
      preparation or recipient treatment, insulin independence with adequate metabolic control was
      however rarely prolonged beyond two years. The most frequently proposed explanations include
      chronic allogenic rejection, recurrence of autoimmunity and beta cell toxicity from
      administered immunosuppressive drugs.

      Fourteen patients were enrolled in this single center phase 2 trial initiated in 2003.
      Eligible patients were males or females between 18 and 65 years of age, with type 1 diabeted
      documented for more than 5 years, arginine stimulated C-peptide lower than 0.2ng/ml, and
      hypoglycemia awareness or documented metabolic lability. Exclusion criteria included body
      mass index greater than 28Kg/m2, unstable arteriopathy or heart disease, active infection,
      previous transplantation, insulin daily requirements above 1.2 UI/kg, creatinin clearance
      below 60 ml/mn/m2 or urinary albumin excretion above 300 mg/day, malignancy, smoking, desire
      for pregnancy, psychiatric disorders and lack of compliance. The study primary efficacy
      endpoint was graft survival defined as insulin independence and HbA1c<6.5%. Secondary
      outcomes were graft function and metabolic control.
