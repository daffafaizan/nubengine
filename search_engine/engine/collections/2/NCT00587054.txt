      your body, and to reduce the side effects of a transplant, which we have seen in our previous
      studies, (2) to see if this treatment with a new recipe of radiation and chemotherapy can
      suppress your immune system enough for the stem cells to 'take' and grow, (3) to see if the
      specially prepared stem cells can grow in you without a problem called graft-versus-host
      disease (GvHD) occurring.

      One of the major side effects of any stem cell transplant is a condition known as graft vs.
      host disease or GVHD. GVHD is an immune reaction caused by certain cells from the
      transplanted stem cells called T-lymphocytes (or T-cells). The T-cells from your donor may
      see your organs as foreign and attack them. New ways to remove the T-cells from the stem
      cells before the transplant are being used to try and prevent GVHD. In some studies, the
      removal of T-cells from the stem cells has been successful for many patients in preventing
      both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) forms of GVHD. However, the removal of
      T-cells may increase the chance that the new bone marrow developing from the stem cells will
      be rejected or will not function well. Rejection of the transplant means that some of your
      own cells have survived the chemo and radiation therapy, and are attacking the new bone
      marrow cells. This condition can be lifethreatening because of an increased risk of
      infections and bleeding and would require your getting more treatment and additional stem
      cells. Studies like this one are designed to find better ways to avoid GVHD without
      increasing the risk of other problems such as graft rejection.
