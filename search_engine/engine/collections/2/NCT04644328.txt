      Harvard and Lynn Community health center doctors (6 people in all) to approximately
      20,000,000 Facebook users. The ads will be shown before the Thanksgiving holiday and will
      focus on staying safe - limiting travel, social distancing and mask-wearing. The
      investigators will randomize exposure to the ad campaign at the ZIP code or county level to
      ask:

      Do the videos change mobility and Thanksgiving holiday travel? Do they reduce the spread of
      COVID-19?

      Are there spillover impacts from the video messages? For example, if individuals decide to
      stay home, then do the geographical regions that tend to be visited by people from treated
      areas experience any effects, either through information spillovers or through a reduction in
      travel?
