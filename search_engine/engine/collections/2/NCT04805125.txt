    
      This study is to set up a flexible trial platform using two existing national cohorts of
      immunocompromised patients (i.e. Swiss HIV Cohort Study [SHCS] and Swiss Transplant Cohort
      Study [STCS]) to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of approved SARS-CoV-2
      vaccines in immunocompromised patients. Nesting this trial into cohorts with highly
      standardized data collection allows for a rapid, efficient and cost-saving trial conduct.

      This platform will be tested in the frame of a pilot trial and a framework will be set up to
      conduct a larger, flexible, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test approved SARS-CoV-2
      vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.

      The pilot study will primarily assess the functionality of the trial platform and early
      immunogenicity, efficacy and safety data. At a later stage, the platform might also be used
      to enlarge the pilot trial or to develop sub-protocols to deal with patients with no or
      insufficient immune response to Sars-CoV-2 vaccines.

      Since January 12, 2021 two mRNA vaccines against Sars-CoV-2 by Pfizer / BioNTech (Comirnaty速)
      and COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Moderna速 by Moderna have been licensed in Switzerland and roll-out
      of vaccines has started

      The first sub-protocol for a pilot trial is to investigate the operability of a platform
      trial that is nested into two existing cohort studies and compare immune response, safety and
      clinical efficacy of the first two mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty速 by Pfizer / BioNTech and
      COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Moderna速, by Moderna) in immune compromised patients in the Swiss HIV
      and Swiss Transplant Cohort studies.
