    
      SYR-322 (alogliptin) is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl
      peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones
      released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. It is expected that inhibition of dipeptidyl
      peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus by prolonging the beneficial effects of glucagon-like peptide-1.

      The rising incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the limitations of the currently
      available treatments suggest the need for new therapies for glycemic control. Studies have
      been undertaken in humans that evaluated the effects of directly augmenting glucagon-like
      peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide levels and of inhibiting the activity
      of dipeptidyl peptidase IV.

      This study is an extension of 7 controlled phase 3 studies of alogliptin. These phase 3
      studies included 1 monotherapy study of alogliptin (SYR-322-PLC-010; NCT00286455); 4
      placebo-controlled add-on studies of alogliptin, namely in combination with a sulfonylurea
      (SYR-322-SULF-007; NCT00286468), metformin (SYR-322-MET-008; NCT00286442), a
      thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone; SYR-322-TZD-009; NCT00286494), and insulin (SYR-322-INS-011;
      NCT00286429); 1 coadministration study with pioglitazone in combination with metformin
      (01-05-TL-322OPI-001; NCT00328627), and 1 coadministration study with pioglitazone
      (01-06-TL-322OPI-002; NCT00395512).

      The end of treatment or early withdrawal visit from the preceding study will be the screening
      visit for this study, after which enrolled patients will be required to commit to
      approximately 22 additional visits at the study center.
