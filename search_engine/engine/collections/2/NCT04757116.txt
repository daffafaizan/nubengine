      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This
      surgery has proven to have high efficacy with regards to improving objective and subjective
      parameters, however it is associated with significant morbidity, lengthy recovery period and
      long-term complications. The iTind is a minimally invasive temporary device designed to
      relieve LUTS secondary to BPH. This study is designed to compare the minimally invasive iTind
      device to TURP.
