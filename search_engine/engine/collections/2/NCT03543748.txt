    
      Primary Outcome Measures:

      TMS stimulation applied to the left DLPFC has a quantifiable effect on cognition [ Time
      Frame: Neuropsychological Assessments: Baseline（7days after STA-MCA bypass surgery）; 2 months
      after TMS treatment Changes in one or more assessed cognitive domains at baseline will be
      measured by comparing the scores for the different neuropsychological tests.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      Change in structural grey and white matter in the brain at baseline compared to after TMS
      stimulation [ Time Frame: MRI: Baseline and two months after TMS stimulation ] MRI analysis
      will measure any changes in cortical thickness (mm) or other structural changes in the brain
      after TMS or Sham-TMS stimulation

      Change in executive functioning measured as resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) sequence [
      Time Frame: MRI: Baseline and two months after TMS stimulation ] fMRI analysis will measure
      any changes in amplitude of low frequency fluctuation(ALFF) and other functional changes
      after TMS stimulation compared to baseline.
