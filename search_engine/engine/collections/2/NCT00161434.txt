      spread of HIV, as their presence is associated with higher rates of HIV acquisition in
      susceptible individuals. Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) is a major cause of GUD in developed
      and developing countries.

      The primary objective of this research study is to assess if daily valacyclovir therapy for
      suppression of HSV-2 reactivation is associated with a decrease in mucosal HIV shedding in
      individuals co-infected with both HSV-2 and HIV.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Sixty men who
      have sex with men (MSM) will be randomized to first receive either valacyclovir, 1 gram once
      a day, or matching placebo for 8 weeks. After a 2-week washout period during which all
      participants receive placebo, subjects then switch to the other treatment for the next 8
      weeks.

      At screening, informed consent is obtained and individuals will have blood drawn to test
      antibody status to HIV and HSV and well as to monitor CD4 count and plasma HIV RNA
      determination. At enrollment, oral, genital, and rectal specimens are obtained and additional
      blood is drawn. Participants are given a two-week supply of study medication and are
      instructed on the technique of collecting daily home samples and completing a diary.
      Following enrollment, they are asked to collect daily home oral and genital samples, as well
      as semen samples twice a week, for the full 18 weeks of the study. Participants return to the
      clinic three times per week for follow-up, for collection of oral and rectal specimens, and
      additional study medication. Rectal Biopsy is performed at weeks 8 and 18 for those
      individuals that signed the additional rectal biopsy consent form.
