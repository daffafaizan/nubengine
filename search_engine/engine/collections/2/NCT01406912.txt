      users to interact in three dimensions with a computer-generated scenario (a virtual world).
      In particular, the Nintendo Wii gaming system applies relevant concepts in rehabilitation
      (i.e. repetition, intensity, and task-oriented training of the paretic extremity) showing
      benefits in motor function improvement after stroke. While standard rehabilitation (i.e.
      physiotherapy and occupational therapy) helps improve motor function after stroke, the
      magnitude of its benefit is suboptimal. The implementation of conventional rehabilitation is
      resource-intensive and costly, usually requiring transportation of patients and affecting
      adherence. Moreover, as improvement of motor function may be achieved after multiple sessions
      over a period of rehabilitation. The duration and intensity of the rehabilitation strategy
      are important factors in its effectiveness. Some studies compared an intervention plus
      conventional physical therapy versus conventional physical therapy alone, which by necessity
      allowed for more rehabilitation time in the experimental group. This creates a bias in favour
      of the new intervention as the intensity and frequency of rehabilitation per se is known to
      directly and beneficially affect functional outcomes. Therefore, the investigators are
      proposing comparing VR Wii versus an active control [(recreational activities (RA)].
