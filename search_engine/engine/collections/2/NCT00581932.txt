    
      Patients age 18-65 with a DSM IV diagnosis of schizophrenia who have a history of nonresponse
      to conventional atypical antipsychotics and who are to be treated with clozapine by their
      psychiatrist, will be asked to participate at or near the time clozapine therapy is
      initiated. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative
      Symptoms (SANS), and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) will be
      performed on all subjects at entry into the study, at 3 weeks, 5 weeks, 8 weeks, and at 4 and
      6 months. Adverse effects will be monitored with the Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia
      scale and the AIMS at each of these time points. The Calgary Depression Scale will also be
      administered at each visit. A complete neurocognitive assessment battery will be completed at
      entry and at 6 months for those subjects willing to undergo neurocognitive testing. It is
      anticipated not all subjects will complete neurocognitive testing. A blood or cheek swab
      sample will be collected at study entry for DNA analysis. Plasma blood levels will be
      collected at weeks 3, 5, 8 and study completion for measurement of clozapine plasma
      concentrations. The subject's weight, BMI, smoking status and concomitant medications will be
      recorded at each visit.
