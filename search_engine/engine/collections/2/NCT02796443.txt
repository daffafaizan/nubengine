      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and population based studies are in favor of an early
      operation in acute cholecystitis (1, 2). Thus, one of the largest RCT so far, demonstrated
      significant more complications in a group of delayed cholecystectomy. The main problems in
      these studies are the exclusion criteria used, ie severe cases are not considered.

      Objective:

      In a cohort study all cholecystectomy patients are analysed to demonstrate that delayed
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) in a real world setting has a less complication rate than
      early cholecystectomy (ELC).

      Setting:

      Academic Teaching Hospital with 400 beds, seven departments (anesthesiology and intensive
      care medicine, orthopaedics and trauma surgery, visceral and thoracic surgery,
      gastroenterology, cardiology, gynecology and obstetrics, psychiatry. The visceral and
      thoracic department has a main focus on minimally invasive techniques.

      Participants:

      All cholecystectomy patients during 1/2006 and 9/2015

      Variables:

      Clavien Dindo Complication score, American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) Score,
      conversion rate, onset of symptoms, histology, hospital stay

      Data sources:
