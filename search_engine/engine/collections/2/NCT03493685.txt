    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel, active-control study.
      Approximately 300 patients aged 8 to 75 years (inclusive) will be enrolled in the study. The
      study will be conducted in approximately 300 study centers, globally. The investigational
      drug (sparsentan) is a dual-acting angiotensin receptor blocker and endothelin receptor
      antagonist. The active control is irbesartan. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will
      require washout from renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, if applicable
      prior to their first dose of study drug.

      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sparsentan or active
      control (irbesartan).

      After completing the double-blind portion of the study, patients may participate in the
      open-label extension for treatment with sparsentan if they meet eligibility criteria.
