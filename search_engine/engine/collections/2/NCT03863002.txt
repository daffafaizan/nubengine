      a serious live-threatening disease. Currently, the clinical management, such as liver
      protection, anti-virus medicine, and artificial liver support, has not significantly improve
      the outcomes, the mortality still remains over 50%. Liver transplantation is the only
      effective treatment of ACLF, but this therapy is limited by the shortage of donor organs,
      potential surgical complications, immunological rejection and high medical costs. Mesenchymal
      stem cell (MSC) is one of adult stem cells, which has been suggested to play a role in
      amelioration of liver disease, such as: trans-differentiation of MSCs into hepatocytes,
      immunomodulation, inhibition of fibrosis development, protective effects on hepatic cell and
      restoration of hepatic cell proliferation capacity.
