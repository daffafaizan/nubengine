    
      Primary Aim: To determine how blood flow restriction to the lower extremities using
      non-pneumatic anti-shock garments affects hemodynamic and cardiovascular parameters such as
      blood pressure in Hemodialysis (HD) patients while they are not on dialysis.

      Investigators propose a pilot study to assess the effects of blood flow restriction using
      non-pneumatic anti-shock garments in HD patients while they are not on dialysis.

      Outcomes: The primary objective will be a measurement of blood pressure upon application of
      the non-pneumatic anti-shock garments.

      Secondary outcomes will include the following: baroreflex sensitivity; trends in beat-to-beat
      blood pressure upon application of the anti-shock garments; patient tolerability of the
      non-pneumatic anti-shock garments, ejection fraction via echocardiogram analyses.
