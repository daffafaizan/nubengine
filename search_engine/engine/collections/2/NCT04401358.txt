      study. End stage renal disease patients who haven't been under hemodialysis will be screened
      for enrollment at the nephrology department in National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients
      have to be over 20 years old who are diagnosed with end stage renal
      disease(eGFR<15ml/min/1.73m2) but haven't been under hemodialysis yet. Expected 85 patients
      will be enrolled according to power analysis, those who have the diseases such as Parkinson's
      disease, hypothyroidism, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, under chemotherapy or radiotherapy, history of
      head and neck tumour and surgery, and patients who unable to response to evaluate protocal.

      We will first use Montreal Cognitive Assessment to screen patient's cognitive function, for
      those scored 23.5 and higher, a full evaluation will be conducted at two points in before
      dialysis and afterward. The full evaluation before dialysis include 1.The difference of
      smell, taste, salivary secretion, oral assessment guide, plaque index and xerostomia on end
      stage renal disease patients before and after hemodialysis. 2.Investigating the reliability
      of olfactory identification by using Sniffin'sticks within 2 to 4 hours. 3.Investigating the
      correlation between taste questionnaire and taste strips. 4.Salivary flow rate. 5.Oral
      Assessment Guide. 6.Plaque Index. 7.Taste threshold sensitivity.

      The evaluation after dialysis involved 1.The olfactory identification 2. Salivary flow 3.
      Taste threshold sensitivity.For patients who get score lower than 23.5 from Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment, we'll skip the test of olfactory and taste .Data will be analyzed with
      descriptive and inferential statistics using R studio statistic software.
