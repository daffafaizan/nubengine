      junctional epithelium continues to present a serious therapeutic challenge. The concept of
      laser deepithelialization to retard epithelial migration has enabled new attachment formation
      in periodontal pockets. Based on this hypothesis, that laser deepithelialization during root
      coverage procedures will enhance clinical outcome, a split mouth randomized controlled
      clinical trial was planned to compare the clinical outcome of Coronally advanced flap (CAF) +
      subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) alone and in combination with laser
      de-epithelialization in the treatment of gingival recession.

      METHOD:

      In a split-mouth study, 20 patients presenting at least one pair of bilaterally symmetrical
      Miller's Class I and Class II buccal gingival recessions will be selected. Control site will
      receive coronally advanced flap with connective tissue graft and test site will receive laser
      deepithelialization as an adjunct to coronally advanced flap with connective tissue graft.
      Gingival recession depth (GRD), Gingival recession width (GRW), Probing depth (PD), Clinical
      attachment level (CAL), Keratinized tissue width (KTW), Plaque index (PI), Gingival index
      (GI), Gingival bleeding index (GBI) will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6
      months after treatment. The root coverage outcomes were also assessed by photogrammetric
      analysis.
