      trabeculectomy (trab) or phaco-trabeculectomy (phaco-trab) are included in this study between
      January and December 2017. The study interventions takes place 6 months after surgery and
      include examination of refraction, biometry and corneal topography in order to assess the
      patient's astigmatism. The values are compared to the preoperative baseline values, which are
      available from patient records.
