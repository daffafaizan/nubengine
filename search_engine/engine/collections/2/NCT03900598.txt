      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common subtype of NHL, accounting for 30 percent
      (%) to 40% of all newly diagnosed cases. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma
      translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a key mediator of the nuclear factor
      kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway and has been
      shown to play a critical role in different types of lymphoma, including activated B cell-like
      (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). JNJ-67856633 is a MALT1 inhibitor and
      will be administered orally. The study will evaluate the following: Dose Escalation (Part 1):
      One or more recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2Ds) of JNJ-67856633. Cohort Expansion (Part 2):
      JNJ-67856633 is well tolerated and achieves antitumor responses at the RP2D. The study
      consists of screening phase (less than or equal to 28 days before first dose), treatment
      phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 till end of treatment visit [within 30 (+7) days after the last
      dose]) and post-treatment phase. A prescreening period may also apply to participants in
      select cohorts in Part 2. The total study duration will be approximately 3 years. Efficacy
      assessments will include radiographic image assessments, positron emission tomography scan,
      bone marrow assessment, endoscopy or colonoscopy etc. Safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
