      DA products (Medtronic HawkOne® and TurboHawkM)19-21 and FDA approved drug-coated balloon
      (Medtronic IN.PACT® Admiral®)22 used in combination to debulk moderate and severely calcified
      femoropopliteal artery atherosclerotic lesions as defined by the published Peripheral
      Arterial Calcium Scoring System (PACSS) followed by treatment with the Medtronic IN.PACT®
      Admiral® DCB for the prevention of restenosis as assessed at 12-month follow-up. The data
      will be independently adjudicated by an angiographic and DUS core labs. An independent IVUS
      core lab to determine change in maximal luminal plaque area, pre- and post-atherectomy and
      post-adjunctive DCB therapy will adjudicate the assessment of debulking effectiveness. The
      operator will be blinded to all IVUS images and procedural success will be based on usual and
      customary angiographic visual assessments. The post-atherectomy plaque debulking
      effectiveness (change in plaque area) and vascular calcium severity as assessed by IVUS will
      be correlated with the angiographic metrics of RVD, pre- and post-treatment MLD, calcium
      grade (using PACSS), lesion length, sub-intimal wire passage, CTO length, and angiographic
      patterns of restenosis in all patients who sustain a CD-TLR through 12-months. All
      atherectomy specimens will be collected and provided to an independent histology laboratory
      for analysis of calcium content and vessel wall elements. The amount of embolic debris
      captured in the Spider® Distal Protection Device will be visually assessed. The study will
      validate PACSS definitions of moderate and severe calcium and its location (intimal, medial
      or mixed) as they relate to intra-procedural and Major Adverse Events (MAEs) through 30-day
      clinical follow-up (e.g., grade D-F dissections requiring provisional stenting, vessel
      perforation requiring an additional intervention or surgery, vessel thrombosis requiring
      adjunctive technologies and/or lytic agents, unplanned amputation, intra-procedure distal
      embolization, and CD-TLR).
