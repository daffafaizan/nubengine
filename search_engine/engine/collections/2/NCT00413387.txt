    
      Asthma is a chronic disease that is estimated to affect over 25 million people both in the
      U.S. and in Europe (i.e. approximately 10% of the total population). Pharmacological therapy
      is used to treat reversible airway obstruction, inflammation and hyper-reactivity.
      Medications include preventive treatments in forms of antinflammatory/antiallergic agents
      (i.e. glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, cromolyn sodium) and reliever
      treatments, in forms of bronchodilators (i.e. β-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics). In
      patients treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids whose asthma is not fully controlled,
      national and international guidelines recommend a stepwise approach. Recent evidence-based
      clinical trials show that the addition of a LABA to inhaled glucocorticosteroids is more
      beneficial in terms of asthma control than increasing the dose of corticosteroids alone.
