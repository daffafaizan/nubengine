      synovitis, who were recruited into protocol 94-AR-0194 (The Pathogenesis of Inflammatory
      Synovitis: A Study of Early Arthritis). Clinical, radiographic, and functional outcome
      parameters, particularly those relating to articular damage and functional loss, will be
      evaluated and related back to clinical, serologic, immunogenetic, and pathologic variables
      identified at the onset of the arthropathy. A model will be generated which incorporates and
      weighs the variables in order to determine diagnostic and prognostic markers in the early
      stages of arthritis. Synovial tissue samples have been obtained from the entire cohort at the
      initial visit of protocol 94-AR-0194. Studies of these biopsies have so far demonstrated
      evidence for the presence of infectious agents in a proportion of the samples, and have
      generated information regarding the cytokine profiles in the early stages of synovitis. In an
      attempt to further define the pathogenetic mechanisms of synovitis longitudinally, biopsies
      will be repeated on selected subsets of the cohort. Specific questions to be answered relate
      to the persistence of microbial agents in the synovium, and to the evolution of cellular and
      molecular mechanisms which mediate the invasive, destructive potential of the synovial
      lesion. It is anticipated that these studies should prove valuable to clinicians who are
      attempting to stratify patients for therapeutic strategies, early in their disease course.
      They should also prove valuable in enhancing the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms
      of synovitis.
