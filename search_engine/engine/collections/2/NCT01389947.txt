      extracorporeal circulation support during intervention. Extracorporeal circulation result in
      SIRS. We aim to study digestive tract during this intervention.

      There are 5 times of measurements : under stable hemodynamic conditions and after beginning
      of anesthesia, just at the end of extracorporeal circulation, about 15 minutes following
      aortic unclamping and at the end of the Protamine perfusion, about 90 minutes after the end
      of extracorporeal circulation and the last time measurement 24 hours later.

      At each time measurement are done : blood samples to measure Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding
      Protein, Citrullinemia that are markers for digestive suffering ; blood samples for
      measurement of Syndecan 1 CD 138 and Heparan Sulfate, two markers of shedding of the
      endothelial glycocalyx; blood samples for measurement of NOx and GMPc to assess the NO
      pathway ; measurement of tissular oxygen saturation with a NIRS probe, before, during and
      after a vascular occlusion test of 3 minutes. Blood samples for hemoglobin, platelets,
      coagulation evaluation, urea, creatininemia, liver enzymes and pancreatic enzymes will be
      done at each time.

      The vascular occlusion test is done the day before the surgery when patient is awake without
      any exercise. This is a reference measurement.
