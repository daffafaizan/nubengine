    
      Study design - This is a clinical study Phase I, randomized, double blind with 60
      individuals. 30 individuals will receive the experimental vaccine by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz
      and 30 individuals will receive a meningococcal C conjugated vaccine used in the National
      Immunization Program.

      Location of Study - Clinical Trials Unit for Immunobiology by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz.

      Primary objective - Evaluate the safety of the meningococcal C vaccine by
      Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz for use in humans.

      Secondary objective - To evaluate the immunogenicity of the meningococcal C vaccine by
      Bio-Manguinhos in young adults.

      specific objectives

        1. To evaluate the frequency / intensity of adverse events occurring up to 30 days after
           vaccination.

        2. To evaluate the seroconversion defined as pre-immunization serum nonreactive (negative)
           and post-immunization reactor (positive) antigens, with getting titles 8 (rabbit
           complement) to the target strain used in the test of bactericidal power of the sera from
           immunized volunteers, a 4-fold increase in titers following vaccination compared to
           pre-vaccination and antibody titers after immunization.
