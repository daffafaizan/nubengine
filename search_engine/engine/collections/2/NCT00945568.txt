      energy malnutrition. A limited number of studies have indicated an important role for
      nutritional support in the surgical management of patients who have undergone hepatic
      resection for HCC. In a preliminary study, we reported the clinical efficacy of
      supplementation with branched-chain amino acids in a small number of patients with liver
      cirrhosis who underwent hepatic surgery for HCC. The aims of this study are (1) to study the
      benefit of branched-chain amino acids enriched nutrient-mixture by analyzing a variety of
      clinical parameter, including laboratory data, the duration of hospitalization after the
      surgery, and (2) To investigate the postoperative QOL in receiving peri-operatively
      branched-chain amino acids enriched nutrient-mixture in patients who undergone the hepatic
      management for HCC with chronic liver disease.
