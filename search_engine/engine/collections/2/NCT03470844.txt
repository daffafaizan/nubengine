      to assess for functional brain reorganisation, structural changes and long-term cognitive
      dysfunction following major burns injury and intensive care admission. The hypothesis is that
      following a major burns injury and intensive care admission patients will have neurocognitive
      dysfunction and demonstrable functional alterations seen on functional MRI due to
      neuroinflammation as a result of the primary injury and subsequent inflammatory insults.
