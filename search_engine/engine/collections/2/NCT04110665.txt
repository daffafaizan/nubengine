      used for pain relief after ambulatory surgery. Tramadol achieves pain relief when rescue
      analgesia is needed after this surgery, but induces side effects (nausea, vomiting,
      discomfort, sleep disorder...). Other drugs could be used to reduce the side effects of
      tramadol and improve postoperative experience : nefopam or opioid (immediate or delayed
      release medication). Using a survey that describes pain, comfort, emotion or physical status
      (QoR 40), the investigators analyse the impact of various multimodal strategies using
      tramadol or nefopam or opioid that is necessary to improve postoperative experience.
