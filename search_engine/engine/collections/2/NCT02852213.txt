    
      The Study will specifically address:

        -  Safety, as measured by adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory tests, brain imaging, and
           the relationship of AEs to study/surgical procedures or to AAV2 hAADC.

        -  Clinical responses to treatment with AAV2-hAADC. The primary clinical outcomes will
           reflect the predominant motor deficits of loss of motor function and dystonic movements.

      Primary Endpoints Safety: Assessment of AE or severe AE (SAE) and its relationship to study
      surgery, infusion, or treatment effect (graded as definite, probable, possible, unlikely or
      unrelated).

        -  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events

        -  Post-operative MRI and/or CT (with contrast if clinically indicated)

        -  Clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, immunology) Biological Activity:
           Demonstration of effective restoration of AADC function by assays of cerebrospinal fluid
           (CSF) neurotransmitter metabolites and 18-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (F-DOPA)
           positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

      Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints To obtain preliminary data for clinical response by
      assessing the magnitude and variability of changes in specific outcomes.

      The principal clinical outcome measures are:

        -  Motor function, as assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88)

        -  Frequency of oculogyric episodes, as measured by a Symptom Diary

      Secondary clinical outcome measures include:

      â€¢ Assessment of subject disability, as assessed using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability
      Inventory (PEDI); adaptive behavior, as assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale;
      Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGI-C); and quality of life, as determined using the
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL).

      Although the investigators recognize that the utility of established developmental and
      cognitive assessments may be limited because of the study population's severe physical
      disability, the investigators will use the following:

        -  Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2nd edition (PDMS-2)

        -  Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd edition.
