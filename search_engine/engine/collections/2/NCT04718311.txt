      ointment 0.1% or a mouthwash composed of calcium hydroxide 10%, hyaluronic acid 0,3%,
      umbelliferone and oligomeric proanthocyanidins, or an anti-inflammatory mouthwash (mouthwash
      which contains calcium hydroxide, hyaluronic acid, Umbelliferone and Oligomeric
      Proanthocyanidins) for 3-months. At baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1), patients were
      subjected to clinical and oral assessments and were evaluated for the symptoms (Numerical
      Pain Scale, NRS score) and signs (Thongprasom's score) of OLP. Data were calculated using
      T-test for the dependent variable, Wilcoxon test and Mann-Witney u test.
