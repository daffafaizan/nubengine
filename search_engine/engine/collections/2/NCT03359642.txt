      inflammatory bowel diseases patients (10 Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis (UC), in
      which a first anti-TNF alpha treatment is indicated. At D0 and M3, intestinal microbiota will
      be studied by DNA16S sequencing and qPCR, via a stool sampling. Volatile Organic Compounds
      (VOCs) profile will be obtained by mass spectrometry. Blood lymphocytes profile will be
      obtained by flux cytometry. In addition, a colonoscopy will be performed at D0 for UC
      patients, with an endoscopic and histological assessment. A second short colonoscopy will be
      performed for UC patients at M3. At each time, clinical assessment will be performed.

      A mirror group of 10 spondyloarthritis and 20 inflammatory bowel diseases patients (10
      Crohn's disease and 10 ulcerative colitis), in which an "all but anti-TNF alpha or
      biotherapy" treatment is indicated will be included to distinguish the specific effects on
      microbiota of anti-TNF alpha.

      12 patients by group will be included at M0 by anticipating that some patients will stop
      their treatment between M0 and M3, and consequently will be excluded from M3 sampling and
      from final analysis. Final analysis will be performed on 10 patients by group.
