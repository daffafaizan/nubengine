      extracorporeal hemofiltration circuit. LMWH accumulate in patients with chronic renal
      failure. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) is a renal replacement modality for
      intensive care patients with acute renal failure. Up to now it is not known whether
      nadroparin is removed by hemofiltration or not. If not, accumulation is expected and the risk
      of bleeding for the patient increases. Because critically ill patients are at increased risk
      of bleeding, this question is crucial.

      If nadroparin would be removed by filtration, removal is expected to depend on hemofiltration
      dose (to be greater with a higher dose)

      We therefore designed a randomized controlled cross-over trial in the setting of critical
      illness and acute renal failure comparing the anticoagulant effect of nadroparin (anti-Xa)
      between two doses of CVVH in the patients blood, in the extracorporeal circuit and in the
      ultrafiltrate.

      Because hemostasis in critically ill patients is not only influenced by anticoagulation but
      also by the critical illness and the extracorporeal circuit, we also measure other hemostatic
      markers, especially the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), which seems the most global
      marker of hemostasis, incorporating procoagulant and anticoagulant effects.
