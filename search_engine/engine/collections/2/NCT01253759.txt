      or medium-sized choroidal melanomas were treated with i-TTT using infrared light delivered
      from a diode laser. All patients were evaluated to rule out systemic metastasis and underwent
      a complete ophthalmological evaluation including: Slit lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus
      examination, Fluorescein angiography, Optical coherence tomography and A/B ultrasonography.
      Main outcome measures were: Changes in visual acuity, complications associated with the
      treatment and local control of the tumor.
