      I. To assess the efficacy, feasibility and safety of administering most closely human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
      (HMC-CTLs) generated by "gamma-catch" to mediate antiviral activity in hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients with CMV infections.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the persistency of the administered HMC-CTLs generated by "gamma-catch" and
      their contribution immune reconstitution.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes intravenously
      (IV). Patients with partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease may receive an
      additional dose of allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes at a minimum
      of 2 weeks from the first infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months.
