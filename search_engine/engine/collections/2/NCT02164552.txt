    
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common complex and heterogenous endocrine disorder. It
      affects â‰¤10% of women of reproductive age, with approximately 16%-80% of the affected women
      being obese. Polycystic ovary syndrome frequently is associated with insulin resistance (IR)
      accompanied by compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and IR is aggravated by the interaction between
      obesity and the syndrome. Moreover, the contribution of body mass and/or body fat
      distribution to IR of PCOS remains controversial. In addition, women with PCOS with IR are at
      an increased risk of developing diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.
      Preliminary data on the local women with PCOS showed high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
      (serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L). Recent studies showed that vitamin D deficiency is linked to IR,
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, inflammation and cardio vascular disease. Several studies
      have demonstrated that serum 25(OH)D levels were negatively correlated with body mass index
      (BMI), body fat, and IR. These conditions are common among women with PCOS. Accordingly, it
      is anticipated that vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency may contribute to the endocrine
      and metabolic disarrangements among women with PCOS. Such adverse effects may further
      contribute to the risk of further long term complications among women with PCOS.
