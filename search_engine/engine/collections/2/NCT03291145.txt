      QT syndrome by investigating how the exposure of physical and acoustic stress will affect the
      QT-dynamics and if beta blockers protect against arrhythmias by suppressing this dynamic
      QT-prolongation. Furthermore, the project will investigate the effects of Spironolactone on
      the QT-dynamics tested by "Brisk Standing".

      First, patients are tested with known arrhythmic triggers and they are then administered
      thier normal dose of beta blockers. Hereafter, "Brisk Standing" test is performed and the
      patients are on Spironolactone for seven days. After seven days treatment the "Brisk
      Standing" is repeated.
