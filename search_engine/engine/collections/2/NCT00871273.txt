    
      Primary Objective:

        -  To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine in patients who have undergone a
           total gastrectomy

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine administered to patients with
           gastric cancer pre- and post-gastrectomy and to compare this to historical data of
           capecitabine PK values in patients with other cancer types.

        -  To ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to PK data from the same
           patients prior to gastrectomy.

      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine in patients
      who have undergone a total gastrectomy. The study also aims to establish the toxicity profile
      of capecitabine in these patients, to identify any dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and to
      ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to PK data from the same patients prior
      to gastrectomy. Screening tests will consist of demographic details, complete medical
      history, physical exam, vital signs, tumour serum markers, haematology and biochemistry
      tests. There will also be an ECG, chest X-Ray or CT thorax, CT abdomen and a serum or urine
      pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential). Haematology and Biochemistry will be
      repeated prior to each study drug administration. All patients will receive 6 cycles of oral
      capecitabine chemotherapy at a dose of 625 mg/m2, administered twice daily at 12 hourly
      intervals for 21 consecutive days. Total proposed duration of therapy is 3 cycles
      pre-operatively and 3 cycles post-operatively. Capecitabine and its metabolites (DFCR, DFUR
      and 5-FU) plasma levels will be measured during the 1st and 4th cycles in all patients.
      Treatment should continue for 6 cycles unless there is evidence of disease progression, or
      unacceptable toxicity.
