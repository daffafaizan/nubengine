      myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the
      ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. Ranging in
      severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe, anemia can result in patients requiring regular
      red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which can lead to further complications from iron
      overload. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept versus
      placebo in anemic patients who are categorized as International Prognostic Scoring
      System-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
      have ring sideroblasts present, and require constant RBC transfusions. The design of the
      study will allow a period of initial randomization of patients into either the luspatercept
      or placebo arm, followed by a double-blind treatment period, and then an MDS disease
      assessment visit. For those patients that are determined to be experiencing clinical benefit
      as judged from the study Investigator by this disease assessment visit, they will be
      permitted to enter the double-blind Extension Phase of the study. Once patients are
      discontinued from study treatment, they will enter a post treatment follow-up period.
