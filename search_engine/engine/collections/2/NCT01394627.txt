      focus of this protocol. In our preliminary studies, the investigators demonstrated that
      baroreflex sensitivity is impaired during hypoglycemia in healthy individuals. Treatment with
      eplerenone (200mg total administered in two doses in the 15 hours prior to the hypoglycemic
      clamp) prevented this impairment.

      The study is based on the overarching hypothesis that hypoglycemia leads to increases in
      aldosterone/mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activity and increased cardiovascular injury.

      This study will address the following Specific Aims:

      To test the hypothesis that MR blockade will reduce the adverse effects of hypoglycemia on
      inflammation and on autonomic control of cardiovascular function.

      The investigators will determine the effects of hypoglycemia (50 mg/dl for 2.0 hours) on the
      blood inflammatory factor interleukin-6 levels, and on cardiovascular autonomic function
      (baroreflex sensitivity) in each subject under two conditions - pretreatment with MR blockade
      (eplerenone) and pretreatment with placebo.
