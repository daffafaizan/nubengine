    
      This is an observational study designed to evaluate safety and outcomes of solid organ
      transplantation in HIV+ recipients of HIV+ deceased donor organs. This study will evaluate
      overall survival and graft survival compared to transplantation with an HIV- organ.

      In addition the study will assess potential complications of organ transplant using HIV+
      deceased donors - including but not limited to - HIV superinfection, incidence and severity
      of graft rejection, recurrence of HIV-associated nephropathy, incidence of bacterial
      infections, and opportunistic infections.
