      in patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma. The secondary
      objective is to observe time to response,progression free survival rate at 2 years,overall
      survival rate at 2 yearsï¼Œsafety and immunogenicity of SHR-1210 in relapsed or refractory
      extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.The relationship of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue and
      EBV-DNA copies in blood to SHR-1210 efficacy in these patients would also be explored.
