      adipose tissue (VAT) and improve insulin sensitivity in normoglycemic adults, but glucose
      levels may rise transiently. Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug, counters the
      short-term diabetogenic effect of GH in rodents, but combined use of these drugs has not been
      evaluated in humans.

      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of GH and a TZD, alone and in
      combination, on glucose metabolism, visceral adiposity and insulin sensitivity in abdominally
      obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance. The hypothesis that combined treatment
      attenuates GH-induced increases in glucose concentrations, reduces VAT, and improves insulin
      sensitivity over time was tested. Sixty-two adults received GH and pioglitazone for 40 weeks
      in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
