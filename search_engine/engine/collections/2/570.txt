resistance to human growth hormone in pituitary dwarfism:clinical and immunologic studiesthirteen pituitary dwarfs havebeen treated with human growth hormone(hgh), and growth acceleration with doses of5-7 mg/week has been observed in all but onepatient.  on therapy, this 7 1/2-year-old girl grewat a rate of 1.05 cm/month for 7 months.thereafter, despite larger doses of growthhormone (15 mg/week), growth rate fell to0.27 cm/month.  this rate of growth persistedafter stopping hgh.  on retreatment on 2occasions, acceleration of growth did notoccur.  antibodies to hgh, absent in herserum before treatment, were repeatedlydemonstrated in her serum in high concentra-tion (hgh binding capacity up to 100 mg/1)during treatment.  comparable titers of anti-body have not been found in any of the 12other patients receiving long-term hgh treat-ment.  the specificity of the human anti-hghserum differed from rabbit anti-hgh serum.whereas both monkey growth hormone(mgh) and hgh were effective inhibitors ofthe binding of hgh-131i by rabbit antiserum,only hgh was an effective inhibitor withhuman antiserum.  in like manner, a crudeplacental extract which was an effective in-hibitor for rabbit antiserum was ineffectivewith human anti-hgh serum.
