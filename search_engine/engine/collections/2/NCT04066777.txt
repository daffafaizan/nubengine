      non-vasodilating ß-blockers or verapamil to decrease myocardial contractility and heart rate.
      A substantial part of patients remain symptomatic despite medical treatment. In these
      patients interventional or surgical treatments (septal reduction therapies (SRT)) to reduce
      LVOTO is considered in presence of moderate to-severe symptoms (New York Heart Association -
      functional class (NYHA) III-IV) and/or recurrent exertional syncope and an LVOTO gradient ≥50
      mm Hg. In some centers, invasive therapy is also considered in patients with mild symptoms
      (NYHA Class II) who have a resting or maximum provoked gradient of ≥50 mm Hg (with exercise
      or Valsalva's maneuvre) and moderate-to severe MVR. Advanced treatment options are alcohol
      septal ablation (ASA) or surgical myectomy often combined with mitral valve reconstructive
      surgery. These treatments have similar outcomes in terms of gradient reduction, symptom
      improvement and exercise capacity

      No previous trials have examined the effect of ASA in HOCM with respect to changes in central
      hemodynamics and myocardial performance during exercise.

      24 HOCM patients will be examined prior to ASA, and approximately six-nine months after ASA.

      The examination set-up consists of simultaneous 1) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), 2)
      right heart catheterization (RHC) and 3) cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX).
