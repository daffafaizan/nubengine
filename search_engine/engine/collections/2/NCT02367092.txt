      liver transplant candidates and recipients. This home-based intervention consists of a
      30-minute exercise session available on digital video disc or on the internet. This
      intervention was originally developed to improve functional status in community-dwelling
      older adults and therefore, has been designed to maximize the safety for even the most frail
      individuals. Subjects enrolled in this study will be randomized to one of two arms: (a) the
      exercise intervention arm in which the subjects will be asked perform this exercise session
      three to four times per week or (b) the standard-of-care arm in which the patient will be
      encouraged to exercise by their transplant clinician at every clinic visit. Subjects in the
      exercise intervention arm will undergo this intervention for 6 months. All subjects will be
      followed for up to two years from the time of enrollment to ascertain outcomes.
