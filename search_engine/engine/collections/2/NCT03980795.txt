      physically inactive, resulting in poor physical function and reduced quality of life.
      Combined resistance and cardiovascular exercise programs have been shown to be successful in
      hemodialysis patients but studies are limited in PD patients. The primary objectives of this
      pilot trial was to test the study feasibility of a combined resistance and cardiovascular
      exercise program (recruitment and retention rates) and report adherence and adverse events.
      Secondary objectives were to calculate the sample size for detecting differences in the 30
      second sit to stand test (STS30) and measure the effect on physical function and patient
      reported outcome measures (PROMs).

      Methods: The 3-month parallel two-arm pilot trial took place in California, USA. All
      participants were peritoneal dialysis patients in a single center who met inclusion criteria
      were invited into a randomized controlled trial. Recruitment was through face to face
      invitation following eligibility requirements. The intervention (I) group received monthly
      exercise physiologist consultations, exercise prescription (resistance and aerobic exercise
      program using exercise bands) and weekly phone calls over 12 weeks. Control (C) group
      received normal care. Feasibility outcomes were exercise adherence rates and adverse events.
      Secondary physical function measures were change in I compared to the C group in STS30, pinch
      strength test (PST) and the 8 foot timed up and go test (8TUG). PROMs were measured using the
      London Evaluation of Illness (LEVIL) instrument. Data collection was not blinded but
      statistical analysis was blinded.
