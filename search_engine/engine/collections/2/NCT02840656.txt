      and rectal Gram-negative bacilli colonization in 100 healthy subjects, and their
      susceptibility to chlorehexidine. Each participant will undego a oropharyngeal swab
      collection and a rectal swab at day 0. The Gram-negative bacilli colonization will be
      identified, E. coli isolates will be studied in terms of phylogeny; gram-negative isolates
      will be studied in terms of antimicrobial and chlorhexidine susceptibility. The primary
      objective is to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal Gram-negative bacilli colonization.
      The secondary objectives are to determine the chlorhexidine and antimicrobial susceptibility
      of such colonization; to determine the phylogentic characteristics of oropharyngeal and
      rectal predominant E. coli isolates; to compare the phylogentic characteristics of
      oropharyngeal and rectal E. coli isolates.
