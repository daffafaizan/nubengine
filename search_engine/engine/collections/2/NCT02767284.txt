      vision than letter charts commonly used by ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians.

      The current methods used to measure the CSF are often unreliable, due to high variability
      between measurements. This study will compare four (4) new tests with two (2) currently used
      standard tests. The contrast sensitivity function will be measured using all of the six (6)
      methods three times (3) in each of the two (2) eyes at two (2) occasions. Each subjects CSF
      will be measured 6x3x2x2 = 72 times.

      In addition, for each of the CSF measurements, the time used to measure the CSF and number of
      background variables for the subjects will be recorded.

      After informed consent is obtained, the subjects will undergo a visual examination. If they
      match the inclusion criteria they will be included. At that time or at their earliest
      possible convenience, their CSF will be measured using the six methods and some background
      information will be recorded.

      The follow-up measurement occasion will occur between 4 to 6 weeks (28 to 42 days) after the
      first.

      To facilitate comparison with previous studies, the CSF-measurements (in rel.
      contrast/cycles/degree) will be converted to a log (Base 10 logarithm) scale. The unit will
      thus be log CSF (LCSF) [log[relative contrast]/log[cycles/per degree]].
