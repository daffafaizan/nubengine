      However, IUD insertion is a procedure that require well-trained medical personnel and can
      cause pain in several steps during insertion such as applying tenaculum, applying uterine
      sound and insertion of IUD. Fear of pain during IUD insertion is a barrier to use of this
      contraceptive method. Previous researches reported mean pain score with using visual analog
      scale (VAS) moderated pain (4.7/10 and 34.7-51.2/100). In several countries, pain control is
      used before IUD insertion procedure. Currently, there is no recommended standard method for
      reducing pain during this procedure. From Cochrane Database 2015, some lidocaine
      formulations, such as lidocaine spray, lidocaine gel and lidocaine paracervical injection,
      could reduce pain during IUD insertion, but there is limited data on effect of lidocaine
      spray on reducing pain during insertion of IUD.

      Lidocaine is introduced to use for pain relieving in medical procedures with advantages of
      rapid action and minimal side effects.10% Lidocaine spray is a form of local anesthetic
      method that use in obstetrics and gynecology procedures and has favorable efficacy in
      reducing pain. Nevertheless, there were limited studies of 10% Lidocaine spray during IUD
      insertion. In this study, we investigate pain during IUD insertion using lidocaine spray
      compared with placebo.
