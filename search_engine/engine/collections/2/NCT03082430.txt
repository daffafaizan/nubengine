      "light" in the KOOS questionnaire on questions about pain and difficulty walking on flat
      ground.

      Secondary objectives include the safety validation of the use of PRP (prepared standardized
      manner by means of a given medical device) as second-line standard of care for osteoarthritis
      by the introduction of a systematic monitoring; and the feasibility of the health care system
      dedicated to the treatment of knee osteoarthritis by autologous PRP.

      Furthermore, the secondary objectives are to monitor and follow the evolution of pain (VAS)
      and the knee function (KOOS score) at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months. Evaluation of MRI will be
      performed within 15 days prior (inclusion visit) injection and 6 months to assess the
      cartilage thickness and visualize a regenerative effect.
