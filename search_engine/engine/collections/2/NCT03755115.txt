      and early metastasis in lung cancer. The systemic chemotherapy response rate is high in a
      wide range of patients, but it is easy to resist drug recurrence, which brings certain
      difficulties to clinical treatment. The signaling pathway activated by programmed cell death
      receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (programmed death-ligand 1, PDL1) is a hotspot in recent
      years and has brought good news to cancer patients. However, PD1 inhibitors are only about
      13% effective in treating lung cancer patients. Epirubicin is a classic drug that activates
      the immunogenicity of tumor tissues, induces tumor immunogenic death, and releases some
      marker proteins such as CRT, HMGB1, HSP and so on. These two drugs combine to enhance the
      anti-tumor effect of the human immune system.The investigators designed the study to explore
      the possibility of apatinib as the Second-line Therapy in ED-SCLC.
