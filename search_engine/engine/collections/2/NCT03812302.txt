    
      The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the potential use of 68-Ga HA-DOTATATE
      PET/CT for detecting medium-large vessel inflammation in a small number of GCA patients with
      active disease, as compared to FDG PET/CT, and to understand if DOTATATE uptake correlates
      with disease activity. Fifteen patients with active GCA (either newly-diagnosed or recently
      relapsed disease) who are receiving glucocorticoids will be enrolled. Participants will
      undergo baseline FDG PET/CT and baseline DOTATATE PET/CT scan. Tracer uptake will be
      described in 8 major vascular territories. DOTATATE PET/CT will be repeated again in 6
      months, and tracer uptake will be correlated to clinical disease activity, and medication
      use.
