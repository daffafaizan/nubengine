    
      A randomised trial has been initiated. 226 healthy primipara are invited to participate if
      they deliver a child after gestation week 36 and sustain a perineal laceration or an
      episiotomy during childbirth.

      The randomisation is done using a computer-controlled voice response system and the compared
      treatments are:

      A: Acupuncture in Shen Men, GV20, BL36 and 2 needles in the upper ear.

      B: Local anaesthetics (lidocaine 10 ml/mg) directly in the wound area.

      Primary outcomes are:

        1. Need for additional pain relief during the perineal repair.

        2. Pain experienced during perineal repair reported 1 day after delivery.

        3. Wound healing evaluated 1 and 14 days after delivery.

        4. Patient satisfaction with the given pain relief.
