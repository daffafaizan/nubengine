      I. To collect safety data about the combination of doxorubicin and Cixitumumab and determine
      if they can be combined with acceptable toxicity at full doses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the confirmed response rate (CR + PR as defined by RECIST) of patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma when treated with combination doxorubicin
      and Cixitumumab II. To assess the 3 and 6 month progression free survival rate of patients
      treated with doxorubicin and Cixitumumab.

      III. To assess the progression free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
      doxorubicin and Cixitumumab.

      IV. To evaluate changes in left ventricular ejection fraction assessed by MUGA scan after 2,
      4 and 6 cycles of therapy compared to baseline.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of anti-IGF-1R recombinant monoclonal
      antibody cixutumumab.

      Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously over 44-52 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue to receive
      cixutumumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
