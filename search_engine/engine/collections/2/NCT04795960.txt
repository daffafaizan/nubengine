    
      Eligible participants that will be given Ustekinumab as part of their standard of care will
      be enrolled in this study.

      The study hypotheses include that a low serine diet (compared to a high serine diet) in
      patients with active CD will:

        -  Reduce the relative abundance of Adherent invasive ecoli (AIEC), and increase the
           relative abundance of Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium in stool of patients with Crohn's
           disease.

        -  Make patients more likely to respond to ustekinumab (anti-Interleukin12/23) therapy with
           control of inflammation as measured by the mean Simple endoscopic subscore Crohn's
           disease (SES-CD) in each group at week 25.
