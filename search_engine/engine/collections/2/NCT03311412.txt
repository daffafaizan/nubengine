    
      Part 1 of this study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the selected dose of sequential
      escalating doses of Sym021 when administered once every 2 weeks (Q2W) by IV infusion to
      patient cohorts with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or
      lymphomas that are refractory to available therapy or for which no standard therapy is
      available

      Part 2 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and DLTs to establish the MTD
      and/or the selected dose of sequential escalating doses of Sym022 when administered Q2W in
      combination with a fixed dose of 3 mg/kg of Sym021, each by IV infusion to patient cohorts
      with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphomas that
      are refractory to available therapy or for which no standard therapy is available

      Part 3 of the study will evaluate of the safety, tolerability, and DLTs to establish the MTD
      and/or the selected dose of sequential escalating doses of Sym023 when administered Q2W in
      combination with fixed doses of 3 mg/kg of Sym021 and either 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg of Sym022, each
      by IV infusion to patient cohorts with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic solid
      tumor malignancies or lymphomas that are refractory to available therapy or for which no
      standard therapy is available.
