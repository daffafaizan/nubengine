      than 5 million people living with HIV in South Africa, including 280,000 children under the
      age of 15. Most HIV positive children acquire infection through mother-to-child transmission;
      in South Africa 29.3% of pregnant women attending antenatal services are HIV-infected.
      Furthermore, it is estimated that HIV is the cause of 35% of all deaths in children under
      five in South Africa. The South African government began a national rollout of HIV treatment
      for adults and children in 2003. As of 2007, an estimated 32,060 children under the age of 15
      were receiving antiretroviral therapy (roughly 30% of those in need). There is an urgent need
      to obtain more comprehensive, in-depth, profiles of children enrolled in HIV care with a
      focus on documenting outcomes, particularly timing and causes of death, reasons for loss to
      follow-up, timing and frequency of treatment failure, adverse events, metabolic complications
      and psychosocial aspects of HIV disease.
