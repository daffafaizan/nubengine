      placebo group. Both the participants and investigators were blinded, as the supplements were
      coded by an external lab. Data was collected at baseline and again in 6-weeks. Participants
      consumed 2 servings of the assigned supplement daily for 6 weeks. Measures included body
      composition, blood pressure, questionnaires, blood work (comprehensive metabolic panel,
      complete blood count, and lipid panel), and a urinalysis. Also, blood ketone levels were
      assessed before and periodically after consuming the supplemental drink (30 and 60 minutes
      post drink). These measures were performed at both baseline and 6-weeks later.
