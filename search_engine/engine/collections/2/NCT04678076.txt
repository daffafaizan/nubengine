    
      The present bioequivalence phase I study has been designed to compare the bioavailability and
      the concentration-time profile of the new immediate release oral gel formulation of
      ketoprofen 25 mg with a marketed reference of ketoprofen lysine salt (KLS) as granules for
      oral solution (80 mg bipartite sachet, half sachet containing 40 mg of KLS, corresponding to
      25 mg as ketoprofen), when administered in fed conditions to healthy male and female
      subjects. The study has been designed under fed conditions since the leaflet of the
      reference.

      A two-stage design has been selected for the present study considering the margin of
      uncertainty existing over the sample size estimate in order to accomplish the primary study
      objectives in terms of ketoprofen rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC0-t) of absorption of the two
      formulations.
