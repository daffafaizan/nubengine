      pressure ulcers due to prolonged and severe immobilization, moisture exposure related to
      sphincters incontinence, friction and shear forces associated with difficult transfers, as
      well as abnormal micro vascular blood flow secondary to a disrupted autonomic function below
      the level of injury. These factors contribute to ischemia of the skin and underlying tissues
      over bony prominences, which lead to increased risk of pressure ulcers. Most severe spinal
      cord injuries are associated with higher risk of developing pressure ulcers and presenting
      more severe pressure ulcers. The sacral area and heels are most at risk for pressure ulcers
      in the spinal cord injury population. Consequently, prevention of pressure ulcers during the
      acute care hospitalization is of utmost importance. Patients will be randomized to the
      intervention group (prophylactic placement of foam dressing over sacrum and placement of a
      Heelmedix boot) or the control group (no prophylactic foam dressing over sacrum and no
      Heelmedix boot). Both groups will receive the standard-of-care at the facility for the
      prevention of pressure ulcers. The standard care can include a regular evaluation of the
      skin, a nutritional evaluation, the management of incontinence, the use of a gel mattress,
      the use of a low air loss pressure-reliving mattress, the use of safe patient mobilization,
      weekly assessment by a physiatrist, a change of position every 2 hours, as well as
      occupational therapy and physical therapy.
