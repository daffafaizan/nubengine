    
      Alcohol dependence (AD) is the most severe form of alcohol use disorder. It occurs in 2.6% of
      people aged 15+ years worldwide and can result in a reduction of life-expectancy by several
      years as compared with the general population.

      Currently, disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone are the main medicinal products registered
      for the maintenance of abstinence in AD patients. Although effective on the group level,
      effects sizes are limited, and many AD patients fail to respond to these medications.
      Therefore, additional pharmacological treatments are needed.

      Sodium oxybate 50mg/kg/day showed evidence of efficacy compared to placebo and naltrexone in
      the maintenance of abstinence in AD patients in a series of open label and blinded randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs). However, studies were generally small and did not investigate the
      sustainability of the Sodium oxybate effect post-treatment.

      The present phase III/IV RCT (GATE 2) aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of oral Sodium
      oxybate in the maintenance of abstinence. Secondary aims included the assessment of sustained
      SMO effects during the 6-month medication free period immediately following the 6-month
      treatment period and monitoring the risk of Sodium oxybate dependence.
