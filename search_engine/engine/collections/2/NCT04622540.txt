      happens more often after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) than deceased donor liver
      transplantation.

      Many transplant centers adopted their own methods to improve biliary complications after
      LDLT. One suggested method is the application of external biliary drainage (EBD).

      A prospective study was planned to demonstrate effect of EBD on biliary complication after
      LDLT. Patients who underwent LDLT with duct-to-duct anastomosis will be randomly assinged to
      application of EBD or conventional duct-to-duct anastomosis without EBD according to a
      computer generated randomization sequence and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups.

      Primary outcome is biliary complication incidence 1 year after LDLT.
