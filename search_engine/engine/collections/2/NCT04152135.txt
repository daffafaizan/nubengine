      examined. After giving detailed information, voluntary certificate will be taken from
      patients who accept to participate in the study. Heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood
      pressure values will be recorded by routine monitoring. After intubation of the patients,
      plethysmographic waveform will be recorded with blood pressure, heart rate and end-tidal
      carbon dioxide values and IVC diameter will be measured by ultrasound. New hemodynamic values
      will be measured after passive leg raising maneuver. Blood pressure, heart rate, end-tidal
      carbon dioxide values will be re-measured and plethysmographic waveform will be recorded
      after beach chair position for surgery.
