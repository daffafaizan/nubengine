      represent a significant and challenging part in the daily practice for the majority of
      urologists practicing. The present methods of diagnosis are: Ultra sound, Cystoscopy, CT-scan
      etc. All these are stressful to the patients, particularly Cystoscopy which is commonly
      employed for the follow up of Bladder cancer patients.

      In recent years, fluorescence cystoscopy, in contrast to conventional white light cystoscopy,
      has been investigated as a tool to enhance detection of occult papillary lesions and
      carcinoma in situ. Recent fluorescence photo detection strategies have used 5-aminolevulinic
      acid (5-ALA); a precursor of heme biosynthesis.

      5-Aminolevulinic acid-enhanced cystoscopy does appear to have improved sensitivities in
      detecting nonmuscle invasive bladder tumors such as carcinoma in situ . Aminolevulinic acid
      (ALA) may have a role in other applications in surgical oncology based on its ability to
      discriminate neoplastic tissue from adjacent normal tissue. Aminolevulinic acid is not a
      photosensitizer, but rather a metabolic precursor of porphyrin, which is a photosensitizer.

      The present study will employ photodynamic diagnostic procedure to quantify only in urine a
      specific cancer biomarker Porphyrin which selectively binds on to the bladder cancer tissues
      for a longer time than the normal tissues. In this context, the present study will offer
      viable, very easy and reliable table top instrumentation for diagnosis and continual
      monitoring of disease regression.
