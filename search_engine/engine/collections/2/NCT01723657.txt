    
      Induction chemotherapy: idarubicin (12mg/m2/day intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5),
      intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h, intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5) and etoposide
      (100mg/m2/day, intravenous, from day 1 to 3) as in AML-99 trial (NCT01716793), with the
      addition of subcutaneous G-CSF from day 0 to the last day of chemotherapy. This induction
      therapy is repeated if complete remission (CR) is not achieved after the first course of
      treatment.

      Consolidation therapy (as in AML-99 trial): mitoxantrone (12mg/m2/day, intravenous, days 4 to
      6) and intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h from day 1 to 6).

      Risk-stratification according to cytogenetics, courses to CR and availability of an
      HLA-identical sibling:

        -  Patients in the favorable cytogenetics group [t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16)] and
           Leukocyte index <20 at diagnosis (LI=white blood cell count (WBC) x (blasts in bone
           marrow/100) are treated with one course of high-dose cytarabine (3g/m2/12h, intravenous,
           days 1, 3 and 5), but in case of LI>20 at diagnosis the intention is to perform an
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.

        -  Patients in intermediate risk group, with normal karyotype, a single course of induction
           chemotherapy to achieve the CR, the absence of adverse molecular features (FLT3-ITD or
           MLL-PTD) and low minimal residual disease levels after consolidation (MRD<0,1%) receive
           an autologous PBSC transplant, regardless of having an HLA-identical sibling.

        -  The remaining patients defined as high-risk patients are treated with an allogeneic stem
           cell transplantation. Depending on the age, if the patient has an HLA-identical sibling
           donor, up to age of 50 years old it is performed with conventional conditioning therapy
           and positive selection of CD34+, older patients receive a reduced intensity conditioning
           regimen.

        -  Very high risk patients without a sibling are allocated to unrelated donor (9-10/10).
           Patients with adverse cytogenetics and/or FLT3-ITD without an adequate donor received
           Mylotargâ„¢ as "in vivo purging" followed by an autologous PBSC transplantation.
