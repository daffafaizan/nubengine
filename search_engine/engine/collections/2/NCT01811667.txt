      significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the investigators need to establish
      guidelines in order to treat these pathologies. Standard treatments such as surgery or
      interventional radiology are of limited efficacy and related to a high level of recurrences
      as well as complications. Recent preclinical studies have shown the important role of the
      PI3Kinase/AKT/mTor pathway on the development and the lymphatic-vascular organisations
      suggesting an appealing therapeutic target to treat patients with complex vascular
      malformations.

      The aim of this clinical study is to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and the safety of
      the Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, to treat children and adults with microcystic lymphatic
      malformations, general lymphatics abnormalities (GLA) or complex vascular malformations for
      which conventional therapies as surgery or sclerotherapy are ineffective or associated with
      high risk of important complications.
