    
      The Millipede Feasibility Study is a prospective, open-label, single-arm study to assess the
      safety and feasibility/performance of the Millipede Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System in
      subjects with functional mitral regurgitation. The study will include subjects with
      functional mitral regurgitation classified as moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) that are
      symptomatic (NYHA Class II-IV) despite guideline directed medical therapy in whom the local
      hearth team determines that surgery is not an option for mitral valve repair. Clinical
      follow-up will be required in hospital, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 12 months, and then
      annually through 5 years post-procedure. Subjects who have any part of the Millipede
      Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System introduced into the body but who do not end up with an
      implant will be followed through 30 days.
