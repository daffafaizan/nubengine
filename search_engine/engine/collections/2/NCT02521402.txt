      previous treatment of their keloid. Once patients are deemed to be appropriate candidates,
      they will be enrolled in the study. Operatively, the old scar will be completely excised.
      Then the Biovance will be laid in the base of the wound. After this is performed, extensive
      undermining will be done to close the wound in layers.

      All post-revision complications (including infection, incision dehiscence, hematoma, seroma,
      and wound necrosis) will be assessed and recorded by the investigator. Patients will be
      reviewed to obtain demographic and risk factor (such as age, body mass index, smoking) data.
      Data on adjuvant therapy use (previous surgeries, treatments for keloid scar) will be
      collected. Surgical technique details (such as incision size and closure technique) will also
      be recorded for each patient. Photographs documenting the pre-, intra- and post-revision
      clinical course of patients will be collected.
