      is the main way of saving visual function and relieving pain, but the proliferation of iris
      neovascularization (NVI) makes it difficult to treat NVG. Normally, the patients need
      intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents prior to
      glaucoma surgery to control the NVI proliferation.

      KDR2-2, a novel small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2),
      has demonstrated anti-neovascular effect without obvious side-effects or complications in
      animal studies and Phase I clinical trial (NCT04620109). In this study, 20 patients with NVG
      will be included to evaluate the effect of KDR2-2 suspension eyedrop on NVI in NVG eyes. The
      included subjects would be randomized to receive either 0.96 or 4.8 mg/day/eye, in a QID
      fashion, Ã—7 days (those without complications can continue to 28 days).

      This study aims to and propose a novel, non-invasive and more compliant method for the
      treatment of NVG.
