      patients undergoing the Nuss procedure have lingering pain which can complicate recovery.
      Depending on the nature of the surgery and the severity of disease, this recovery period can
      be as short as a few days, or it can take several weeks and even months. Few studies have
      demonstrated the benefit of physical activity and exercise postoperatively on returning to
      normal function. Additionally, research has suggested that pain and recovery can be
      influenced by psychological factors.

      The investigators will use wireless activity monitors to assess the activity levels of
      children who undergo major musculoskeletal surgery, specifically the Nuss procedure. The
      investigators will also evaluate this population for psychological well-being. In this pilot
      study, the investigators identify goals and objectives which will provide preliminary
      evidence for physical and psychological recommendations to reduce post-operative pain and
      improve recovery.

      Families will be asked to complete questionnaires at different phases in the surgery
      (pre-surgery, post bar insertion, post bar removal). Children will be instructed to record
      any pain they are experiencing as a result of their condition or the surgery at various time
      points. The activity levels will also be followed over the course of the recovery period.
