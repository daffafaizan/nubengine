      muscle stimulation device on treating urge incontinence in women. The aim of the device is to
      stimulate the pelvic floor muscles and surrounding structures to improve urinary
      incontinence. This is a randomized prospective controlled study of two active groups with a
      stimulation frequency difference between the groups.
