      that these infants could perhaps be managed without antibiotics. Widespread application of
      the WHO clinical algorithm could therefore result in the referral of as many as 13.7% (135.7
      per 1000 live births) of all infants for isolated fast breathing, the vast majority of these
      unnecessarily, and exposing infants to a high risk of nosocomial sepsis and hospital
      mortality in addition to over-burdening health resources.
