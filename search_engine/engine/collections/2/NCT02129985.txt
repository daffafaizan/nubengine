      over time in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus,irrespective of lifestyle and existing
      pharmacological interventions. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes is one of the major
      challenges in the treatment of affected patients, and agents that could alter the natural
      history of this condition would add greatly to current treatment approaches.Short-term
      intensive insulin therapy of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes has been proved improving
      beta-cell function and usually leading to a temporary remission time,but the remission rate
      in a year is only about 50%. The effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on beta-cells is
      stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin release, followed by enhancement of insulin
      biosynthesis. It is stimulating beta-cell proliferation, induction of islet neogenesis, and
      inhibition of ß-cell apoptosis. Exenatide is an GLP-1 receptor agonist. Exenatide exerts
      direct effects on β-cell, which indicates that may contribute to delay disease progression.
      However, no study has evaluated effect of short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide
      therapy model on β-cell function and glycemic remission rate in newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetic patients. Our hypotheses is whether GLP-1 receptor agonists sequential therapy in
      newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients can further improve glycemic control, diabetes
      remission rate and β-cell function after the short-term insulin intensive therapy.
