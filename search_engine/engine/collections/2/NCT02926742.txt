      times will use fixed dose and duration. Little research has been conducted on the physiologic
      implication of resolution of symptoms. It seems reasonable, that symptomatic relief results
      from some degree of hemodynamic normalization. This study will seek to examine the extent to
      which the hemodynamic impairment is normalized from a thrombolytic treatment protocol with an
      endpoint of therapy determined as resolution of presenting symptoms. Treatment plans will
      utilize the MBS (Modified Borg Scale) score to help evaluate and measure outcome-based care,
      quantifying shortness of breath.
