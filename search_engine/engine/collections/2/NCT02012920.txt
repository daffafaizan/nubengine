    
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of seviteronel in subjects with castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC). Phase 1 was a dose-escalation study enrolling subjects with CRPC that were
      either "treatment naïve" (not treated with previous abiraterone or enzalutamide), or treated
      with one or more of the following: abiraterone, enzalutamide, or chemotherapy.

      Phase 2 is an open-label, multi-center cohort-expansion study to further determine the
      efficacy and safety of seviteronel in two CRPC populations with documented rising PSA with or
      without bone or soft tissue disease progression during treatment with: abiraterone or
      enzalutamide for ≥ 12 weeks (Group 1) abiraterone and enzalutamide; treatment should be ≥ 12
      weeks for at least one agent (Group 2)
