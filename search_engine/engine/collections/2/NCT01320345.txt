      most feared complication of diabetes. Fenofibrate is a blood fat lowering drug available in
      Australia and has been shown to reduce eye damage in people with Type 2 diabetes by 35-40%,
      and to prevent eye damage in Type 1 diabetic animal models. This study will evaluate the
      potential benefits of oral Fenofibrate 145mg once daily for average 36 months in 450 adults
      with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are at high risk of eye damage.
