      Israel, Clalit Health Services, which insures and provides healthcare to 55% (3.9 million) of
      the nation's population. All persons between 21 and 90 years and registered with Clalit on
      January 1, 2002 (the date of study entry), without a previous history of cancer, were
      included in a closed cohort that was followed until December 31 2012.

      All individuals were followed for cancer incidence, which was ascertained by record linkage
      to the Israel National Cancer Registry, established in 1960. The registry has benefited since
      1982 from a national law mandating registration of cancer, and has greater than 95% coverage
      of solid tumors, and approximately 85% coverage of hematologic cancers [34].

      Definitions of diabetes: Incident diabetes was defined as fulfillment of at least one of the
      following six criteria during 2002-12: (1) diabetes recorded in the Clalit Chronic Disease
      Registry; (2) a physician's diagnosis of diabetes, and one plasma glucose test > 125 mg/dL
      within 12 months; (3) one HbA1c measurement > 6.5%; (4) 2-hour plasma glucose level during an
      oral glucose tolerance test â‰¥ 200 mg/dL; (5) 3 or more purchases of glucose-lowering
      medication within 12 months; (6) 2 plasma glucose measurements > 125 mg/dL within 12 months.
      The date of the earliest defining criterion was considered the date of diagnosis.

      Prevalent diabetes was defined as being recorded with diabetes in the Clalit Chronic Disease
      Registry on study entry, or fulfilling criterion #5 above (information on medication use was
      available from 1998) before study entry.

      Types of cancer: The following cancers were investigated: liver (ICD-O-3 codes C22.0 and
      C22.1), pancreas (C25.0-C25.9), gallbladder (C23.9-C24.9), endometrium (C54.0-C54.9, C55.9),
      stomach (C16.0-C16.9), kidney (C64.9, C65.9, C66.9., C68.0-C68.9), benign brain and central
      nervous system (C70.0-C72.9 with behavior code 0), malignant brain (C70.0-C72.9 with behavior
      code 3), multiple myeloma (C42.1 with relevant morphology codes), colorectum (C18.0-C21.8),
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (C02.4, C09.8. C09.9, C11.1, C14.2, C37.9, C42.2, C77 and all other
      sites for extra-nodal Non Hodgkin's lymphoma), lung (all: C34.0-C34.9), adenocarcinoma,
      squamous cell), leukemia (C42.0, C42.1, C42.2 with relevant morphology codes), ovary (C56.9),
      bladder (C67.0-C67.9), breast (C50.0-C50.9), thyroid (C73.9) and prostate (C61.9). Apart from
      benign brain tumors, all cancers included in the analysis were coded as invasive (behavior
      code = 3).
