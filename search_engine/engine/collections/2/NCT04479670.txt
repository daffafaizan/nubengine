      location of dangerous threat at the foot of the Pelee volcano, generating intense stress and
      psychotraumatic disorders. Indeed, faced with the phenomena of mudslides and boulders in
      connection with volcanic activity (Lahars) and repeated alerts, several cases of Psychotrauma
      have already been reported. Even if the municipal, territorial and state authorities have put
      in place a large-scale action to keep the population safe, the process of moving the
      neuralgic centers of the town will not be completed until 2021.

      In the meantime, investigators propose to provide appropriate support for this situation via
      the SOS Kriz platform and the Psychotraumatology center of Martinique University Hospital.

      In order to reach this objective, the study team will conduct patholinguistic procedures to
      the verbal recordings of persons from the town of Le Prêcheur every six months during one
      year. This analysis is carried out semi-automatically using a cognitive-discursive analysis
      software (Tropes1).

      Two validated psychometric tests (GHQ-12 and PCL-5) to supplement the patholinguistic data
      will be used.

      This mixed trial aims to evaluate the evolution of the overall state of mental health of the
      population via a patholinguistic and psychometric measurement device, to be able to target
      the actions of care and support to victims of psychotrauma related to risks of natural
      disaster in the commune of Prêcheur in Martinique.
