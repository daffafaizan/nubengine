      health problems and accelerates HIV disease progression. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has
      been the single most important treatment for people living with HIV to optimize viral
      suppression and slow disease progression. Adherence to ART has considerable public health
      implications, particularly given that optimal adherence decreases morbidity and mortality,
      decreases the potential for the development of drug resistant strains of HIV, and reduces HIV
      infectiousness.

      Project PLUS (Positive Living through Understanding and Support) was the first (and to our
      knowledge only) theory-based behavioral intervention, which integrates motivational
      interviewing and cognitive-behavioral skills training, to demonstrate significant
      improvements in viral load, CD4 cell count, and self-reported adherence among a racially and
      ethnically diverse sample of HIV-positive women and men enrolled in a randomized controlled
      trial, and the first intervention for hazardous drinkers to demonstrate any significant
      effects. A clinic-based replication is the crucial next step in studying the intervention's
      effectiveness in the real world when delivered by HIV clinic providers to their patients.

      In collaboration with medical providers at the Spencer Cox Center for Health at the Institute
      for Advanced Medicine, Mount Sinai Health System, the largest provider of HIV medical care in
      the New York City area, our goals are to better understand alcohol-related outcomes among
      HIV-positive persons over the lifespan and to conduct a multisite comparative effectiveness
      trial with three intensities of treatment-the PLUS intervention, an enhanced treatment as
      usual (eTAU) condition, and treatment as usual (TAU) condition-to test the clinical and
      cost-effectiveness of the PLUS intervention in reducing alcohol use and improving ART
      adherence, viral load, and CD4 counts among HIV-positive hazardous drinkers. This study has
      the potential to exert a sustained and powerful impact on the effectiveness of ART
      interventions for HIV-positive persons with problematic drinking.
