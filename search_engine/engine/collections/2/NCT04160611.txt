      procedure includes ovary aspiration, to isolate oocytes. During the aspiration the patient is
      sedated with short-term intravenous aesthetic. Premedication is often used in
      anaesthesiology, and includes drugs application 30 minutes prior to procedure to sedate and
      treat the anxieties of the patient. One of the most often used drugs in premedication is
      midazolam. As the procedure is quite stressful for the patients, our aim is to investigate
      the influence of midazolam premedication on the stress release during the oocyte aspiration
      procedure, as well as its influence on the whole IVF procedure. Therefore, patients will be
      divided into two groups, control and midazolam. Blood samples will be taken before and during
      the procedure. Stress, antioxidant parameters (with glutathione and catalase) and oxidative
      status will be monitored in serum and follicular fluid.

      The results will be correlated with subjective stress levels in the two groups in an effort
      to establish ties with IVF results.
