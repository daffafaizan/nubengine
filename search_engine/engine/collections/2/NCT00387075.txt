      40-item olfactory identification test provided by mail. 300 subjects (225 with decreased odor
      identification and 75 with normal olfaction) will be invited to undergo DAT imaging at the
      Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders in New Haven, CT. There will also be additional
      clinical follow-up at participant's clinical (local) site. The primary outcome measure for
      the study will be the mean striatal uptake of [123I]B-CIT in first-degree relatives with a
      loss of odor identification, which will be compared to an established healthy control
      database (age 40-70; n=50). 300 relatives will be followed longitudinally with clinical
      evaluations and a second imaging study completed after two years. Comparing the first and
      second scans in this subset of subjects will allow us to evaluate the rate of progressive
      loss in dopamine transporter density during this pre-symptomatic period.
