    
      Purpose: To assess both anatomic and functional outcomes between short-pulse continuous
      wavelength and infrared micropulse lasers in the treatment of DME.

      Materials and Methods: A prospective interventional study from tertiary care eye hospital -
      King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). Patients with center-involving
      diabetic macular edema were treated with subthreshold laser therapy. Patients in the
      micropulse group were treated with the 810-nm diode micropulse scanning laser TxCellâ„¢ (IRIDEX
      Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Laser was applied according to manufacturer
      recommendations for MicroPulseTM in a confluent mode (low intensity/high density) to the
      entire area of the macular edema. Patients in the short-pulse group were treated with grid
      pattern laser with 20ms pulse PASCAL laser 532nm (TopCon Medical Laser Systems, Tokyo, Japan)
      with EndPoint algorithm, which was either 30% or 50% of testing burn. Main outcome measures
      included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and foveal thickness at baseline and the last
      follow-up visit.
