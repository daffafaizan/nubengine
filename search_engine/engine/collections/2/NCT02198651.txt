      included a Screening period of up to 28 days (unless extended with justification approved by
      study-designated physician), a 4-week Lead-In Period with open label (OL) 40 mg adalimumab
      administered subcutaneously (sc) every other week (eow), and a randomized 36-week
      double-blind period with 40 mg adalimumab sc every 3 weeks (q3wks; tapering arm) or placebo
      sc q3wks (withdrawal arm). Participants were randomized in a 5:1 ratio (tapering arm:
      withdrawal arm) after confirmation of meeting the disease activity score (DAS) criteria.
      Participants who experienced a protocol-defined flare at any time were to enter a rescue arm
      with OL 40 mg adalimumab administered sc eow for 16 weeks.
