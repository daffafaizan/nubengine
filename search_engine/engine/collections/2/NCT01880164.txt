    
      1. Identify disease burden associated with adult spinal deformity (ASD) using quality
           adjusted life year (QALY) analysis.

        2. Identify disease burden of specific demographic and radiographic features associated
           with ASD.

        3. Compare disease burden of ASD to other musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal diseases.

        4. Identify efficacy of specific nonoperative treatment modalities to treat ASD and
           identify specific clinical and radiographic features of ASD responsive to nonoperative
           treatment modalities.

        5. Compare QALY and ICER values for different ASD nonoperative treatment modalities to
           previously established QALY and ICER for values for operative and nonoperative treatment
           modalities for degenerative hip and knee disease, coronary artery disease, insulin
           dependent diabetes, and hypertension.

        6. Evaluate the cost and work hours associated with data collection and minimum 85% patient
           follow up.

        7. Evaluate patient characteristics associated with poor patient compliance for study
           follow up including demographic, radiographic and HRQOL values and for reasons for
           cross-over to operative treatment for ASD.

        8. Establish standardized data collection methodology for economic based outcome studies
           based upon patient demographics and HRQOL values.
