      trial of the therapeutic use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of patients with
      moderate to severe COVID-19.

      Short Title: PROTECT-Patient study

      Aim: Assess the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) as a therapeutic
      treatment for hospitalised patients with moderate to severe COVID-19

      Study Design: Randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial

      Intervention: Randomised 1:1 to either CCP plus standard of care (SOC) or to SOC plus placebo
      (200 mL normal saline)

      Active Agent: A single unit of approximately 200-250 mL of CCP that contains anti-SARS-CoV-2
      collected by plasmapheresis from a volunteer who recovered from COVID19 with SOC as
      determined by local practice and guidelines.

      Placebo: A single unit of 200 mL normal saline with SOC as determined by local practice and
      guidelines

      Sample Size: 600

      Study Population: Consenting adult inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19, not requiring
      invasive ventilation, who are admitted to a participating public or private sector hospital
      and who are not enrolled in another COVID-19 treatment trial.

      Settings: Participating public and private sector hospitals in South Africa
