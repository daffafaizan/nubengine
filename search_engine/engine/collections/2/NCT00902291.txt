    
      A disease assessment will be performed at study week 8 (Â± 3 days) by the investigator. The
      assessment will be based both on changes in clinical symptoms, and radiographic images.
      Subjects without evidence of disease progression may continue to receive treatment based on
      their original treatment assignment until disease progression or intolerability. Disease
      assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during the extended period. A safety follow-up
      visit will occur 4 weeks after the last dose infusion of AGS-1C4D4 and/or gemcitabine.

      Post-Treatment: Subjects terminating from protocol therapy for reasons unrelated to
      documented disease progression will be followed by telephone contact every 2 months until
      they begin a new anticancer therapy, their disease progresses, they die, become lost to
      follow-up or withdrawal consent for further follow-up, whichever of these events occurs
      first.

      Overall survival: All subjects will be followed by telephone contact every 2 months until
      death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever of these events occurs first.
