      methemoglobinemia, and with induced hypoxia and methemoglobinemia. This will be accomplished
      in three runs with 24 to 28 plateaus total. The number of plateaus will be dependent on the
      subject's tolerance of the study procedure. The first run will be strictly induction of
      hypoxia down to approximately 70% saturation. The second run will be induction of hypoxia
      down to approximately 80% saturation with mild hypoxia at 7% MetHb. The third run will be
      induction of hypoxia down to approximately 80% saturation with a target MetHb of 11-15%.
