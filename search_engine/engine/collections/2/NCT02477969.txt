      as add-on to metformin hydrochloride. The baseline HbA1c level （HbA1c≤8.5% or HbA1c>8.5）is
      designed as the stratification factor based on which a dynamic randomization will be
      performed.

      This study consists of 4 periods： Period 1：Up to 3 weeks of screening period. Period 2：A
      4-week PEX168 dummy injection run-in period. Period 3：A 52-week treatment period (including a
      24-week core treatment period and a 28-week extended treatment period).

      Period 4: A 30-day safety follow-up period.
