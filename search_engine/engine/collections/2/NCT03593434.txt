      recruiting CF patients who are 6-21 years old with one or two copies of the F508del CFTR
      mutation. The existing protocol is funded by the NHLBI under R01-11863962 (PIs Woods, Clancy,
      and hereafter referred to as "the NHLBI study" for simplicity), and seeks to enroll a total
      of 38 subjects; it includes three to four (three scheduled, with a fourth optional) study
      visits, with spirometry, LCI, UTE MRI, and 129Xe MRI being performed at each visit. This
      present study will utilize existing study visits for the NHLBI study, with patients opting-in
      to have all of the procedures performed twice, with an intervening ACT, during one their
      study visits. The target enrollment is 20 subjects.

      Airway clearance therapy (ACT) is used for treating cystic fibrosis (CF). It is known to
      impact measures of lung function, and while an increasing number of lung function measures
      are used in clinical trials, there has been no direct comparison of the effects of ACT across
      the different modalities. This study is actively investigating the relationship between
      different measures of lung function, comparing a spirometric measure (FEV1 percent-predicted)
      with measures of whole-lung ventilation (lung clearance index, or LCI) and regional
      assessments of both structure (with ultra-short echo time magnetic resonance imaging, or UTE
      MRI) and function (with hyperpolarized xenon, or 129Xe, MRI). Performing these assessments on
      CF patients will help to elucidate the relative sensitivity of each measure to
      intra-individual changes within the lung and will help guide the selection of lung function
      measures in future studies.
