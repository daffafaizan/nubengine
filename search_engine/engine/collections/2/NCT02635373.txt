    
      Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA, calciphylaxis) is a rare disease (ORPHA280062) with
      dramatically high mortality characterized clinically by the occurrence of painful
      debilitating cutaneous lesions and ulcerations. Median survival time is about 1.5 years. Many
      uncertainties still exist about risk factors and optimal therapy. CUA mainly occurs in
      patients with severe renal insufficiency or ESRD.

      The aim of the present initiative is to establish an international (European) observational
      registry for CUA patients. This registry will help to reach a critical mass of CUA patients,
      will allow novel insights into pathophysiology, and will help establishing systematically an
      overview upon risk factors and long-term outcome of CUA patients. The design of the
      international registry is supposed to adopt the structure of the presently running
      nation-wide German calciphylaxis registry.

      The investigators plan to initiate a registry in which treating physicians can provide data
      upon demographics, clinical picture, comorbidities, medical treatments and laboratory data at
      the time of diagnosis and serial follow-up time points. In addition investigators will
      build-up a biobank for full blood, serum and plasma samples as well as tissue samples.

      The registry will allow investigations regarding potential subgroups of patients (proximal
      versus distal forms of CUA), geno-phenotype correlations, description of international
      state-of-the-art treatment, and identification of preventive tools, risk factors and
      biomarkers for estimation of prognosis.

      Furthermore, the registry will be the nidus for further scientific exchange between experts
      and clinicians on the field of uremic vascular calcification.
