      randomized cross-over design. Each study consists of asymptomatic daily wear soft contact
      lens wearers observed at baseline and at two and four hours post lens insertion. Corneal
      staining is being assessed using sodium fluorescein, a cobalt filter and a yellow filter.
      Subjective comfort assessments are obtained at each visit.
