      ovarian cancer. One option to further improve the therapeutic results is the incorporation of
      a third, non-cross-resistant drug into first line chemotherapy of advanced ovarian cancer. In
      two separate, single center phase II studies, a different combination of the three active
      agents (Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and Topotecan) has been tested. In these studies, Carboplatin
      and Paclitaxel were given at standard doses and schedules, followed sequentially by Topotecan
      which was well tolerated at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day given for five days and repeated every
      21 days. The prolonged therapy is not associated with cumulative toxicity and the compliance
      of the patients was good.

      Study Hypothesis/Comparison: The triple combination (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Topotecan) yields
      superior outcome in the treatment of first-line ovarian cancer compared with the combination
      of Carboplatin + Paclitaxel
