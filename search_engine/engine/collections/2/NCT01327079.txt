      uniformly distributed with respect to gestational age and encompassing GA's of from 22 to
      less than 43 weeks.

        -  Stratified Selection by Gestational Age (GA): The study neonates will be selected to
           achieve balance in the following GA strata: (22-24 wks, 25-26 wks, 27-28 wks, 29-30 wks,
           31-32 wks, 33-37 wks; 38-43 wks). Stratification will be done to ensure broad
           representation by GA. As described below, analyses will treat GA as a continuous
           variable.

        -  Randomization will assign a newborn infant to group 1 (n=30) or group 2 (n=30).

        -  Study medications: Methadone and inulin administration Blood and urine will be collected
           for the purposes of this research project. Blood will be drawn from the indwelling
           arterial catheter that already is in place for clinical purposes. The amount of blood
           obtained for all study related determinations will be minimized and kept at less than 3
           mL/kg of blood per 48 hour period. The study will last 60 hours for group 1 and 72 hours
           for group.

        -  DNA study 0.3ml whole blood will be collected from each subject

        -  PK study Blood samples (0.2 mL per sample) will be taken in 30 newborn infants at t=0,
           1, 4, 12, 36, 60 h (group 1) after the administration of one dose of methadone, and in
           30 newborn infants at t=0, 2, 8, 24, 48, 72 hr (group 2) after the administration of
           methadone. A total of 1.5 ml of blood will be collected from each subject

        -  Urine Collection Urine samples will be collected from each infant's diaper (wood pulp
           based study diapers) every 3-4 hours over the first 24 hour period or alternatively,
           from an indwelling urinary catheter placed based on clinical indications unrelated to
           the study protocol.
