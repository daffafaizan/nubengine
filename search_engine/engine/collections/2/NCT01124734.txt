      survival duration of less than one year. Durable remissions with conventional therapy are
      rare and therefore clinical trials remain a primary treatment modality for metastatic
      disease. There are 2 currently FDA-approved therapies for metastatic melanoma. Chemotherapy
      with single agent parenteral dacarbazine or its oral pro-drug, temozolomide, are capable of
      producing responses in 6.5 to 20% of patients. These responses are usually minor to partial
      at best and are not durable. Combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs has not been
      successful. The immune system also seems to play a role in malignant melanoma. High dose
      Interferon therapy is the current standard therapy for the adjuvant treatment of stage IIB,
      IIC and III melanoma after surgical resection in which it has shown to result in modest
      improvements in disease free survival and overall survival. In metastatic disease, various
      immunologic approaches have been employed as well. High dose IL-2 can produce a response rate
      of about 10-15% in patients with metastatic melanoma. About 5-10% of responses are complete
      and some of these complete responses are durable so that the lucky few patients who have a
      durable complete response are for all intents and purposes cured. Attempts to combine
      chemotherapy with immunotherapy, although improving response rates, has not impacted survival
      as summarized in recent meta-analysis.
