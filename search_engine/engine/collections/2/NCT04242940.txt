      of a task. The aim is to compare listening effort with different settings (OpenSound
      Navigator ON and OFF) of Ponto 4, the sound processor released by Oticon Medical AB in June
      2019, in listening scenarios that differ in complexity. The study consists of three visits of
      about two hours each in duration, during which the patients will perform a speech-in-noise
      task where the listening task varies in difficulty (i.e., in terms of signal-to-noise ratio,
      SNR). Pupil dilation will be recorded during the listening task as an indicator of listening
      effort. The patients will also use Ponto 4, instead of their own Ponto device, during a
      field-trial period of three months in between visit 2 and 3. Subjective evaluations of Ponto
      4 will be performed via three questionnaires, one regarding self-reported performance in
      everyday life, one regarding work-related fatigue, and one regarding overall sound processor
      preference (Ponto 4 vs. patient's own device). All these outcome measures are non-invasive
      measurements. This is a post market study and all products used are CE marked and used in
      clinical practice worldwide.
