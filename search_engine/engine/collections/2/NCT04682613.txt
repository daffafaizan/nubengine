      physiological growth. Significant risk factors for the physical and mental health of children
      and adolescents include, among other things, disordered eating patterns, overweight and
      reduced physical activity, low self-esteem and negative body image.

      "In Favor of Myself" is a preventive intervention program. The program's primary goal is to
      increase adolescents' self-esteem and to prevent negative self-image and body image, as well
      as to development media literacy. In this study, the investigators will focus on the "Young
      In Favor of Myself " program, designed for ages 10-12, grades 5 and 6, and its main goal is
      the development of self-care behaviors, media literacy, positive self-esteem, and body-image.
      To increase the effect of "Young In Favor of Myself " program, on the adolescents, the
      investigators have developed a teacher component as an addition to the school-based
      intervention, usually delivered by college students. The study will first assess the
      teachers' influence on the program, and then evaluate the difference in adolescent outcomes
      from the program with or without this supplement.

      Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the participants
      (both teachers and adolescents) before, after, and three months after the completion of the
      program. The questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good psychometric
      qualities. The study protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board.
      Parents of all participants, in the intervention and in the control group, as well as
      teachers involved in the program, received information about the program and the study and
      were asked to provide informed consent.
