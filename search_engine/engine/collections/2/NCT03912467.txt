      with a high cost of care. Hospitalization in the ICU is a context where there is a high risk
      of occurrence of PUs, prevention of which is a priority for ICU teams caring for critically
      ill patients. However, the literature is inconclusive regarding the prevalence of PUs among
      critically ill patients and the associated risk factors. The main objective of this study was
      to describe the prevalence of PUs among critically ill patients hospitalized in the ICU.
      Secondary objectives were to describe means of prevention of PUs in the ICU and the
      characteristics of PUs, and to identify factors either related to the ICU or patient
      characteristics associated with occurrence of PUs in the ICU.
