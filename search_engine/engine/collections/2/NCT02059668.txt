      Primary: Evaluation of local-regional recurrence- free survival after two years of patients
      with locally advanced head and neck cancer who received definitive or adjuvant
      radiochemotherapy.

      Secondary: Evaluation of disease-free -survival, metastases-free and overall survival after
      two years, of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.

      Outline: This is a multicenter observational study. The treatment is based on the center
      specific standard of care. The total dose will be between 69 and 73 Gy (definitive treatment)
      and 63 and 66 Gy (adjuvant treatment), the chemotherapy will be cisplatin- based.

      The aim of the analysis is to validate the prognostic impact of potential biomarkers on
      loco-regional control. This will lead to the definition of risk groups and stratification of
      patients and will help to individualize radiotherapy prescription in future trials.
