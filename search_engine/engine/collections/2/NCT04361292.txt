      used procedure for the treatment of patients with unexplained infertility. The fact that IUI
      is less expensive, less invasive, and easier to perform than other assisted reproductive
      techniques makes it the first-line treatment option in infertility treatments. Several
      studies have been published over the past few years examining the relationship between sperm
      DNA fragmentation and IUI outcome. The optimal period for ejaculatory abstinence before the
      semen sample is a controversial issue in the literature. There are only two retrospective
      studies examining the relationship between the ejaculatory abstinence period and pregnancy
      rates after IUI.

      Several studies suggested performing IUI with sperm samples obtained in a shorter abstinence
      period than recommended by WHO. However, there isn't enough research on this issue in the
      literature. Moreover, there is no specific prospective clinical research examining the
      relationship of ejaculatory abstinence period and sperm DNA fragmentation in IUI cycles. The
      aim of this study was to report the effect of ejaculatory abstinence on sperm DNA
      fragmentation and pregnancy rates in IUI cycles, as well as the correlation between the two
