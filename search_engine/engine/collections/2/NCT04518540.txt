      acid in treatment of ALS. The study will recruit 150 ALS patients, then these patients will
      be randomized to lipoic acid group or control group (75 patients per arm) for 6 courses for
      about 5 months. Clinical efficacy and safety assessment will be done at screen/baseline, 3th
      course and 6th course. The specific aims are to compare lipoic acid versus placebo on: (1)
      Lipoic acid could improve the motor function, delay the disease progression and extend
      survival time in patients with ALS, measured by the ALSFRS-R Scale, ROADS Scale, upper motor
      neuron Scale, Muscle strength Scale and Electromyography; (2) Lung function will be collected
      to prove the hypothesis lipoic acid may help respiratory function. (3) Safety index including
      blood and urine routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation index will be recorded.
