      incorporating a split-mouth intra-oral design. Young volunteers (14-35 years old) with at
      least two early lesions in posterior teeth will be enrolled into this clinical trial to
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of arresting lesion progression by infiltrating the
      lesions. The infiltration protocol included application of on-market materials and
      applicators, and was performed in one session.
