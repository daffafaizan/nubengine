    
      There are multiple cohorts in this trial:

        -  5 tumor specific cohorts with HER2 overexpression/amplification (cervical cancer,
           uterine cancer, biliary tract cancer, urothelial cancer, and non-squamous non-small cell
           lung cancer [NSCLC])

        -  2 tumor specific cohorts with HER2 mutations (non-squamous NSCLC and breast cancer)

        -  2 cohorts which will enroll all other HER2 amplified/overexpressed solid tumor types
           (except breast cancer, GEC, and CRC) or HER2-mutated solid tumor types.
