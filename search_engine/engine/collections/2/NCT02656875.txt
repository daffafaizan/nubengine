      parenteral opioid therapy. Eligible patients with moderate to severe pain caused by medical
      conditions or surgery, who require IV opioid therapy may be enrolled in this open label
      safety study. Patients will be treated with TRV130 by IV bolus, PCA administration, or both,
      as determined by the investigator, for a duration not to exceed 14 days. The duration of
      treatment for each patient will be determined by the clinical need for parenteral opioid
      therapy. A follow-up assessment will take place 2-3 days after the completion of the
      treatment phase.
