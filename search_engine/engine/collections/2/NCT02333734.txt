      insufficient insulin secretion and abnormal glucagon secretion. It is however well
      established that physical activity per se improves glucose and may postpone or even slow down
      in the diabetic population. Glycaemic control may be improved more by high intensity interval
      training than by intensities from existing recommended guidelines. Additionally, there seems
      to be accumulating evidence that high intensity interval training induces increased overall
      fat and abdominal fat mass loss as opposed to traditional continuous endurance training
      Therefore we hypothesise that 3 weekly sessions of high intensity interval training (10Ã—60
      sec. at an intensity inducing 90% of maximal heart frequency with a recovery of 60 sec.
      between each bout) over 8 weeks improves overall glycaemic control (glucose, insulin and
      glucagon), inflammatory status (interleukins, cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion
      molecules) and blood flow (NO and PGI2 vasodilatory capabilities).
