      a very common clinical entity with a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% in the adult population.
      Lumbar radiculopathy typically causes back pain and sharp, shooting pain in the leg(s).
      Despite its prevalence and disabling characteristics, sciatica has never been selectively
      studied in drug trials. It is plausible to assume that tricyclic antidepressants and opioids,
      which are effective in the treatment of other neuropathic pain syndromes will be beneficial
      for chronic lumbar radicular pain as well. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, four period cross-over study of chronic lumbar radicular pain. Patient
      selection will target men and women of all ethnic backgrounds between the ages of 18 and 65
      who have had signs and symptoms of sciatica for 3 months or more. Treatments are: 1.
      nortriptyline (25-100 mg); 2. morphine (MS Contin 30-90 mg); 3. nortriptyline (25-100 mg)
      plus morphine, (MS Contin 30-90 mg); 4. combination of an active placebo, benztropine (0.25-1
      mg) and an inert placebo. Patients will be called twice a week to individually titrate doses
      and monitor side effects. The primary outcome measures in this study will be the daily pain
      scores in the low back, in the leg and combined. Patients' quality of life and activities of
      daily living will be secondary outcome measures as assessed by the SF 36 and Oswestry and the
      Beck questionnaires. Fifty one patients will be enrolled in this study and the duration of
      the study will be 37 weeks.
