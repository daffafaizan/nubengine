      standard treatments for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer; however, the role of
      adjuvant chemotherapy is still controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      efficacy of adjuvant FOLFOX for rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine based
      chemoradiotherapy and complete total mesorectal excision.
