      diseases. Perioperative blood glucose concentration was continuously monitored using an
      artificial pancreas system. We prospectively divided into two groups: one for whom glucose
      levels were controlled using a manual injection of insulin according to the commonly used
      sliding scale and another that received programmed infusion of insulin determined by the
      control algorithm of the artificial pancreas.
