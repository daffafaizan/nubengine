      depression. The program includes both face-to-face group sessions and individual telephone
      sessions. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of a mixed mode CBT-AD in
      reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing adherence among adults with DM and subclinical
      depression. The intervention program consists of three components: 1) eight weekly sessions
      of face-to-face interventions, 2) four weekly consolidation individual telephone calls and 3)
      three monthly individual follow-up phone calls.

      This is a prospective randomized two-armed intervention study. The CBT-AD intervention will
      be compared with enhanced treatments usual (ETAU) using a single blinded randomized design.
      The intervention will be delivered by qualified health care professional (e.g. clinical
      psychology/ social worker/ nurse counsellor) who have had some training in CBT in the initial
      training.
