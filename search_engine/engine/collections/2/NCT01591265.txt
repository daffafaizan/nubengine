    
      The study has been designed as a randomised controlled clinical trial. The control group will
      have the normal standard intervention receiving routine patient care with the normal practice
      of upper and lower extractions, whilst the intervention group will have removal of the lower
      tooth but no upper extraction. Study recruitment will take place over an 18 month period and
      will be based in the Dundee Dental Hospital Orthodontic and Paediatric Dentistry Departments.
      Patients are referred to this department from their General Dental Practitioner.

      Consent of the patients will be carried out by the attending dentists who will have received
      training on the study design and protocol, including RGF and consenting patients for clinical
      trials.

      Data will be collected contemporaneously using the Case Report Forms. Additional data which
      will be collected for the purposes of the study will include COHQoL questionnaires and
      measurements from 3D images of models of the teeth.

      At subsequent 1 year and five year review visits dental study 3D models will be repeated, and
      the CRF completed together with the COHQoL questionnaire for that visit.
