      psychopathology, but is especially relevant for individuals with bipolar mood disorders (BD).
      These individuals experience severe and episodic emotion dysregulation associated with
      maladaptive functioning, interpersonal problems, decreased work productivity, and suicidal
      ideation and behavior. To date, both pharmacological and psychosocial treatments fail to
      normalize emotion dysregulation for many bipolar patients. As a consequence, all too many
      experience poor outcomes. Thus, there is a significant need for new innovative approaches to
      target and improve emotion dysregulation in bipolar patients. Non-invasive neuromodulation
      using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may provide a viable strategy to help improve
      emotion dysregulation in bipolar mood disorders. As a first step to test this hypothesis, the
      current proposal seeks to experimentally identify specific neural target sites for improving
      emotion regulation using TMS. If the investigators can demonstrate target engagement of
      emotion regulation at the behavioral level using TMS, this will provide an important first
      step towards examining the potential utility of TMS as a viable strategy to help improve
      emotion dysregulation in bipolar mood disorders. While this is not a definitive clinical
      trial, the sham-controlled double-crossover design of this study will provide valuable
      information for target site selection for the development of TMS as an intervention strategy
      to improve emotion dysregulation in BD.
