      0,5% versus placebo for androgenetic alopecia in female patients.

      The patients and the investigators who analyzes complementary exams are blind.

        -  Clinical criteria, photo, 4mm biopsia, trichogram and trichoscopy are perfomed before
           patients are randomized into two arms :

             1. Group 1 (Placebo):

                30 patients who will have intradermal injections in the scalp of saline 0.9%

             2. Group 2 (Active Drug):

                30 patients who will receive intradermal injections in the scalp with minoxidil
                0.5%/2ml

                Eight weeks after the last session patients will be recruited for repeat the exams
                and perform a self-assessment of both the effect on hair growth and the effect on
                hair loss.
