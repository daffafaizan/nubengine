      independently assess each subject for the degree to which various radiation-induced soft
      tissue changes are evident. Subjects will be put into three groups according to the severity
      of the soft tissue changes which are noted, and the results of the blood tests for members of
      each group will be analyzed to determine whether a correlation with cosmetic outcomes can be
      determined. If the results are promising, they will be studied further and used as the basis
      for future prospective clinical trials.
