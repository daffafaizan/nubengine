      neurologically impaired subjects such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of different percentages BWSTT on gait, balance, quality of life
      and fatigue in moderate to advanced PD. Thirty five patients were randomly assigned to one of
      the three groups according to the percentage unweighed: 0% BWSTT, 10% BWSTT and 20% BWSTT.
      All patients participated 30 minutes BWSTT sessions 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Primary
      outcomes were 6 minute walk test (6MWT), Berg balance scale (BBS), Unified Parkinson's
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); and secondary outcomes were Nottingham health profile (NHP),
      Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) which were performed at the
      beginning and end of the rehabilitation.
