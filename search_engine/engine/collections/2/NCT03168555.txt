      diarrhoea (BAD), a disease with increasing estimated of prevalence.

      BAD is occasionally triggered by cholecystectomy and FGF19 and C4 is known to be affected by
      cholecystectomy. The investigators are exploring if FGF19 after oral stimulation can be
      developed to a universal test for BAD, and need to know how the proposed test is affected by
      cholecystectomy.
