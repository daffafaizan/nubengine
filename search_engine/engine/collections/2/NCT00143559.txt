    
      Secondary outcome evaluations for this clinical study included the following:

        -  To estimate one-year overall survival for research participants with high risk
           malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT

        -  To compare overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse for the two groups of
           patients with their corresponding historical controls

        -  To estimate disease-free survival and event-free survival in participants with
           hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT

        -  To estimate the incidence of overall grade 3-4 acute GvHD in research participants with
           hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT

        -  To estimate the incidence of chronic GvHD and graft failure in research participants
           with hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT

        -  To estimate the incidence of non-hematologic regimen-related toxicity and
           regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days post-transplant in research participants
           with hematologic malignancies who receive a haploidentical HSCT

        -  To estimate the number of research participants who develop evidence of EBV reactivation
           or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLPD)

        -  To describe disease-free survival, GvHD and engraftment in research participants
           receiving grafts from Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatched and KIR
           matched haploidentical donors
