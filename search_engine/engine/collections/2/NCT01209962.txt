      and chemotherapy, depending on the location of the cancer and other individual patient health
      factors. The goals of therapy are to reduce or eliminate the cancer cells, but without
      serious damage to normal cells.Each patient is unique in terms of the cancer type and
      location and its sensitivity to treatments. Investigators at The University of Michigan are
      conducting a research project to see if treatment effects on an individual patient's cancer
      cells can be detected early by new imaging tests in patients with resectable pancreatic
      cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Each patient is unique in terms of the
      cancer type and location and its sensitivity to treatments.
