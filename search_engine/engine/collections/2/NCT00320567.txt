      with anorexia nervosa, there have been no previous definitive placebo-controlled studies
      evaluating the effectiveness of oral contraceptive treatment on bone mineral density in
      pediatric females with anorexia nervosa. This is a randomized (patients are assigned
      different treatments based on chance), multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the
      physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage),
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the bone mineral density in pediatric patients with
      anorexia nervosa following treatment with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol or placebo for 13
      consecutive 28-day cycles. Norgestimate/Ethinyl Estradiol is packaged in a 28-day
      blistercard. Each tablet contains the following:

      a) Days 1-7 0.180 mg norgestimate/0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol b) Days 8-14 0.215 mg

      estradiol d) Days 22-28 inactive tablets;One tablet is to be taken once daily by mouth. After
