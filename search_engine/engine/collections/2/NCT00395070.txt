      product designed to train your body's immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells) vs.
      a 33% chance of receiving standard chemotherapy (either dacarbazine or temozolomide). The
      treatment course recommended for patients who receive Allovectin-7® is a minimum of 16 weeks.
      Each cycle will consist of weekly injections of Allovectin-7® alone for six weeks followed by
      two weeks of observation and assessments. For patients who receive the chemotherapy alone,
      their treatment course will follow standard dosing. During the trial all patients' tumors
      will be closely monitored. Patients whose melanoma does not clinically progress will be
      encouraged to continue on the treatment and be assessed for up to two years.
