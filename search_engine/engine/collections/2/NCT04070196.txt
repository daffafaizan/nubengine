      peritonitis at home and seeking medical help early.

      We hypothesize that PeriplexÂ® is not inferior to routine leukocyte testing of PD Fluid
      effluent in the diagnosis of peritonitis. The test strip is designed to detect the
      inflammatory markers (IL6 and MMP-8) which are usually released during peritonitis. The strip
      is intended to be used in the PD patients who suspected to have symptoms of peritonitis. The
      target population is all adult PD patients who are followed up in Singapore General Hospital
      and have signs and symptoms suspected of peritonitis during the study period. The test is
      considered positive for peritonitis if one or both test lines appear in the window of the
      test strip.

      The test will be performed at 2-time points, one at the presentation of peritonitis and one
      at the completion of antibiotics for the current episode of peritonitis, to document
      resolution of peritonitis.

      The results of the tests will be compared with the leukocyte testing of PD effluent.
