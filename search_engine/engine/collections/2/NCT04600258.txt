      chocolate group and control group. The chocolate group is receiving 40g of dark chocolate per
      day for 2 months and the control group is not receiving any intervention. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) are being isolated for expression of Nrf2, NF-kB, and NADPH quinone
      oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antioxidant
      enzymes activity (catalase-CAT and glutathione peroxidase-GPx), high-sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (hs-CRP) will be assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
