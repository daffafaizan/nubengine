      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex. Utilizing experimental neuropsychological tasks during functional
      MRI on healthy adult volunteers, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing as opposed to the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, involved in nonsocial-events (planning, problem solving,
      economic exchange and reasoning). We will also attempt to determine the relationship between
      non-frontal neural structures involved in emotional expression, such as the amygdala, and
      those frontal neural structures involved in executive functions that may modulate emotion.
      Another goal of our study is to test different fMRI sequences to determine which one gives us
      the best quality of signal in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (affected by signal
      drop-out due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts). The data that we collect in this protocol
      will be of value in (1) identifying a set of neural regions and distributed networks
      mediating the forms of knowledge representation stored in the prefrontal cortex, and (2)
      contributing to optimization of functional imaging of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex
      at high field strength (3 Tesla). We will also use the data obtained in these studies to
      constrain theories of frontal lobe function and to provide evidence for the role of specific
      frontal cortex sectors in specific cognitive functions.
