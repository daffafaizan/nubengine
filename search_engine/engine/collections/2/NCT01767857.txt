      a reasonable expectation. Instead, the primary goal of anti-tumor therapy at this stage is to
      eliminate or reduce the symptomatic effects of the tumor, while trying to prolong survival
      for as long as possible. Due to treatment related morbidity however, few treatment modalities
      are ideal for this objective. Even with the most recent targeted agents (such as multi-kinase
      inhibitors), drug related toxicities frequently lead to relatively short treatment durations.
      With discontinuation of therapy, disease progression is uncontrolled and prognosis is poor.

      New agents that control disease progression-while improving tumor-related symptoms, rather
      than causing significant therapy related morbidity-are vitally needed to treat patients with
      advanced cancer, including those with colorectal cancer. An approach has been taken to
      develop such an agent using a monoclonal antibody to block the chronic inflammation involved
      in both malignant disease progression and constitutional symptoms.

      Xilonix™ is expected to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis by interrupting crucial signals
      that drive angiogenesis and invasiveness. The antibody therapy may also block tumor
      microenvironment infiltration by leukocytes (such as myeloid suppressor cells) that suppress
      antitumor immunity, enabling better host immune control of the disease. In addition to local
      effects on the tumor, Xilonix™ is expected to work systemically to correct the metabolic
      dysregulation, fatigue and anxiety mediated by chronic inflammatory signaling to the central
      nervous system.
