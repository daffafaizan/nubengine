    
      The main purpose of this phase IIIb study is to test the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab
      in combination with bevacizumab compared to TACE in patients with intermediate stage liver
      cancer.

      Primary efficacy objective is to assess the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with
      bevacizumab compared to TACE in patients with intermediate stage liver cancer.

      The secondary efficacy objective is to further characterize the responses obtained with the
      respective therapeutic strategy and to assess the impact of each therapeutic strategy on
      liver function over time.

      Furthermore the objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of each therapeutic
      strategy and their respective impact on Quality of Life and to identify prognostic and
      predictive angiogenic and immune related biomarkers (tissue and circulating) for study
      endpoints.

      This is a Phase IIIb, randomised, multicenter, open-label study. Approximately 434 patients
      suffering from intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled in this trial.
      Patients will be recruited from up to 60 sites in 10 different countries.
