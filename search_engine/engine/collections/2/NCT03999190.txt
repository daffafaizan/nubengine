      in a counterbalanced design, to measure binding potential (BPND) under baseline conditions
      and 3-hours following oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg amphetamine in the same 30 MF-S and 30
      HC. The main outcome measures will be baseline BPND and the percent change in BPND induced by
      amphetamine, denoted âˆ†BPND, in the subdivisions of the striatum. In addition, all subjects
      will undergo fMRI while performing a WM task concurrent with both the initial pre- and
      initial post-amphetamine PET scans to explore the relationship between DCA DA transmission
      and fMRI BOLD response in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during a WM task.
