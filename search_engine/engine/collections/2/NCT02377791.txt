      Tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor, is commonly used in kidney transplant patients
      worldwide. Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index. Overdosing increases the risk of
      dose-related adverse drug reactions and infections, whereas underdosing increases the risk of
      rejection and graft loss. In addition, achieving therapeutic tacrolimus levels is complicated
      by high intra- and inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability of the drug. Though, the
      source of pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus is not fully understood. It is known that
      the inter-individual variation in metabolism of tacrolimus is at least partly due to
      differences in expression of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 enzyme, one of the key proteins
      involved in tacrolimus systematic clearance.

      Mutations due to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the gene encoding CYP 3A5 have been
      demonstrated to affect their expression. Among CYP3A5 alleles, CYP3A5*1 has been found to be
      the main allele associated with CYP 3A5 expression, whereas the mutant allele CYP3A5*3
      prevents expression of the enzyme. Several studies have shown that this mutation affects the
      dosing of tacrolimus.

      The frequency of CYP3A5 SNP varies among different ethnic populations . In a small study in
      Thais, the frequency of , CYP3A5*1/*1 genotyping was identified in 20.6% of patients,
      CYP3A5*1/*3 in 35.3% and CYP3A5*3/*3 in 44.1%.

      To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study on the impacts of the CYP 3A5
      genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus blood concentration and acute rejection rate during the
      very early stage post-transplantation in Thai kidney transplant recipients. Evaluation of
      CYP3A5 polymorphisms may be helpful in determining an appropriate starting dose, timely
      achieving target levels, and improving outcomes of tacrolimus-based therapy in this group of
      patients.

      Therefore, we are to determine the impacts of CYP 3A5 genetic polymorphisms on tacrolimus
      trough blood concentration during the first post-operative week and acute rejection rate at
      3-month post-transplantation comparing between CYP3A5 expressers (CYP3A5*1 homozygotes or
      heterozygotes) and CYP3A5 non-expressers (CYP3A5*3 homozygotes).

      Methods:

      Study population:

      This retrospective analytical study will be performed at Ramathibodi hospital, Bangkok,
      Thailand. Thai recipients who underwent kidney transplantation between January 2011 and
      December 2013.

      Data collection:

      Demographics and clinical data will be gathered from the medical files and records. Blood
      samples will be collected for determination of genotypes of CYP3A5, other metabolic enzymes
      and transport proteins with respect to their corresponding effects on the pharmacokinetics of
      tacrolimus.

      Approval for this study will be obtained from the ethics committee of Ramathibodi hospital,
      Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University.

      Number of samples:

      According to the study of Sang-Il Min, et al , the effect of CYP3A5*1 allele with early acute
      rejection and graft function in patients with kidney transplants who received tacrolimus.
      CYP3A5 expressers (n=29) had the mean trough concentration to dose ratio of 127.09 ± 69.40
      ng/mL/mg/kg. While CYP3A5 non-expressers (n=33) had the mean trough concentration to dose
      ratio of 220.99 ± 108.95 ng/mL/mg/kg on day 10 after kidney transplantation.

      The sample size is estimated using the formula: n/group=2(Zα + Zβ)2σ2/(µ1-µ2)2 Given dose
      adjusted Co of Tac among expressor µ1= 127.09±69.40 and the different at least 25% would have
      clinical significant so the absolute different was 30. Calculated sample size was at least 85
      patients per group so the total subjects would be at least 170 patients.
