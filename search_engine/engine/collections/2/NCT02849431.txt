      people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. A battery of measures will be
      administered at baseline, in a time window of six to zero weeks prior to the start of the
      intervention. Outcome measures will be repeated in the two weeks after the end of the
      eight-week intervention, along with a qualitative interview.
