      over the same period the number of patients being sent to rehabilitation settings have
      tripled . For those who do survive, the latest data indicate that 50-70% of ICU "survivors"
      will suffer cognitive impairment and 60-80% of "survivors" will suffer functional impairment
      or ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW).Still,there is a lack valid data on the long-term impact on
      morbidity from prospective observational studies. Therefore, the investigators designed an
      observational cohort which cover a broader range of outcomes to quantify long-term physical,
      psychological, and cognitive impairment after intensive care unit (ICU).Intensive Care Unit
      patients survive from critical illness will be approached for study recruitment and
      participation.Survival rate,Quality of life,Cognitive impairments,Depression and
      anxiety,PTSD,Physical activity,Neuromuscular impairment will be assessed 3 or 6 months after
      ICU discharge.
