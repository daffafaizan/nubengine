      angiography and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention .

      The development of Contrast Induced Nephropathy after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention is
      associated with poor clinical outcomes including prolonged hospitalization, increased costs,
      increased rates of end-stage renal failure, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization,
      and short- and long-term mortality.

      Contrast Induced Nephropathy follows decreased renal perfusion and administration of
      nephrotoxic medications as the third most common cause of renal insufficiency during
      hospitalization.

      Patients with acute coronary syndrome have a 3-fold higher risk of developing Contrast
      Induced Nephropathy .Therefore ,predicting contrast nephropathy and initiating therapeutic
      preventive strategies are very important.

      Red Blood Cell Distribution Width is a quantitive marker of the variability on size of
      erythrocyte.

      It is a routine assay of Complete Blood Count that doesn't require an additional cost, that
      is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the mean cell size by the Mean
      Corpuscular Volume of the red cells and multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage.

      Normal range of Red Blood Cell Distribution Width 11-16%. Increased Red Blood Cell
      Distribution Width means increased variability in red blood cell size owing to ineffective
      erythrocyte production, which is associated with indices of inflammation and pro-inflammatory
      cytokines such as interleukin-6 .

      On the other hand, suggested mechanisms underlying Contrast Induced Nephropathy include
      cytotoxic effects, factors that affect renal hemodynamic, and regional hypoxia.
