           tone in adult humans with elevated blood pressure to a greater extent than either
           metoprolol or placebo.

        2. The investigators further hypothesize that reducing ET-1 vasoconstrictor activity
           contributes to the improvement in endothelial vasodilator function associated with
           nebivolol.
