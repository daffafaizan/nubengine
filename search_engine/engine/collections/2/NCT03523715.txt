      Improved management of constipation among these patients has the potential to both alleviate
      pain and for significant savings for health care systems. This is a prospective, randomized
      control trial that randomizes patients post-operatively into standard care versus standard
      care plus prunes. The primary objective is to determine the time to first bowel movement
      after surgery. Secondary objectives are pain associated with first bowel movement, stool
      consistency using Bristol stool form scale, compliance and patient satisfaction. The study
      population includes women over the age of 18 undergoing benign gynecologic surgery with
      overnight stay. Patients in the control arm will take 100 mg docusate twice per day for 3
      days (standard care). Participants in the treatment arm will consume 4 oz prunes daily and
      take 100 mg docusate twice per day for 3 days. Follow-up phone calls will be made 3 and 5
      days postoperatively to inquire about primary and secondary outcomes. Participants will be
      randomized to the treatment or control group at a 1:1 ratio and using randomization blocks of
      6. Participant characteristics will be presented as means and standard deviations for
      continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. The primary and
      secondary outcomes will be assessed using two-sample t-tests.
