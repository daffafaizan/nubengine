      with insomnia will be enrolled, and will undergo GV20, EX-HN-1, GV21, GV22, GV23, GV24, GV29,
      and bilateral GB13 acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks.

      The primary outcomes of therapeutic effect on insomnia are changes of the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale (HADS).The time frame of the three primary outcomes are: baseline week 0, week 2, week
      4 and week 6.

      The secondary outcomes of therapeutic effect on insomnia are sleep parameters including sleep
      efficiency (SE), sleep awakenings (SA) and total sleep time (TST) recorded by the actigraphy
      (time frame: baseline week 0, week 2, week 4 and week 6), as well as the heart rate
      viability(HRV) recorded by the ECG monitor (time frame: baseline week 0, week1, week 2, week
      3, week 4 and week 6; and 30 minutes before and 60 minutes after acupuncture through study
      completion).
