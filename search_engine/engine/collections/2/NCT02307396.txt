      relapse-prevention should be continued and to which time a patient is protected enough, so
      that a guided withdrawal or reduction of the medication seems appropriate. Relapse is defined
      as primary outcome. We include patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in
      remission for at least 3 years under a stable antipsychotic medication.
