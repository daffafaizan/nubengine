      and most trials of adjuvant chemotherapy do not improve survival rates. However, it has shown
      that chemo-radiotherapy can substantially increase survival rates after gastric resection in
      a recent intergroup randomized study (INT 0116) that used adjuvant chemoradiation of
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin concurrently with total dose of 4500 cGy of
      external-beam radiation treatment (RT) to the abdominal tumor nodal field in patients with
      resected, locally advanced gastric cancer. However, since the most common recurrences in both
      arms (surgery only vs. surgery followed by chemoradiation) were regional, typically abdominal
      carcinomatosis, this may indicate the need for adjuvant ip floxuridine to be added to
      adjuvant chemoradiation. Our experience for ip floxuridine leads us to hypothesize that the
      addition of this type of therapy to adjuvant chemoradiation may further increase the
      cure-rate for patient under-going potentially curative gastric resection. It seems important
      to convincingly demonstrate the effect of ip floxuridine treatment combined with the
      chemoradiation regimen. This became the basis for the design of this Phase II study, which
      will test the toxicity and efficacy of ip floxuridine added to chemo-radiation of the INT
      0116 study. The protocol is to be completed in three years, and it may become a springboard
      for planning and initiation of a pivotal multi-institutional trials.
