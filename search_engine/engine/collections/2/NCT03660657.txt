      of patients with symptomatic refractory ischemic heart disease, III-IV functional class of
      the classification of the New York Heart Association (NYHA).

      MAIN OBJECTIVES: 1) to evaluate clinical effect and quality of life related to health (HRQOL)
      of adding O3 to the standard treatment of these patients. 2) to estimate the additional costs
      of adding O3 to the standard treatment and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 3) To evaluate the evolution of a) biochemical parameters; b)
      cardiovascular parameters; c) toxicity of O3. 4) Develop and evaluate the acceptability of a
      shared decision-making (SDM) tool between professionals and patients.

      METHODOLOGY: Phase II-III clinical trial, randomized, triple-blind. Sample size: 18 patients.

      TREATMENT: All patients will receive their standard treatment + 40 sessions of rectal
      insufflation:

        1. Ozone-Group (n = 9): O3/O2 concentration progressively increased from 10 to 30 µg/ml.

        2. Control-placebo-Group (n = 9): O3/O2 Concentration = 0 µg/ml (only O2).

      Main Variables: 1) changes in the self-perceived quality of life (Minnesota scale). 2) Direct
      costs.

      Secondary Variables: 1) biochemical parameters; 2) Cardiovascular parameters; 3) Side
      effects. 4) acceptability of patients to a shared decision-making (SDM) tool.

      Length of treatment: 16 weeks.

      Follow-up: 16 weeks after completion of O3.

      Assessments: 1) Pre-O3 (basal), 2) pos-O3 (end of O3), 3) 4 months pos-O3.

      Planned length of clinical trial: 36 months.
