      persistent fatigue and endorse it as the most distressing and challenging symptom that
      affects daily life. Chronic fatigue has a devastating impact on individuals because it leads
      to reduced participation in everyday life. Despite the high incidence of post-TBI fatigue and
      its impact on everyday life, these is a dearth of studies examining the effectiveness of
      non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of post-TBI fatigue. This study is unique
      in that it will examine the effectiveness of a non-pharmacological intervention to manage
      post-TBI fatigue. The Maximizing Energy (MAX) Intervention, individuals with post-TBI fatigue
      will reduce the impact of fatigue on everyday life by actively seeking and implementing
      solutions for their fatigue-related problems, thus promoting their reintegration into the
      community.
