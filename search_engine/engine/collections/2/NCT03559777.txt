      tapping force, which should be sufficient enough to infracture the sinus floor cortical bone
      but restrained enough to prevent the osteotome tip from traumatizing the Schneiderian
      membrane.

      Several surgical techniques have been proposed to minimize the sinus membrane perforation
      rate by using a piezosurgical device, balloon, hydrostatic pressure.

      The success of therapy in posterior maxilla is not only dependent on the success of the sinus
      elevation but also the primary stability of the implant that allow bone apposition on the
      implant surface without any micromovement for osseeointegration.

      Later, densah burs are introduced as another treatment option for internal transalveolar
      approach of sinus floor elevation with improving primary stability of implant by
      osseodensification.

      As treatment options of edentulous maxillary today may include dental implants, the
      practitioner must be familiar with various sinus lift surgical techniques in order to choose
      an ideal treatment option for the patient.
