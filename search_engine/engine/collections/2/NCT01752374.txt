      and amount of PCEA infusion and rescue pethidine were monitored after the end of surgery
      during four time periods: 0-2 h; 2-6 h; 6-24 h; and 24-48 h. Nausea was defined as the
      subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit; vomiting
      included retching (defined as the laboured spastic, rhythmic contraction of the respiratory
      muscles without the expulsion of the gastric contents) and vomiting (defined as the forceful
      expulsion of gastric contents from the mouth) [11]. A complete response was defined as no
      PONV and no need for rescue anti-emetic drug. If two or more episodes of PONV occurred during
      the study period, a rescue anti-emetic (metoclopramide 10 mg) was given IV. The primary
      outcome was the incidence of nausea during the study period.
