    
      In this study we will evaluate the efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical block
      associated with balanced general anesthesia with remifentanil as opioid of choice in
      preventing postoperative pain in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with mini
      incision without neck dissection.A hundred and twenty patients ASA I - II will be assessed
      and allocated randomly (through a table of random numbers) into three groups for analgesia
      for post-operative:

      Group 1: bilateral superficial cervical block with 20 ml of 0.9% saline (placebo); Group 2:
      bilateral superficial cervical block with 20 ml ropivacaine 0.25%; Group 3: bilateral
      superficial cervical block with 20 ml ropivacaine 0.5%.
