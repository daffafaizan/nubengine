      tests twice, on different days (see protocol description), in a corridor and on a treadmill,
      until reaching their limit of tolerance. In the test performed on the treadmill and in the
      one performed in the corridor, subjects will simultaneously use the VO 2000. And the
      volunteers will fill out the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).
