      inspiratory muscle training in dynamic situations.

      Objetive: To examine the effects of FB on lung ventilation, gas exchange and heart rate
      during exercise in patients with COPD.

      Methods: 20 men with COPD with a forced expiratory volume in the first second between 30% and
      70% of its predicted value were selected. In the first visit to the laboratory, baseline
      static maximum inspiratory pressure and spirometry were performed previous to the exercise.
      Then, a maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed to determine
      ventilatory and cardiac parameters. During the second day, each participant conducted two
      tests with 30 min of rest between them. Exercise protocol was an identical walk on a
      treadmill for 10 minutes at a constant rate at 50% of VO2peak. Each test was performed
      randomnly in two different conditions: 1) oronasal breathing (ONB); and 2) nasal breathing
      through the FB.

      Results: Lung ventilation and gas exchange during exercise in COPD patients was modified
      during exercise using FB. Our results showed a positive effects of FB vs ONB on dynamic
      hyperinflation, an improved breathing pattern and breathing efficiency, higher expiratory and
      inspiratory time and higher perceived effort. Despite these differences, blood oxygen
      saturation percentage, oxygen uptake and heart rate showed similar response between both
      conditions.

      Conclusions: The new device FB used during exercise in COPD patients influenced ventilatory
      responses to an efficiency breathing compared to oronasal mode.
