      between 2mg/kg or 60mg/1m2 for 6-4 weeks and the duration of the first steroid course is
      between 8 weeks to 6 months. The bases of this treatment have been put in the early 70s.
      Since then most of the study were focused on the duration of the therapy with a results that
      8-12 weeks course is as good as 6 month. Studies have showed no difference in response rate
      between 2mg/kg to 60m2' although the difference in the dose in young children can rich to
      25%. Other retrospective analysis been show that patients who response in the first 7-9 days
      tend to have lass relapses than other patients. In our nephrology clinic the investigators
      there is ongoing clinical study on low doses of steroid therapy for relapse of nephritic
      syndrome with good results.
