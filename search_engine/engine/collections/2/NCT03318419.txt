      vast majority of patients with ALL will die of the disease, and no standard chemotherapy
      regimen were defined for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. Our previous experience has
      shown that Cladribine in combination of GAP(G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and
      Pegaspargase) are effective with tolerable toxicity profiling.Thus, this phase 2 clincial
      trial is going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cladribine in combination with G-CSF,
      low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin (C-CAG) in patients with refractory/relapsed acute
      myeloid leukemia.
