      substantial research expressing the need for HIV prevention services for ex-offenders
      postrelease, this population has limited access to quality programming and services related
      to HIV risk reduction. This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction
      intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being
      released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area.The study will utilize
      qualitative and quantitative methods to inform and adapt an HIV prevention intervention for
      this study population.
