      cancer is three to four times greater in men than in women. However, women are diagnosed with
      more advanced disease at presentation and have less favorable outcomes after treatment.
      Statistical data show that between 2002 and 2012, worldwide, the number of bladder cancers
      increased from 375.000 to about 430.000 , while the mortality increased from 145.000 patients
      in 2002 up to 165.000 patients in 2012. In the United States, bladder cancer is the fourth
      most common cancer in males with an age-adjusted incidence rate of 37.3/100,000 person years
      (PY) using the US standard population.

      In developed countries, over 90% of the bladder cancer cases diagnosed are transitional cell
      carcinoma (TCC), with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinomas, and rare types of
      bladder cancer comprising the remaining 10% of bladder cancer cases.

      Exposures to tobacco smoke, occupational toxins, and environmental sources of heavy metals
      such as arsenic are the major reported risk factors for TCC.

      Unlike TCC, the main risk factors for SCC are not environmental exposures, but exposure to
      infectious agents. Age, smoking, tumor stage and the treatment modalities such as surgery and
      adjuvant chemotherapy were proved to affect the overall survival in patients with urinary
      bladder cancer. Our study may give an important evidence about clinical, epidemiological
      factors and clinical outcomes in urinary bladder cancer patients at Assuit University
      Hospital.
