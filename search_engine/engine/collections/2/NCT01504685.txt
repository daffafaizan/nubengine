      has been recognized as the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. However, the debate
      about the best surgical procedure is still considerable.

      Among a wide range of operations that have been used for morbid obesity, Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (RYGB) has shown an appropriate risk/benefit balance and has achieved a high degree of
      acceptance in America.

      The weight loss pattern in RYGB is characteristic and includes significant eight loss during
      the first 2 years after surgery, followed by some weight regain after the second or third
      postoperative year. To prevent this some authors suggest the placement of a premeasured band
      or ring around the gastric reservoir, adjacent to the gastroenterostomy. This procedure has
      been called banded RYGB.
