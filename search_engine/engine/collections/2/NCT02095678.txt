      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients will lead to improved tissue characterization,
      resulting in fewer ambiguous readings and thus fewer biopsies. As each component of the
      proposed methodology has been experimentally validated in the investigators preliminary work,
      the next appropriate step would be to evaluate the clinical feasibility of the exam. The
      investigators goal is to test the ability of quantitative MRI techniques to provide high
      quality images of the liver and to differentiate liver lesions from one another in a time
      frame shorter than a current clinical exam.
