    
      Data concerning patients' Health Related Quality of Life as well as the cost of the disease
      treatment were collected at four subsequent periods and specifically at baseline (Visit 1),
      and at months 3, 6 and 12.

      Moreover, at baseline patients' socioeconomic, and history of illness data as well as the use
      of other prescribed medication and costs due to rheumatoid arthritis have been recorded, in
      order to identify patients' health state before adalimumab treatment initiation.

      Patients discontinuing therapy (drop-outs) either due to adverse events or on their own
      initiative were categorized and analyzed separately, while reasons leading to discontinuation
      were recorded. Adverse events were not collected in this study with the exception of adverse
      events leading to withdrawal.

      In order to evaluate the cost-utility of adalimumab both the cost of the disease treatment
      and the Health Related Quality of Life of rheumatoid arthritis patients have been taken into
      account. The process is described below:

      Face-to-face interviews were conducted by the physicians/investigators in charge in all four
      subsequent periods as well as before adalimumab treatment initiation. A questionnaire,
      divided into the following sections, was administered: 1. Patients' Sociodemographic
      Characteristics 2. Measurement of Health Related Quality of Life in Rheumatoid Arthritis
      patients 3. Cost Assessment
