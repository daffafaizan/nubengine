    
      Approximately 100 participants from primary care will be enrolled via General Practitioner
      (GP) or Primary Care Centers in Dublin. A patient information sheet (PIS) will be made
      accessible to participants recovering from COVID-19 via their GP practice inviting the
      participants to contact Cardiovascular Research Institute Dublin. The participants, subject
      to suitability, will be invited for a site visit over two days, where upon explicit consent
      being granted, the Investigators will proceed with data collection. The study population
      includes participants who are recovering from COVID-19 in the community.

      Primary Objective

      To investigate the incidence of cardiac abnormalities as assessed by cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging in unselected participants after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlation
      with immunological response and biomarkers of coagulation.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity and

        -  To investigate the extent of coagulopathy persistent after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Follow-up data collection points will be at 1, 6- and 12-months including assessment of major
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as myocardial infarction (MI), revascularization,
      pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thromboembolism (DVT), incident heart failure and
      stroke. 'Patient reported outcome measures' via two quality of life (QOL) questionnaires will
      be administered at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.
