    
      This 50-week multicenter and multinational clinical study is comprised of a 2-week screening
      period, a 6-week open-label dose-titration period followed by a variable duration maintenance
      period (up to 42 weeks).

      Patients with at least 12 weeks of investigational product exposure who meet the protocol
      specified responder criterion at two consecutive visits separated by at least two weeks are
      eligible to transition to a randomized withdrawal study. A responder is defined as a patient
      who demonstrates at least a 10 point improvement (reduction in score) in the Social
      Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total raw score relative to the Visit 1 total raw score.

      Weight based dose limits were selected in this study to ensure that exposure in terms of area
      under the curve (AUC) was less than the predefined limit of 2100 ng·h/mL which represents a
      10-fold lower exposure than observed at the No observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 15
      mg/kg/day in juvenile rats.

      The weight-based dose limits in this study were as follows:

        -  Group A: ≥ 60 kg; maximum 15 mg/day

        -  Group B: 40-59 kg; maximum 9 mg/day

        -  Group C: 20-39 kg; maximum 6 mg/day

        -  Group D: < 20 kg; maximum 3 mg/day
