      to increase the CSA of the carpal tunnel and the median nerve in cadavers. These changes are
      important because they may relate to the decrease in CTS symptoms.

      Patients with mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome will be selected for the trial. They
      will be randomized in 2 groups. One group will wear an standard splint for carpal tunnel
      syndrome and the other the decompression prototype splint.
