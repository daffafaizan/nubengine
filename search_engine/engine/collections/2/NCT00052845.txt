        -  Determine the time to objective and biochemical progression and response proportion
           (objective and post-therapy changes in PSA) in patients with hormone refractory
           metastatic prostate cancer treated with docetaxel, estramustine, and exisulind.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5, docetaxel IV over 1
      hour on day 2, and oral exisulind twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
