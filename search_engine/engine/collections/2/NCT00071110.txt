      lower quality of life, significant functional impairment, and premature death due to suicide
      or comorbid physical illness. Over the past 50 years, effective and safe treatments for major
      depression have been developed, including antidepressant pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and
      electroconvulsive therapy. However, many Americans who suffer from a depressive disorder
      either do not elect to receive one of these conventional treatments or do not complete an
      adequate course of treatment. A growing number of Americans with depression are choosing to
      be treated with complementary and alternative therapies. Acupuncture, in particular, is
      increasingly being used to treat depression even though only limited data support its safety
      and efficacy.

      This study will use a randomized parallel-group design to compare the safety, efficacy, and
      tolerability of electroacupuncture (EA) and sham electroacupuncture (SA) for the treatment of
      major depression. Over a 15-month period, 60 adult outpatients with a major depressive
      disorder of mild or moderate severity (as defined by the DSM-IV) will be randomized to either
      12 sessions of EA or SA to be provided over 6 weeks. Safety and symptomatic improvement (as
      measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD]) will constitute the primary
      outcome measures. Tolerability and functional improvement will constitute secondary outcome
      measures.
