      learning (LBL) is the best known of conventional teaching methods. The main purpose of a
      lecture is knowledge transfer [1] and its great advantage is that of transferring knowledge
      from one individual to several or many. Knowledge transfer via LBL is still widely used in
      international medical congresses, in continuing medical education online via downloading of
      lectures offered by leading medical schools, and in postgraduate medical education in several
      countries. We showed that in prospective study of 13 lectures that two thirds of critical
      care junior doctors identified at best only one of the three main take-home messages of a
      lecture, suggesting that knowledge transfer is poor during passive format learning.

      In this study, we assess the impact of an intervention including the identification of
      take-home message of lecture with slides calling "Learning Objectives", "Message",
      "Conclusion", in the identification of take-home message in critical care junior doctors.

      6 lectures are performed by professor without specific orders. 6 lectures are performed by
      professor with the intervention. Both groups of professors do not know this study The
      critical care juniors do not know the intervention. We compare the take-home messages of
      students with those of lecturer, 1 month after the lecture.
