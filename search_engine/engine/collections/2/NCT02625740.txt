      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravascular percutaneous catheter-delivered high
      intensity, low-frequency ultrasound utilizing CardioProlific Genesisâ„¢ System to improve local
      paclitaxel delivery effect in patients with CLI due to femoral-popliteal calcific lesions and
      occlusions. The protocol was approved by a Local Review Boards and the Institutional Ethics
      Committee. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. The trial was
      conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.

      Randomization Randomization occurred after successful crossing and pre-dilatation of the
      target lesion with a standard percutaneous angioplasty balloon without sub-intimal approach
      and/or flow limiting dissections. Patients were enrolled when a successful angiographic
      control was performed after PTA pre-dilatation. Subjects were randomly assigned by a
      computer-generated random sequence (2 blocks in a 1:1 ratio). Randomization was done in
      advance for all patients and without any stratification. The patients and physicians involved
      in the follow-up control were blinded to the treatment assignments through the completion of
      all 6 month follow-up evaluation. Operators were not blinded due to differences in treatment
      protocol. Twenty eight (28) patients were treated with an intravascular percutaneous
      catheter-delivered high intensity, low-frequency ultrasound and local Paclitaxel delivery
      with temporarily blood flow occlusion created by distal occlusion balloon (Study Group), and
      twenty eight (28) patients were treated with drug eluting balloon with conventional method
      (Control Group).
