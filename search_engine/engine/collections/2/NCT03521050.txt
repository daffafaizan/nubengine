    
      All patients having an ICD implanted and having follow-up at the investigators center are
      included in this retrospective ICD lead registry from 2006 onwards. Data is collected
      prospectively from december 2016 onwards. After certain ICD-leads tended to fail early the
      investigators aimed for a registry monitoring our patient population with defibrillator leads
      and evaluating their long-term performance.

      The following parameters will be measured during regular clinical controls: electronic
      impedances, threshold values, sensing values, battery performance, inadequate/adequate shock
      release und software problems
