      patients with or without cachexia, perineural invasion and diabetes.

      Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, based on the results of an endoscopic
      ultrasonography (EUS) biopsy or surgery were enrolled at the diagnosis and blood samples are
      drawn.

      Thus the investigators propose to identify the protein expression levels of Activin and
      Midkine in plasma of patients with different stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared
      with benign pancreatic disorders and healthy patients and to evaluate the possible
      correlation with diabetes, tumor size and tumor stage.

      Furthermore, the investigators propose to identify the prognostic role of these biomarkers in
      the development of metastasis and survival in patients with adenocarcinoma, with and without
      diabetes and cachexia; to identify a new biomarker predictive of cachexia and eventually to
      select patients likely to benefit from treatment with antagonists of activin (or hypoglycemic
      treatment) and investigating the role of invasion neural in the appearance of cachexia in
      patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      Follow-up: with phone-calls on an every 6 month, for up to 2 years, retaining the following
      data: survival, date of decease and its direct cause, the presence of tumor recurrence.
