      schistosomiasis and the immunological and nutritional status of children. In this scope, the
      investigators conducted a case-control study where one group of children is infected with
      schistosoma haematobium and the other is not infected with this parasite.

      The investigators then stimulated whole blood of these children with various vaccine antigens
      to address their immune function and study the influence of schistosomiasis infectious state
      on their overall immune condition.

      Aims of the study:

      To evaluate the interaction between schistosomiasis and the nutritional status of children
      and their haemoglobinemia.

      To evaluate the influence of schistosomiasis on children's specific immune response towards
      EPI vaccine antigens, the inflammatory status of children and nutritional serologic markers.

      To compare schistosomiasis diagnostic tools (evaluation of circulating cathodic antigen (CCA)
      strip for diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis in comparison with microscopy and urinary
      dipsticks)

      To study prevalence of intestinal parasites such as Blastocystis hominis
