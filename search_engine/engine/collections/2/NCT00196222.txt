      catheters is a standard procedure and in experienced EP laboratories, the safety and efficacy
      of this approach is very high.

      However, the potential complication of higher degree AV conduction block, requiring in some
      instances implantation of a pacemaker, is a major drawback of this approach.

      We want to compare in this randomized study the safety and efficacy of standard RF ablation
      with the cryo-ablation technique. This relatively new technique is thought to offer more
      safety concerning higher degree AV conduction block.
