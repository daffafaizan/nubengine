      numerous experimental and clinical trials cholinergic mechanisms have been demonstrated to
      play an important antinociceptive role. Physostigmine, a central cholineresterase inhibitor,
      has been shown to produce analgesia and enhance opiate analgesia after systemic injection.
      This action is not based on Âµ-receptor (opioid) activity, but can be mostly explained by
      stimulation of serotonine (5-HT-3) receptors. The major withdrawal of utilizating
      physostigmine in postoperative care, is due to its short duration of action.

      In the present study, we examined the effect of a continuous intavenous physostigmine
      application during a patient-controlled analgesia with piritramide for 48 hours compared to a
      placebo infusion with NaCl.

      Major concern was set for consumption of analgesics, VAS-pain scale, hemodynamics,
      mobilisation and side effects.
