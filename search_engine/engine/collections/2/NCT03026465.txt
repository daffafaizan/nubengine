      present study is to determine the relation between vascular injury induced by the stent and
      strut thickness. Vessel injury after stent implantation will be evaluated with optical
      coherence tomography (OCT). Two stents platforms with different strut thickness (Coroflex
      ISAR 50 microns and Biomatrix 120 microns) will be compared.
