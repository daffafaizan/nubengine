    
      This is a Phase IV, prospective, randomized controlled study to investigate the cumulative
      live birth rates (CLBRs) of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol
      (GnRH-ant group) compared with the standard GnRH agonist long protocol (GnRH-a group) for
      controlled ovarian stimulation in supposed normal ovarian responders.

      In this study, patients who are planning to undergo IVF/ICSI cycle aged â‰¤38 years old with
      normal ovarian reserve will be considered for enrollment. Approximately 888 patients will be
      enrolled at approximately 5 centers in China over a period of 10 months.

      About 12-20 visits will be performed in this study for each patient. The CLBR with first live
      birth resulting from one initiated COS cycle will be compared between GnRH-a group and
      GnRH-ant group.
