      waiting list for liver transplantation with proven written consent will be recruited and
      randomized during organ procurement. Randomization will be performed by computer (secutrial).
      Perfusion will be started in the operation room after regular organ procurement, transport
      and back table preparation. The perfusion procedure will not delay the implantation due to
      the fact that recipient hepatectomy usually takes 2 hours. During this procedure, hypothermic
      oxygenated perfusion (HOPE group) for one hour will be performed vs continued cold storage
      (Control group).

      We will use commercially available and approved IGL solution (Institut George Lopez) as
      perfusate for machine perfusion.

      Subjects will be followed for one year after transplantation.

      10 European centers are participating in this study, Randomization is stratified by center.
