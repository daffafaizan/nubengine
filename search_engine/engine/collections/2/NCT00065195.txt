      care, terminally ill patients are still significantly burdened by unrelieved symptoms.
      Therapies that have potential to alleviate these symptoms deserve thorough investigation.

      This study will last 3 weeks. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive
      six sessions of either moving or nonmoving touch therapy, in addition to usual hospice care,
      for 2 weeks. Moving touch therapy consists of massage therapy in which a trained therapist
      continually touches a person's body. The nonmoving touch therapy will be conducted by
      volunteers who have no previous experience in massage. Participants in this group will have a
      volunteer rub specific body parts for 3-minute intervals. Because current evidence suggests
      that thoughts of healing may influence the effectiveness of touch therapy, volunteers in the
      nonmoving therapy group will distract their minds to avoid thinking of healing processes. In
      both groups, the person administering the touch therapy will note all interruptions during a
      session, including talk, music, and television. Interviews about medication use, pain, and
      quality of life will be used to assess participants; these interviews will be conducted at
      study start, immediately before and after each therapy session, and at Weeks 1, 2, and 3.
