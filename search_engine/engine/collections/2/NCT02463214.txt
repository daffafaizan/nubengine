      our bodies, on everyday objects, in food, and in our environment. They are passed around
      through the many interactions with other people and our surroundings. Some are even
      beneficial, helping us digest our food or protecting us from infections caused by harmful
      microbes.

      In rare instances, some of the harmful microbes can cause infections. When a microbe causes
      an infection while we are in healthcare facilities, they are called "Healthcare-associated
      infections", or "HAIs". Examples that you may have heard of include Clostridium difficile,
      and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Vancouver General Hospital already
      has some of the lowest HAI rates in the country. We have dedicated hospital workers that do a
      great job at preventing HAIs, but we are always looking for ways to be even better.
