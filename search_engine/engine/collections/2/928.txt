visual versus tactual receptor preference in normal and schizophrenicchildren.receptor preferences between visual or tactualstimuli were measured in schizophrenic and normalchildren; 4 pairs of standardized choice situations betweenvisual or tactual stimuli were used, with the timeof engagement with either stimulus constituting thepreference measure.  schizophrenic children between theages of 7 and 9 were compared with same aged normalchildren.  a group of retardates were used for ma control.schizophrenics were significantly lower in visualpreference than the same aged normals, and an age trendfor increased visual preference was found in the normalsample.  retardates showed greater visual preferencethan schizophrenics of comparable ma.  some implicationsfor theory of schizophrenia were discussed.
