      characterized primarily by motor impairment, but cognitive impairment is common and dementia
      may occur in up to 50% of patients. Cholinergic deficits have been widely demonstrated in PD
      patients with and without dementia. Cholinergic deficits are more profound in the setting of
      PD with dementia. The cholinergic system mediates aspects of learning and memory and deficits
      in cholinergic function are correlated with the degree of dementia in PD. Additionally, the
      cholinergic system may mediate certain aspects of motor function in PD. Data on cholinergic
      function, particularly relating to nicotinic cholinergic receptors, are limited to post
      mortem studies, and little is known about the role of the cholinergic system in vivo and how
      it relates to clinical phenomena. The aim of the current study is to assess the feasibility
      and usefulness of imaging of the high affinity alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic cholinergic receptor
      in vivo, using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging in patients with
      PD. The long-term goal of the present study is to further understanding of the role of the
      cholinergic system in the pathogenesis of PD and to elucidate potential diagnostic and
      therapeutic targets.
