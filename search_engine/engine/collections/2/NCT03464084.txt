      sparked great interest into the role of melatonin in glycemic control, for which the
      mechanism is largely unknown. This research will determine the effect of melatonin and MTNR1B
      on glycemic control under highly-controlled, in-laboratory protocols while manipulating
      circulating melatonin concentrations (both up and down) and assessing glycemic control by
      frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests, as well as in ex vivo human
      pancreatic islets. This research will provide mechanistic insights into the metabolic effects
      of melatonin and the MTNR1B risk variant and may help in evidence-based approaches and
      personalized recommendations to improve glycemic control in night shift workers and
      late-night eaters.
