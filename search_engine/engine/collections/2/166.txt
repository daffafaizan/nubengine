changes in dna, rna, and protein synthesis in the developing lens .lens cell dna, rna, and protein synthesis in the developing mouse eyewere studied with the use of tritium-labeled thymidine, uridine, and l-leucine and autoradiographic techniques . in the mouse embryonic lens,epithelial cells undergoing dna synthesis were found over the entireanterior lens surface . from birth and until the eyes opened thepercentage of epithelial cells undergoing dna synthesis rapidlydecreased . later the percentage of epithelial cells undergoing dnasynthesis was nearly constant as the germinative zone became localizedin the lens equator region . rna synthesis occurred in all nucleatedcells of the developing lens from the embryonic stage until the eyelidsopened . with lens maturity the h uridine was incorporated into the rnaof only the more superficial cells . a similar pattern of tritiumincorporation was seen with h l-leucine .
