    
      Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy will be recruited after signing
      an informed consent, and randomly divided into 2 groups according to intervention
      technique-half will be allocated to the bipolar coagulation group and half to the SURGIFLO
      group.

      Patients will be assessed both pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively by blood tests
      including FSH, LH, E2, Progesterone and AMH levels, and sonographic evaluation of ovarian
      volume and antral follicle count.

      Antral follicle count will be performed on the cyst post-surgery using light microscopy. The
      difference in hormone levels, especially AMH reflects the damage done during surgery to the
      ovarian reserve. Sonographic signs including a decrease in ovarian volume and antral follicle
      count also reflect the damage done during surgery to the ovarian reserve.
