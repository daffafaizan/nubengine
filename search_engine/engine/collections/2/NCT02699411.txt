      treatment performed a stability exercises and proprioception (Group B). Forty-six patients
      will be examined s. None had been previously operated by joint instability and all subjects
      were previously subjected to a diagnostic study by nuclear magnetic resonance before surgery
      and the diagnosis was confirmed by additional diagnostic testing. All patients will be
      evaluated by a physical therapist and Myofascial Trigger Point (PGM) of the vastus muscle
      will be evaluated.

      patients using the following variables are evaluated:

        -  Pain: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used.

        -  Stiffness and physical function using the WOMAC scale (The Western Ontario and McMaster
