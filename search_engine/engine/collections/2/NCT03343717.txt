      clinical diagnosis of VAP hospitalized in an intensive care unit, which will be submitted,
      together with the hospital protocol, the protocol of early mobilization. For these patients
      will be performed physical therapy evaluation in the pre-protocol period, on the second and
      fourth day of application of the protocol and 1 week at the end of the proposed protocol. For
      statistical analysis will be compared the pre and post-treatment data found in the
      evaluations and tabulated in a Microsoft Excel worksheet. BioStat 5.2 software will be used
      to analyze the results, and the choice of tests for this will depend on the types of
      distributions found and the homogeneity of the variables.
