      require controller medications every day to achieve and maintain control. Leukotriene
      receptor antagonist is one of the options which have been recommended to use as a mono
      controller therapy. Patient satisfaction and compliance was better with montelukast,
      attributed to oral intake and convenience. Owing to its easy and simple oral once a day
      administration montelukast was found to be advantageous over ICS. On the other hand, recent
      studies have shown that there is a considerable degree of airway remodeling in peripheral
      airways in patients with mild asthma.The new information points out the need for large, long
      term studies on the treatment of mild persistent asthma, with an emphasis on exacerbations,
      remodeling, and the relationship between these outcomes and markers of asthma control. TGF-β
      participates in the initiation and propagation of inflammatory and immune responses in the
      airways. The leukotrienes exert their biologic actions by binding to and activating specific
      receptors. Montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene 1(CysLT1) receptor antagonist, acts on LTC4,
      LTD4 and LTE4, and, therefore, on airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Some results
      suggest that low dose of Montelukast may modulate the parameters of inflammation and
      fibrosis.In this study we try to determine the effects of lower dose Montelukast on the
      expression and variation of TGF-β in induced sputum and T lymphocyte for children with mild
      persistent Asthma.

      Drug in the study provide by MSD. We have done induced sputum procedure in our past study.
      Reagent can be bought from company.
