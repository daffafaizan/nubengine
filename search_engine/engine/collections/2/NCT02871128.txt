      deficiency problem has always been in Taiwan. This study intends to use the products,
      Natureheme-iron, using blood of pig to concentration, separation and extracted, and then got
      natural and clean Natureheme-iron. Natureheme-iron is not just a good iron supplement, while
      also providing an excellent source of natural protein. This is a randomized, double-blind
      trial, subjects separate to 3 groups, one group (n = 20) take two Natureheme-iron capsules a
      day for a total of 12 weeks (1000mg Fe / capsule), another group (n = 20) with the same dose
      of placebo, and the other group (n = 20) is a commercial iron supplement (100mg Fe).
      Investigators assess whether Natureheme-iron can promote iron absorption and antioxidant
      effects, and compare the effects with commercial iron supplement. When this study is
      completed, it will increase the value of Natureheme-iron, and can improve health of
      Taiwanese.
