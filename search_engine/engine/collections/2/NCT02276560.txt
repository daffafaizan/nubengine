      To estimate the rate of N2 nodal clearance at time of surgery in patients with NSCLC
      undergoing treatment with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin and surgery.

      Estimate response rate and complete response rate in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after
      3 cycles of neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin

      Estimate complete pathological response of primary tumor and lymph nodes at the time of
      surgery in patients with NSCLC undergoing treatment with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel plus
      cisplatin

      Estimate disease free survival for all patients who undergo surgery and also stratified by
      nodal clearance

      Patients will be assigned to receive three (3) cycles of cisplatin (mg/m2) and nab-paclitaxel
      (125 mg/m2). Surgery will then be conducted per standard of care.

      Approximately 4-12 weeks after the surgical resection, patients will receive one of three
      available treatment regimens based on the results of the surgical reports, which include: Two
      four week cycles of therapy of Cisplatin and Nab-paclitaxel; Four three-week cycles of
      Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, or four three-week cycles of Cisplatin and Gemcitabine

      Thirty (30) days after treatment ends, subjects will be followed for any ongoing serious
      adverse events, if necessary, and every 3-6 months thereafter for two years.

      After the two years of follow-up, subjects will be followed for survival and disease status

      Estimate overall survival for entire group and stratified by nodal clearance

      To estimate event free survival (EFS)

      Estimate time to distant recurrence and time to local recurrence following total study
      procedures
