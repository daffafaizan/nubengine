      effectiveness of incentives for preventative health care.

      Health risk assessments are an important part of preventative healthcare. Employees fill out
      these forms and are given feedback about their health risks and steps they can take to
      improve their health. This study will be run in an employer setting in which rates of health
      risk assessment completion are suboptimal. This study would be conducted within a workplace
      setting in which the firm is divided into a number of geographically situated and
      functionally related subunits. We will run a "complete your health risk assessment now!"
      program for 4 weeks. Each work unit will obtain a symbol. Every week, one symbol will be
      randomly drawn, publicly announced, and anyone in that work unit at the firm who has received
      their preventive screening would receive a $100 prize. In addition, if all of employees in
      that unit have completed their forms, then the prize will be increased to $125.

      This program plays on a number of psychological factors: 1) avoidance of regret, which one
      will experience if the number/symbol of the unit one is a member of is drawn and one does not
      win a prize because one is not participating in the wellness program 2) amplification of such
      regret by social means - because other people around you who are participating will receive
      cash prizes 3) mild social pressure, because high enrollments will yield benefits for all
      participants.
