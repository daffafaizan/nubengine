      its equilibrium point when exposed to a perturbation. This exploratory project is based on
      the hypotheses that decreased balance(increased sway as measured by the center of pressure of
      the body during quiet standing) causes an increased risk of falls and osteopathic
      manipulative treatment can improve postural balance. To test these ideas, the investigators
      will investigate the kinematics(study of the way the body moves)of postural balance in two
      cohorts of healthy elders, those receiving manipulation and those not receiving manipulation.
      We hypothesize that OMT is effective to increase postural stability, balance.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: To measure balance in a cohort of healthy elders(age 65 and over)using a
      force plate to measure center of pressure in the Anterior/posterior and medial-lateral
      directions during quiet standing with the eyes open, with the eyes closed and during a
      Romberg test.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of OMT to improve balance in a healthy elderly
      population. We will observe the progression of improvement in balance in one group who will
      receive OMT for four weeks compared to the other who will not receive OMT.

      Aim 3: To examine any potential impact and efficacy of OMT on cardiac and circulatory
      responses by measuring blood flow and circulation.
