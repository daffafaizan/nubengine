      benign and pre-cancer colon lesions as well as melanoma and/or other benign pigmented skin
      lesions will be used. The achieved specimens were kept in Department of Pathology, National
      Taiwan University Hospital. Sections of achieved pathological specimens were put on glass
      slides and tissue image will be observed by 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT). The 3D
      optic tomography system utilize a Ce:YAG optical fiber as light source and also combined with
      confocal microscopy. Taken together, these features made the 3D optic tomography system have
      very high resolution and suitable for single cell imaging. This study will not interfere with
      the normal medical practice and had no impact on patient's safety and health. All of the
      materials will be destroyed once the experiments are done. The enrollment criteria will be
      patients who underwent colon/skin surgery or examinations in NTUH with pathological specimens
      taken and stored at NTUH.
