      and fetal side effects. This mode of analgesia is not usually offered to patients who require
      termination of their pregnancies or who suffer unexpected fetal losses, although they go
      through labour and delivery with likely more difficult psychological circumstances.

      We plan to compare patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with intravenous patient
      controlled analgesia (IV PCA), for 2nd trimester terminations of pregnancy. We hypothesize
      that PCEA provides better quality of recovery than IV PCA. The previously validated Quality
      of Recovery - 40 questionnaire will be used to measure a patient's quality of recovery. The
      results of this study will determine the optimal method of pain relief for late termination
      of pregnancy or fetal loss.
