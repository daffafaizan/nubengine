    
      Hemoptysis is a challenging symptom which may be frequently related to endobronchial
      malignancies. Patients with central neoplasms and hemoptysis show a lower median survival
      than patients with no bleeding and endobronchial neoplasms and/or patients with hemoptysis
      and peripheral malignant lesions.

      Hemoptysis control without recurrence at 48 hours after bronchoscopic interventions may
      improve survival in patients with mild bleeding and endobronchial malignancies.

      Argon Plasma Coagulation is considered one of the most effective techniques for endobronchial
      management of hemoptysis in this subset of patients. Nevertheless, few data are available in
      literature on its efficacy and safety, and the main predictors of success are still unclear.

      In this prospective, observational study, investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy (i.e.
      immediate bleeding cessation without recurrence during the following 48 hours) of endoscopic
      Argon Plasma Coagulation in patients with hemoptysis caused by endobronchial neoplasms.

      Investigators will also evaluate the safety of the procedure, the main variables associated
      to a successful intervention, the presence of hemoptysis relapses and patients overall
      survival to 3,5 months after the bronchoscopic intervention.
