      after treatment in patients with carcinoma due to fatigue scale scores, the classification of
      syndromes, the quality of life score changes and related laboratory index, evaluation factors
      ginseng and astragalus injection on the digestive tract tumor (chemotherapy) in patients with
      cancer-related fatigue and quality of life improved efficacy and safety. The experimental
      group was randomly divided into 2 groups, experimental group Shenqifuzheng injection of 500
      ml. The control group was 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 500ml, intravenous drip, 1 time
      daily, 7 days for continuous use, 14 days of rest, and 1 treatment for each 21 days, and 2
      courses were observed. At the same time, according to the NCCN guide and the health ministry
      issued the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for cancer treatment.

      Main efficacy evaluation indexes before and after treatment for cancer-related fatigue rating
      - adopting the Piper fatigue scale revised Chinese version, compare the experimental group
      and the control group before and after treatment cancer-related fatigue rating difference
      have differences. Secondary efficacy evaluation index to compare the ECOG score difference
      before and after the treatment, the quality of life score difference before and after the
      treatment, TCM syndrome curative effect, single symptom curative effect of immune function,
      tumors had curative effect (if any) and chemotherapy completion. Safety assessment includes
      the observation of vital signs, blood routine, urinary routine, routine stool, liver
      function, renal function, electrocardiogram examination, and adverse reactions during the
      treatment.
