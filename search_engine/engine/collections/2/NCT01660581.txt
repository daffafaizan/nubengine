      with autological CD133+ cell populations, which include cells with a higher expression of
      cardiac and endothelial differentiation markers.

      REGENT VSEL Trial will include Patients with Angina resistant to pharmacological treatment
      and without the possibility of effective revascularization.

      The main objective of the study is to assess the treatments influence on:

        -  improvement of myocardial perfusion

        -  global and segmental contractility (LVEF)

        -  occurrence of symptomatic angina

        -  quality of life

      Regent Vsel is a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study with a
      planned number of 60 Patients.

      Randomization will be carried out according to a 1:1 mode. Every Patient will undergo a bone
      marrow aspiration. CD133+ cells will be isolated from bone marrow aspirates. Patients
      randomized to experimental group will receive isolated cells (direct left ventricular muscle
      administration). Patients enrolled to control group will get only a placebo solution injected
      into the muscle.
