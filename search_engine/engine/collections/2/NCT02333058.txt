      of Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (allo-HSCT) in at least 70 paediatric patients with haematological
      malignancies (male and female children with haematological malignant diseases as acute
      lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes
      (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemias (JMML), requiring myeloablative conditioning
      treatment with following allo-HSCT).

      Treosulfan dose per day is to be calculated by using body surface area (BSA). Two background
      conditioning regimens with Treosulfan are allowed: One regimen consists of a standardised
      Fludarabine-containing regimen and the other consists of an intensified regimen with
      Fludarabine and ThioTEPA.

      Freedom from transplant (treatment)-related mortality (TRM), defined as death from any
      transplant-related cause from the day of first administration of study medication until day
      +100 after HSCT is the primary objective of the trial.

      Moreover, the current pharmacokinetic (PK) model should be contributed to be able to finally
      give age (or BSA) dependent dose recommendations.
