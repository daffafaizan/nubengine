    
      This is a retrospective observation that involves the revision of clinical, instrumental and
      pathologic data of an estimated cohort of 145 patients with glioma treated with surgery with
      radical intent at our center.

      We will review 11C-Methionine PET data acquired within 30 days prior to surgery and analyze
      its principal imaging characteristics with respect to IDH1 mutation status, MGMT promoter
      methylation and 1p/19q co-deletion. These markers will be studied on tumor tissue obtained at
      surgery, used for diagnostic purposes and stored in paraffin.
