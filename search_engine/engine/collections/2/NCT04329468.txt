      upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract and Small Bowel. However, the complete visualization of
      UGI tract still present challenges due to rapid transit through esophagus and duodenum,
      although technical improvements of MCE are helpful.

      Detachable String MCE (DS-MCE) can control the movement of MCE through the string and MCE can
      start next examination after string detachment, which was proved to be an effective and safe
      method for complete viewing of the esophagus and stomach. In order to improve the duodenum
      visualization, endoscopist separate MCE from the string after finishing UGI examination so
      that can inspect the esophagus, stomach and duodenum under the string and magnetic field
      control.

      This is a prospective, single-centered, self-controlled pilot study. Subjects with or without
      digestive symptoms receiving UGI endoscopy will be enrolled to take DS-MCE and conventional
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 48h successively.
