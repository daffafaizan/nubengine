      parents, via the home visitation service delivery model where many of the most at-risk
      families enter into provider-client relationships during their child's infancy and early
      childhood.

      Previous postpartum depression preventive interventions-including MB-have neglected to
      intervene with partners of pregnant women, despite the growing recognition that paternal
      depression also exerts influence on children's social-emotional development and occurs in a
      similar time-frame. Thus, in an otherwise successful intervention, these limitations-mixed
      success in improving hypothesized intervention mechanisms and limited engagement of
      fathers-may mitigate intervention efficacy. Paternal depression is hypothesized to mediate
      the relationship between MB modules and maternal mental health outcomes.

      This study addresses this limitation. The investigators will collaborate with 10-12 home
      visiting (HV) programs serving primarily low-income families. The investigators will recruit
      24 mother-father dyads for an uncontrolled pilot in which mothers will receive MB-TXT and
      fathers will receive FAB, a pilot curriculum developed using existing materials and data
      collected via qualitative research with home visiting clients, their partners, and home
      visiting staff.

      Aim 1. To develop and determine the feasibility and acceptability of a) conducting the MB-DAD
      intervention protocol and b) assessing paternal and dyadic outcomes across two home visiting
      programs. Focus groups with prior trial participants, their male partners, and home visiting
      staff will generate information on a) intervention content, b) frequency of contact, and c)
      relationship to MB materials received by their partner.
