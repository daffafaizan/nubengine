      Primary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of laparoscopic hyperthermic perfusion of mitomycin C in
           preventing relapse at 4 weeks post-treatment in patients with malignant ascites.

      Secondary

        -  Determine any improvement in the quality of life of patients treated with this
           procedure.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study.

      Patients undergo laparoscopic surgery to remove ascitic fluid and any intraabdominal
      adhesions and to place 2 inflow and 2 outflow catheters. Mitomycin C is infused into the
      abdominal cavity by hyperthermic perfusion over 60 minutes.

      Quality of life is assessed at study entry and at 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
