      double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple (4) crossover fashion. Twelve PD patients (thus 12
      N-of-1 trials) with levodopa-induced dyskinesia will complete 4 treatment phases; one phase
      at each of the 3 doses of famotidine and one of placebo. The treatment doses will be:
      famotidine 40mg/day, 80mg/day, and 120mg/day. The phases will occur in a random order, but
      each subject will receive each of the treatment doses during the course of the study. After
      each phase of treatment (14 days), there will be a washout period (7 days, over 10 half-lives
      of famotidine) followed by a crossover. The primary outcome will be the change in Unified
      Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) between placebo and famotidine at the end of each treatment
      phase and secondary outcomes will be Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease
      Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts III and IV, Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Lang-Fahn
      activities of daily living dyskinesia scale (LFADLDS) and assessment of adverse effects.
