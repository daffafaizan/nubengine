      acceptability of a uniquely targeted HIV risk reduction intervention for young men who have
      sex with men (MSM), ages 16 to 20, at risk for HIV acquisition or transmission. In year one,
      the preliminary components of a primary prevention intervention for young MSM aged 16-20 will
      result from the findings of qualitative interviews conducted among a multiethnic sample of 21
      young MSM (aged 18-24) who acquired HIV through male-to-male sexual contact between ages
      16-20. In year two, a preliminary primary prevention intervention curriculum will be
      completed and subsequently refined through community advisory board review. In year three,
      the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial in a community-based agency with excellent access to and research experience
      with the population. We will enroll 100 at-risk young MSM ages 16-20; two-thirds of the
      sample (N=66)will be randomized to the intervention condition while one-third (N=34) will be
      randomized to the time-matched attention control condition and receive standard health
      promotion information in a group-based format. Sexual risk will be assessed at baseline, 6,
      and 12 weeks post-intervention. The specific aims of this exploratory study are: 1) to design
      an HIV and substance use primary prevention program for 16-20 year-old urban,
      ethnically-diverse YMSM; 2) to pilot test and refine study methods; 3) to test the revised
      multi-ethnic intervention with 100 young YMSM and examine preliminary effects on risky sexual
      behavior, alcohol/drug use, and psychosocial intermediate outcomes specified by our
      theoretical framework in preparation for a large-scale, efficacy study. An additional
      exploratory aim is to describe the prevalence of HIV and STIs in the community recruited
      sample.
