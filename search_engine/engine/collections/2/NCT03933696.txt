      disturbances, inflammation, insulin sensitivity (Si) and glucose disposal (Sg) and cognition
      in patients with MCI and mild ADRD and sleep disturbances. Using a single-arm,
      between-subjects, placebo-controlled study the investigators will investigate if long-term
      (6-month) exposure to TLI improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in patients
      with MCI and mild AD who suffer from sleep disturbance and are living at home. Participants
      will be recruited from the Mount Sinai AD research center (ADRC) and randomized to receive
      the TLI (or comparison control treatment) at home. The investigators hypothesize that,
      compared to the comparison light, a TLI will increase entrainment, improve sleep, reduce
      depression, reduce inflammation, improve metabolic control, increase insulin sensitivity, and
      reduce susceptibility to T2DM and metabolic disease during and after the completion of the
      6-month intervention.
