      with PTSD, substance use, anxiety, and suicide. Eligible individuals will be randomized to
      one of two conditions. In both conditions, participants will complete various self-report
      questionnaires and a computerized presentation. Additionally, all participants will be asked
      to complete a one month follow-up appointment.
