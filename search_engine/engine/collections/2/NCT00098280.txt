      stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis.
      The clinical features of PNH result from the lack of one or more of the GPI-linked proteins
      that serve to protect cells from autologous complement mediated attack. Two such proteins,
      CD55 (decay accelerating factor) and CD59 (reactive lysis inhibitor) have been shown to be
      absent from PNH erythrocytes and platelets as well as other cell types.

      Evidence strongly suggests that lack of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 is responsible
      for the sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes and platelets to the effects of autologous
      complement. Since the pathogenesis of PNH is due to the inability of PNH red cells and
      platelets to inhibit the activation of terminal complement, it is logical to hypothesize that
      a terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop the intravascular hemolysis, obviate
      or lessen the need for transfusions, and possibly decrease the propensity of life threatening
      thrombosis. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that like CD59 inhibits terminal
      complement.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study of
      eculizumab or placebo administered intravenously to approximately 75 PNH patients. The study
      is designed to evaluate the safety of eculizumab in transfusion dependent patients with
      paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and to determine if the administration of this
      terminal complement inhibitor could provide a safe and effective substitute for CD59
      function.
