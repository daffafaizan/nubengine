    
      Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-oral dose study conducted
      in 2 parts, for evaluation of AM1476.

      Part A will comprise a single-ascending dose, sequential-group design incorporating a
      single-group, 2-period crossover arm incorporating a food-effect evaluation. Overall, 48
      subjects will be studied in 6 groups, with each group consisting of 8 subjects.

      Part B will comprise a multiple-ascending dose, sequential-group design. Overall, 24 subjects
      will be studied in 3 groups, with each group consisting of 8 subjects.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of single- and
      multiple-oral doses of AM1476 in healthy subjects.
