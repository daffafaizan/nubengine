      unit (CICU) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as well as EDs and delivery room (DR)
      practice, and benchmark against other PICUs, CICUs, NICUs, DRs and EDs as a part of
      Multi-Center Airway Safety collaborative network (NEAR4KIDS).

      The goal of the study is to utilize collected benchmarked data to improve local practice. In
      order to develop this quality improvement (QI) intervention and collaboration, it is
      necessary to collect baseline data to describe current practice and to continuously evaluate
      the effectiveness of any QI intervention.
