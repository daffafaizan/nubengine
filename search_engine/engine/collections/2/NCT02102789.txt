      chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine and dexamethasone
      in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. However, most of them
      are retrospective studies, phase I or II clinical researches, which could not provide
      high-level evidence. Therefore, we designed this study to determine whether systemic
      chemotherapy combined with HAI can increase the complete resection rate (R0) and improve the
      overall survival in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis.
