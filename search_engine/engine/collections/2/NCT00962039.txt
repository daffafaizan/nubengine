      citalopram in the treatment of pediatric functional recurrent abdominal pain (FAP) in
      children and adolescents ages 7 to 18 years, inclusive. The goal is to recruit and randomize
      100 subjects to citalopram or placebo. Secondary aims include to determine if citalopram is
      superior to placebo in reducing comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and
      adolescents with FAP, to explore potential mediators (i.e., anxiety, depression) and
      moderators (e.g., age, gender, referral from primary or specialty care) of treatment
      response, and to explore the durability and tolerability of citalopram treatment 18 weeks
      following completion of the double-blind treatment phase with the goal of generating data
      useful to the development of future studies. The study is novel in conducting recruitment,
      assessment, and treatment in traditional medical settings. Limited exclusion criteria and the
      delivery of study assessments and interventions within routine practice settings provide for
      considerably greater external validity than the typical efficacy study.

      Study hypotheses:

        1. Citalopram will be superior to placebo in producing clinical improvement and reductions
           in abdominal pain.

        2. Citalopram and placebo will not differ in tolerability or safety.
