      loss significantly improves cardiovascular risk factors.

      Bariatric surgery is now the most effective intervention for the long-term treatment of
      obesity and its complications. Among patients receiving bariatric surgery, 30-90% have
      moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome. The progressive loss of weight
      contributes to the regression of the symptoms related to OSA. Observational studies have
      shown that bariatric surgery can rapidly improve glycemic control and cardiovascular risk
      factors with a significantly higher remission rate of hypertension and dyslipidemias than in
      the non-surgical group. Given the strong associations between OSA and cardiometabolic
      comorbidities, this project is based on the hypothesis of a lower improvement of
      cardiovascular risk factors and a higher number of post-surgical complications in OSAS
      patients.
