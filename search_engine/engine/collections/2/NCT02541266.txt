      perspective on undertaking imaging procedures, MRI and PET/CT, for research purposes. The
      study is to evaluate the patient opinion and perceptions of the burden of imaging associated
      with research. We will look at different scanning procedures of varying duration, intensity,
      frequency and scheduling; this will enable us to have a better understand of the factors that
      influence participation in research and thus help us develop protocols that are more patient
      focused and acceptable.
