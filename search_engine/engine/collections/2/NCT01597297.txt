      10 mg twice daily in patients with Multiple Sclerosis with walking disability. The change of
      walking ability will be measured using Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) to
      further elucidate the clinical relevance of changes over 24 weeks treatment duration. Another
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of prolonged-release
      fampridine.

      Approximately 120 patients MS will be randomized over 20 sites worldwide. Duration of
      patient's participation in the study will be approximately 28 weeks.
