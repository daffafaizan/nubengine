      (HL) that may be easier to tolerate than standard therapies and that does not involve an
      autologous blood or marrow transplant (BMT, also called a stem cell transplant).The study is
      for people with HL who have never received treatment for relapsed lymphoma, except for
      radiation therapy. Usually, when HL relapses for the first time, the standard is to receive
      combinations of chemotherapy, including an autologous blood or marrow transplant (BMT, also
      called a stem cell transplant) which has about a 40% cure rate. BMT may cure the HL, but also
      may be associated with serious side effects and risks. This research looks at a combination
      of drugs for relapsed HL that may not have the side effects of standard therapies and that
      does not involve BMT. The goal is to treat the lymphoma effectively with drugs that we expect
      will have fewer side effects, while avoiding a treatment like BMT.
