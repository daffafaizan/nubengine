      autobiographical memories and recent research has demonstrated how retrieval of
      autobiographical memory can activate eye movement. This research has been however mainly
      concerned with young adults and, until now, little is known about the relationship between
      eye movement and autobiographical memory in patients with Alzheimer's Disease. The aim of the
      current study is therefore to evaluate eye movements during the retrieval of autobiographical
      memories in patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
