      with rates projected to increase as the population ages. Aortic valve replacement remains the
      only recognised treatment available. Bioprostheses are far more common than mechanical
      prostheses, particularly with increasing rates of transcatheter heart valve use.

      Bioprothetic valves are less durable than mechanical valves and are subject to deterioration
      which may lead to clinical heart failure and the need for re-intervention. Long-term results
      with surgical bioprostheses are well reported, with valve deterioration rates of less than
      15% at 10 years. These data, however, rely on re-operation rather than echocardiographic
      measures, suggesting that the true incidence of structural valve deterioration is
      underestimated.

      Valve thrombosis is increasingly recognised as a potential contributor to leaflet
      degeneration and has been detected in participants undergoing both surgical aortic valve
      replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation. The role of valve thrombosis as an
      early trigger for calcification and subsequent valve degeneration has not been addressed. The
      true incidence of valve thrombosis and its impact on clinical outcomes is unknown due to the
      lack of a sufficiently sensitive non-invasive imaging modality to detect early subclinical
      thrombosis. Current observational data suggests rates of 12 to 40%, based on computed
      tomography findings. There is a clinical need for a more sensitive non-invasive method of
      detecting valve thrombosis.
