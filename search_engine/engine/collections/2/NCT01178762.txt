      January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006 at one cornea specialist's (Y.C.H) out-patient clinic
      were retrospectively reviewed. At this clinic, patients of both sexes with acute, chronic or
      recurrent follicular conjunctivitis with the symptoms and signs of chlamydial conjunctivitis
      suspected were tested for Chlamydia direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests and arranged for
      next time out-patient clinic follow up 1-2 weeks later. The patients who attended the follow
      up visit with positive DFA results were treated with oral azithromycin. These patients
      received a single dose oral azithromycin (400mg~1000mg, according to their age and body
      weight) once a week for consecutive two weeks. Repeated DFA examinations were performed 4 to
      6 weeks later. If the DFA examinations still showed positive results, augmented single dose
      oral azithromycin once a week for one week was given again till the DFA showed negative
      results. The occurrence and frequency of adverse events recorded in the medical charts were
      reviewed as well.
