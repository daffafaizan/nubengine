      informed consent are obtained, patients will undergo a brief screening period to determine
      eligibility for the study. Once eligibility is confirmed, eligible patients will be placed in
      a randomized placebo control manner. Patient will be assigned to Xlear (2 puffs per nostrils,
      every 3-4 hours a day) or placebo. Patient will be followed for 1 week. Inflammatory markers
      will be obtained on Day 4 and repeat COVID-19 Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT PCR) on Day 7.
      Follow up will be done on Day 14 for all patients.
