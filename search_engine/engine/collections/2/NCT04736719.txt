    
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as possible in healthcare insurance claims
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a
      statistical balancing of measured covariates through standard practice. Investigators assume
      that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that failure to
      replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims data for
      replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the validity
      of the original RCT finding.
