      the donation program of the clinic.

      This process is performed in donors who have generated at least 3 pregnancies compared those
      samples, however, were not a function of gestation assisted reproduction technique used.

      Consequently, differential expression of genes are identified in assisted reproduction
      treatment cycles from IAD, IVF or ICSI.
