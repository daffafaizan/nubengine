      administration. Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and
      will be residential for a single period of 27 days/26 nights.

      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit after completion of down-titration on
      the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are no medical
      reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit; which is the end-of-study visit (ESV). Prior
      to discharge, participants will be provided with local buprenorphine and methadone providers
      for their reference.
