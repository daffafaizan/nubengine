    
      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up. All patients with cardiovascular
      disease (i.e., myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and angina) from 4
      primary care centers will be screened for insomnia and during a clinical examination
      diagnosed by a physician specialized in sleep medicine. INTERVENTION: 9 weeks internet-based
      cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (1 week introduction, 2 weeks psycho education on
      cardiovascular disease/insomnia, 6 weeks of sleep hygiene, stimulus control and sleep
      restriction) vs 3 weeks internet-based sleep hygiene education. QUESTIONNAIRES: Sleep
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, sleep diary), depressive- and
      cardiac symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire) and Quality
      of Life (SF-12) at baseline, during and after intervention (after 6 and 12 months).
