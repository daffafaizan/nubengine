      Patients), an online system designed for cancer patients to self-record toxicity-related
      symptoms based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0, performance status
      by ECOG criteria, global quality of life by the EuroQOL 5-D assessment tool, emergency room
      visits, and survival. Secondary outcomes will include patient assessment of the usefulness of
      STAR, clinician perceptions of the potential value of STAR in routine clinical practice, and
      an evaluation of whether STAR improves the patient experience of care as assessed by
      satisfaction measures.
