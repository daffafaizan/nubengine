    
      This clinical trial consists of two parts. We will first use the bite fork in normal
      volunteers to evaluate its test-retest and inter-rater reliability. We will then use the bite
      fork in subjects with differing endodontic diagnoses and compare these results with the
      standard clinical diagnostic test (percussion).
