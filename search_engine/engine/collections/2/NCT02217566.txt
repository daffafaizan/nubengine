      country), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), and single
      arm study to determine benefits of abiraterone acetate and low-dose prednisone to androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) in mCRPC participants who failed to prior DES therapy. The study
      will consist of a Screening Phase of up to 28 days before enrollment; a PSA Evaluation Phase;
      and a Follow-up Phase of up to 24 months. Each cycle of abiraterone therapy will be of 28
      days. Participants will receive 1000 milligram (mg) abiraterone acetate orally once daily
      plus prednisone 5 mg orally once daily plus stable regimen of ADT (luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists) as per Investigator's discretion. Treatment will
      continue until PSA progression, clinical progression, consent withdrawal, or the occurrence
      of unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy will primarily be assessed by time to PSA progression.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
