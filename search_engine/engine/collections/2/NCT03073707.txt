      index patients presenting with NTS infection. Index patients with laboratory confirmed NTS
      bloodstream infections will be randomly addressed for the collection of samples from their
      household (household members, animals (domestic animals and rats) and water supply). The
      collection of those samples will be done as close as possible to the timing of diagnosis in
      the index patient.

      The sites of blood culture collection are the General Hospitals of Makiso and Kabondo and the
      Centre Hospitalier Village de PÃ©diatrie. Blood cultures will be drawn by nursing staff
      according to the standard procedures of the surveillance study. A total of 1500 blood
      cultures is expected with a positivity rate of 10% (Falay, 2016). According to previous
      prevalence data in DR Congo, the expected number of NTS in this sample group will be 50
      isolates.

      The isolates of Salmonella sp. conserved on TSA agar will be shipped to ITM and the molecular
      identity of the isolates will be determined and pairs of isolates (index patient-household
      environment) will be compared for clonal identity, by whole genome sequencing or equivalent
      technique as appropriate.

      A database will be completed that contains the study data. Data that can have a link to the
      patient identity will be coded.
