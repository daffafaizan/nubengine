    
      In both arms,subtotal gastrectomy (dissect more than 2/3 of stomach and total omentectomy)
      and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of
      splenic artery (4d, 4sb), hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) wiil be
      performed basically. As a general rule, Billroth II method will be used for gastric
      reconstruction for all cases.Billroth II gastrectomy is to link the gastric pouch to the
      jejunum 10~15 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. An antecolic or retrocolic
      gastrojejunostomy connects the jejunum to the stomach in one continuous segment. For
      anastomosis, absorbable suture is used. Anastomotic diameter is 5~6 cm length. Drainage tube
      is inserted through the right flank area and additional drainage tubes can be inserted as
      needed.
