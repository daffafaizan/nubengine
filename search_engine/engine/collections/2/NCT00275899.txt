    
      Specific Aim 1. Study DcR3-induced T cell activation in SLE and RA. A. Patients and controls
      Patients with SLE and RA in Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University
      Hospital will be studied. All patient meet the criteria of the American College of
      Rheumatologists for diagnosis of SLE and RA. As controls, 20 healthy age- and gender-matched
      volunteers will be used. All the studies including samples involving human is in accordance
      with institutional guidelines.

      B. Detection of serum DcR3 protein in SLE and RA patients C. T cell proliferation assay

      Specific Aim 2. Study effects of DcR3 on activation-induced cell death (AICD) in SLE and RA
      In order to understand whether DcR3 could reduce the AICD in activated T cells in SLE and RA
      patients, the T cells from these patients will be assayed their AICD in the presence and
      absence of soluble DcR3-Fc.

      Specific Aim 3. To investigate the association of clinical manifestation of SLE and RA with
      genetic polymorphism on DcR3 genes.

      A. The gene sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of DcR3 genes.

      B. The association of clinical manifestation of SLE and RA with genetic polymorphism on DcR3
      genes.
