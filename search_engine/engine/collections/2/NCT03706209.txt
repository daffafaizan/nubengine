    
      This trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two oral doses of MP1032 (150 mg bid and 300 mg bid) in adult patients
      with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

      The trial design consists of a 28-day screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and
      subsequently a 28-day follow-up period. Each patient will have 6 visits and unscheduled
      visits as needed.

      Approximately 150 patients (2 Ã— 50 patients MP1032 and 50 patients placebo) who meet the
      entry criteria will be randomized on Day 1 to receive either 150 mg MP1032, 300 mg MP1032 or
      placebo orally twice daily for 12 weeks. The administration of IMP will stop after end of
      study (in max. 13 weeks).

      PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index), PGA (Physician Global Assessment) and BSA (Body
      Surface Area) Scores will be recorded at predefined timepoints as basis for the efficacy
      evaluation.

      Safety parameter will be monitored from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until
      the last follow-up visit.

      To evaluate systemic concentrations of MP1032 PK (pharmacokinetics) samples will be analyzed
      in a subgroup.
