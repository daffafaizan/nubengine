      is a stylet specially designed for videolaryngoscopes. The investigators aim to compare the
      efficacy of a new designed bougie for intubation in patients with simulated difficult
      airways.

      The primary endpoint will be time necessary for intubation, secondary endpoints will be
      injuries, ease of use and subjective assessment.
