      additional to physiotherapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT), on stroke patients with hand
      paralysis. A randomized controlled trial. The experimental group received a passive
      mobilization of the hand through the robotic device Gloreha and control group received a PT
      and OT for 3 consecutive weeks (3 days/week) in addition to traditional rehabilitation.
      Outcomes included the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Ashworth
      Scale (MAS), Barthel index (BI), Motricity index (MI), short version of the Disabilities of
