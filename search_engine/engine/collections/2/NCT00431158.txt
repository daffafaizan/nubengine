      managed using low tidal volumes, relatively high respiratory rates, with oxygenation managed
      according to PEEP and FIO2 relationships as defined in a table. This study compares the
      ARDSnet protocol with an open lung approach to mechanical ventilation. The open lung approach
      uses a technique to recruit collapsed lung areas and then uses the lowest PEEP level that
      prevents recollapse of recruited lung units. The best PEEP level is determined by a
      decremental PEEP trial involving a series of pressure measurements taken after the
      recruitment maneuver. Both the ARDSnet protocol and the open lung approach require low tidal
      volumes and plateau pressures.

      Evidence suggests that using a mechanical ventilation strategy of recruitment maneuvers (to
      open the collapsed lung) followed by high PEEP (to prevent collapse of the opened lung) with
      control of transpulmonary pressure through lower plateau pressures would maximize homogeneity
      within the lung and as such, minimize shearing forces in the lung parenchyma, thus improving
      ventilation and outcome in mechanically ventilated ARDS patients.
