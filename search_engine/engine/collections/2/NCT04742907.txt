      1:1:1 (TU-100 15 g/day: TU-100 7.5 g/day: placebo) on postoperative Day 1 before the first
      dose of study medication. After randomization, subjects will receive a total daily dose of
      TU-100 15g, TU-100 7.5 g, or matching placebo (3 times per day (TID)) until hospital
      discharge or â‰¤ 10 days (whichever is earlier). All subjects will be treated with study
      medication as adjunct to an enhanced recovery (ERAS) pathway for gastrointestinal (GI)
      recovery.
