    
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common rhythm disturbance affecting the human population.

        1. Its prevalence increases with age and can be found in >8% of humans over the age of
           eighty;

        2. Radiofrequency ablation for drug refractory nonvalvular atrial fibrillation has become a
           common therapy available to patients. It has been shown to be both efficacious and cost
           effective;

        3. The standard approach to atrial fibrillation involves electrical isolation of the
           pulmonary veins (PVI) from the rest of the atrium chamber. This involves moving a 3.5mm
           tip ablation catheter point to point around the PV structures until an encircling
           ablation line is formed. This can be made difficult by not knowing if the tip is in good
           contact with the atrial tissue. In addition the esophagus is a posterior lying structure
           and injury to the esophagus by ablating the overlying tissue has been reported, at times
           fatal;

        4. Currently, intracardiac imaging of the left atrium has FDA approval in the right atrial
           chamber. This leads to difficulty in visualizing tip tissue interface, and important
           left sided structures such as carina, ligaments, and esophagus. By placing the tip of
           the ICE catheter in the left atrium, enhanced visualization of the tip tissue interface
           may lead to more effective ablation points, fewer needed ablation points, and enhanced
           safety by avoiding placement over adjacent noncardiac structures.
