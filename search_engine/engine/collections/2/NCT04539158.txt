    
      Patients with sustained atrial fibrillation and obesity who are scheduled for a cardioversion
      for atrial fibrillation will provide written informed consent prior to starting the
      procedure. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to either single-DCCV or
      dual-DCCV treatment.

      All patients will have 4 defibrillation pads placed: two pads placed in the right
      infraclavicular region and left flank region, plus two pads placed in the left
      infraclavicular and right flank region.

      All patients will receive moderate sedation immediately prior to and during cardioversion.

      Patients randomized to single-DCCV will be given a single 200J shock using the "primary" (or
      right anterior-left posterior) pair of pads. Patients assigned to dual-DCCV will receive two
      simultaneous 200J shocks (from both the "primary" and "secondary" set of defibrillator pads),
      totaling 400J delivered.

      Patients in the single-DCCV group whose initial shock fails to restore normal sinus rhythm
      will be crossed over to the dual-DCCV group. Patients in the dual-DCCV group will receive up
      to three attempts at DCCV, as needed, at the discretion of the attending electrophysiologist.

      One hour after cardioversion is completed, patients will be asked if they experienced any
      chest discomfort related to cardioversion and, if applicable, will rate their chest
      discomfort using a pain scale from 0-10.
