      Botox . Men with a clinical diagnosis of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/CPPS will be
      treated with intraprostatic Botoxâ„¢ and followed for 12 weeks (primary efficacy analyses), and
      24 weeks (long term follow-up) for responders.

      It is proposed that a total of 40 males will be enrolled. There will be seven (7) research
      clinic visits and two phone contacts: Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline/treatment),
      Visit 3 (2-week safety evaluation - clinic contact), Visit 4 (4-week safety evaluation -
      phone contact), Visit 5 (6-week interim efficacy/safety), Visit 6 (12-week primary endpoint
      evaluation), Visit 7 (14-week clinic follow up), Visit 8 (16 week phone contact) and Visit 9
      (24-week clinic close out).

      Outcome measures include Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI 0-35), NRS pain (0-10),
      Global Response Assessment (GRA) at 12 weeks. Safety to be monitored during the study.
