      specific phobias. ERP involves systematic and repeated exposure to a feared or
      anxiety-provoking stimulus, leading to habituation and extinction of the fear response.
      Animal models of fear extinction have shown that acute administration of D-cycloserine (DCS)
      prior to exposure to a feared stimulus enhances extinction of that fear. A recent study in
      human subjects with height phobia (a specific phobia) has also demonstrated that DCS
      facilitates the effects of ERP therapy. Current theories postulate that DCS facilitates fear
      extinction by enhancing the learning process and increasing consolidation of memories, but
      the neural mechanisms underlying this process are not understood. The proposed research aims
      to elucidate these mechanisms by using fMRI to measure brain activation during 1) symptom
      provocation and verbal learning two hours post-medication, and 2)repeated symptom provocation
      and verbal recognition one week post-medication. This research will also examine the effects
      of DCS on cognitive functioning using neuropsychological testing both two house and one week
      post-medication.
