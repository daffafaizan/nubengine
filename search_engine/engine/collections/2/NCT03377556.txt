    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and
      partial) with talazoparib (BMN 673) in HRRD Medivation (MDVN)-positive patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate investigator assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) and overall survival
      (OS) associated with therapy in HRRD MDVN-positive patients.

      II. To evaluate ORR, IA-PFS, and OS in HRRD Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI)-positive
      patients.

      III. To evaluate ORR in HRRD MDVN-negative/HRRD FMI-positive patients. IV. To evaluate the
      frequency and severity of toxicities associated with talazoparib (BMN 673) in HRRD
      FMI-positive patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess if the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score is associated with
      clinical outcomes (response, PFS, OS) in HRRD FMI-positive patients treated with talazoparib
      (BMN 673).

      II. To assess if the level of PARP protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry is
      associated with clinical outcomes (response, PFS, OS) in HRRD FMI-positive patients treated
      with talazoparib (BMN 673).

      III. To characterize pharmacokinetic properties of talazoparib (BMN 673).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and at the end of year 3.
