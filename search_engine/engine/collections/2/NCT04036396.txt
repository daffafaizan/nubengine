      incarceration. During the trial, half of participants will be randomized into a control group
      that will receive usual care consistent with the facility in which they live, along with
      referrals customized to their needs and preferences to share with a case manager. They will
      be compared to the other half of participants randomized to the intervention group that, in
      addition to receiving customized referral sources, will also receive the GeoPassport App,
      incentives, and the support of a trained Peer Mentor for six months. The GeoPassport App will
      provide participants with tools for tracking goals and progress toward meeting them,
      assistance in locating services, appointment and medication reminders, opportunities to
      provide feedback on service providers, and built-in tracking and distribution of rewards
      (incentives) for service utilization. GeoPassport will assist Peer Mentors in monitoring
      participants' service utilization. The Peer Mentors will provide encouragement, role
      modeling, accompaniment to appointments, and assistance with goal setting, problem-solving,
      and reducing logistical and psychosocial barriers to service engagement. The intervention can
      be delivered in person or remotely in order to comply with necessary social distancing during
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in both groups will be followed to assess whether those
      offered the intervention are more likely to meet the specific prevention targets described in
      the Specific Aims. The intervention lasts 6 months following departure from jail or
      residential recovery facility. Participants are interviewed at 3, 6, and 9 months from the
      same point as the intervention.
