      hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) for this feasibility study. The primary hypothesis is that
      this study will show safety and performance of the REBOA procedure when used as an adjunct to
      Advanced Life Support (ALS):

      Data is collected:

        -  from enrolment of the patient until hospital arrival

        -  every 24 hours

        -  at discharge or 7 days post enrollment

        -  at 30 days post enrollment

      The investigation is initiated to investigate the safety and performance of the REBOA
      procedure for patients experiencing refractory OHCA.
