      adequate landing zone in up to 40% of descending thoracic aneurysms (DTAs). To ensure
      adequate seal of currently available off-the-shelf stent grafts, 20 mm of healthy aorta is
      recommended between the proximal neck of the aneurysm and the leading edge of the stent
      graft. Stent graft placement can be facilitated by extending the proximal landing zone into
      the arch and covering the LSA; however, there may be a higher risk of serious neurologic
      outcomes (cerebral and paraplegia), although this is still a matter of debate. Serious risks
      are also known to accompany subclavian revascularization, which may involve bypass or
      transposition. The Valiant Mona LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System (Medtronic,Santa Rosa, Calif)
      consists of a main stent graft and a branch stent graft designed to maintain LSA patency
      while diverting circulation through the encroaching aneurysm.

      The purpose of the feasibility study is to characterize the safety of the Valiant Mona LSA
      Thoracic Stent Graft System, including an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the
      device acutely and at the 1-month visit in the identified subject population (Aneurysms and
      chronic, Type B dissections). A follow up of this population will be annually during 5 years.

      This pilot, non-randomized, single-arm prospective study will concern 20 patients. Inclusion
      criteria required patients with a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) or dissection with an
      indication of a stent-Graft insertion. Primary end points will be aneurysm-related mortality,
      stroke, paraplegia, left arm/hand ischemia, and treatment success. Technical success will be
      assessed by imaging at 1 month, 6 months then annually during 5 years.
