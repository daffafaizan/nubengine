      pharmacogenetic relationships of morphine in the early postoperative period, whereas it is
      the main clinical situation for severe pain and a unique model for its study (not possible in
      the healthy volunteer). Indeed, intravenous titration of morphine is the first step for pain
      control in the postanesthesia care unit. Administration of intravenous boluses of morphine
      enables to obtain complete pain relief in 98% of the patients. We intend to study the effects
      of morphine (intravenous titration then patient-controlled intravenous administration (PCA)
      for 24 hours), perform dosages of plasma concentration of morphine an its main metabolites,
      and also study gene polymorphisms coding for main proteins involved in the pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic profile of morphine (hepatic metabolism, distribution and elimination,
      interaction with morphine receptor). Five hundred patients scheduled for major orthopedic
      surgery will be included in this prospective study. The main objective of this study is to
      improve our knowledge on the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic
      relationships of morphine administered to relief severe postoperative pain. The analysis will
      encompass the efficacy (acute during titration and subacute during the first 24 hours) and
      adverse effects of morphine. Our purpose is also to better characterize the age- and
      sex-related differences which probably markedly differ between the two periods (acute vs
      subacute). We consider that this knowledge is important to confirm or not several important
      concepts currently used to define the appropriate analgesic regimen to control severe pain in
      the postoperative period.
