      outbreak increases cardiovascular disease risk in China. Cardiovascular events occurring
      after 2019-nCoV outbreak in Jinan were prospectively assessed by emergency physicians. We
      compared those events with events that occurred during the past 3 months and the same months
      of the last year.
