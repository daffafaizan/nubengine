    
      This is a placebo controlled study where subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis
      will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive ASN002 at 40 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg, or placebo once
      daily for 12 weeks. Eligible subjects will get the opportunity to enroll in the 24 month
      open-label extension study (OLE). There will be a 4-week follow up period for subjects not
      participating in the OLE study. This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ASN002 through blood sampling and three or four biopsies from subjects
      who consent.
