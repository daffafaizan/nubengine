    
      80 type 1 diabetic patients with kidney function (GFR > 45 ml/min), but with urine albumin
      excretion of at least 30 mg/day and HbA1c 7.5-13.0% are randomised to either multiple daily
      insulin injections (control group) or insulin pump therapy plus continued glucose monitoring
      (CGM) (intervention group). Patients must be in stable RAAS blockade before entering the
      study.

      Before the study is initiated all patients receive education in intensive diabetes treatment
      and self-care including carbohydrate counting.

      Patients return to the clinic after 1,3,6,9, and 12 months for measurement of urine albumine
      excretion, clinical examination including blood pressure, CGM sensor readings, four-point
      self monitored blood glucose (SMBG) profiles, blood samples and fulfillment of questionnaire
      to assess quality of life. At entry and after 12 months, eye fundus foto, 24-hour blood
      pressure, GFR, and carotis intima media thickness (CIMT)are also evaluated.
