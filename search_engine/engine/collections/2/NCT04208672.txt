      prevalence ranging from 4-30%. OSA has been shown to be a significant risk factor of many
      cardiovascular diseases and mental disorders. However, OSA is a neglected problem in the
      general population. In addition, there is a significant unmet need for the treatment of OSA.
      One of the major reason for the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of OSA in the general
      population is a lack of reliable screening tool in detecting OSA. In this regard, several
      devices, such as ApneaLink, have been developed for the screening of OSA. However, as this
      kind of device only employs time in bed rather than actual sleep time to calculate the apnea
      index or desaturation index, they tend to underestimate the severity of sleep apnea. In this
      regard, it is timely need to develop and validate new device that can integrate the actual
      sleep time and apnea or desaturation events for the precise calculation of sleep apnea index
      or desaturation index.

      The UMindSleep is a handy and wearable device to acquire EEG, heart rate, saturation, snoring
      and temperature. The signal will be uploaded to a smartphone through Bluetooth. By
      integrating these signals, the system can automatically analyze several key parameters by the
      algorithms, such as sleep stages and desaturation events.
