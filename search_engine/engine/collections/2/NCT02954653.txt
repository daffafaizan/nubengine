      at escalating doses. The proposed dosing scheme includes 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg.
      Patients will be monitored for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose escalation in order
      to define the MTD. Two of the three arms in the dose expansion will include PF-06747143 in
      combination with standard of care chemotherapy and will include a safety lead in. The third
      arm, pending clinical data, will be PF-06747143 as a single agent.
