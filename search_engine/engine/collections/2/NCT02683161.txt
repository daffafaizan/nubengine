      smoking cessation intervention (i.e., varenicline + monetary incentives + brief counseling)
      into a hospital setting by recruiting elective bariatric surgery patients and assessing
      theoretically relevant baseline characteristics (e.g., factors influencing smoking decisions,
      such as smoking motivation, delayed discounting, and distress tolerance) that may predict
      smoking cessation and post-surgical recovery outcomes. Participants will be required to
      attend a screening visit at the Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) located on the
      Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus, during which the participants will answer
      questionnaires, complete computerized tasks, and undergo sensory testing. Participants will
      then attend approximately 6 weekly study visits leading up to their bariatric surgery, and
      approximately 6 more weekly study visits after the surgery, as well as a 30-day follow-up
      visit, all located at the BPRU at Johns Hopkins Bayview. During the 6 pre-surgery visits and
      6 post-surgery visits, participants will undergo an intensive smoking cessation treatment
      that includes administration of a medication called varenicline that has been FDA-approved
      for smoking cessation, as well as behavioral counseling sessions and monetary incentives for
      remaining smoke-free. After completing all study visits, participants will be asked to return
      for a 30-day follow-up visit, during which they will complete several study measures once
      more. Throughout the study, participants will be asked to periodically complete
      questionnaires, computerized tasks, and sensory testing. Investigators will also track
      outcomes associated with post-surgical recovery, including duration of hospital stay,
      hospital readmission, post-surgical complications, and prescription pain-killer use
      post-surgery.
