      small camera to record the light. The tool is the size and shape of spoon. The technique of
      shining light into the mouth, face, and sinuses is known as "transillumination" and has been
      used for nearly a century to aid in the diagnosis of sinusitis. The tool described in this
      study is a custom made device that uses light that is invisible to the eye.
