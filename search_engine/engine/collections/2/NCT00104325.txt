    
      Cytapheresis is an automated method/process of cell removal and collection that involves a
      continuous flow cell separation by centrifugation and the withdrawal of a particular blood
      component. This allows blood components not collected to be continuously

      returned to the donor. Guidance and recommendations for the performance of these procedures
      are provided in detail in the Standards of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and
      in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

      The study objective is to provide white blood cells obtained by cytapheresis to National
      Institute on Aging (NIA) researchers for other in-vitro research studies.

      The study population consists of healthy males and females 18 years and older. Study subjects
      are anticipated to be non-patient community volunteers. Individuals will not be excluded
      based on gender, race or ethnicity. The number of subjects to be enrolled will

      be 10, 000. This will allow us to try and maintain 200 active participants in this protocol.
      Volunteers are screened initially and annually by a health history questionnaire and
      laboratory testing to screen for bleeding or immune disorders. Participants may undergo a
      cytapheresis procedure every fifty-six days.

      We will collect blood component cells for distribution to NIA research investigators for
      their studies of the immune system. We will be performing cytapheresis for the collection of
      3 7 blood component packs per week. We will need to maintain an active volunteer pool of
      approximately 200 active volunteers.
