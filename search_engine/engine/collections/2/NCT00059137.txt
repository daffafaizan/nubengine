      sense and plot the patient's respiratory cycle. The point in the respiratory cycle at which
      the patient holds his/her breath will be recorded at different levels and correlated with CT
      scans and prior patient breathing levels. Our hypothesis is that a graphical representation
      of the respiratory cycle may make it easier for the patient to hold his or her breath at the
      same level each time a CT scan is obtained, or a needle is inserted. If this is true, then
      this should translate into faster safer procedures, with potentially less ionizing radiation,
      although this endpoint is not defined in this particular study.
