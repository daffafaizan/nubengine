    
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 4-period, single-dose, single-center, crossover
      study with a William's design in healthy subjects (males).

      The study will comprise:

        1. A screening period of maximum 28 days;

        2. Four treatment periods during which subjects will be resident prior to the evening meal
           the night before dosing with abediterol (Day -1) until at least 48 hours following
           dosing for collection of PK samples; discharged on the morning of Day 3; and

        3. A final safety post-treatment visit within 14 days after the last administration of
           abediterol.

      There will be a minimum washout period of 14 days between each treatment period.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 12 weeks.
