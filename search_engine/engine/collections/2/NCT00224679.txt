      clinical trial design to test the efficacy of regular low-dose aspirin administration in
      reducing the recurrence rate of colorectal adenomatous polyps. The study involved 49
      gastroenterology centers from various parts of France. Patients were eligible if they had
      either at least 3 adenomas irrespective of size, or at least one measuring 6mm in diameter or
      more histologically confirmed colorectal adenomatous polyp by the local pathologist, and 2
      independent pathologists, underwent a complete colonoscopy with polypectomy and were then
      confirmed free of polyps, were aged between 18 and 75 years at recruitment, and were be able
      to conform to the protocol during the study period. During a 4-week run-in period before
      enrolment, all subjects took 300 mg aspirin per day to test tolerance and compliance with the
      treatment. They were then randomized to either of the following three groups: placebo,
      aspirin as acetylsalicylate of lysine 160 mg/day or aspirin as acetylsalicylate of lysine 300
      mg/day. Information on compliance, tolerance of the treatment and concomitant disease is
      obtained at regular clinical visits every 4 months. Informations on factors such as smocking
      habits, previous medical history was recorded at enrollment. The primary outcomes were
      defined as the proportion of subjects in whom at least one new adenoma was detected, and the
      adenomatous polyp burden calculated as the sum of the diameters of these adenomas at the
      follow-up colonoscopy 1 and 4 years after enrollment.
