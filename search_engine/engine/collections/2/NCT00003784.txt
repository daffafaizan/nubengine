      diagnosed follicular lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
      prednisone (CHOP) followed by iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody anti-B1. II. Determine the
      complete and partial response rates of these patients after this therapy. III. Evaluate the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the rate of disappearance of cells
      with clonal t(14;18)/bcl2 rearrangements from the peripheral blood and bone marrow after this
      therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 15 minutes, doxorubicin IV, and
      vincristine IV on day 1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Treatment is repeated every 21 days
      for up to 6 courses. Within 4-8 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy, patients who
      achieve at least a partial response and have less than 25% bone marrow involvement begin
      immunotherapy. Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody anti-B1 (MOAB anti-B1) IV over
      1 hour, then iodine I 131 MOAB anti-B1 IV over 20 minutes on day 1. This regimen is repeated
      on day 8. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
