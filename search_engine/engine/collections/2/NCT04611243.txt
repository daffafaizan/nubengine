      COVID-19 will be followed up at the Prince of Wales Hospital at 4 weeks after discharge, 6,
      12, 18 and 24 months similar to our previous studies for SARS patients in 2003. The
      assessment at each timepoint includes: lung volume (total lung capacity [TLC], vital
      capacity, residual volume, functional residual capacity), spirometry (FVC, FEV1), diffusing
      capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), 6-min walk distance, chest radiographs, and
      Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey questionnaire. In addition,
      blood will be taken for ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibody to the receptor-binding domain
      of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate its sensitivity and specificity together with
      90% plaque reduction neutralization tests.

      T cell assays for SARS-CoV will be carried out on the blood samples collected at 6 and 24
      months.

      (c) Expected outcome(s) This study will inform if there is any impairment of lung function,
      exercise capacity and quality of life among patients with confirmed COVID-19. In addition the
      study will provide data on the titre and longevity of the serology response.
