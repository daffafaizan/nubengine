      cavity (intraperitoneal [IP] chemotherapy) may provide a significant survival benefit to
      women with ovarian cancer when combined with cytoreductive surgery and IV chemotherapy.

      This study will include a dose-finding phase and an efficacy phase to evaluate IP NanoPac®
      administered immediately post-cytoreductive surgery in women with ovarian cancer. In the
      dose-finding phase, subjects will be enrolled in dose-escalated cohorts of three subjects and
      receive IP NanoPac® at 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/m2 plus standard of care (SOC) IV
      chemotherapy. Subjects will be followed for disease status for 12 months. The two best doses
      from the dose-finding phase will be determined. In the efficacy phase, subjects will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to one of the two best doses plus SOC IV chemotherapy or SOC alone.
