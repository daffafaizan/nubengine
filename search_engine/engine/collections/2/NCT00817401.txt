      health problem worldwide. Moderate to severe HIE of newborn infants is associated with a high
      rate of death or long-term disabilities. Historically, treatment has been purely supportive
      including stabilizing cardio-respiratory functions and treating convulsions. Recent
      multi-center trials assessing the effects of hypothermia demonstrated improved outcome in
      term neonates with moderate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, hypothermia was
      not effective beyond 6 hrs after brain injury. The aim of this study was to investigate
      whether systemic hypothermia induced up to 10 hrs after birth would improve the
      neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months in infants with moderate or severe HIE.
