      cytoreductive agents prior to and during definitive radiation therapy improves overall
      survival over radiation therapy alone in locally confined carcinomas of the prostate;
      Secondary: To compare the rates of disease-specific survival, clinical relapse (local
      progression and/or distant failure), freedom from prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure,
      freedom from second clinical relapse, freedom from second PSA relapse, and disease-free
      survival; To compare the prostate re-biopsy at two years; To measure the effect on sexual
      function.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients were stratified by PSA level (less
      than 4 vs 4-20), tumor differentiation (well vs moderate vs poor), nodal status (N0 [nodes
      evaluated by surgical sampling] vs NX [nodes evaluated negative by imaging methods only]),
      and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral flutamide 3 times a day and goserelin subcutaneously once every 4
      weeks, or once as a time release injection (intramuscular leuprolide may be substituted for
      goserelin), beginning 2 months prior to radiotherapy and continuing until completion of
      radiotherapy. Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 4-5 days per week for almost 8 weeks. Arm
      II: Patients undergo radiotherapy only, as in arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months for
      the remainder of the first year, every 4 months for the second year, every 6 months for the
      third through fifth years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1980 patients within 5 years.
