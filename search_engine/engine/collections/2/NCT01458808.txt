      cardiovascular (CV) complications. Inflammation is established as a major risk factor for CV
      complications in these patients, occurring in approximately one third of them. Recently,
      growing evidences have suggested the body water volume expansion is a cause of inflammation
      in CKD. In a previous study Rodrigues Telini showed that dietary sodium restriction reduced
      the inflammatory markers levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Similar results were observed
      in patients treated by reduction of HD dialysate sodium concentration. However in both
      studies no significant reduction in body volume markers was observed. These results could be
      due to small number of patients or low sensibility of volume markers; on the other hand they
      could suggest a direct role of sodium as an inflammatory inducer independently of volume.
      With a larger number of patients and using a more sensitive volume marker as the B-type
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), this study intends to confirm the hypothesis that sodium
      mobilization can reduce the body water volume and attenuate the inflammatory in HD patients.
      A hundred thirty-five patients will be enrolled and divided in three groups with 35 patients:
      A, treated by reduction of 2 grams in daily sodium intake; B, exposed to reduction of sodium
      dialysate from 138 to 135 mEq/L and C, control group. The patients will be followed up by 16
      weeks and inflammatory markers (CRP, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor) as well as
      volume markers (Watson formula, electrical bioimpedance measurements and BNP concentration)
      will be determine each 8 weeks.
