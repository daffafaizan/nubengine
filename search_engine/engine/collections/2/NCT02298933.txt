      bleeding in patients who have low and/or dysfunctional platelets. Treatment of blood cancer
      and other blood diseases as well as bone marrow transplantation is not possible without
      platelet transfusion support. Unfortunately, 20-60% of chronically transfused patients will
      stop responding to these transfusions putting them at risk for serious bleeding
      complications. Data support the concept that in many patients, platelet counts fail to
      increase after a platelet transfusion because the transfused platelets are destroyed by the
      body s complement. In order to overcome this problem, we will inhibit complement activity
      with the medication eculizumab that specifically binds and suppresses complement. We
      hypothesize that when we treat patients who have platelet refractoriness with eculizumab, the
      platelet counts will increase to higher numbers after platelet transfusions, decreasing the
      risk of bleeding complications associated with having a low platelet count.
