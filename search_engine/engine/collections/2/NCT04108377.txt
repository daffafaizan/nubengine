      insulin resistance, both common in obesity, are associated with an increased risk of
      concurrent asthma.

      Targeting Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors (PDE4) allows for examination of a mechanism
      potentially linking obesity and asthma as well as identification of readily available and
      safe options to treat hyperinsulinemic, overweight asthmatics.

      It is hypothesized that obesity and hyperinsulinemia contribute to asthma by impairing Î²2
      adrenoreceptor function and that this can be rescued the PDE4 inhibitor, roflumilast.
