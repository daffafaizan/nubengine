      dyslipidemia, raised blood pressure, insulin resistance or glucose intolerance. These
      symptoms are also frequently found in hypogonadal men.

      Adipose tissue and androgens in male obesity are reciprocally linked. Total and free
      testosterone (T) are decreased in proportion to the degree of body fatness while T regulates
      insulin sensitivity and body composition. As a consequence, hypoandrogenism carries an
      additional independent risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Men with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2D) exhibit lowered T levels that are inversely correlated to HbA1c. In
      addition, abdominal adiposity causes an impairment of testicular steroidogenesis that is
      directly linked to circulating adipokines; enhanced cytokine release from
      macrophage-infiltrated adipose tissue is pivotal to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance
      and atherosclerosis. Both MetS and T2D share with hypogonadism such a proinflammatory state.

      For this reason we performed a randomized controlled trial on the effects of TRT on insulin
      resistance and circulating inflammatory markers in a cohort of middle-aged men with mild
      hypogonadism and MetS at first diagnosis, that were not taking medications known to influence
      the investigated outcomes. We established strict criteria for enrollment and used a
      physiological replacing therapy.

      Given that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) determines a reduction of body fat mass
      paralleled by an increase in fat free mass (6), and that TRT exerts an anti-inflammatory role
      inhibiting interleukins (IL), in particular the IL-6 gene (14), it remains to be established
      whether these independent effects also reflect in an improvement in insulin resistance.
