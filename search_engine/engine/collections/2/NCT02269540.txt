      and the dietary supplement. There are two possible selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      treatments but the dietary supplement remains the same. No subjects are receiving the
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor alone and no subjects are receiving the dietary
      supplement alone. The dietary supplement is called n-acetylcysteine.
