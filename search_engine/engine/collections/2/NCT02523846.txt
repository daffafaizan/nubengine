      subjects who meet this criteria meaning their dynamic pain (when blowing incentive
      spirometer) is â‰¥ 4/10 after starting on IV-PCA Morphine will be randomized in to 2 groups.
      One group will receive patient re--education with an additional background morphine infusion
      and the other group will receive re--education only.

      The second highlight for this study is regarding the background morphine calculation. The
      background morphine is calculated according to this formula:

      Total morphine requirement in the first 24 hours post surgery (mg) = 100 - Age (year) So, the
      background morphine infusion will be calculated based on subject's age and half of their 24
      hours requirement will be infused over 24 hours.

      This formula was published by Pamela Macintyre in her paper titled " Age is the Best
      Predictor of Postoperative Morphine Requirement".
