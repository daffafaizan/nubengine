      due to its advantages of minimally invasive, safe and direct vision. Intra-capsular
      arthroscopy(intracapsular method), which is performed via natural cavity, is the mainstream
      arthroscopic procedure. However, intracapsular method requires the damage of joint capsule
      and may cause intraoperative neurovascular injury and other complications. In view of the
      defects of intracapsular method, the surgical scheme of the extracapsular arthroscopy
      (referred to as "extracapsular method") has emerged. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the exploration history, key theories, methods, and techniques involved in the evolution from
      the intracapsular method to the extracapsular method for arthroscopic treatment of tennis
      elbow, and explore the effectiveness and safety of extracapsular method.

      Methods: Qualitative data were collected via focus group interview. 7 surgeons who were
      selected through purposive sampling discussed on the theories, methods, and technical
      specifications of the transition from intracapsular method to extracapsular method.
      Qualitative data were analysed using NVivo11. Quantitative data of consecutive 43 patients
      were analysed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the extracapsular method.
      Descriptive analysis was conducted to analyse the demographic characteristics and clinical
      outcomes after surgery.
