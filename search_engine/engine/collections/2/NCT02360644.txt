    
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of vitamin D deficiency and repletion on xenobiotic
      clearance in vivo. The study will mechanistically evaluate the function of major pathways of
      metabolism and transport by prospectively studying clearance phenotypes utilizing "probe"
      drugs commonly used for this purpose in CKD patients and healthy volunteers under vitamin D
      deficient and replete states. Bupropion, midazolam, olmesartan, fexofenadine, in addition to
      an endogenous probe (N-methylnicotinamide), will be used to phenotype major phase I drug
      metabolizing enzymes [cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6), cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5)], and
      transporters [multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and
      multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1/2K (MATE1/2K)], respectively. Hypothesis: The in vivo
      function of individual pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and transport are affected by
      vitamin D status (and CKD).

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of CKD on the in vivo function of individual CYPs
      responsible for vitamin D metabolism and the pharmacokinetics of cholecalciferol (vitamin
      D3). The research will prospectively measure the activity of CYP450s responsible for
      cholecalciferol metabolism, and simultaneously evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      cholecalciferol after single- and multiple-dose administration to CKD patients (stages 1-5)
      and healthy volunteers. Hypothesis: CKD alters the activity of individual CYPs responsible
      for vitamin D metabolism, leading to modified clearance of cholecalciferol.
