      double blind randomized controlled trial, according to CONSORT guidelines. This will be a
      four armed study of three doses of inositol vs. placebo over a three month period with the
      reduction in hyperandrogenism (based on serum testosterone levels) as the primary outcome and
      key secondary outcomes of the change in sex hormone binding globulin(SHBG) and the related
      free androgen index, fasting insulin levels and area under the curve glucose levels from an
      oral glucose challenge test (OGTT). The hypothesis is that women with PCOS who receive
      inositol supplementation will have a dose related reduction in hyperandrogenism. Further, we
      propose that the primary mechanism of inositol will be a significant improvement in
      hyperandrogenism (both ovarian and adrenal) vs. placebo, as documented by a lower free
      androgen index [decreased total testosterone and increased sex hormone blinding globulin
      (SHBG)], lower sebum measures and lower antral follicle counts of the ovary and
      anti-Mullerian hormone, all of which will correlate with the decrease in hyperandrogenism.
