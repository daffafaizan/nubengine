      progesterone (PrometriumÂ®). Participants maintain a daily diary to keep track of their
      vasomotor symptoms and other factors. Forearm blood flow will be assessed by venous occlusion
      plethysmography at baseline and after three months of therapy. Screening tests at baseline to
      rule out heart disease include measurement of blood pressure and heart rate,
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests - fasting blood glucose and lipid profile.

      Collection of serum and plasma samples at baseline and end of therapy for analysis of
      cardiovascular markers (e.g., c-reactive protein) and clotting and fibrinolytic markers.
      Continued daily diary collection for one month after therapy discontinuation to look for
      possible rebound effects. Analysis of outcomes will be by analysis of covariates, with final
      value as the outcome, therapy as factor and baseline values as covariate.
