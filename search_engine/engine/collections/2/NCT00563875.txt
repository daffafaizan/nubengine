      antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin. Taken together with laboratory findings of a low
      response to aspirin, the term "aspirin resistance" has been coined. Diabetics have an
      increased risk of suffering ischemic vascular events and, recently, an increased prevalence
      of "aspirin resistance" was reported in these patients. The purpose of the present study is
      to compare the aspirin response in diabetics and non-diabetics in a population with
      angiogram-verified coronary artery disease. Furthermore, healthy volunteers and patients who
      suffered a myocardial infarction while being treated with aspirin are included. Eligible
      patients are identified in the Western Denmark Heart Registry.
