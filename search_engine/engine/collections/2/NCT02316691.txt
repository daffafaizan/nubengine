      currently the standard of care for TED patients. Subjects will receive the IVGC therapy at a
      facility chosen by them and their physician. If their disease does not respond to IVGC
      therapy, they will receive rituximab and/or surgical decompression and/or radiation which is
      also currently standard of care at a facility chosen by them and their physician. Prior to
      initiation of treatment and during the course of treatment, study patients will get research
      labs done along with routine labs and fill out questionnaires regarding their disease
      symptoms.

      We will obtain 30 mL or 2 tablespoons of blood from subjects at initial evaluation and
      approximately Wk4, Wk 12, Wk 26, Wk 38, and Wk 52 (this may vary depending on when the
      patient comes in for their follow up visits, but the schedule approximates what is typical
      for standard of care in these patients) for mechanistic studies.
