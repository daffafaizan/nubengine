      for couples dealing with sexual dysfunction secondary to prostate cancer treatment. Couples
      will be invited to participate through the Vancouver Prostate Centre (VPC) and the Prostate
      Cancer Survivorship Care (PCSC) Program. Interested couples will be screened for eligibility.
      Eligible couples will be randomized to either an immediate-start or a delayed-waitlist
      control group.

      Prior to treatment, couples will complete an online questionnaire package. Treatment will
      consist of a 4-week mindfulness-based group lead by a clinician trained in mindfulness
      treatment. Sessions are 2hrs in length and take place in consecutive weeks, with daily
      homework recommended between sessions. The intervention was developed based on pre-existing
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy treatment groups for sexual dysfunction developed by Dr.
      Lori Brotto at the UBC Sexual Health Laboratory, mindfulness in sex therapy and intimate
      relationships (MSIR) treatment group developed by Kocsis and Newbury-Helps (2016), and expert
      input. Sessions consist of mindfulness-based training, sex therapy techniques, and education.
      After treatment, couples will be invited to complete a post-treatment questionnaire once
      immediately after the end of treatment, and again 6 months later.
