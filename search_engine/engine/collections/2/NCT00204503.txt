      common substance of abuse is alcohol, which is most commonly associated with the depressed
      phase of the illness. Although there are available treatments for bipolar depression, no
      studies have been done to evaluate efficacy in bipolar patients with comorbid substance abuse
      disorders. Given the independent open-label evidence for efficacy and safety of divalproex
      sodium in alcohol abuse and bipolar depression, divalproex sodium is the most likely
      candidate for potential success in bipolar depressed patients with comorbid alcohol abuse or
      dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine if Divalproex Sodium can be used to
      Treat and Prevent Depression in Patients with Bipolar Disorder who have Comorbid Alcohol
      Dependence/Abuse.
