      burden on children. Allergic inflammation is responsible for all clinical symptoms of asthma.
      The effects of allergic inflammation are: bronchial muscle constriction, excessive mucus
      production, and edema of mucosa, all elements of "asthmatic triad" causing bronchial
      obturation. Normal lung function is one of the goals of asthma management. In most of the
      studies the effect of monotherapy on the symptom scores, lung function parameters and
      bronchial hyperreactivity was assessed.

      The present study was conducted to determine the effects of four week treatment with
      budesonide, montelukast, budesonide with montelukast and budesonide with formoterol in
      children with atopic asthma on lung function: forced expiratory volume in one second,
      mid-expiratory flow, peak expiratory flow rate, resistance by the interrupter technique,
      plethysmographic specific airway resistance, exercise-induced bronchial hyperreactivity and
      clinical symptoms.
