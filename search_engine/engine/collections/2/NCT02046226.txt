    
      A Prospective, Randomized, controlled pilot study enrolling up to 50 subjects at a singe
      investigational site in the US. Subjects with atherosclerotic peripheral arteria disease
      (PAD) presenting with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and one or more non-healing lower
      extremity arterial insufficiency ulcers who are suitable candidates for revascularization
      procedures (endovascular or surgical) will be randomized 1:1 to:

        -  Wound care with the use of OxyGenesys(TM) Dissolved Oxygen Dressing, or

        -  Standard Wound Care procedures

      An initial study phase will enroll up to 20 subjects (10 in each arm). Pending results of the
      initial study phase, the study may continue to enroll until up to 50 subjects (25 in each
      arm) have been enrolled.

      All subjects will be followed clinically and receive wound evaluation at 1, 3, and 6 months.
