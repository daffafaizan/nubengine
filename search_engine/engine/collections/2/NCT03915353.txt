      exposure to intense noise on the auditory system are well explained, but the number of
      studies that observes the effects of noise on the vestibular system is limited. It has been
      stated that intense noise may affect the peripheral vestibular system and consequently cause
      problems in balance mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
      exposure to chronic noise on vestibular functions and balance in Edirne Band musicians.

      Twenty-two individuals working in the Edirne Band for at least 5 years and over 18 years of
      age who did not have a diagnosed vestibular disorder, no cervical vertebrae problem, no
      musculoskeletal system problems during the evaluation and a control group of 22 individuals
      working at Trakya University and with similar sociodemographic characteristics to the
      experimental group were included in the study. The socio-demographic questionnaire was used
      to inquire about the demographic characteristics of individuals and alcohol-cigarette use,
      the Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale to assess how they felt about the balance, and
      the Dizziness Handicap Inventory to determine the quality of life-related to dizziness. A 3D
      ultrasonic system was used to assess the static and dynamic balance of the individuals.
