      (cP32) in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer that has failed conventional
      therapy. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interstitial cP32 when combined with
      interstitial macroaggregated albumin (infusional brachytherapy) in these patients. III.
      Determine the therapeutic response rate to acceptable single doses of cP32 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of colloidal phosphorus P32 (cP32). Patients receive
      cP32 and macroaggregated albumin via interstitial infusion using ultrasound localization.
      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of cP32 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 4 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicities. Additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 1,
      2, 4, and 6 weeks; then at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 months; and then every 6 months
      thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a
      total of 40 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study.
