      recurrent and self-limited attacks of fever associated with abdominal, chest, and joint pain.
      Previous studies have shown that individuals with FMF are more limited in terms of physical
      function than the normal population, and depression and anxiety are more common in these
      individuals. Being a lifetime disease, quality of life, and mental health can be affected due
      to serious complications such as attack frequency, disease resistance, and sometimes
      amyloidosis. Mental imagery is the ability to imaging the movement without doing the physical
      execution of the movement. During the last years, mental imagery is used in clinical practice
      as a tool for the treatment of chronic pain. Pain differs in patients with rheumatic
      diseases. Stress is one of the predictors of pain in patients with FMF. Even if the frequency
      is variable when attacks happen they may affect patients physically and their mental health
      and the ability to cope. A main function of imagery is to aid the self-regulation of
      thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. To use imagery for motor and motivational outcomes firstly
      the imagery ability levels should be measured.
