      medications which treat RLS will be asked to discontinue the medications for two weeks prior
      to beginning the study. All participants will be screened with Beck Depression Inventory,
      International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) severity scale, and Clinical Global
      Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale. An ordinal scale (i.e. rate symptoms from 1-8) will
      also be obtained. Participants will be randomized to a placebo or medication group. Those in
      the medication group will be given 150 mg of bupropion at night for six weeks. Others will
      receive similar-appearing placebo. Participants will be called at the end of weeks one, two,
      four and five to assess symptom severity based on IRLSSG scale, and to determine if they are
      experiencing any adverse effects. At three weeks and six weeks, participants will return to
      the clinic to complete all four of the initial forms, the Beck Depression Inventory, IRLSSG
      severity scale, ordinal scale, and CGI-I.
