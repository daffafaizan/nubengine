    
      This is a Phase I study of the combination tamoxifen and 9-cis-Retinoic acid in patients with
      breast cancer. The primary objective of the study is; 1) to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose of 9-cis-Retinoic acid in combination with Tamoxifen and to determine the overall and
      dose limiting toxicities. Other objectives are: 2) to determine the effect of Tamoxifen on
      the pharmacokinetics of 9-cis-Retinoic acid; 3) to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of this
      combination therapy within the context of a phase I study; 4) and to determine the expression
      of surrogate biomarkers of breast carcinogenesis before and after treatment.
