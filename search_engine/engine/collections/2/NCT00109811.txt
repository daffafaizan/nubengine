      I. Determine the T-lymphocyte immune response in patients with recurrent adenocarcinoma of
      the prostate treated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) peptide vaccine (PSA-3A; PSA:
      154-163 [155L]) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this vaccine in these patients. II. Determine the effect of this
      vaccine on serum PSA level in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) peptide vaccine (PSA-3A; PSA: 154-163
      [155L]) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously once in weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, and
      18 in the absence of disease progression* or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *A rise in PSA alone is not considered disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks.
