      from physiologic insulin replacement, defined as administration of background and mealtime
      insulin. More than half of patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have less than 50% of their
      beta cell function at the time of diagnosis. Because of this, these patients would also
      benefit from the physiologic delivery of insulin. Currently, 4 or more injections per day are
      required to deliver the various different available insulins in a physiologic manner.
      Valeritas has developed the h-Patch, a device suitable to make the delivery of basal and
      bolus insulin effective, simple and discrete. This study will measure patient preference,
      glucose control and safety of the h-Patch compared with patients' previous therapy. Patients
      previous therapy will be multiple daily injections delivered either by pens or needle and
      syringe.
