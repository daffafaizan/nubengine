      information and occurrence of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. By
      collecting this information in a standardized manner, CAPACITY can aid in providing more
      insight in (1) the incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19, and
      (2) the vulnerability and clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with an underlying
      cardiovascular disease.

      The CAPACITY extension to the ISARIC-WHO CRF consists of additional data collection
      instruments for:

        -  cardiac history and cardiovascular risk factors

        -  prior use of cardiac medication or NSAIDs

        -  electrocardiography (ECG)

        -  echocardiography

        -  cardiac MRI

        -  invasive cardiac procedures

        -  cardiac complications

        -  cardiac biomarkers

        -  cardiac outcome during admission
