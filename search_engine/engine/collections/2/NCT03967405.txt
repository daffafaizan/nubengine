    
      Patients (n = 50) with chronic wounds will be imaged using 2 imaging devices. Two types of
      images will be acquired with each device, as standard photograph (ST-image) and a
      fluorescence image (FL-image). The images captured with the 2 imaging devices will be
      compared off-line by many interpreters to assess for any differences in the images that would
      alter a clinical decision.
