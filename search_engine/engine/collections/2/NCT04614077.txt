      procedures despite knowing evidence of its influence on the human endothelial cell function.
      Aim of this study was to assess the effect of DuraGraft©, an intraoperative graft treatment
      solution, on human saphenous vein segments, rat aortic segments and human umbilical vein
      endothelial cells (HUVECs) in comparison to saline. According to literature saline could have
      detrimental effects on the endothelium but data shows conflicting evidence. Duragraft a so
      called endothelial preservation solution should protect the human endothelium. Intent of this
      observational study was to study the effects of both solutions and compare them.

      Within 12 patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery, left overs from saphenous vein
      graft segments were randomized to DuraGraft© (n=12/6) or saline (n=12/6) solution before
      intraoperative storage. These segments as well as rat aortic segments underwent assessment of
      vascular function in a multichamber isometric myograph system in comparison to
      Krebs-Henseleit solution (KHS), a physiologic organ buffer solution. Additionally, human
      umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used for cell viability tests.
