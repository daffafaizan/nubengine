    
      IED is a condition characterized by a failure to resist aggressive impulses. IED is a
      behavioral defined condition for which effective treatments have not been identified.
      Research suggests that serotonin (5-HT), a chemical that helps regulate mood and emotions,
      may play a role in the response to pharmacological IED treatments. This study will examine
      the relationship between 5-HT receptors and response to treatment with fluoxetine or
      divalproex. In addition, this study will examine people with IED and those without the
      condition to determine whether there are differences in their 5-HT receptor and transporter
      systems.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine,
      divalproex, or placebo for 12 weeks. Scale ratings will be used to assess the aggression
      levels of participants. Biologic evaluations of the 5-HT system will be conducted throughout
      the study.
