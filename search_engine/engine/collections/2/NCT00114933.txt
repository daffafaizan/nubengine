    
      Primary Study Objective: Efficacy and durability of switching to lopinavir/ritonavir
      single-drug HAART compared to maintaining therapy based on lopinavir/ritonavir and two
      nucleosides

      Secondary Study Objective(s):

        -  Safety (related drug AEs/SAEs and laboratory anomalies G3/4) through 48 w.

        -  Resistance profile on patients with sustained virological failure

        -  QOL comparing stopping nucleosides versus continuing therapy

        -  Pharmaco-economic analysis comparing treatment cost between the 2 study arms.

        -  Predicting factors of failure in the stopping nucleosides arm

      Subject Population: 200 patients

      Study Design:

      RANDOMIZATION:

      Patients are randomized (1:1) either to continue under the same treatment or stop nucleosides
      as follows:

        -  Stopping nucleosides arm: Lopinavir/r alone.

        -  Continuing arm: Lopinavir/r + 2 NRTIs

      STUDY PROCEDURES: A baseline HIV-RNA, CD4 and routine labs will be collected if the most
      recent results are not collected within the 4 weeks prior entering the study. Patients will
      be followed for HIV-RNA (and CD4) at w1, w4, w8, w16, w24, w 36 and w48. After w48,
      durability of response to lopinavir/r single-drug therapy will be studied long-term (up to
      w96). Routine hematology and clinical chemistry (including fasting triglycerides and
      cholesterol, total and HDL/LDL ratio) will be measured at w4, w16, w24, w 36 and w48. A
      central laboratory will be used for HIV-RNA determinations and to archive plasma/cell samples
      for further genotype test in case of rebound.

      Treatment adherence will be followed with a self-patient report questionnaire (GEEMA study)

      All AEs will be collected if suspected relation (possible or probable) to any concomitant ARV
      drug, and SAEs, related or not, reported within 24h.
