1786. studies of theleucocyte compartmentin guinea-pig bonemarrow after acutehaemorrhage andsevere hypoxia  evidencefor a common stem-cellafter a large acute hemorrhage,the absolute le-vels of neutrophils, eosinophils, andbasophils in guineapig bone marrow are considerablyreduced.  all stagesof differentiation are involved, thedecline in myelo-blasts and promyelocytes beingparticularly marked.exposure to severe hypoxia alsotemporarily depressesthe number of marrow granulocytes.bone marrowlymphocytes are only slightly reducedafter a single he-morrhage but in the later stages ofsevere hypoxia theirnumbers are greatly reduced.assuming the supply ofstem cells in the bone marrowis not unlimited, the de-crease in marrow granulocytesand lymphocytes follow-ing marked erythropoietic stimulationappears to favora monophyletic theory of hemopoiesis;a heavy demandfor stem cells to differentiate into theerythron maytemporarily restrict thenumber entering the leukon.  thehypoxic animals showeda considerable loss of body weightand the notable reductionof marrow lymphocytes in thelater stages of hypoxiamay be specifically related to ageneralized atrophy oflymphoid tissue.  using h3-thymi-dine there is evidenceof active dna synthesis in guineapig metamyelocytes.although dna-synthesis was foundin metamyelocytes ofnormal marrow, after hemorrhagethese cells form a muchlarger proportion of the totalsynthesizing cells in thegranulocyte compartment andalso the ratio of labeledmetamyelocytes to myelocytesis considerably increased.microspectrophotometricmeasurements of the feulgendna-content of metamyelo-cytes after hemorrhage showthat there are 2 populationsof these cells.  one group hasvalues typical of resting ornonsynthesizing cells but a 2ndgroup shows a completerange of dna-values up to levelscharacteristic of thosefound in dividing cells.  certainsmall mononuclear cellswith minimal but deeply basophiliccytoplasm are a dis-tinctive group of dna-synthesizingcells in marrow af-ter hemorrhage.  morphologically,there appears to be acomplete sequence between thesecells and procrythro-blasts.
