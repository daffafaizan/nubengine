      use. Some of these people are currently being treated with Buprenorphine for their addiction
      and with medications for HIV infection. Raltegravir is a medication that was approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir acts by
      making it more difficult for the virus that causes AIDS to multiply and cause more damage to
      the immune system in someone who is HIV infected.

      Earlier studies looking at the effect of Buprenorphine and HIV medications have shown that
      Buprenorphine and some HIV medications act differently when taken together. It is important
      to learn if taking Buprenorphine and HIV medications together results in changes in the blood
      level of either medication. If the HIV medication affects the level of Buprenorphine in the
      blood, an individual taking Buprenorphine and HIV medications may experience symptoms of
      withdrawal, even while taking their usual dose of Buprenorphine. On the other hand, if
      Buprenorphine decreases the amount of HIV medication in the blood, then the HIV medication
      may be less effective in controlling HIV infection. It is therefore important to learn if
      Raltegravir and Buprenorphine will affect each other when taken together.

      In order to learn about the effects of Buprenorphine and Raltegravir, we will need to measure
      the amount of Buprenorphine in your blood for 24 hours before you have taken Raltegravir and
      then compare that to the amount of Buprenorphine in your blood after you have taken
      Buprenorphine and Raltegravir together .
