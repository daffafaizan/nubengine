      during the data analysis phase. Predictor variables with a substantial single variable
      association with each outcome (p<0.2) will be included in a multivariable linear regression
      model to determine the adjusted associations of improved outcome from being in the treatment
      arm. A second model will use multi-levels (two levels: 1. time points for individuals, 2.
      individuals) to determine whether the trajectory of change in outcome scores differs between
      the two arms of the study. Significant predictors of improved outcomes will be determined
      from both of these models. A sensitivity analysis will be undertaken for final models based
      on degrees of compliance to home treatment using categories determined through exploratory
      analysis of the data.
