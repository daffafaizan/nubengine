    
      Between 1995 and 2004, 239 patients with isolated colorectal liver metastases received HAI
      chemotherapy with neoadjuvant intent. Fifty of these patients underwent subsequent curative
      liver resection (HAI group).

      Postoperative morbidity, liver function tests, and long term outcomes were evaluated. Adverse
      events related to HAI chemotherapy were also evaluated.
