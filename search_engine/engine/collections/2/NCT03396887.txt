      sufferers seek treatment and the rate of relapse is high. There is therefore an urgent need
      for improved methods of promoting long term abstinence and recovery in AUD. This study will
      explore the effectiveness of a smartphone application, UControlDrink, in aiding recovery from
      AUD in patients who have been discharged from an inpatient alcohol treatment programme. The
      application comprises five recovery focused features:

      supportive messages, Computerised-Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a drinking log, activities
      and trigger avoidance log, craving management and gamification. Patients will use the
      application for 3 months. A control group of patients will also be followed over the same
      time period. Cumulative abstinence duration as well as changes in questionnaire measures to
      baseline, time to first drink, proportion of patients continuously abstinent from alcohol,
      levels of activity within the app and patient satisfaction with their overall treatment will
      be measured at 3 months. If successful, this application may offer a unique, patient-centred,
      technology-driven, cost effective method of improving outcomes in AUD.
