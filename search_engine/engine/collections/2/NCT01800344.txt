      of pharyngolaryngeal symptoms. Yet, pressure manometers are not widely available limiting the
      application of a strategy of intracuff pressure reduction. The Ultra airway has been designed
      to provide continuous indication of intracuff pressure and can limit the intracuff pressure
      to < 60 cm H2O. This study compares the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal complications in
      patients managed with either a pressure-limiting strategy using the Ultra or a standard
      practice using a LMA, in ambulatory surgery patients.
