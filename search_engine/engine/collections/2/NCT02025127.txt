      persistent hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 70 mmHg) despite intravenous (IV) fluid
      resuscitation. Severe sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare problems, affecting
      millions of people around the world each year In critically ill patients without shock,
      provision of enteral nutrition within 24-48 hours has shown to preserve intestinal
      epithelium, maintain brush border enzyme activity, maintenance of barrier function to enhance
      immune function, and preservation of tight cell junctions to reduce permeability. These
      benefits of enteral nutrition are postulated to prevent downstream complications of
      nosocomial infections and the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), though direct data
      addressing this question are lacking.

      The primary aim of this study is to conduct a phase III single-center pilot randomized
      controlled trial comparing early trophic EN to 'no EN' in mechanically ventilated septic
      shock patients to determine feasibility of achieving >75% consent and compliance rate and
      <10% contamination rate.
