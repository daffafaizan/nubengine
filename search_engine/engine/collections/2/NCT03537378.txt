      central lung neoplasms meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and could receive interventional
      therapy.

      There are 3 study site in this study and a total of 30 patients with early central lung
      cancer will be included.

      HybridAPC is integrated with traditional APC and water-jet technique, which has been
      successfully applied for endoscopic treatment of mucosal lesions in GI, such as Barrett
      esophageal and lesions in colon. Submucosal injection of water jet can elevate superficial
      lesion, and then APC can be more effective in ablation of superficial tumor with a protection
      for muscular layer. The application of HybridAPC in respiratory intervention could
      theoretically protect cartilage, adventitia, reduce damage and formation of scare, and
      increase ablation energy to reach radical treatment.
