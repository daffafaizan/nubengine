      (SAS) Program in improving the social-emotional functioning of children with Autism Spectrum
      Disorders (ASD) in clinic, school and remote Skype/telephone-assisted delivery contexts.
      Results from a pilot University clinic evaluation of the program for children with
      social-emotional difficulties but without ASD has also yielded positive findings, showing
      comparable treatment effects to those achieved for children with ASD in terms of improved
      social-emotional functioning. Within the USA, results from a two-year Buffalo School District
      implementation project and delivery of the program through USC University Center for
      Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD Children's Hospital Los Angeles) have
      provided further support for the effectiveness and cross-cultural appropriateness of the
      intervention with children who have a range of mental health challenges. The present study
      aims to extend on the above literature by conducting a 6-month randomized controlled trial
      evaluating the effectiveness, utility and acceptability (including cultural acceptability) of
      the Secret Agent Society (SAS) social-emotional skills training program. Specifically, the
      study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the SAS Program for 8-12 year-old children with
      social difficulties in the context of a range of diagnosed mental health conditions and/or
      developmental disorders, including anxiety disorders, ADHD, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.
      Outcome variables will include measures of child social functioning and mental health
      outcomes related to their primary diagnoses (e.g. anxiety, disruptive behaviour, etc).
