      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in abstinent smokers to directly evaluate the effect of the
      4 milligrams (mg) nicotine lozenge on brain activation associated with visual attention. The
      experimental task featured 3 conditions: 1. a highly demanding cognitive/attention task, 2. a
      simple cognitive/attention task, and 3. simply look at a '+' symbol. During the experiment
      these conditions are each presented a number of times in an alternating manner while
      acquiring images.
