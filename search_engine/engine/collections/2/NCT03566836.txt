      undetected until late in the course of the condition. If AF can be detected with simpler
      tools like a smart watch, it would enable providers to identify patients with AF much earlier
      in the course of the condition (even before being seen by a physician) and hopefully be able
      to prevent stroke. This study is being done to identify a technology that can likely identify
      AF using a smart watch.
