      communicate, swallow and breathe. Each year, physicians diagnose approximately 650,000 cases
      of head and neck cancer worldwide. Many people with head and neck cancer have their cancer
      detected late, and this can result in a poor clinical outcome. One strategy to improve the
      clinical outcomes for people with a head and neck cancer is to develop a non-invasive
      screening assay using breath biomarkers. Such a diagnostic tool will identify at-risk
      individuals early, and potentially offer improved and cost-effective treatment.

      The idea of using human breath samples to detect cancer began with the observation that dogs
      can be trained to "sniff out" certain types of cancers from urine and blood. Since then the
      presence of various volatile organic compounds from many types of cancers, including: lung,
      skin, breast, prostate, and bladder have been characterized. These studies are ongoing, but
      promise to revolutionize the way physicians screen cancer in the future.

      In this pilot study, the Investigators aim to determine specific volatile organic compounds
      present in breath samples of patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer before and
      after tumor resection, or before and after definitive chemotherapy/radiotherapy. As head and
      neck cancer can result in significant functional deficit, early detection is the key to
      improving clinical outcome. Much anecdotal evidence exists for the presence of distinct odor
      emissions from the tumor bed of head and neck cancer patients. Therefore, the identification
      of specific volatile organic compound to head and neck cancer will undoubtedly lead to a
      novel, cost-effective screening strategy for early detection of head and neck cancer.
