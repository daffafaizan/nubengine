    
      MAC Project is a prospective cohort, multicenter, observational, no-profit study aimed to
      prospectively collect reliable real-life clinical information in unselected VTE or NVAF
      patients treated with any DOAC, during a medium-long term follow-up period. Patients will be
      investigated in Italian hospital-based clinical centers, skilled in the management of adult
      patients with VTE or NVAF requiring anticoagulant treatment, and followed-up up to 5 years.
      The drugs will be prescribed according to current standards of care and regulations and not
      provided by any sponsor. The primary outcome is to collect and evaluate the safety and
      efficacy data of DOACs in a real-life setting, regardless of the underlying pathology, and
      the duration of treatment. The secondary outcome is to separately evaluate safety and
      efficacy of DOACs for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, specifically considering
      treatment duration, as follows: short-term (e.g., superficial venous thrombosis); medium-term
      (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, etc.); long-term (e.g., atrial fibrillation,
      prevention of recurrent VTE or long-term treatment of recurrent VTE, peripheral arterial
      obstructive disease, etc.).Investigators will store event-driven clinical information into a
      REDCap based on-line EDC system about management and outcome of all efficacy and safety
      end-points; treatment compliance/adherence; VTE risk factors; thromboembolic and haemorrhagic
      risk-scores; comorbidities; concomitant treatments; patients' appreciation by a specific
      score (ACTS); clinical or adverse events; survival; possible causes of death.
