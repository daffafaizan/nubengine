      been shown to prevent AF compared to ventricular pacing. Whether prevention of AF and CHF by
      physiologic pacing reduces emergency room visits or hospitalizations for cardiovascular
      causes in this population in unknown.

      The investigators wish to determine the optimal pacing mode for this patient population that
      would enable optimal management of cardiovascular problems, resulting in improved quality of
      life and minimizing use of health care facilities.

      Patients recruited to the study will be randomized to either DDDR or VVIR pacing, and
      followed in the clinic every 6 months for the 3 years of the study.
