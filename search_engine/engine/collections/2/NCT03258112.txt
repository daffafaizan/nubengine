    
      The right and left ventricular outflow tracts (RVOT/LVOT) are the most common sites of origin
      for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in
      patients without structural heart disease.1

      Frequent PVCs was associated with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and radiofrequency (RF)
      catheter ablation of frequent PVCs was associated with improvement of left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF).2

      The most common underlying pathophysiological mechanism was identified to be triggered
      activity and RF catheter ablation treatment is highly effective with low complication
      rates.1,3 Drug therapy has limited effectiveness (in case Î²-blockers and calcium-channel
      blockers) or drug-related side effects ( in case of flecainide, propafenone and amiodarone).4

      RF catheter ablation is recommended in cases of high PVC burden associated with decreased LV
      ejection fraction (LVEF) or in highly symptomatic patients despite optimal drug therapy.3

      Although the RVOT is the most common site (about 70-80% of cases) for idiopathic VAs1,5, only
      few studies have reported on the prevalence and RF catheter ablation of ventricular
      arrhythmias (VAs) arising from the pulmonary artery (21-46% among the RVOT VAs)6 and even
      less prevalence is reported in VAs arising from the pulmonary sinus cusps (11%).7

      Compared with VAs originating from the RVOT, ablation of LVOT-VAs is more complex and
      reported to be 12-45% of all idiopathic VAs.8-11 The success rate of ablation of LVOT-VA
      sites was previously reported to be lower (55-60%) without using antegrade/transseptal
      approaches.12,4 Rarely, it requires epicardial ablation via the GCV/AIV or subxiphoid
      puncture.13,14

      There are some cases in which RF catheter ablation cannot successfully be performed from
      either LVOT or RVOT. In such cases the VAs may originate from the LV-summit which is the most
      common site of idiopathic epicardial VAs from the LVOT region.13

      Although most idiopathic VAs originating from the cardiac OTs are suitable targets for
      endocardial RF catheter ablation, a small percentage of failures in these patients may be
      because of an inaccessible site of origin from epicardial or intramural septal
      locations.15The identification, mapping and RF catheter ablation of these idiopathic VAs may
      be challenging for the electrophysiologist and need special consideration.16
