      During the first and third study visit, rebaudioside A or the placebo will be administered.
      During the second and fourth study visit, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be
      executed to measure the response of administration of rebaudioside A versus placebo on the
      glucose homeostasis. The area under the curve blood glucose values during the first two hours
      of the OGTT will be compared for both conditions.
