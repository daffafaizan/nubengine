      manage self-administering their medication once they return home, and are aiming to improve
      their medication adherence. In this six month long study, patients will be placed into one of
      three intervention groups 1) standard care received (usual care, no reminder provided), 2)
      receive a video call at time medication is to be taken, 3) receive an automated text message
      when medication is to be taken. The investigators aim to identify which intervention is best
      at helping brain injury survivors adhere to their medication schedule, with the future goal
      of implementing this type of reminder protocol into standard care.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that automated reminder text messages will result
      in MSA improvement comparable to video calls, maintained over the six month period.

      Allocation to groups: Patients will be randomized to receive video calls, automated text
      messages, or no intervention (standard care). The randomization schedule is by
      computer-generated number list.
