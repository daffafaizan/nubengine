    
      Part 1:

      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending single dose study in
      healthy adult participants, 7 cohorts, and 1 additional cohort may be considered if needed
      according to the observed safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics results.

      A sentinel dosing strategy will be implemented at each dose level to ensure the best
      conditions of safety. Each cohort will be divided into at least 2 subgroups. The first group
      (sentinel cohort) will include 2 participants that will be dosed on the first day, with 1
      participant receiving MMV533 and 1 participant receiving placebo. The safety and tolerability
      data from the sentinel cohort up to and including 96 hours post-dose will be reviewed by the
      Principal Investigator, the Medical Monitor and the SponsorÂ´s Medical Director. Following a
      satisfactory safety review, dosing of the remaining participants in the cohort may proceed.

      Part 2:

      Open label, 2-period cross-over, randomized, pilot food effect study to provide preliminary
      information on the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of a single-dose oral
      administration of MMV533 to healthy male and female participants aged between 18-55 years
      old. Part 2 may be conducted in parallel to or after completion of Part 1 at the discretion
      of the SRC. The dose will be selected by the SRC based on PK and safety results obtained in
      Part 1 and also taking into account the human efficacious dose/exposure predicted from
      preclinical efficacy studies in rodent malaria models.
