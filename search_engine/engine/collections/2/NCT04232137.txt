      maternal mortality ratio of 497 per 100,000 live births. Cultural factors contribute to the
      underutilization of maternal health services. In 2014, only 20% of our antenatal care
      patients delivered in our hospital. In order to increase health facility-based delivery
      rates, government-funded hospitals and health centers facilitate traditional Ethiopian coffee
      ceremonies after delivery. We hypothesized that organizing postpartum coffee ceremonies would
      motivate our antenatal care patients to deliver in our hospital and would thus increase the
      hospital-based delivery rate.
