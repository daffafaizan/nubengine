      aim to determine the prevalence and burden of nsVT with longer term monitoring with the
      iRhythm Zio XT device over a 2-week period vs. 48 hours; and whether, this greater burden of
      nsVT compared to conventional shorter monitoring potentially identifies a subset of HCM
      patients who may be at higher risk of sudden cardiac death.
