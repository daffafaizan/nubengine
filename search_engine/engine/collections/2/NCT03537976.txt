      assessment by the surgeon of the static face. The important role of function or movement
      generally has been given far less consideration mainly because of the challenges faced by
      surgeons (e.g., the amount/quality of the tissue available to alter movement). Presently,
      even when surgeons do attempt to assess function, they do so in a subjective manner because
      there are no quantitative/visual aids to incorporate functional assessment into their
      treatment planning and decisions regarding lip surgery.

      The Intervention approach proposed here has been refined sufficiently with surgeon feedback
      to allow surgeons to broaden their "vista" of the patients' 'movement and form' problems.
      Potentially, having identified a movement/form problem(s), surgeons could contemplate what
      needs to be done to improve patient specific problem(s). Importantly, pilot studies
      demonstrated that the Intervention had a definite impact on surgeons' decisions for lip
      revision: Surgeons substantially, but variably, changed their problem list and treatment
      planning goals. Thus, a goal of this study is to collect surgical outcome data which will be
      used primarily to monitor adverse events but also will provide preliminary information on
      improvement in patient outcomes (facial form and movement) when surgeons use the
      Intervention. In addition, given that revision surgery is very common after the primary lip
      repair, it is important to understand surgeons' decision-making with the use of the
      Intervention, to determine surgeons' goals and expectations for primary lip repair surgery,
      and to understand the surgical limitations that may lead to subsequent revision surgery.
