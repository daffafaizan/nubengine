      (BBS) and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)) and Korebalance Balance System. The Korebalance Balance
      System is a balance assessment and exercise system. The higher the score, the greater the
      deterioration in the balance. The results of static and dynamic balance evaluation are
      recorded as score values. In this study, investigators compared Korebalance Balance System,
      Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests and other demographic and clinical
      parameters (age, body mass index (BMI), 25OHvitD level, menopause age, fall within the last 1
      year, fracture history, history of fracture in mother).
