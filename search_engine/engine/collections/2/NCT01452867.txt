      to the body and safe to avoid potentially fatal regurgitation and aspiration pneumonia and
      excessive stomach inflation. Basically trained rescuers have severe problems to ventilate a
      patient during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This study intends to compare three commonly
      employed ventilation techniques. First, the traditionally bag-valve mask ventilation is
      commonly taught during CPR course, despite recent evidence suggesting low efficiency rates.
      Second, the laryngeal mask and the laryngeal tube supraglottic airways have shown high
      efficiency and safety in previous studies in the hand of experienced clinicians. Until now it
      is unclear if basically trained rescuers are better in ventilation with bag valve mask
      ventilation or the supraglottic airway devices, the laryngeal mask and the laryngeal tube.
      The purpose of this study is to compare in anesthetised patients airway management and
      ventilation with bag-valve mask, laryngeal mask and laryngeal tube.
