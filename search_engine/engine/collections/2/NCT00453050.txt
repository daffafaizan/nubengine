      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity of in situ photoimmunotherapy comprising imiquimod and infrared
           laser therapy with or without indocyanine green in patients with stage III or IV
           melanoma and cutaneous metastases.

        -  Determine the complete systemic and local response rates in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this treatment on immunologic parameters in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients undergo in situ photoimmunotherapy (ISPI) comprising topical imiquimod twice daily
      on days 1-42 and infrared laser therapy (with or without indocyanine green) on days 14 and
      28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood is collected at baseline, prior to ISPI, 24 hours after ISPI, and at week 6. Samples
      are examined for cytokine response, CD8 T-cell activation and regulatory T-cell assays (by
      flow cytometry), and antibody response (by western blot).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then
      every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
