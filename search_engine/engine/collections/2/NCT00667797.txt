      hospitalized patients with asthma or COPD who have been admitted due to an exacerbation of
      their disease and required further treatment with a beta2-adrenergic agonist. Approximately
      430 patients were randomized and enrolled. Patients were then followed during their
      hospitalization. Once discharged, patient status was assessed via telephone interview 30 days
      after discharge. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor
      Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was
      changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
