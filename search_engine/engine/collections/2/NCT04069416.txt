      HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
      Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for HCC patients has emerged as a rewarding therapy
      for a cure and a successful alternative where a Deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT)
      program is lacking. Therefore, trials for careful expansion to Milan criteria have been
      adopted.

      Aim of the study:

      To evaluate the impact of expanding criteria beyond Milan on tumor recurrence and patient
      survival that will help identify the best selection criteria for HCC transplanted patients
