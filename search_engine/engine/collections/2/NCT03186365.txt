      HCV NS5A inhibitor 50 mg fixed dose combination, Zepatier, achieved high SVR12 rates of > 95
      % in treatment-naïve, experienced cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients with genotype 1, 4, or
      6 infection. Zepatier, 12 to 16 weeks, was approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 4
      in Taiwan in December, 2016. An SVR rate of 93 % was demonstrated in treatment-naive,
      non-cirrhotic (F0-F3) GT1b-infected patients who received 8 weeks of grazoprevir/elbasvir
      with or without ribavirin in the pooled analysis of C-WORTHY (PN035) and C-EDGE
      treatment-naive (PN060) trials. Furthermore, truncated treatment period of 8-week
      grazoprevir/elbasvir could achieve an even higher SVR rate at > 98% for naive HCV G1b
      patients with mild fibrosis (Fibrosis score 0-2). The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of
      8-week regimen with grazoprevir/elbasvir on naïve, HCV G1b patients with mild fibrosis by a
      randomized clinical trial.
