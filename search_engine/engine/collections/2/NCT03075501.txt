      linked with drug experiences are a major barrier to the treatment of drug addiction. These
      links are remarkably persistent and can cause relapse to drug taking even after long periods
      of abstinence. They are also key features in some of the foremost theories of addiction, yet
      there is little clinical evidence of how these associations are formed and how they come to
      profoundly control behavior. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how drug
      cues become powerfully linked with drug experiences and their influence on mood and behavior.
      In the proposed project, the investigators will use a de novo conditioning paradigm to
      examine the influence of drug contexts on drug seeking, mood and acute drug responses. The
      hypothesis is that drug-paired contexts gain motivational salience, induce approach, and
      alter acute subjective responses to the drug.This knowledge will lead to novel treatment
      strategies to counteract the effects of drug cues on mood and behavior, and also to prevent
      relapse.
