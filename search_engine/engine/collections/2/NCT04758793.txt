      occurs as a result of chronic hepatic injury, related to excessive alcohol consumption,
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and chronic viral infection. Cirrhosis is accompanied by
      symptoms that profoundly affect the quality of life of patients.

      Sarcopenia, or decrease in muscle capacity through loss of muscle mass, is associated with
      liver disease. Patients with liver disease and sarcopenia have increased morbidity, and
      higher pre- and post-liver transplant mortality than patients without sarcopenia. The
      mechanism responsible for the development of sarcopenia in liver disease remains largely
      misunderstood, as do the mechanisms by which sarcopenia appears to promote complications of
      liver disease.

      This study, carried out on a prospective cohort of patients with stable liver disease, aims
      at understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in sarcopenia and its
      consequences.

      After checking the inclusion criteria, all eligible patients treated at Beaujon Hospital
      (Clichy) will be invited to participate in the study. After inclusion, clinical and
      laboratory features (hepatic assessment) will be collected and the blood samples will be
      taken.

      During the surgery, a muscle biopsy will be performed on the incision area. No follow-up is
      planned.
