    
      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination
      therapy and mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab combination therapy in first-line treatment of
      chemotherapy-naive patients with KRAS/NRAS wild-type, incurable/unresectable,
      advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer.

      This study will enroll a total of approximately 800 participants (400 per group).

      Participants will be randomized to either the mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab arm (Group P) or
      mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab arm (Group B) at 1:1 ratio at the time of registration.

      Group P and Group B treatment regimen shown below should be administered once every two
      weeks, following dose, schedule and route of administration.

      Group P; mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy, once every two weeks OXA: 85 mg/m2/day 1
      l-LV: 200 mg/m2/day 1 5-FU iv: 400 mg/m2/day 1 5-FU civ: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3 panitumumab: 6
      mg/kg

      Group B; mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab combination therapy, once every two weeks OXA: 85 mg/m2/day 1
      l-LV: 200 mg/m2/day 1 5-FU iv: 400 mg/m2/day 1 5-FU civ: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3 bevacizumab: 5
      mg/kg

      This trial is conducted by multicenter and is scheduled for 12 months as whole administration
      period.
