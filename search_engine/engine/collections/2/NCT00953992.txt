           patients with AKI

           - Several nutritional assessment methods such as anthropometric, clinical and
           biochemical evaluations have been used; however, no single indicator is considered to be
           a "gold standard."

        2. to evaluate the association of serum nutritional variables and prognosis of acute kidney
           injury

        3. Given the different half-lives of serum nutritional markers, we hypothesized that the
           utility of serum nutritional variables as prognostic predictors may differ in early
           death (<7 days) and late death (>7 days, <28 days) patients.
