      surgical patients, could contribute to long-term social dysfunction, high mortality and
      increased medical cost. Previous studies have suggested that impaired Olfaction was related
      to postoperative delirium (Nadya M. Dhanani et al, J Clin Anesth 2012; Charles H. Brown IV et
      al, J Am Geriatr So 2015; Min Seung Kim et al, J Neural Transm 2016). However, there is still
      no efficient treatment for POCD, and it also remains largely unknown whether enhanced
      olfactory stimuli can be used as an inventive strategy to reduce the risk of POCD.
