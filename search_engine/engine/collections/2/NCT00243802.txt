      can cause stroke or death, if untreated. In general, treatments are not very effective with
      frequent relapses of the abnormal heart beats. One explanation for the high relapse rate is
      that the treatments might not address the underlying cause of atrial fibrillation.

      Recently, we have found that atrial fibrillation is associated with increased oxidative
      stress in a particular part of the top parts of the heart, the left atrial appendage (LAA).
      Oxidative stress is a condition where abnormal oxygen forms are produced. These forms harm
      the cells of the heart, causing them to beat abnormally. Also, the inside of the heart
      becomes sticky and more likely to form blood clots. These clots, when they travel to the
      head, are thought to be the main cause of strokes in this condition. We have found increased
      oxidative stress and increased evidence of blood clotting in pig and mouse models of atrial
      fibrillation. We would like to see if these same findings are present in the human LAA.

      In this study, we will compare blood and tissue markers of oxidative stress between patients
      with and without atrial fibrillation who are scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery. It is the
      expectation that participants with atrial fibrillation will have more abnormal markers of
      atrial fibrillation. This study requires participants to be seen during their routine
      preoperative visit, undergo a history and physical examination, give blood only once, and
      allow use of their discarded LAA. This tissue is routinely removed at surgery because its
      removal is thought to reduce the risk of strokes in patients who develop atrial fibrillation
      after the surgery. This happens in up to 50% of patients, thus providing the desire to remove
      the LAA.
