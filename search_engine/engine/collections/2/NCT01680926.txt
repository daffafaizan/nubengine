      daily. During the first week, all three main meals were replaced with 50 g of a protein-rich
      meal replacement (Almased) (=1100 kcal per day). During weeks 2-4, only two meals were
      replaced and a protein-rich lunch was allowed. During weeks 5-12, only dinner was replaced.
      Clinical parameters were determined at the beginning of the study, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks as
      well as after 1.5 years of follow-up. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for the
      intention-to-treat analysis and Mann-Whitney test for subgroup analyses.
