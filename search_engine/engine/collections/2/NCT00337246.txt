    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the efficacy and safety of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone
           hydrochloride with or without rituximab in patients with previously treated chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the overall response rate, defined as complete or partial remission, in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the proportion of patients with undetectable minimal residual disease.

        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the 2-year overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel group, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with fludarabine (refractory vs not
      refractory or naive). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral fludarabine* and oral cyclophosphamide* on days 1-5 and
           mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine*, cyclophosphamide*, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride
           as in arm I. Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 1.

      NOTE: *If the oral regimen is not tolerated, patients may receive fludarabine IV and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-3.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
