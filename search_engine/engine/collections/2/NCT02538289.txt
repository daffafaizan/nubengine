      staff improve the well-being of dyspneic patients. The MAIN GOAL of this study is to evaluate
      the effect of two talks (conveyed to doctors and nurses of Cardiology and Respiratory
      Medicine Departments) on the patient-perceived dyspnea. The contents of these talks will be
      prepared and supervised by Palliative Care specialists.

      This is a four-staged study that includes a first observational phase (prevalence study of
      dyspnea) followed by intervention and a third phase that will determine the effect of this
      teaching intervention. The fourth phase consists in the elaboration of specific protocols for
      management of dyspnea.

      A pharmacovigilance study of opioids will also take place.
