      whose function is impacted by gonadal steroids in women. The overarching hypothesis is that
      aging differentially alters the effects of estrogen on the brain. Our preliminary data
      indicated that aging alters the effect of estrogen on brain regions involved in cognition and
      thus, the current study focused on the impact of aging on functional changes induced by
      estrogen in cortical and subcortical areas associated with verbal working memory and
      declarative/episodic memory.

      As our model, we will use women in whom the absence of gonadal function makes it possible to
      control the duration and amount of estrogen exposure, specifically postmenopausal women who
      are younger (45-55) or older (65-80) who receive either oral or transdermal estradiol to
      achieve premenopausal early follicular phase estradiol levels.. We evaluate the effects of
      low dose estrogen exposure at 48 hr and 1 month to determine whether the short-term changes
      in brain regions involved in cognition with low dose estrogen exposure seen in our
      preliminary studies are confirmed and whether changes with short-term estrogen exposure
      persist with more prolonged exposure, a finding that would have enormous clinical relevance.
      These studies, using sophisticated neuroimaging tools (structural and functional magnetic
      resonance imaging [MRI] and [18F] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography
      [FDG-PET]), provide a unique window into the brain in women.
