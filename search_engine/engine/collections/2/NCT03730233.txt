      gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is not only to
      encircle the distal oesophagus and GOJ by the fundic wrap but also to complete a transhiatal
      reduction of a concomitant hiatal hernia (type I, HH), aiming for a 2 - 3 cm intra-abdominal
      length of the of oesophagus and to transact a tension-free hiatal closure. The physiological
      and morphological characteristics of the diaphragmatic hiatus, however, carry a challenge for
      the selection of the ideal technique for surgical repair. The diaphragmatic hiatus consists
      of a three-dimensional structure in constant motion, which creates a border between the
      counteracting pressures prevailing in the abdominal and chest cavities, respectively.
      Following hernia reduction, the structural quality of the diaphragmatic pillars is usually
      weak, offering poor support for the subsequent closure with risk for high recurrence rates.
      These and other considerations have encouraged the exploration of mesh reinforcement to
      enhance the durability of the hiatal closure.
