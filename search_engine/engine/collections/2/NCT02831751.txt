    
      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 2 study will be conducted at multiple
      sites across the United States and Canada.

      The influenza strain composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine used in this study includes
      2 influenza A virus strains (A/California/7/2009 [H1N1] and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013
      [H3N2]) and 2 influenza B virus strains (B/Phuket/3073/2013 [Yamagata lineage] and
      B/Brisbane/60/2008 [Victoria lineage]), based on the 2015-2016 recommended World Health
      Organization (WHO) strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.

      Approximately 1000 elderly male and female subjects, aged 65 years or older, will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1of 4 parallel treatment groups such that 500 subjects
      receive Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine (250 each for the 30 µg/strain and 60 µg/strain groups), 250
      subjects receive FluLaval® Tetra (15 µg/strain) and 250 subjects receive Fluzone® HD (60
      µg/strain). Subjects in each group will be stratified into 2 age strata: 65 to 74 years and
      75 years old and older, where 70 % of subjects will be enrolled into the 65 to 74 years old
      age group and 30 % into the 75 years old or older group.

      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 8 months, during which 5 visits
      will be scheduled, and phone contact will be made on Day 1, Day 8, and every 2 months
      thereafter for up to 6 months post-Day 21 visit (Day 201). Blood samples will be collected
      for immunogenicity analyses at Days 0 and 21 for all subjects. Safety laboratory assessments
      will be performed at Screening, on Day 3 and within 48 hours of Day 3 results availability,
      for grade 3 or grade 4 abnormalities or if deemed necessary by the investigator or early
      termination. Subsequent follow-up of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be
      done according to the investigator's discretion.. Subjects will be monitored throughout the
      study for safety, including the reporting of solicited local and systemic reactions.
