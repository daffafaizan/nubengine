      I. Determine recommended phase II doses for the combination of flavopiridol and vorinostat in
      patients with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, or refractory
      anemia with excess blasts-2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety, toxicity, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of this drug
      regimen.

      II. Determine the pharmacodynamic and clinical anti-leukemic effects of this drug regimen.

      III. Correlate leukemia gene expression patterns with response in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of flavopiridol.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and oral vorinostat three times
      daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
