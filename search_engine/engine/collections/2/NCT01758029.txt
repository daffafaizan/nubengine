      undecanoate, given in accordance with the standard protocol.

      Hypogonadal men eligible for treatment with testosterone undecanoate, who have not been
      treated with testosterone undecanoate within the last 6 months prior to enrollment, can be
      enrolled in the study. Patients who were treated with another testosterone formulation (eg.
      testosterone gel, testosterone enanthate injections) will require a 4 week wash-out period.
      Patients must be enrolled after the decision for treatment with testosterone undecanoate has
      been made.

      Patients will be followed for an observation period of 28 weeks. Observations will be
      recorded at 3 consecutive visits, and will assess patient and spouse satisfaction and quality
      of life with validated questionnaires.

      The study design is an intra-individual comparison. Each patient/spouse serves as his own
      control.

      a laboratory test for total testosterone level will be required in the last visit. the need
      for concomitant phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors use will also be recorded and analyzed.
