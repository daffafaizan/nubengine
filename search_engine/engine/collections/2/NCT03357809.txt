      hepato-gastroenterology department of Saint Joseph Hospital (Marseille). A first clinical,
      endoscopic and PH impedance evaluation will be made. Mucosectomy will be scheduled depending
      on the results of the review.

      The patients will be followed for 2 years with esophageal and gastric PH-impedance monitoring
      at 6 months and 24 months. Health related quality of life questionnaires will be completed
      before ARMS, 6 and 24 months after mucosectomy.

      The characteristics of the patients will be compared to evaluate the % of responders and
      non-responders
