      again. As one of adjunctive methods, intraoperative application of a single dose of mitomycin
      C (MMC) seems to be the most commonly used method for preventing recurrence of pterygium.
      Additionally, closure of conjunctival defect after excision of pterygium by limbal
      conjunctival autograft or amniotic membrane have also become popular in recent years. There
      are a few reports in which MMC combined either limbal conjunctival autograft (LCAG) or
      amniotic membrane graft (AMG) for the treatment of recurrent pterygium. To assess the
      effectiveness and safety of these two combined approaches, the investigator plans to work on
      a randomized comparative and prospective trial of recurrent pterygium extensive excision with
      intraoperative 0.02% MMC application comparing LCAG to AMG.The patients enrolled in this
      study will be followed for at least 12 months after the surgery. Recurrence was defined as
      fibrovascular tissue crossing the limbus on to the clear cornea in the area of previous
      pterygium excision.
