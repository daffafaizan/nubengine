    
      This will be a prospective randomised trial. Two hundred pregnant women with term PROM and an
      unfavourable cervix (Bishop Score â‰¤ 4) are expected to be entered into the study (see
      statistical analysis below).

      All eligible women will be presented with the study protocol by a study coordinator. Women
      interested in participating will read and sign the informed consent. Subsequently, the
      following screening medical procedures will be completed: medical and gynecological history,
      physical and vaginal examination, ultrasonography to: (i) Confirm fetal vertex presentation,
      (ii) Exclude placenta previa and (iii) Assess cervical length and posterior cervical angle.
      (iv) Asses bio-physical profile score

      A non-stress test will be performed in order to monitor:

        1. The fetal heart pattern for the presence or absence of decelerations and

        2. The presence of uterine contractions. All women will undergo a pelvic examination by a
           staff member to obtain an initial Bishop score.

      If the patient will be determined eligible for study entry, and following the informed
      consent, randomisation into the following groups will take place:

      GROUP 1: Oxytocin infusion alone (Standard Protocol). GROUP 2: insertion of the double
      balloon device and concurrent oxytocin administration.

      GROUP 3: Expectant management
