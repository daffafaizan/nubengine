      To examine the comparative effectiveness and costs of a community-based intervention to
      support self-management with usual primary care for older adults with T2DM and Multiple
      Chronic Conditions and their family caregivers.

      Objectives

        1. To determine if a 6-month, IP, community-based intervention improve self-management
           compared with usual primary care services?

        2. To compare the effectiveness of the intervention on HRQoL, physical activity,
           nutritional status, depression, anxiety, diabetes parameters (blood glucose levels
           [HbA1c, hypoglycemic episodes]), diabetes-related complications, number of vascular
           events, social support number of falls, fall risk and medication safety with usual
           primary care services?

        3. To determine the effectiveness of the intervention on HRQoL of family caregivers
           compared with usual primary care?

        4. To assess whether or not the intervention improves clinical practice behaviours?

        5. To determine the 6-month costs of use of health services of the intervention compared
           with usual care, from a social perspective?

        6. To identify which subgroups of older adults with T2DM and MCC benefit most from the
           intervention?

        7. To determine the effectiveness of the intervention based on sex/gender and region?

        8. To determine the overall feasibility and acceptability of an IP community-based health
           promotion intervention and what can be identified as barriers and facilitators to
           implementation?
