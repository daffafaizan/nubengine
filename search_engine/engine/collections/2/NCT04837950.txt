      anatomical structures during Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). A number of
      patients referred to VATS-surgery appear with an elevated diaphragm, reducing visibility and
      complicating safe surgical techniques, thus entailing conversion from VATS into an open
      Thoracotomy. Some surgeons handle the decreased visibility due to an elevated diaphragm by
      increasing the amount of ports during VATS. Others have benefited from attaching a traction
      suture on the diaphragmatic posterior tendinous part, thus flatting the diaphragmatic dome
      when the suture is tightly retracted through the camera-port. It turns out that most thoracic
      surgery clinics are not familiar with this technique. There are also no articles regarding
      this topic in medical literature. We want to investigate if the diaphragmatic traction-suture
      affects the pleural cavity volume, as well as improves visual overview of a surgical field
      during minimally invasive thoracic surgery.
