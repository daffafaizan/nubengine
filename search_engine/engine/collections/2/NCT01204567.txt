      intervention to maintain and enhance cognitive and physical function in older
      individuals.Despite good evidence regarding the positive effects of exercise, a sedentary or
      inactive lifestyle is common among people over 65 years of old, especially among persons with
      chronic diseases. Research shows that good mental health and physical capacity is of vital
      importance for living independently in the community and we know that participation in
      physical activity offers good opportunities to extend years of active independent life.
      Nevertheless our knowledge is sparse regarding the evidence of effective programs for health
      promotion in groups of elderly, especially after discharge from hospital. Our knowledge is
      also sparse as to which intervention program is the most effective, group-based training or
      home- based training.
