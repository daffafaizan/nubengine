      becoming more widely available and more useful in cardiac assessment. MSCT provides
      quantification of coronary calcium as well as information about the structures of the
      coronary vessel walls and atherosclerotic plaques. Multiple studies have demonstrated that
      MSCT provides information on coronary artery stenosis comparable to that obtained from
      invasive coronary angiography. PET imaging provides functional data via the measurement of
      coronary flow reserve (CFR). CFR is a quantitative measure of the increase in coronary blood
      flow in response to vasodilation; normal coronary flow is able to augment by three- to
      four-fold; diseased coronary arteries show less ability to increase flow, i.e. less CFR.
      Assessment of CFR yields functional information about the significance of coronary disease
      and is often used clinically in conjunction with anatomic imaging to identify early
      atherosclerosis. There is no current data evaluating the incremental value of hybrid PET/CT
      assessment of CFR and coronary anatomy in relation to SPECT studies in the clinical setting.
