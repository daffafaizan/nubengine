      receive either oral therapy (subgroup 1) or IV therapy (subgroup 2). The investigator can
      initiate treatment with either oral or IV therapy based on clinical judgement i.e subjects
      who require IV therapy (like subjects with severe ABSSSI or where oral administration is not
      feasible).
