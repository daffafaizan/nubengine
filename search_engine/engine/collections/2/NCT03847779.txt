        -  clinical: diabetes duration, treatments

        -  anthropometric: weight, height, BMI

        -  level of physical activity by means of the International Physical Activity Questionary,
           pedometers and the 6 minutes walking test

        -  biological evaluations: glycemia, HbA1C, lipids, high sensitive C-reactive protein,
           fibrinogen, 25(OH)D, creatinine, albumine Type 2 diabetes participants will benefit from
           neuropathy evaluation: sensory tests by means of Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and of
           Nerve Check, amplitude and velocity sural nerve and neuropathic symptom score (NSS) In
           addition, cutaneous microcirculation (perfusion and vasomotion) by means of Laser
           Doppler Flowmetry and Laser Speckle Imaging will be recorded at rest and after different
           stimuli (exercise, hyperthermia and foot lowering).
