      With the development of surgical techniques, more and more people with coronary heart disease
      underwent non-cardiac surgery, which include abdominal, urologic, orthopedic surgeries. Due
      to the vulnerable heart function, geriatric patients suffer high incidence of cardiovascular
      events during the peri-operative period. Some studies found that EA preconditioning have a
      protective effect for the patients underwent Cardiac surgery. But non one addresses the
      effects of EA preconditioning on the outcomes of the patients with coronary heart disease who
      undergo non-cardiac surgery.

      DESIGNING:

      The patients with coronary heart disease who will receive abdominal surgery will be randomly
      assigned into EA preconditioning group and control group. The patients in EA preconditioning
      group was treated at bilateral Neiguan (PC 6)，Lieque (LU 7) and Yunmen (LU 2) with electrical
      stimulation (5-30 Hz，2．34-6．24 mA，30 min) for 5 consecutive days before surgery．Before
      operation and before surgery, after surgery, 24h, 72h post surgery, all patients will be
      subjected to test the serum level of c-reactive protein and Troponin I. The EEG and heart
      ultrasonic exam will be used to evaluate the condition and function of heart before and after
      surgery.
