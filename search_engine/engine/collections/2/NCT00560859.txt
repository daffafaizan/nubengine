      get surgery. However, in order to assess the extent to which adenotonsillectomy surgery
      improves breathing disturbances and sleep quality in children with OSAS, two groups will be
      studied. One group will get surgery early (one month after enrollment) and the other group
      will be re-evaluated for surgery within 7 months of enrollment.

      Children in both groups will be closely monitored through the 7-8 month study period and
      sleep and health educational materials will be provided to assist in establishing healthy
      habits.
