      reproductive-aged women in the United States (1). The increase in this morbidity is
      associated with large increases in cesarean delivery over the non-obese obstetric population
      and resultant post-operative complications are also higher in obese women (2). There are no
      interventions proven to reduce the risk of cesarean in obese women. The aim of this research
      study is to determine if induction of labor at 39 weeks can reduce the incidence of cesarean
      delivery over routine obstetric care (expectant management).
