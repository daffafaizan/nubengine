      resection + adjuvant therapy has become the standard treatment model for locally advanced
      mid-low rectal cancer, However, the existing evidence shows that this comprehensive treatment
      method has reached the upper limit of efficacy and cannot continue to reduce the metastatic
      rate and improve the survival rate.

      Recent studies have shown that PD-1 antibody inhibitors have excellent curative effects on
      the treatment of a variety of tumors and have good safety.

      This study is a single-arm, single-center, prospective, phase II clinical study. It is
      designed to test the efficacy and safety of Total Neoadjuvant chmoradiation Treatment plus
      SHR1210 for High-risk locally advanced Rectal Cancer, Meanwhile, screening effective
      Biomarker base on neoantigen.

      In this study, patients with high-risk rectal cancer will receive 3 cycles induction CapeOX
      and SHR-1210, intensity modulated radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and 2 cycles
      consolidation CapeOX and total mesorectal excision.

      This study is designed to recruit 25 patients in all.
