      I. To define the biodistribution of gallium Ga 68 FAPi-46 (68Ga-FAPi-46) and gallium Ga
      68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) in normal and cancer tissues of patients with various
      non-prostate malignancies. The goal is to determine where and to which degree 68Ga-FAPi-46
      and 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulates in normal and cancer tissues.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether 68Ga-FAPi-46 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulation observed by positron
      emission tomography (PET) correlates with the amount of fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
      and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in excised cancer tissue, respectively.

      II. As an exploratory study aim, will also assess the 68Ga-FAPI-46 biodistribution
      correlation with 68Ga-PSMA-11, if the patient volunteers for optional scan, and
      18F-fluodeoxyglucose (FDG), if any FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) has been performed as
      standard-of-care.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-FAPi-46 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan over 20-50 minutes.
      Patients may also receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 IV and undergo PET/CT scan over 20-50 minutes on a
      separate day (for volunteer patients only, PSMA PET/CT is optional and not required).
