      warfarin in the quality of anticoagulation as measured by interpolated INR time in
      therapeutic range. This is a Phase II/III multi-center, randomized, stratified, double blind,
      parallel group, active control study comparing ATI-5923 with Coumadin in patients who require
      chronic, oral anticoagulation. Up to 600 patients who successfully complete all screening
      assessments and meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and receive study
      drug treatment for 6-12 months depending on time of study entry.
