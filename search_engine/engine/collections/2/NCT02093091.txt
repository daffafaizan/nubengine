      (n=10) using a notched-edge crosshead. Independent sample t-test was used for statistical
      analysis. Then, a split mouth designed clinical trial was performed in which nano-filled
      RMGI; Ketac Nano (KN) and conventional RMGI; Vitremer (VR) were used to restore class I
      cavities of primary molars. Each material group (n=30) was evaluated according to the
      modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) regarding marginal discoloration,
      marginal adaptation, color match, anatomic form and recurrent caries, at baseline, after one
      year and after two years. Wilcoxon signed- rank test and Chi-square test were used for
      statistical analysis.
