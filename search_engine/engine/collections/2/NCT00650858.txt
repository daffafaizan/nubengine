      intraventricular injections of multiple low doses of rt-PA. Sixteen subjects were already
      randomized to receive intraventricular injections of with 0.3 mg or 1.0 mg of rt-PA every 12
      hours for up to 8 doses. Results of this stage (n=16) were then analyzed and the most
      effective dose of 1.0 mg was chosen to be used in the second stage (n=36) to determine the
      optimal frequency of dosing. We propose to test if this intervention facilitates more rapid
      clot resolution, complete recovery function and decreased mortality from this condition.
