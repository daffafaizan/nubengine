      informed consent would undergo study-specific screening assessments within 45 days from the
      day of informed consent.

      Eligible study subjects will receive a HAV and will be followed to 12 months
      post-implantation at routine study visits regardless of patency status. After 12 months,
      subjects with a patent HAV will be followed (while the HAV remains patent) for up to 3 years
      (36 months) post implantation at study visits every 6 months.
