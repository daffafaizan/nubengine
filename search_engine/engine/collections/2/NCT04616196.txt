    
      This study is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter dose escalation and dose expansion study
      in patients with R/R HNSCC or CRC.

      NKTR-255 is a cytokine that is designed to regulate T and natural killer cell activation,
      proliferation and promote their anti-tumor effects.

      After an initial cetuximab loading dose during the study run-in period (Day -7), patients
      will receive IV NKTR-255 every 21 days in combination with cetuximab weekly. In the dose
      escalation phase, beginning with Dose Level 1, successive cohorts will receive ascending
      doses of NKTR-255 until the MTD and/or RP2D is determined. Patients who achieve optimal
      response (partial response or complete response), will be given the option to continue
      treatment with NKTR-255 as single agent for maintenance.

      Enrollment into Phase 2 will commence once the RP2D is established in Phase 1b. The RP2D of
      NKTR-255 will be evaluated in expansion Cohorts A and B. Cohort A will combine NKTR-255 and
      cetuximab in patients with R/R HNSCC and Cohort B will combine NKTR-255 and cetuximab in
      patients with R/R CRC.
