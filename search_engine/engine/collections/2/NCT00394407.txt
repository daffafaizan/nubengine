      daily plus glulisine (Apidra®) insulin before meals in hospitalized patients with type 2
      diabetes and elevated blood glucose (sugar) levels. Lantus is a long-acting insulin which is
      given subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily. Apidra is a rapid-acting insulin which is
      given subcutaneously several times a day and frequently before meals. Regular insulin is a
      short-acting insulin in clinical use for more than 20 years that is also given subcutaneously
      several times per day. Lantus, Apidra and regular insulins are approved for use in the
      treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA.

      This investigator-initiated research will be conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta
      and at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami. Dr. Umpierrez designed the study and will serve as
      principal investigator. A total of 65 patients will be recruited at Grady and 65 patients at
      the Jackson Memorial Hospital. This study is supported by Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals.
