    
      Approximately 600 patients with locally advanced, unresectable ESCC (AJCC 8th cStage II-IVA)
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either durvalumab + dCRT or placebo + dCRT. The
      primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy of durvalumab + dCRT compared
      with placebo + dCRT in terms of progression free survival (PFS, per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by
      BICR) in all randomized patients (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and PFS in patients with
      PD-L1 high tumors (PD-L1 High population).
