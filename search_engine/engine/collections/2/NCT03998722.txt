      endocrine therapy which can lead to vaginal atrophy (VA), caused by decreased levels of
      circulating estrogen to urinary and vaginal receptors. Due to the reduced estrogen
      production, less vaginal fluid is produced within the vagina and the mucosa becomes thinner
      and more fragile. This group of patients can not use estrogen treatment to reduce the
      symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

      A previous study showed a significant reduction in the severity of the most bothersome VA
      symptoms and vaginal pH was improved (decreased) as well as increased percentage of
      superficial cells over a 12 week treatment period with Vagivital.

      In this study all participants will self- administer the intravaginal gel once daily for 12
      weeks.
