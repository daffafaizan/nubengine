      Electrolyte disturbances and fluid shifts are common in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage
      (SAH) or traumatic brain injury (TBI). They usually have a rapid onset with impact on
      morbidity (possibly mortality) and length of stay. So far the understanding of underlying
      pathophysiologies and the contribution of iatrogenic influences is not fully understood.

      Only limited evidence and data on classification, management and outcome of patients exists.

      Objective

      To describe the incidence, characteristics and duration of sodium and fluid disturbances in
      patients with SAH or TBI.

      To document exact fluid and electrolyte management To evaluate predisposing factors and
      potential predicting biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, renin-aldosterone system.

      Methods

      Prospective systematic observational study with 50 patients in the SAH group and 50 patients
      in the TBI group.

      8hourly clinical assessment, blood and urin samples. Defined trigger points for additional
      measurements.

      Continuous fluid balance documentation Daily measurement of natriuretic peptides, aldosterone
      and renin
