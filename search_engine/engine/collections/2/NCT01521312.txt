    
      The aim of this pilot study is to compare in patients with impaired glucose tolerance the
      effects of saxagliptin versus placebo:

      (i) on glucose metabolism (ii) on vago-sympathetic activity, arterial stiffness and
      endothelial function. A total of 36 patients will be recruited in the department of
      Endocrinology-Diabetology-Nutrition of Jean VERDIER hospital, AP-HP, Bondy, France.

      The measurements will be performed in the morning 1) at the time of randomisation (Acute
      ACCES study) and 2) 11-14 weeks after the beginning of saxagliptin or placebo (Chronic ACCES
      study).

      We will evaluate at fasting and each hour after a standardized breakfast:

      (i) biological and metabolic parameters. Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test will be
      performed at the end of the study.

      (ii) by non-invasive devices arterial stiffness (Sphygmocor速), endothelial function (ENDOPAT
      2000速 ), cutaneous microcirculation (laser doppler Perimed 速.PF 5010) and cardiac autonomic
      function(task force monitor速).
