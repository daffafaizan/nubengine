      users vs. healthy controls) and NET AAGG4 status (L4/ L4 vs. L4/S4 or S4/ S4 genotype) as the
      between-subject factors. Similar to previous studies, we propose to compare individuals with
      two copies of the L4 allele to participants with at least one S4 allele because only less
      than two percent of the general population is homozygous for the S4 allele. Forty cocaine
      users and 40 healthy controls will participate in 3 test sessions, where they will be
      assigned to 40 mg atomoxetine, 80 mg atomoxetine, or placebo. Outcome measures will include
      physiological, subjective, and cognitive performance measures.

      To date this study has 35 completers and currently in data analysis. (January 2016)
