      at least 3 prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an
      immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), or whose disease is refractory to both a PI and an IMiD. The
      study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 28 days), a treatment phase, and a
      follow-up phase. Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarkers and safety will be
      assessed at scheduled time. Follow-up will continue until the end of the data collection
      period, approximately 24 months after the last participant was randomized or when the median
      overall survival for both arms has been reached, whichever occurs first. The primary
      hypotheses is that the ORR and maximum Ctrough for Dara SC 1800 milligram (mg) are not
      inferior to the ORR and maximum Ctrough, respectively, for Dara IV 16 mg per kilogram (mg/kg)
      in participants with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy
      including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), or whose disease
      is refractory to both a PI and an IMiD.
