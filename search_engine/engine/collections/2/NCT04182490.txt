    
      Healthy subjects will be randomized within one of the following sequential dose cohorts:

        -  LMN-101, six 500-mg capsules orally three times daily for 28 days (n=21), or
           identical-appearing placebo (n=7); or

        -  LMN-101, two 500-mg capsules and four 500-mg placebo capsules orally three times daily
           for 28 days (n=21), or identical-appearing placebo (n=7); or

        -  LMN-101, one 300-mg capsule and five 500-mg placebo capsules orally three times daily
           for 28 days (n=21), or identical-appearing placebo (n=7).

      Campylobacter jejuni CG8421, 1.5 x 10e5 colony-forming units challenge will be administered
      orally as a single challenge after 7 days of dosing.The C. jejuni CG8421 (capsule type 23,
      36) challenge strain lacks all ganglioside mimicry and the genes needed for synthesis of
      N-acetyl neuraminic acid, necessary for glycolipid mimicry associated with Guillain-Barr√©
      (Poly et al. 2008; Tribble et al. 2009).The C. jejuni challenge will be followed 144 hours
      later by antibiotics for 5 days. Earlier antibiotic treatment will be initiated if subjects
      meet the criteria to start antibiotics or have any illness that necessitates early treatment
      in the opinion of the study physician. Additional treatment will be given if microbial
      recrudescence is observed.
