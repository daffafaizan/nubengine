    
      LBH589 will be evaluated when administered twice weekly at the following possible dose
      levels: 20 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, and 60 mg. Capecitabine will be paired with LBH589 and will
      range in dose from 825 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 orally BID 14 of every 21 days. Treatment cycles
      will be 21 days in length. Once determined safe, 10 additional patients will be treated at
      the determined MTD to further assess safety.

      The second portion of this study will assess QTc prolongation with the LBH589 and lapatinib
      combination. A subset of 6 patients will be treated with the LBH589 one dose below the MTD
      determined during Part I. If tolerated, 6 additional patients will receive LBH589 at the MTD
      established in Part I with lapatinib (capecitabine will not be administered in this subset of
      patients).

      If there are no clinically significant findings in the LBH589 and lapatinib subset, the study
      will advance to a third portion which combines the three drugs LBH589, capecitabine, and
      lapatinib.

      The triple combination will initially administer lapatinib 1000 mg orally daily with LBH589
      and capecitabine at one dose level below the established MTD. If tolerated, LBH589 and
      capecitabine doses will be escalated to the MTD.

      Toxicity assessments will be ongoing and disease assessments will be repeated every 2
      treatment cycles. If all dose level combinations are explored, a total of 45-55 patients will
      be required to accommodate for the additional patients enrolled in the QTc subset and to
      establish the recommended phase II dose of the combination regimen.
