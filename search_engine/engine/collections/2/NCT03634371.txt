      lifelong therapy. Its physiologically active metabolite is tri-iodothyronine (T3).
      Levothyroxine is also endogenously produced in the body. Since small changes in levothyroxine
      administration (e.g. change in brand or formulation) can cause significant changes in serum
      thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations, precise and accurate TSH control is
      critical to avoid potential adverse iatrogenic effects. Tecnoquimicas modified its
      Levothyroxine tablets formulation in order to comply with new pharmacopeical specifications.
      It will then evaluate the impact on drug product performance based on pharmacokinetic (PK)
      measures of total serum T4 and total serum T3 of the new formulation of levothyroxine (Test
      formulation) relative to the reference formulation from Merck (Reference formulation)

      This will be a single-center, open-label, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence,
      randomized, single-dose, crossover study. 80 healthy adults will be randomized to receive a
      single dose (4 x 150 mcg tablets = 600 mcg) of the test formulation of levothyroxine and
      reference formulation of levothyroxine separately in each treatment period. There will be two
      treatment sequences (AB, BA) and a 42 day washout between the two treatment periods.
