      To evaluate the effect of social media in the promotion of repeat blood donation among
      first-time blood donors in a Peruvian blood bank.

      Study design:

      A randomized control trial will be conducted over a 6-month period, and will compare the rate
      of repeat blood donation who amongst first-time donors who received promotional messages
      through social media and those who did not.

      Population:

      Voluntary first-time blood donors who attend blood donation campaigns organized by the blood
      bank of the Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia (HCH), Lima - Peru.

      Sample:

      A sample of 105 participants per group was calculated, with a significance of 95% and a power
      of 80%, to show a difference of 20% in recurrence rate of blood donation between the two
      groups.

      Group assignment:

      Participant selection will occur at blood donation campaigns organized by the HCH blood bank.
      If inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, donors will be invited to participate in the
      study. After accepting and signing the informed consent form, donors will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups using complete block randomization until a total of 212
      participants are recruited: 106 in the intervention group and 106 in the control group. All
      participants will receive an introductory message through social media confirming their
      participation in the study.

      Ethical considerations:

      Written informed consent will be requested from participants. Data confidentiality will be
      maintained. Personal identifiers will be stored in a separate database, which will be
      password protected and accessible only to the research team.
