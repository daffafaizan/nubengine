      supplementation works to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people at risk for the disease
      and to gain a better understand how vitamin D affects glucose (sugar) metabolism. Researchers
      at US sites will enroll people with pre-diabetes (people who have higher than normal blood
      glucose level but not high enough to meet the diagnosis of diabetes). The study will enroll
      participants over approximately 2 years and participants will be followed for approximately 3
      years. Participants will receive either Vitamin D or a placebo by chance. Participants will
      take 1 pill a day for the duration of the study.
