        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of "ATO/RIF + ATRA + less intensive chemotherapy"
           protocol in children with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

        -  Compare the safetyï¼Œefficacy and treatment cost of "RIF + ATRA + less intensive
           chemotherapy" with "ATO + ATRA + less intensive chemotherapy" protocol in children with
           APL. Determine if ATO can be substituted by RIF.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter and randomized prospective study.
