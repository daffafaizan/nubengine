      neurotransmission affect exposure therapy learning across multiple indices. Hypothesis:
      L-DOPA will decrease measures of fear responding across indices.

      Specific Aim 2: Test the degree to which post-exposure functional connectivity within
      dopaminergic neural networks mediates the effect of dopaminergic manipulation on fear
      responding after exposure therapy. Hypothesis: L-DOPA will predict enhanced post-exposure
      dopaminergic functional connectivity, which in turn predicts decrease fear recall.
