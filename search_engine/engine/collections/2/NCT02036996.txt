      admitted to sleep lab and to determine the accuracy level of the EarlySense system vs. the
      monitors used in sleep lab (e.g., Polysomnography, respiratory belts, ECG, etc..) . Data
      regarding sleep condition, scoring and quality of sleep and in and out of bed status, patient
      turns will also be collected and compared to data collected by EarlySense contactless
      monitor. Different patient population will be monitored including obese, morbidly obese,
      patients with or without obstructive/central apnea, patients with or without arrhythmia as
      well as healthy population who arrive to sleep lab for general evaluation will be monitored
