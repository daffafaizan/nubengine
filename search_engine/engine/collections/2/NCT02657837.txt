      early childhood, but have historically gone undetected until the onset of clinical symptoms,
      at which point irreversible lung damage may have already occurred (1-3). Consequently, over
      the last ten years the focus of clinical care has shifted to early intervention and
      prevention of these structural changes. To facilitate early intervention there is a pressing
      need for surrogate markers of early obstructive lung disease that are also sensitive enough
      to detect treatment effects (4).

      The Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is a promising marker for detecting early lung disease. The
      LCI is measured by multiple breath washout (MBW) and is an indicator of ventilation
      inhomogeneity. MBW is performed during quiet tidal breathing and requires minimal effort from
      patients. It is feasible in all age groups when adaptions are made for younger children.

      While there are Health Canada licensed washout systems available that can determine LCI;
      these devices have not been adequately validated; thus their use in routine lung function
      testing is controversial. As part of an international effort to validate multiple breath
      washout testing to measure LCI, the specific device is licensed in Europe, but as of yet is
      not Health Canada approved. Thus, testing with this device is considered research. This study
      will utilize technology to assess lung function in patients undergoing routine lung function
      testing for clinical indications. In addition, healthy controls of different ages will be
      asked to perform this lung function test to gain reference data that can be used to interpret
      LCI in patients with lung disease.
