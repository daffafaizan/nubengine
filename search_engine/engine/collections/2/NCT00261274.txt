      be drawn about the safety of small volumes of A-ECO cells. All participants will receive
      their own (autologous) red cells that have been either: 1) treated with an enzyme to create
      A-ECO cells (test group); or 2) washed with saline (control group). The test and control
      groups will be compared for the rate and extent any adverse reactions or unexpected
      laboratory test results.
