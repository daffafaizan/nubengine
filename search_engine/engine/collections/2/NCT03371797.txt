      mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine
      belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class
      of medicines Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the
      transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle.
      Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle
      to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood
      pressure.Valsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of
      angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in
      many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland International studies are
      available concerning the single pill combination therapy used in Blood pressure reduction. To
      determine the clinical significance of single pill combination, conducted multi center real
      life study i.e.; "ALERT Trial" in our local population. Through this study, observed the
      effect of single pill combination on BP reduction and adverse events in health care settings.
      Antihypertensive drugs use in a single pill combination may further enhance BP control by
      reducing pill burden and improve patient compliance.
