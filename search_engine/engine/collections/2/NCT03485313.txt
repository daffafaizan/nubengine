    
      Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the placenta shortly
      after implantation of a fertilized ovum into the uterine wall and the rapid rise of blood hCG
      concentration after conception makes it an excellent marker for confirmation and monitoring
      of early pregnancy. As such, levels in the blood of non-pregnant premenopausal individuals
      are low, typically < 5 mIU/mL (milli-International Unit per milliliter).

      In terms of identifying a clinically significant range of expected hCG values as determined
      by the RAMP Î²-hCG test, a 95th percentile of a healthy, non-pregnant, adult female reference
      population [upper reference limit (URL)] shall be determined in this study.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and give informed consent will be
      enrolled in this study. Because hCG levels in blood increase with age, the study population
      will be divided into two age groups: 18 to 40 years and >40 years, with approximately 125
      subjects per group.

      One EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) blood sample will be collected from each subject
      via standard venipuncture. The maximum trial duration for each subject will be one
      visit/blood draw.
