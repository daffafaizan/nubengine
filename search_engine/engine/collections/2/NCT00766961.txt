      (TAE) is safer than and probably as effective as surgery in the control of bleeding from
      ulcers after failed endoscopic therapy. Patients with major arterial bleeding that cannot be
      stopped by endoscopic therapy will be randomly assigned to receive immediate TAE or surgery.
      Primary outcome will be death within 30 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes include
      recurrent bleeding after assigned treatment, need for additional intervention either in the
      form of interventional radiology or surgery, and post procedural morbidities.
