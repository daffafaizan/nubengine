      Traditional vaginal surgery with native tissue is associated with high recurrence rate. Thus,
      synthetic meshes were introduced into POP surgery and became the mainstream. Several
      transvaginal mesh procedures, such as Uphold system (Boston Scientific) and Perigee system
      (American Medical Systems Inc), have been used for cystocele repair. Perigee system is a
      trans-obturator four-arm mesh device attached to proximal and distal arcus tendineus fasciae
      pelvis. Nonetheless, Uphold system, is a single incised, two-arm anterior sacrospinous mesh
      fixation system. Both systems can be used for cystocele repair, despite Uphold system can be
      used for concomitant repair of apical prolapse. The aim of this study was to compare the
      clinical outcomes of Uphold system and Perigee system in treating women with cystocele.
