    
      About 100 youth volleyball players (13-20 years), playing at least 8 hours volleyball in a
      week will be included in the study.

      At the beginning of the 2019-2020 season, they will have to take part at the following
      evaluations :

        1. Clinical evaluation :

             -  Scapular dyskinesis assessment (normal, subtle abnormality and obvious abnormality)

             -  Scapular upward rotation at 0°, 45°,90° and 120° with an inclinometer.

             -  Rounded shoulder posture

             -  Posterior shoulder stiffness

             -  Internal/external rotation range of motion (at 90° of abduction)

        2. Medicine ball throw :

           From a cocking position, players have to throw a 800g medicine ball as far as possible
           (3 trials). Only the best result will be retained for analysis. Volunteers have 2
           minutes of rest between trials.

        3. Upper Quarter Y Balance Test :

           In a facial drop position, the purpose of this test is to bring the plastic board as far
           as possible in the 3 directions (supero-lateral, infero-lateral, medial). 3 trials are
           performed by each subject and only the best test is kept for analysis. A rest period of
           one minute is provided between tests to avoid fatigue.

        4. Strength assessment (isokinetic test) :

           Internal and external rotators strength (concentric 60°/s, eccentric 60°/s and
           concentric 240°/s) are measured with an isokinetic device (Cybex Norm) at 90° of
           abduction.

        5. Psychosocial factors assessment :

      Players will have to fill in POMS questionnaire (65 questions), that give information about
      stress and well-being.

      After that, players will be followed during all the 2019-2020 season and will have to fill in
      a form each month about the potential injuries they had during the previous month.
