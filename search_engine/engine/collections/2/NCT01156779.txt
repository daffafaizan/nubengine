      two-part approach. In part I, 4 subjects are injected 0.5mg dose of DA-3091 or
      placebo(Single/Subcutaneous Injection). After completion of part I study, we are reporting
      data about safety to IDMC. In part II, 8 subjects per group are injected 1mg, 2mg, 4mg of
      DA-3091 or placebo through dose escalating protocol. The ratio of DA-3091 and placebo is 3:1.
