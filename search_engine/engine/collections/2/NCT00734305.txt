      tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose was identified. The study initially explored a dosing
      schedule every 7-days, which may have been modified to longer intervals under certain
      circumstances but did not expand to more than weekly. When the maximum tolerated
      dose/recommended Phase 2 dose was identified, an Expansion Cohort was enrolled at that dose
      to further characterize safety and to explore pharmacodynamic endpoints. There were 3 sites
      that participated.
