        -  Determine the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of erlotinib in a subset of patients who
           are undergoing treatment with erlotinib for stage III non-small cell lung cancer and
           have no CNS metastatic disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, nonrandomized study.

      Patients will undergo single lumbar puncture (LP) to remove cerebrospinal fluid for analysis.

      After completion of study, patients will be monitored for 1 month after LP to assess for any
      LP-related complications.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
