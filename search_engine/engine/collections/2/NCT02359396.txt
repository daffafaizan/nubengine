      randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive 5.0g, 7.5g, 10g b.i.d. of MZRW at 9 am
      respectively. The study drug, MZRW will be administrated to the participants by site
      personnel after participants have fasted overnight for more than 8 hours and 6 hours after

      were immediately centrifuged (1700g, 10 min). Plasma fractions were stored at -20°C until
      analysis. All study procedures conduct in accordance with the ethical principles of the
