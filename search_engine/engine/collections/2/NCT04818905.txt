      represent the oldest and most widely used form of alternative or complementary treatments for
      the prevention and management of obesity. Their consumption is currently increasing in the
      population due to the high cost, potential adverse effects and limited benefits of currently
      available pharmaceutical drugs. Helichrysum italicum is a mediterranean plant with promising
      nutraceutical activities. The plant is known as a rich source of biologically active
      compounds such as polyphenolic antioxidants, which are recognized in the prevention of
      various non-communicable chronic diseases. However, most of its traditionally claimed uses
      have not yet been scientifically proven.

      The proposed study will investigate the acute effect of Helichrysum italicum infusion on
      resting energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, respiratory quotient and blood pressure in a
      pilot study of 11 male adults. It will be designed as a crossover study. Half of the
      participants will consume the Helichrysum italicum infusion and the other half will consume
      hot water. After seven days of washout period the participants will consume the alternate
      beverage.
