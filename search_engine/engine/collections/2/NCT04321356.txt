    
      The objective for this study is to analyze the in vivo kinematics for subjects implanted with
      either a Stryker PCR, Stryker PS, Zimmer PCR, and Zimmer PS TKA and to compare those patterns
      to subjects having a normal knee from our previous study and to those patterns from subjects
      having a Smith & Nephew PCR, BCR, and BCS TKA.
