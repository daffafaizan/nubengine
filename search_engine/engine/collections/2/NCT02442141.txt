    
      Pre-operatively medical history will be collected along with baseline physiological data
      (Blood pressure, heart rate, date of birth, date of surgery, weight, gestational age at
      birth, gender, medical conditions, and medications). Given the importance of reliable blood
      pressure measurement- during the study, strict guidelines regarding proper blood pressure
      cuff placement and choice of cuff size will be followed. An upper extremity and the cuff
      index lines will be used to make sure that the cuff is appropriately sized. NIRS sensors will
      be applied pre-operatively in the operating room prior to induction of anesthesia. All NIRS
      values will be collected as blind values so as to not influence anesthetic management or
      clinical decisions.

      Intra-operatively the NIRS values will be blindly recorded, physiological data and details of
      the anesthesia (the conduct of all clinical monitoring, including blood pressure measurements
      and anesthesia will not be affected in any way by this study). No additional blood pressure
      or other measurements will be made.

      One week later the hospital record (for those infants still hospitalized) will be reviewed
      for evidence of new changes in neurological status (specifically seizures or other
      generalized or focal neurological deficits noted by the clinical team in the record and
      physical exam). For infants discharged home prior to one week after surgery, a phone call
      will be made to inquire about the occurrence of any events that required medical attention or
      treatment.
