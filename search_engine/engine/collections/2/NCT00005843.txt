      I. Determine the safety and effectiveness of R115777 in patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

      II. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and 6 month survival rate of these
      patients with this treatment regimen.

      III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily for 21 consecutive days. Treatment continues every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
