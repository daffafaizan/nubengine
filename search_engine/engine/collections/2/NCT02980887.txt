      and right heart dysfunction, based on molecular, clinical, hemodynamic and radiographic
      characteristics. New classifications will be a product of association of these in depth
      phenotypic descriptions with specific molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. The protocol will
      be implemented to lead to identification of both sub-phenotypes of lung vascular disease and
      to biomarkers of disease that may be useful for early diagnosis or for assessment of
      interventions to prevent or treat this condition.

      A longitudinal study in a subset of the participants enrolled in the parent cross-sectional
      study will:

        1. Retest participants at a minimum 6 month interval from initial evaluation to collect a
           core set of clinical and OMICS features. This will include survival, clinical staging,
           clinical group assignment, 6-minute walk, echocardiography, and blood for a broad
           collection of selected OMICS tests, to include proteomics and other variables found to
           be informative in the initial set.

        2. Associate and compare OMICS data with clinical sets and OMICS clusters between baseline
           and follow-up interval, with attention to reproducibility, predictive capacity as
           biomarkers for diagnosis, disease progression, phenotypic changes, functional capacity,
           therapeutic response and survival.
