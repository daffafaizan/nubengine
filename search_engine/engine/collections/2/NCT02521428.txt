      End-of-life decisions (EOLD) underlie a dynamic process and limitation of ICU-therapies is
      done sequentially. Questionnaire-based and observational studies on medical ICUs and in
      palliative care reveal blood transfusions as the first therapy physicians withhold in EOLDs.
      Whether this practice also applies to surgical ICU-patients is unknown.

      The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to describe the sequence of
      ICU-therapies that are limited and to compare characteristics and the decision making process
      in surgical ICU-patients.
