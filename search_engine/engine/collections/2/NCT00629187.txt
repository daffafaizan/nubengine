      alternative for patients with brain tumors. Temozolomide has been approved for use by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certain tumors of the brain. The doses
      of temozolomide given in this study will be higher than approved by the FDA and higher than
      those given in any prior studies.

      Over 25 subjects will be enrolled on this study over a period of 5 years. This study will
      only be available at Tufts Medical Center.
