      groups. The LA group received subcutaneous infiltration of 0.5 ml/kg lidocaine 1% in
      adrenaline 1:200,000 and the CT group received 0.5 ml/kg of Na CI 0.9% in adrenaline
      1:200,000. The primary outcome was number of patients requiring rescue analgesia (tramadol)
      during the first 24-h postoperative. Secondary outcomes were haemodynamic variables, the
      ESRT, intraoperative anesthetic requirements, time to LMA removal, time to total recovery,
      pain scores, time to first rescue analgesia and incidence of vomiting.
