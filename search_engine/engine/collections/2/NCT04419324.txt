      diagnosed primary NPC will be recruited to the test group. 20 patients undergoing an OGD for
      lesions not involving disease of the head and neck region will be recruited to the control
      group.

      NBI OGD and flexible nasoendoscopy will be performed to examine patients' nasopharyngeal
      region.

      NBI OGD: Endoscopic procedures would be performed by our investigators with expertise on
      performing upper endoscopy. Endoscopes with magnification and NBI function would be used
      (GF-H290Z, Olympus Medical Corporations, Tokyo, Japan). A soft black hood would be attached
      to the tip of the endoscope for better focal length adjustment.

      Upon insertion through a mouthpiece, the scope will then be retroflexed into the nasopharynx
      and the lateral walls into the Fossa of Rosenmuller and the posterior nasopharyngeal wall
      will be systematically examined with white light and NBI. Target suspicious areas would be
      examined by use of magnification with the power up to 80X.

      Flexible nasoendoscopy: The nasoendoscope is introduced into the nose, the nasal cavity and
      nasopharyngnx. It has a camera and a light at the end and allows our doctor to check for any
      abnormal looking areas. Upon identification of suspicious lesion. Biopsies of sites with
      different NBI findings will be taken to correlate the NBI findings with histological
      features.
