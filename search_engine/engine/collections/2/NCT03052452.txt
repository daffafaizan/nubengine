      AIM 1 - To validate the FAST Instrument against existing patient-reported outcome (PRO)
      measures.

      AIM 2 - To assess sensitivity of the FAST instrument to changes in patient diet.

      Investigators will collect information about food intake and related symptoms using the MNH
      app to validate the FAST instrument and assess its sensitivity to change in patient diet. For
      this study, 100 participants who are scheduled to see participating dietitians at either
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center or the University of Michigan will be recruited.

      Participants will be asked to report information regarding food intake and symptoms for two
      weeks (one week pre- and one week post-dietitian visit). The MNH app will prompt users to log
      food intake and any symptoms that you are experiencing at multiple time points throughout the
      day. Investigators will reach out to participants via telephone during the first week of
      enrollment to inquire about their progress using the app, assist in troubleshooting for
      technical difficulties, and answer any questions.

      At the end of each week, participants will be asked to respond to a standardized
      questionnaire about GI symptoms (the 15-item Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale; GSRS) and
      a questionnaire about general health status (the PROMIS 10 Global Health, a 10-item
      questionnaire developed by NIH) through the MNH mobile app.
