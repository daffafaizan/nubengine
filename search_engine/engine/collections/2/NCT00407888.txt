      I. To assess disease-free survival following a dose-intensive weekly regimen of Adriamycin +
      oral cyclophosphamide augmented with G-CSF support followed by Abraxane and Herceptin if
      appropriate for adjuvant treatment of high risk breast cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity associated with this regimen. II. To assess the delivered dose
      intensity of the regimen. III. To assess time to treatment failure and overall survival of
      the regimen. IV. To assess the incidence and severity of delayed nausea and vomiting with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dose-intensive chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over
      10-15 minutes on day 1, oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-7, and filgrastim
      subcutaneously on days 2-7. Courses repeat every 7 days for up to 12 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1 week later, patients then receive
      paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes once a week for 12
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with HER-2/neu
      positive disease also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
