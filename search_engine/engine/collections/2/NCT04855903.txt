      impairments in mental flexibility, leading to difficulties in decision-making, action
      planning, or behavioural perseverance. Techniques for remediation of these dysexecutive
      disorders are often performed in a hospital or in a liberal office. The possible progress
      resulting from this rehabilitation is rarely transposed into the patient daily life
      performances, executed in a richer and less controlled environment than the usual place of
      re-educational. Here, we wish to assess the effective benefits (i.e. in carrying out the
      activities of daily living) of a computerized rehabilitation program addressing executive
      functions and based on virtual reality, simulating ADLs. We use in this study a multiple
      baseline single case experimental design (AB design with a follow-up beyond), including for
      each patient: pretreatment (phase A), treatment (phase B), and follow-up phase.

      Pretreatment includes a routine sensitivomotor neurological rehabilitation program that
      doesn't specifically target executive functions in daily living activities (3 to 5 weeks
      depending on randomization). Treatment consists in a 4 weeks virtual reality cognitive
      training program, including four 45-minute sessions per week with an occupational therapist
      for cognitive rehabilitation in a virtual environment with the COVIRTUA Cognition software.
      The follow-up phase (5 to 3 weeks depending on randomization) includes no support for
      executive functions, either in a rehabilitation centre or in a liberal office.
