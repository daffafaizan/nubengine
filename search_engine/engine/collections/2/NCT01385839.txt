    
      Alopecia areata is a recurrent, non-scarring type of hair loss that can affect any
      hair-bearing area. This disorder can present in many different manners. Though medically
      benign, alopecia areata can result in severe emotional and psychosocial stress in affected
      individuals. This disease can be treated by hair transplantation.

      Hair transplantation is a procedure in which donor hair follicles are harvested from a
      section of a patient's scalp, and transplanted in another bald recipient area, at which time
      it will take root and continue to grow. Hairs generally continue to grow indefinitely

      During this study, subjects with alopecia areata will have one area (or ½ of a large area)
      treated by hair transplant and another (or the other ½) treated by simple irritation with a
      large gauge sterile hypodermic needle.
