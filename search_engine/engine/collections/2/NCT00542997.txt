      period. During the 28-week efficacy period, subjects visited the study site at least every 4
      weeks for efficacy and safety evaluations and additionally recorded details regarding IgPro20
      dose and certain aspects of efficacy and safety in a diary. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters
      were assessed in a sub-group of subjects during 1 treatment interval at steady-state (Week 28
