      techniques such as Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) assisted magnification endoscopy, Auto
      Fluorescence Imaging (AFI) or confocal laser endomicroscopy could, however, improve the
      endoscopic detection.In this research we describe the combined use of these three techniques
      in patients with digestive disease.
