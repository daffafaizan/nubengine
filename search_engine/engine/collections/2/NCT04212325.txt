      planned to include 90 adult patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery at GÃ¼lhane Training and
      Research Hospital between 12 December 2019 and February 2020. These patients were divided
      into three groups: sciatic nerve block (Group B), continuous nerve catheter (Group C). Group
      B patients underwent preoperative popliteal ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blockage. 20
      ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was administered. In Group C patients, 20% bupivacaine 20 ml was
      applied to the sciatic nerve with a peripheral nerve catheter and continuous infusion was
      started with patient controlled analgesia device. Preoperative and postoperative blood flow
      of the popliteal and tibialis posterior arteries, pain scores of patients were evaluated with
      numeric rating scale and wound healing was monitored and recorded. The differences between
      the groups were compared statistically.
