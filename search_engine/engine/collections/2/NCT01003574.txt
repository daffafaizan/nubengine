           greater proportion of the advanced-practice nurse (APN) phone counseling group will have
           undergone cardiovascular screening, as compared to the standard care group.
           Cardiovascular (CV) screening will be defined, based on established CV screening
           recommendations, as completion of an imaging evaluation of left ventricular systolic
           function (i.e., echocardiogram, multiple uptake gated acquisition scan, or cardiac
           magnetic resonance imaging).

        -  This study will measure changes induced by the intervention in survivors' knowledge,
           motivation, fear, beliefs, affect, readiness for medical follow-up, and self-efficacy
           and these changes' potential mediating effects on CV screening.

             -  This study will provide a cost analysis of the ECHOS intervention in terms of the
                cost of left ventricular systolic function imaging per additional survivor
                screened, an estimate of the cost of standard care per survivor screened, and the
                cost of screening and follow-up per survivor screened.
