      C-section under spinal anesthesia (SA) using 10 mg of hyperbaric BPV. After surgery, they
      received bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP block with 50 mg of BPV in each side. Venous blood
      samples were collected immediately before and at 10, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 720 and
      1440 minutes after both TAP blocks. The investigators used high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) to measure BPV total plasma concentrations. Mean BPV area under the
      curve (AUC) was calculated from 0 to 24 hours according to the linear trapezoidal rule. Mean
      peak of total BPV plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to reach the peak (Tmax) were
      recorded. Electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings were also repeated at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours to
      investigate the effect of BPV on corrected QT (QTc) intervals. Data were computed using SPSS
      20®. Quantitative data were expressed as means ± SD. Qualitative data were expressed as
      percentages.
