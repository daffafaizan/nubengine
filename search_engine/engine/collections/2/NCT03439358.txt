      their epidurals 'topped-up' with a fast onset local anesthetic to ensure the lower body is
      fully numb for surgery. This is called an epidural 'top-up'. However, a side effect of
      epidural top-ups is shivering, which is uncomfortable for the mother and interferes with
      patient monitoring. Magnesium administration has been shown to decrease shivering in the
      non-pregnant population. Therefore, in this study the investigators aim to determine if
      magnesium given prior to an epidural top-up decreases the incidence and severity of shivering
      in the pregnant population.
