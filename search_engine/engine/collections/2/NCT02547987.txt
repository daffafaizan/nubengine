      To determine whether neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin will increase the pCR rate in TNBC
      compared to historical controls. Pathologic complete response (pCR) will be defined as no
      residual invasive breast cancer in the breast and ipsilateral axillary lymph node (ypT0-is
      ypN0).
