      corticosteroids are the first drugs of choice for treatment. Monotherapy with an ICS is most
      often sufficient and, along with an as needed short acting bronchodilator agent, the most
      cost effective method for managing patients with mild-moderate persistent asthma.

      Alvesco, the ICS ciclesonide delivered in a solution via a HFA metered dose inhaler, has been
      shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of persistent asthma. This study will
      attempt to further document these attributes in patients with mild-moderate persistent
      asthma.

      The collection of patient reported data can be accomplished in a number of ways. The standard
      system in asthma trials is daily diaries transcribed on paper forms. While useful in many
      studies, this system lacks the ability to remind subject of reporting time, to time stamp
      when the report is done and note at the time of report completion to the subject, areas that
      are incomplete, and to remind patients when to take their study medication. Because of these
      inadequacies, newer electronic data collection systems are being developed. One of these, the
      VOCEL Mobile Diary system, will be compared with the standard paper reporting method for
      abilities to document efficacy, safety, compliance and convenience.
