      metabolites simultaneously in a biological matrix, is a versatile analytical technique
      capable of accelerating biomarker-based discoveries in nutritional science. Recently,
      metabolomics has been applied to samples collected in feeding studies (1) and epidemiologic
      studies (2) to identify dozens of novel potential dietary biomarkers. Several large
      prospective cohort studies, many of which are collaborating in a metabolomics consortium led
      by the National Cancer Institute, have recently applied metabolomics to banked samples. This
      has made nutrition-related biomarkers suddenly available for tens of thousands of
      participants with follow-up for disease endpoints, enabling truly large-scale nutritional
      biomarkers and disease studies.
