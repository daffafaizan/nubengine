      indications. The preterm cervix, however, is frequently not favorable for induction. Multiple
      methods have been evaluated in the term gestation. As these comparison studies have not
      included the preterm gestation, this study seeks to evaluate these two methods in terms of
      safety, efficacy and time to delivery.
