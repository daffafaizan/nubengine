      differentiates itself from the other brain monitor by calculating two EEG indexes, the qCon
      and the qNox. The qCon corresponds to the depth of the sedation and the qNox relates to the
      probability that a nociceptive stimulation triggers a movement of the patient. A controller
      allowing the automated titration of propofol guided by the qCon and remifentanil guided by
      the qNox has been developed. In preparation for a large multi-center control trial, this
      prospective randomized study evaluates the effectiveness of such a closed-loop anesthesia
      system. Two groups of patients are compared: one arm in which propofol and remifentanil are
      administered by the anesthesiologist using target-controlled infusion (TCI) systems, and the
      second arm in which propofol and remifentanil are administered automatically by the combined
      closed-loop anesthesia system. In both groups, the goal is to maintain qCon between 40 and
      60, the recommended range during anesthesia by the manufacturer. It is expected the combined
      closed-loop anesthesia system group to do similar or better control to maintain the qCon in
      the desired range.
