      improve the cognitive function in older people with cognitive impairment. In this regard, it
      has been argued that while physical exercise improves the metabolic activity of the brain,
      the performance of cognitively demanding tasks increases the amount of dendritic branches and
      the level of synaptic plasticity, implying that the combination of both therapies may result
      in synergistic effects that positively influence various cognitive domains in different ways.
      One of the best known therapies which combines mental and physical training is Brain Gym®
      (BG), a movement-based program originally designed to improve learning capabilities through
      the performance of mind-body exercises. Brain Gym® can be considered as an interesting field
      of research due to the need of identifying novel therapies which might be more pleasant for
      older adults who tend not to be prone to participating in conventional exercise programs and
      might have a positive effect on their cognitive function. In spite of this, scientific
      evidence regarding the effects of BG on people with cognitive impairment is scarce and none
      of the studies compared the potential benefits of BG versus traditional exercise programs for
      this population. Moreover, to the authors' knowledge no study of this kind has been published
      so far. Under these circumstances, the present study aims at identifying the potential
      benefits of performing BG exercises on the cognitive function, functional independence,
      physical fitness, and quality of life of institutionalized older people with cognitive
      impairment, as well as at finding out whether the effects are more significant than those
      produced by a traditional exercise program.
