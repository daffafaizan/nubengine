        -  Obtain estimates of changes in vaginal length, perceived vaginal elasticity, perceived
           vaginal lubrication, and sexual activity, response, and satisfaction among patients with
           stage IB2 cervical cancer.

        -  Compare these differences between the patients in the two treatment groups in GOG-0201.

        -  Determine the relationships between vaginal dilation activities and vaginal length
           changes in these patients.

        -  Determine the association between smoking and vaginal length and between smoking and
           vaginal dryness in these patients after therapy for cervical cancer.

        -  Assess the extent of subject interest in and preferred methods of sexual counseling
           related to problems resulting from treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Vaginal length is measured using Vaginal Sound, a modified plastic vaginal dilator.
      The data about vaginal elasticity and lubrication and sexual activity, response, and
      satisfaction are obtained from patient self-report, as well as vaginal dilation activities.
      Measurement and assessments are taken before treatment and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
