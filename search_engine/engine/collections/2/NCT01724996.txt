      Zurich, the study physician in charge, who is acting simultaneously as one of four attending
      clinical physicians, is performing the physical examination according to routine clinical
      practice. The physical examination includes the testing of chest wall tenderness: Palpation
      of chest wall tenderness in lying 30Â° elevation of chest position. Flat index with
      standardized pressure where spontaneous maximum pain is reported (reproducible vs. not
      reproducible pain vs. no pain). Negative control (right side of chest mid-clavicle
      intercostal 6/7), reproducible vs. not reproducible pain vs. no pain. The same physician, who
      is blinded for the final diagnosis at the time of the physical examination, is also recording
      the patient history including the study interview using the standardized study questionnaire.
