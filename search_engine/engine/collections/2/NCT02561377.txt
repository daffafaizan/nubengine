      find a single long term study focusing on type 2 diabetes prevention with resistance training
      and aerobic exercise. It has been known that for those who have already had diabetes,
      resistance training can reduce insulin resistance and HbA1c level, improve lipid profile, and
      decrease blood pressure. Based on previous findings, investigators will evaluate how the
      different exercising interventions impact on insulin resistance, metabolic control, and the
      incidence and prevalence of diabetes in prediabetes population who receive 12 months of
      either resistant training or aerobic exercise. Further more, metabolomics approach will be
      introduced to detect biological markers,and therefore,to analyze the predictive values of
      metabolomics on long term outcomes of prediabetes population.
