    
      Objective: The aim of this study is to determine serum concentrations of adiponectin (ApN),
      leptin and ghrelin in different stages of anorectic patients and to evaluate their
      relationships between biochemical, hormonal and anthropometric parameters.

      Design: The study group is composed of four groups. Group1: Treatment-naïve patients with a
      recent diagnosis of AN (n:19), Group 2: The weight recovered (10 % increase in body weight
      compared with baseline weight) subgroup of group 1 at the end of a mean 117.72±98.14 days of
      follow-up (n: 12), Group 3: Recovered patients with a previous history of AN but normal
      menstrual cycles and body weight at the present time (n:10), Group 4: Control group:
      constitutionally thin healthy young women with normal menstrual cycles (n:10). Venous blood
      was obtained for measurements of biochemical parameters, ApN, leptin and ghrelin and body
      composition was determined by bioimpedance analysis.
