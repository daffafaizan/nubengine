    
      This is a randomized study on healthy individuals. The study design includes the recruitment
      of 12 healthy male and female subjects (50-80 yr of age) randomized into 2 groups of 6 each
      (liposomal glutathione at 500 mg/day or liposomal glutathione at 1000 mg/day). Blood and
      urine samples will be obtained from all subjects at baseline. Eligible subjects will be
      required to have not have taken any high dose antioxidant supplements for at least 1 month
      prior to the study. Subjects will then begin supplementation according to the following
      schedule: Group A, liposomal glutathione (500 mg daily), Group B, liposomal glutathione (1000
      mg daily)

      Eligible participants who sign the informed consent will be randomly assigned to either low
      dose or high dose glutathione groups. Participants will be asked not to consume any other
      high-dose vitamin, multi-vitamin, or mineral supplements containing glutathione throughout
      the study in order to prevent variation in dose of supplemental liposomal glutathione between
      subjects. Participants are to limit their consumption of alcohol in the study to no more than
      5 oz. of alcohol per week. Supplementation will continue for 1 month with biological samples
      collected at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after baseline.

      Levels of glutathione will be measured in whole blood, erythrocytes, lymphocytes and plasma.
      The biomarkers of oxidative stress will include urinary 8-isoprostane and urinary
      8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. Immune function biomarkers will be analyzed including lymphocyte
      proliferation and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity.
