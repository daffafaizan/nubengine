      study, which has been conducted in 24 sites in Greece, under normal clinical practice and as
      per the locally approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of study medication (oral
      paricalcitol). Eligible patients were followed up for a 12-month period after enrollment. All
      study activities were consistent with European Union (EU) directive 2001/20/EC section for
      non-interventional studies.

      In this study, paricalcitol was prescribed on an on-label basis in an everyday setting to
      observe drug actions in a distinct geography (Greece with > 250 days/year of sunny days) as
      well as in a significant subpopulation (Chronic Kidney Disease [CKD] stages 3-5 transplanted
      patients). Dose tolerability, treatment effects, as well as maintenance of results were
      registered for a 12-month period in order to obtain experience in the long term use of
      paricalcitol capsules. Furthermore, in centers where additional blood parameters were
      examined as part of clinical routine, these were recorded and analyzed.
