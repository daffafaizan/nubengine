    
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare disease mainly affecting the elderly. BP is associated with
      significant morbidity and increased mortality secondary to increased risk of secondary
      infections, comorbid conditions, and serious side effects from high-dose steroids and
      immunosuppressants. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of benralizumab as a
      treatment for patients symptomatic with Bullous Pemphigoid (BP).
