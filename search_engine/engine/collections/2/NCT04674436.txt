    
      A ranked first person shooter player will play for two hours each session, and on separate
      days will take a 6 minute walking break or a 6 minute resting break within 2 hours of game
      play. This study is virtual and you may play from your regular home gaming computer. The
      third day will be continuous play.

      The study will take place on 3 separate days. Preferably 2 -3 days in -between testing days.

        -  Participants will sign an electronic consent form to sign and agree to participate. It
           will explain the study in detail.

        -  Participants will then be asked to take two executive function tests online. These test
           will be sent electronically through email. This is for practice. These tests take
           approximately 6-7 minutes.

        -  We will schedule one day where the participant will play a first -person shooter game.
           Prior to playing the participants will be take to take the two executive function tests.

        -  On one day the participant will be asked to stop after the first hour (they will be
           allowed to finish the test) they will either walk for 6 minutes near their computer or
           rest for 6 minutes. Participants will be contacted through cell phones or discord.

        -  Game play will resume normally for another hour. When that hour is completed the
           participant will be asked to take the two online tests again.

        -  This will be 2 days. The third day the participant will take the online tests and play
           continuous for 2 hours with no break and then repeat the online tests.
