      recruited and asked to swallow the OFDI capsule while being awake and unsedated. The capsule
      is attached to a tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule
      as it progresses down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the duodenum using natural
      propulsive force called peristalsis.

      As the capsule progresses, multiple 2-dimensional cross sectional images of the duodenum are
      acquired. Images are analyzed at a later stage.
