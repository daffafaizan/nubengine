    
      This study is a pilot, bi-centric, exploratory, randomized, controlled, crossover design with
      blind observer .

      Subjects participated in a baseline assessment session (T0, before rehabilitative treatment),
      followed by random allocation to 8 weeks of rehabilitative treatments (A or B) (T1), followed
      by 1 month of inactivity wash out period. Following this wash-out period, patients who
      received treatment A switched to the treatment B and viceversa. A computerized randomization
      schedule was generated on the computer and held by an investigator not involved in subject
      recruitment or assessment.

      Both clinical (neurological visit and scale administration) and instrumental (gait analysis)
      assessments were carried out 3 times: at baseline before rehabilitative treatment (T0), 4
      weeks (T1, intermediate evaluation) and 8 weeks after rehabilitative treatments (T2, final
      evaluation). Medication was kept constant throughout the trial, and all interventions were
      performed at the same time of day for each patient during ON phase.

      Participants were asked to maintain their pre-enrollment activity level and current
      medication dosage when not in the laboratory.

      Assessors, for both clinical and instrumental evaluations, were blinded to the allocation
      treatment.

      During the inactive condition, participants received usual care.
