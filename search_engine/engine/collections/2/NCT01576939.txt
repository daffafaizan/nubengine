      adjacent to the dental fillings in patients receiving IMRT for head and neck cancer. If the
      mucosa dose is estimated to be greater than 35 Gy for the entire radiation course, we will
      generate and implement a "filling" optimized IMRT plan, provided that this new plan does not
      compromise tumor coverage or increase dose to the rest of the oral mucosa or parotid glands.
      Dosimeter will be used to measure the mucosal dose delivered by this new IMRT plan. Patient's
      mucositis grade, narcotic use and self-reported mouth and throat soreness scores will be
      recorded and correlated to mucosal dose. We hypothesize that modulation of an IMRT plan to
      reduce the dose delivered to adjacent normal mucosa surrounding the dental filling can
      decrease the severity and duration of radiation-related oral mucositis. Here we propose to
      use thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) to measure the mucosal dose adjacent to the dental
      fillings in a standard, "non-filling" optimized IMRT plan that is normally delivered in the
      clinic.
