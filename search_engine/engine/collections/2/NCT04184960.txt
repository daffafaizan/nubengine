      more accurate in predicting the risk of gastric cancer development.

      The risk factor assessment would be based on the following criteria.

      Endoscopic assessment:

        1. Atrophic gastritis, based on Kimura Takemoto Classification

        2. Kyoto classification of gastritis

        3. Intestinal metaplasia, based on Endoscopic Mapping and Grading of Intestinal Metaplasia
           (EGGIM) Histological assessment (Based on random biopsies)

      1. Operative Links on Gastritis Assessment 2. Operative Links on Gastric Intestinal
      Metaplasia
