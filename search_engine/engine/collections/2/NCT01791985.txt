      which can be used together with a class of drugs called nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors
      (e.g. anastrozole or letrozole) i.e. a dose which does not cause too many unacceptable side
      effects.

      Patients with hormone sensitive (oestrogen receptor positive) breast cancer, whose current
      treatment with anastrozole or letrozole has recently stopped working properly will be
      eligible for this stage.

      Stage 2 will then assess the efficacy of AZD4547, based on the change in tumour size at 12
      weeks (or progression if prior to week 12), when used in combination with either anastrozole
      or letrozole in patients with hormone sensitive (oestrogen receptor positive) breast cancer,
      who have progressed on treatment with either anastrozole or letrozole in any setting.

      In both stages, the study will look at how well the new treatment is tolerated.

      Each patient is only allowed to take part in either stage 1 or 2.

      The study will be run in 9 Hospitals across England and Scotland.
