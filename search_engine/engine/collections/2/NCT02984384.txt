      (VTE), including fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). Current guidelines recommend
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for VTE prophylaxis in orthopaedic trauma patients.
      However, emerging literature in total joint arthroplasty patients suggests the potential
      clinical benefits of VTE prophylaxis with aspirin. This trial aims to determine if aspirin is
      non-inferior to LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in fracture patients.
