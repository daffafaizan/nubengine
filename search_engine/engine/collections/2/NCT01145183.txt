      cocaine addiction in humans. The results of this study will provide medical safety data on
      the duration of the induction schedule that will be optimal for attaining our target dose of
      8 mg doxazosin daily and will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related
      alpha 1 receptor antagonists for cocaine addiction.

      This 16-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will provide treatment for 100
      cocaine-dependent patients and includes a 13 week medication trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 2
      week washout period(weeks 14-15). Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive Doxazosin
      8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

      Subjects will be receiving 1 mg study medication/placebo capsules at week 1, with 4mg/week
      induction rate for weeks, according to their randomized assignments, and are maintained on
      these agents through week 13. At the end of the study (weeks 14-15), participants will
      undergo discontinuation from active/placebo medication over a 2-week period. Subjects who
      wish to be transferred to an appropriate treatment program or treatment-research program will
      be helped with referral during the 2 week period (weeks 14-15).
