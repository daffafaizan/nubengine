      advertising in the Twin Cities area. This will be done by the Tobacco Use Research Center.
      They will be screened in a phone call, then invited to come in for an orientation session at
      which consent will be obtained. Pregnant smokers will be excluded. They will visit the clinic
      weekly for 2 months and once monthly for 4 months for a total of 6 months participation.

      At each visit they will drink 5 ml of 50:50 ethanol:water containing 10 ug [D10]phenanthrene.
      They will then collect their 24h urine and return it to the clinic. The urine will be
      analyzed for [D10]phenanthrene tetraol. The goal of the study is to determine the
      longitudinal stability of the amount of [D10]phenanthrene-tetraol in urine.
