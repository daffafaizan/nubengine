    
      Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in ascending dosing cohorts of 8 subjects each.
      Each subject will receive an oral dose of study drug (fomepizole or placebo) with concomitant
      ethanol with group assignment in a randomized 1:1:1:1 ratio (2 subjects each group) on Study
      Day 1. Each subject is their own intra-subject control with the alternative study drug
      (fomepizole or placebo) administered on the next day (Study Day 2). Four subjects in each
      cohort will receive study drug (fomepizole or placebo) administered 30 minutes prior to
      ethanol, 4 with study drug (fomepizole or placebo) administered 30 minutes after ethanol. The
      study will assess safety and tolerability of fomepizole and the PK/PD of 4-MP, ethanol and
      acetaldehyde in the subject population.
