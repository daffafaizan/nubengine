      Wellness and Research Center's registry. A probability sampling technique (simple random
      selection) will be employed to randomly select (Automated Random Number Generator) the
      potential participants. Then, the potential participants will be contacted and informed about
      the study. After consenting to participate, they will be screened for eligibility. The
      pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria will be enrolled and followed up until nine
      months after delivery. The contact details of each participant will be written on a paper and
      sealed in an envelope marked with either letter A or B. Upon enrolment, the participants will
      be randomized equally with a block size of two into two parallel arms. The pregnant women in
      the interventional arm will receive six sessions of a low-intensity psychosocial intervention
      through telemental health consultations with a trained psychologist. On the other hand, those
      in the control arm will not receive any intervention. The participants in both arms will be
      screened for psychological distress (six times) over the study period.
