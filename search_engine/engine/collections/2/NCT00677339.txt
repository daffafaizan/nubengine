      arginine-nitric oxide and Vitamin D-1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D pathways. Our aim is to determine
      if the key immunomodulatory agents L-arginine and vitamin D can improve the rapidity and
      magnitude of the microbiological and clinical response in pulmonary TB. We will test the
      following hypotheses in newly-diagnosed TB patients in Timika, Papua, Indonesia:

      Our specific aims are to:

        1. Determine whether supplementation with L-arginine and/or vitamin D is safe, and results
           in more rapid improvement in clinical, mycobacterial, immunological, radiological,
           physiological and functional measures of treatment outcome. We will randomise patients
           with pulmonary TB to receive, in addition to standard TB therapy, adjunctive arginine,
           vitamin D and / or placebo in a randomised, double-blind factorial 2x2 design. We will
           relate serial measurements of plasma concentrations of L-arginine and vitamin D, and
           immunological responses (pulmonary NO production, T cell function and phenotype) to
           measures of treatment outcome [mycobacterial (sputum smear clearance and culture
           conversion), physiological (spirometry), clinical (symptoms and weight), radiological
           (chest Xray) and functional (six-minute walk test, modified St George Respiratory
           Questionnaire)].

        2. Determine whether pulmonary production of NO is inversely related to disease severity at
           presentation. Baseline and serial measures of NO production will be related to disease
           severity and the magnitude and rapidity of clinical response
