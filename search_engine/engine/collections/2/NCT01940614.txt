    
      Purpose of this study is to compare the overall diagnostic accuracy of the three following
      diagnostic test procedures in diabetes insipidus (central, nephrogenic) and primary
      polydipsia: a) classical water deprivation test alone, b) classical water deprivation test
      plus plasma copeptin cut-off levels, c) hypertonic saline infusion test plus plasma copeptin
      measurement.

      The investigators hypothesize that firstly b) and c) is better as a). Secondly the
      investigators hypothesize that c) is non-inferior to b).
