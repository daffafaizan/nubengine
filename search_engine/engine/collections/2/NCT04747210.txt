      the students. The schools will be assigned to one of two groups: both groups will receive a
      10 hours training workshop; only the intervention group will receive coaching one-to-one. The
      duration and number of coaching sessions will depend on the caregivers' time available, daily
      routines, and goals. Coaching sessions will be recorded for the assessment of treatment
      fidelity.
