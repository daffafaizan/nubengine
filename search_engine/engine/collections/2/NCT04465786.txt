      first-time, unilateral, subcortical stroke and age-matched healthy controls. All participants
      will carry on 2 sequential experiments. In the first experiment, participants will perform 2
      motor tasks using either paretic/nondominant upper extremity or non-paretic/dominant upper
      extremity, called motor attempt (M) condition or calibration condition. The second experiment
      contains 3 conditions: cyclic functional electrical stimulation (cFES), cFES during motor
      attempt (M-cFES), and functional electrical stimulation during brain-computer interface
      (BCI-FES) in random order. The sensorimotor oscillations from the electroencephalography
      (EEG), upper extremity sensorimotor function score (Fugl-Meyer test, Action Research Arm
      test, and Revised Nottingham Sensation Assessment), corticospinal excitability from the
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and resting-state functional and structural
      neuroimage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be assessed before and after the final
      experiment, as well as 3 months after stroke.
