      HIV-infected patients with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg-positive serology >6 months) in seven
      clinical centers. Patients were recruited in 2002-2003 and followed prospectively every three
      to twelve months, during two phases, until 2010-2011. Extensive information on a variety of
      HIV- and HBV-related parameters were collected during these study visits.

      This particular study aims to extend follow-up of the French HIV-HBV Cohort using a different
      type of design. Patients who completed at least one study phase of the French HIV-HBV Cohort
      are selected for participation. Patients continuing follow-up at a participating clinical
      center are asked to undergo their routine clinical visit, during which time medical data from
      the years since last cohort visit until their routine visit are extracted. For those who
      died, information from the years since last cohort visit until death will be collected.

      The primary objective for this cohort extension is to further understand the reasons for and
      clinical implications of persistent HBV infection in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV in
      the era of highly effective antiviral treatment against both viruses.

      The following secondary objectives are as follows:

        -  To establish the extent of persistent viremia (PV) of HBV, quantified either in serum or
           within the hepatocyte

        -  To understand whether this persistence effects clinically-relevant serological outcomes
           (i.e. HBeAg and HBsAg seroclearance and seroconversion along with HBsAg quantification)
           after prolonged follow-up

        -  To quantify the evolution of liver fibrosis using non-invasive methods and, in a small
           subset of patients, liver biopsies, while investigating the virological and
           immunological factors associated with its progression and regression

        -  To describe the causes of liver-related and non-liver-related morbidity and mortality
           and the direct effect of persistent HBV DNA replication on these outcomes
