      fluconazole in preventing fungal infections in patients undergoing an autologous (for
      hematologic malignancies) or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This is a Phase
      III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in patients six months of age and older.
      Study drug, either FK463 at 50 mg/day (1.0 mg/kg/day in patients weighing less than 50 kg) or
      fluconazole at 400 mg/day (8 mg/kg/day in patients weighing less than 50 kg), will be
      administered intravenously once daily in a blinded manner. Study drug will continue until
      neutrophil recovery (defined as a post nadir absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of greater than
      or equal to 500/mm3). Patients who develop a proven, probable, or suspected (requires
      empirical antifungal therapy) fungal infection will be discontinued from the prophylactic
      regimen. The maximum time the patient may receive study drug is 42 days post transplant.
