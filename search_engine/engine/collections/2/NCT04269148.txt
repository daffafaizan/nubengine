      head and neck cancer patients, apart from the "McMaster University Head and Neck Radiotherapy
      Questionnaire", there is no other questionnaire designed specifically for local advanced
      stage III and stage IV head and neck cancer and treatment of specific morbidity at a certain
      time. Patients in these stages often have difficulties in oral communication, nutritional
      disorders and loss of chewing and swallowing skills leading to dehydration, bad mouth odors,
      appearance problems affecting social and family life, and often significant morbidity
      including severe pain symptoms.
