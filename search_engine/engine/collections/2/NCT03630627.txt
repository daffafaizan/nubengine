    
      The study includes two Parts; Part 1 includes the FiH exposure and SRD and Part 2 is the MRD.
      Approximately 58 subjects will be enrolled in the study. New subjects will be recruited for
      each cohort in both Parts. The SRD Part will include 5 or more dose levels and the MRD Part
      will include 3 or more dose levels; additional dose level(s) may be added based on emerging
      safety and PK data from prior cohorts.
