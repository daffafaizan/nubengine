    
      This is an open label, multi-center, multi-arm, dose-escalation study of BBI608 administered
      in combination with either Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398
      with 5-FU and leucovorin. A study cycle will consist of daily and continuous oral
      administration of BBI608 for four weeks (28 days) in combination with Gemcitabine and
      nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin. Combination
      treatment will continue in 28 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      another discontinuation criterion is met. BBI608 may be continued post-progression if the
      patient is obtaining potential clinical benefit, in the opinion of the investigator. If
      administration of Gemcitabine and/or nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with
      5-FU and leucovorin is discontinued due to chemotherapy backbone-related toxicities, the
      administration of BBI608 can be continued.
