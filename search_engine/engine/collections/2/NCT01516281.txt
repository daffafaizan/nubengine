      subtle changes in the brain ("biomarkers") that are similar to those seen in early
      Parkinson's disease (PD). The results of this study may provide more information about a
      potential link between mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and PD. We will compare
      findings from persons who experienced mTBI ("cases") to persons without history of brain
      injury (mTBI-or "controls"). This study may provide preliminary data that might be used to
      help design future long-term studies.

      The investigators propose scientific studies with one specific aim and two hypotheses:

      Specific aim: to determine if one year post emergency room (ER) visits, DaTscan uptake
      (Ioflupane I123 injection and single photon emission computerized tomography) is lower in
      subjects exposed to mTBI (defined as a closed head trauma that results in loss of
      consciousness or amnesia for less than 24 hours) than in subjects not exposed to mTBI
      (without closed head trauma; mTBI-).

      Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis #1: mTBI is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Hypothesis #2: DaTscan is
      able to detect subclinical PD (as measured by a dopamine transporter deficiency) in mTBI
      subjects.
