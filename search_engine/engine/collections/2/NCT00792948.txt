    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test whether the relapse-free survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation among
      Philadelphia chromosome positive and/or breakpoint cluster region (BCR)/Abelson murine
      leukemia viral oncogene (ABL) positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients given an
      intensive short-term chemotherapy regimen of fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine
      sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) in combination with the
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is sufficiently high to warrant further investigation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test whether the continuous complete remission rate for previously untreated
      Philadelphia chromosome positive and/or BCR/ABL positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
      patients given an intensive short-term chemotherapy regimen of hyper-CVAD in combination with
      the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is sufficiently high to warrant phase III
      investigation.

      II. To investigate in a preliminary manner the relative effectiveness of minimal residual
      disease (MRD) detection using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
      BCR/ABL versus flow cytometry to predict the outcome of patients treated by the hyper-CVAD +
      dasatinib regimen and/or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of the intensive short-term
      chemotherapy regimen in these patients.

      II. To estimate the overall survival of all patients on this study.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION/CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: All patients receive both of the following regimens in
      alternating courses:

      COURSES 1, 3, 5, 7 or 3, 5, 7, 9: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 3
      hours twice daily (BID) on days 1-3; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on day 4;
      vincristine sulfate IV over 30 minutes on days 4 and 11; dexamethasone IV or orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days 1-4 and 11-14; dasatinib PO QD on days 1-14; cytarabine intrathecally (IT)
      on day 7; methotrexate IT on day 2; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) QD or BID.

      COURSES 2, 4, 6, 8: Patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1;
      methylprednisolone IV over 30 minutes BID on days 1-3; dasatinib PO QD on days 1-14;
      high-dose cytarabine IV over 2 hours BID on days 2-3; leucovorin calcium IV on days 2 or 3;
      methotrexate IT on day 2; cytarabine IT on day 7; and G-CSF SC QD or BID.

      Treatment repeats every 14-21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or if patient achieves complete remission (CR) or complete remission
      with incomplete platelet recovery (CRi).

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY*: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 30 minutes on day 1,
      prednisone PO QD on days 1-5, and dasatinib PO QD on days 1-28.

      Treatment repeats every month for 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity or until the transplant is ready.

      INTENSIFICATION: For courses 6 and 13, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours BID
      on days 1-3; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on day 4; vincristine sulfate IV over
      30 minutes on days 4 and 11; dexamethasone IV or PO QD on days 1-4 and 11-14; dasatinib PO QD
      on days 1-14; and G-CSF SC QD or BID.

      NOTE: *Only if transplantation is not ready after induction/consolidation therapy or patients
      are not undergoing a transplant.

      ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (FOR PATIENTS ACHIEVING CR OR CRi):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive 1 of the following regimens:

      REGIMEN A: Patients receive total-body irradiation (TBI) QD on days -7 to -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.

      REGIMEN B: Patients receive TBI BID on days -6 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and
      -2.

      REGIMEN C: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 and TBI QD on days -4 to
      -1.

      REGIMEN D: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 and -5 and TBI BID on days -3 to
      -1.

      REGIMEN E: Patients receive TBI QD on days -7 to -4 and etoposide IV on day -3.

      REGIMEN F: Patients receive TBI BID on days -6 to -4 and etoposide IV on day -3.

      ALLOGENEIC STEM CALL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      on day 0.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive 1 of the following regimens:

      REGIMEN A: Patients receive sirolimus PO and tacrolimus IV continuously (changing to PO BID)
      beginning on day -3 and continuing for 6 months.

      REGIMEN B: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously (changing to PO BID) and continuing
      for 6 months, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      SINGLE-AGENT THERAPY: After completion of maintenance therapy or beginning on day 100
      post-transplantation, patients receive dasatinib PO QD for up to 5 years.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.
