      compared liberal and restrictive ï¬‚uid regimens; concluded that it is difficult to define
      'liberal' or 'restrictive' protocols in clinical practice. patients undergoing moderate-risk
      surgery seem to benefit from the more liberal fluid administration, while patients undergoing
      high-risk or major surgery seem to benefit from restrictive or conservative strategies. Lung
      ultrasound used for comparison between liberal and restrictive fluid therapy in laparoscopic
      hysterectomy patients by detecting the B-lines intraoperatively or immediately
      postoperatively. The aim is to evaluate the lung ultrasound as a guide for intraoperative
      fluid management, being an index for increased extravascular lung water (ECLW). This
      operation is a moderately complex procedure that implies the Trendelenburg position. This
      position - in addition to liberal fluids - will increase venous return and increase the
      challenge on the cardiac muscle under anesthesia in these patients.
