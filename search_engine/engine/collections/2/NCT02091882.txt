      for the rapid assessment of candidate subcomponents for the MIND1 System. This substudy is
      being conducted to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System by completing
      a series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic. Following placement of the
      Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one tablet approximately every 2 hours, for a
      total of 4 ingestions. Aripiprazole-embedded IEM tablets are being tested along with the
      placebo-embedded IEM tablets to assess any difference in accuracy of IEM detection and
      latency. Approximately 32 healthy volunteer subjects will be enrolled in the substudy. The
      duration of this substudy for each subject is estimated to be 1 day of active participation
      plus a 2-week safety follow up (phone call) period.
