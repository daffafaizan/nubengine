      early stage NPC patients treated with radiotherapy alone. Patients who had Stage II disease
      had a worse outcome compared with patients with stage I disease. Chemotherapy, delivered
      concurrently with radiation therapy, has been adopted as standard treatment for locally
      advanced NPC. However, concurrent chemoradiation for stage II NPC patients has never been
      prospectively studied. In the present trial, we hope to assess the value of concurrent
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with stage II (T1-2N1) NPC.
