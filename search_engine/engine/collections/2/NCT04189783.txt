      I. To use a pragmatic phase II randomized controlled trial to compare two standardized
      bundles of usual care for postoperative pain management to reduce the initial discharge
      prescription opioid volume.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess which pragmatic arm improves aspects of postoperative recovery including 30-day,
      3-month, and 1-year opioid use, patient symptom inventory at those time points, hospital
      measures including length of stay and inpatient pain scores.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care liposomal bupivacaine injection before and during
      surgery and standard of care non-opioids and opioids at days 0-3 after surgery in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care liposomal bupivacaine injection before and during
      surgery and standard of care non-opioids and opioids at days 0-3 after surgery in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive a second liposomal bupivacaine injection on
      day 4 after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 12 months after
      the surgery.
