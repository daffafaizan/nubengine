      liver tumors. Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone,
      were widely used to treat jaundice in the patients with severe hepatitis, liver dysfunction
      or liver failure. It was reported that glucocorticoids decrease the rates of liver
      dysfunction or mortality in those patients. However, whether post-operative glucocorticoids
      administration alleviated jaundice or deceased the rates of post-hepatectomy liver failure
      (PLF) yet to be determined. In this study, the investigators were aiming to evaluate whether
      dexamethasone administration accelerates the recovery from hepatectomy-related jaundice and
      decreases the rates of PLF and its safety in the subjects who developed elevated serum TB.
