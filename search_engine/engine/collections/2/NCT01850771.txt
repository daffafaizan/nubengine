    
      Prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled to include 25 subjects treated with
      Regenexx PL-Disc and 25 subjects treated with steroid epidural injection with the steroid
      epidural group crossing over to the PL-Disc injection group at 3 months.

      Subjects will have symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy confirmed by physical
      examination.

      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to injection and take part in follow-up visits
      for one year following treatment. A preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment;
      follow-up visits will occur at the clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months
      post injection. Subjects will remain blinded to the treatment allocation through at least the
      3 month primary endpoint. Control subjects not improving after the 3 month visit will be
      unblinded and given the opportunity to cross-over to the PL-Disc group.

      Subjects will complete the study following the 1 year follow-up visit.
