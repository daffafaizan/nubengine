    
      This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. A fixed single dose
      of adoptively transferred FAP-specific CD8 positive re-directed T cells will be given in the
      pleural effusion.

      Three patients who are at the time point of screening not operable will be treated with
      re-directed T cells administered into the pleural effusion after completion of 3 cycles of
      palliative chemotherapy. In the case of one AE grade III/IV or one SAE - and the occurrence
      of DLT both judged to be treatment related by an independent safety monitoring board - the
      patient number will be expanded to 6 patients. The study will be stopped if one additional
      DLT occurs also judged to be treatment related.

      Patients will be treated with 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells injected in the pleural
      effusion. The study ends 35 days after adoptive T cell transfer. Re-directed FAP-specific T
      cells will be administered at day 0 (day 14 of the third cycle of palliative chemotherapy).
      The study is designed to demonstrate safety of 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells. The
      next patient will be enrolled earliest, when the previous patient completed day +14 and the
      safety monitoring board has not declared any DLTs. The palliative chemotherapy is not part of
      the study protocol.
