      children grow. Children with ASD are slow to develop language and have problems interacting
      socially with others. It is not clear why ASD occurs, but there is some evidence that the
      signals that tell the brain how to grow are altered which causes the brain to develop and
      function differently in people with ASD. Eyes develop from the same embryonic tissue as the
      brain. This means that the retina, which is the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye,
      shares the same signals as the brain. Investigators can listen to retinal signals outside the
      eye and the retina can, in this way, act as an accessible part of the brain.

      The investigators will detect retinal signals as electrical messages. Sensors placed near the
      eye pick up the electrical changes in the retina each time a light flashes. This
      non-invasive, routine clinical test is called an electroretinogram, (ERG). The investigators
      have carried out a study that showed differences in the ERGs recorded from adults with ASD
      compared to control participants.

      The main aim of this project is find out how common ERG differences are in children with ASD
      compared to controls. If it is common, investigators could use the ERG to make an earlier
      diagnosis of ASD and help families sooner. It could help investigators better understand the
      way the ASD brain signals and give investigators a way of measuring if therapies work.
