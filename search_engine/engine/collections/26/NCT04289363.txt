      (interview/focus group and field notes) with administrative and health record data with some
      analyses including data collected from the parent CTN-0079 study. Further, qualitative data
      will be analyzed in the context of themes derived from CTN-0069 and CTN-0079. CTN-0079-A1 is
      planned to be conducted at two of the three sites of the parent study: (1) Catholic Medical
      Center, Manchester, NH; (2) Bellevue/NYU Health and Hospitals, New York, NY. Many of the
      methods, operating procedures, measures and forms will be retained or adapted from the parent
      study. However, CTN-0079-A1 is a new study in which lessons learned through the parent study
      have informed important design modifications necessary to improve study rigor and utility.
