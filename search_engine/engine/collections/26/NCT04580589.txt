      when receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs). The investigators will be studying
      participants on DOACs who have had bleeding and also participants who are on DOACs who did
      not have bleeding (control group). The goal of the study is to determine the accuracy of
      Cipherome's Drug Safety Score (DSS) in it's ability to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
      A DSS score ranges from 0 to 1, with scores less than 0.3 correlated with a higher risk of
      ADRs and scores more than 0.7 correlated with a lower risk of ADRs. The participant's DSS
      score will be compared with the actual clinical outcome using a statistical test to determine
      the accuracy of the DSS.
