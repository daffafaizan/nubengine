    
      The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Phase 1) and an expansion part (Phase
      2). Both parts will enroll patients with advanced non-resectable NSCLC, advanced
      non-resectable thyroid cancer and other advanced solid tumors that have progressed following
      standard systemic therapy, have not adequately responded to standard systemic therapy, or the
      patients must be intolerant to or the Investigator has determined that treatment with
      standard therapy is not appropriate, or there must be no accepted standard therapy for their
      disease.
