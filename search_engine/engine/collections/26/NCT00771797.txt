      from PAOD with a pain free walking distance less than 200 m will be enrolled. In a randomized
      controlled parallel group study the before established novel 5-level approach of vascular
      diagnostics will be realised. In order to test the hypothesis, whether cocoa rich in
      flavanols improves vascular function of diabetic PAOD subjects will regularly intake flavanol
      rich cocoa (group 1: 975 mg/d, n=50 versus group 2: 90 mg/d, n=50) over a period of two
      months. Clinical endpoints are the Ankle-Brachial-Index, measured by Doppler ultrasound and
      the pain-free walking distance determined by a treadmill ergometer. All parameters of
      vascular diagnostic (see 5-level approach above) will be determined before and two month
      after cocoa ingestion.
