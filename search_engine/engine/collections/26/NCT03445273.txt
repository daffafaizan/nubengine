      type of surgery or operative endoscopic/endovascular procedure at the participating Centers.
      Centers will be divided into two groups: Centers that routinely follow the recommendations of
      the SAS 2 Document and Centers that do not. The relevant clinical, procedural and outcome
      data (within index admission and at 30 days) will be entered in a specifically designed
      electronic case record form (eCRF). The primary endpoint will be the rate of discontinuation
      of P2Y12 inhibitors and/or aspirin (without bridging) in the first 3 months after PCI with
      low risk characteristics and 6 months after PCI with high risk characteristics or any
      antiplatelet therapy discontinuation without bridging therapy. The secondary end-point will
      be the composite of death, myocardial infarction, probable/definite stent thrombosis and
      bleeding events at 30 days; the type and the length of discontinuation of any antiplatelet
      therapy in patients undergoing surgery according to time from PCI to surgery; delay in
      performing surgical procedure; rate of surgical procedures within 12 months from PCI divided
      into quartiles (0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12 months).
