      quantitative, objective, neurophysiological marker for diagnosis and monitoring of the above
      most common MDi in man.

      The secondary aim is to find predictive bio-types (electrophysiological fingerprint) of the
      above MDi and within these disorders identifying patients with high likelihood of developing:
      1) psychiatric complications such as dopaminergic medication induced-impulse control disorder
      (ICD) for PD; 2) Depression; 3) Gait and balance Impairment; or 4) Cognitive deterioration,
      including (PD-MCI) or PD-dementia (PDD).

      The technology: BNA technology is based on non-invasive recordings of multi-channel EEG
      event-related potentials (ERPs), and a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis of such
      recordings, aimed at understanding and visualizing the network complexity (or Brain Networks
      Activation patterns) of brain function. BNA takes cognitive ERPs, a direct measure of neural
      activity associated with cognitive functions, to a new frontier, unparalleled by EEG, QEEG or
      ERP alone or by any other anatomic and functional brain imaging and evaluation tools. The BNA
      algorithms use innovative sets of signal processing, pattern recognition and machine learning
      techniques to seek and map activated neural pathways while patients are engaged in a
      cognitive task. The resulting BNA network patterns can aid clinicians with profiling of
      changes in functionality and/or dysfunctionality. BNA received an FDA clearance and a CE mark
      approval during 2014, and is commercially available in the US, with more than 20 active
      clinical and research sites focusing on numerous neurological and neuropsychological
      disorders. More than 30,000 data sets of functional brain networks of healthy subjects have
      been already collected and may serve as normative data for comparison.
