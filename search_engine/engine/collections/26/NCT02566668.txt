      healthy controls to address questions related to the mechanisms for the development of the
      complex immune processes observed in the lungs. Samples will be evaluated for Type-1, Type-2
      and Interleukin-27 (IL-27) expression (and their downstream signatures). In addition, these
      samples will be evaluated for the presence or absence of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) as a counter
      regulatory pathway. These pathways will be directly evaluated in epithelial brushings and
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, as well as BAL fluid. Broad gene expression profiling
      (Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing) will also be performed to determine the range of
      immune-inflammatory markers present in these severe asthmatics. Investigators will
      specifically address the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) signaling
      pathways, particularly STAT-1 and STAT-3 to determine the pattern of activation and
      downstream responses to develop new therapies. Additionally, in a subset, investigators will
      compare targeted and untargeted gene expression as obtained from bronchoscopic samples with
      expression obtained from clinically performed video assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) biopsies of
      very severe systemic corticosteroid dependent patients. The ultimate goal of this studies is
      to determine whether a predictive biomarker panel can be identified in the less invasive
      bronchoscopic samples which predict the findings seen on VATS biopsy.
