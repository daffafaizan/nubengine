      (PD) of two oral formulations of BLD-0409, tablet and solution, in healthy volunteers (HV).

      The study consists of two parts:

      Part 1: A randomized, open-label, 3-period, 6-sequence, complete crossover study with at
      least 3-day washout between treatment periods comparing oral solution formulation to tablet
      formulation.

      Part 2: A randomized, open-label, 4-period, 4-sequence, complete crossover study with at
      least 3-day washout between treatment periods evaluating single ascending doses of tablet
      formulation.
