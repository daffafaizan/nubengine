      a progressive loss of functional muscle mass, which is replaced with fibrofatty tissue.
      Historically, boys with DMD lose the ability to walk between the ages of 8-12 years, due to
      progressive weakness of the quadriceps coupled with the development of contractures at the
      hip, knee and ankle. This progressive loss in function necessitates individuals with DMD to
      spend less time walking and more time in wheelchairs, leading to the development of spinal
      deformities. Recently, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the expected loss of muscle
      strength, extend the time that ambulation and standing are maintained, and minimize or
      eliminate spinal deformity in individuals with DMD; yet, the side effects of such treatment
      preclude use in some patients. To date, differences in gait patterns and other markers of
      disease progression between boys on corticosteroids and those not utilizing such treatment
      have not been objectively quantified. This lack of knowledge is a major obstacle to
      determining the most effective treatment for subsets of boys with DMD.
