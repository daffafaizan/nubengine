      intervention (Parenting from the Inside Out or PIO) originally developed for substance
      abusing mothers (as part of an ongoing NIDA-funded treatment development study; R01 DA17294)
      for implementation with female adult caregivers who have or are at risk for long-term
      interpersonal conflict with family members, children, or significant others and are caring
      for a child between the ages of birth and 7 years. The PIO intervention involves 12-24 weekly
      1 hour individual therapy sessions with Masters level therapists who are trained and
      supervised by Dr. Suchman (the Principal Investigator) in the PIO approach.
