      compared with outcomes for non-AIDS patients. Treatment with mBACOD has been promising, but
      the toxicity is very high. Patients treated with mBACOD have very low white blood cell
      counts. GM-CSF has increased the number of white blood cells in animal studies and
      preliminary human studies. It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to
      lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD.

      Patients admitted to the study receive chemotherapy in 21-day cycles. The length of therapy,
      2 - 8 months, depends on how the tumor responds to treatment. Four medicines are given on day
      1 of each cycle by vein (IV) (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, vincristine). Dosages
      of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are increased in later groups of patients if toxicity in
      the first group is tolerable. A fifth medicine (dexamethasone) is given by mouth (PO) on days
      1 - 5 of each cycle and the sixth medicine (methotrexate) is given IV on day 15 of each
      cycle. Leucovorin is given after methotrexate to prevent methotrexate side effects. GM-CSF
      treatment is started on day 3 and continued for 11 days. To prevent the spread of the tumor,
      a spinal tap is done on 4 occasions to inject cytosine arabinoside directly into the spinal
      fluid. If tumor cells are present in the spinal fluid, the patient also takes cytosine
      arabinoside by spinal tap 3 x/week until the tumor cells disappear and then at monthly
      intervals for 1 year. Patients with tumor cells in the spinal fluid are also given radiation
      treatment to the head.
