        -  Evaluate the impact of neoadjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) and thalidomide on pathologic
           response (histologic P0, margin positivity, capsular penetration), prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) response, and other investigational endpoints in patients with high-risk
           prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy.

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of GM-CSF and thalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 1, 3, and 5 and oral
      thalidomide on days 1-5 or 1-7 in weeks 1-4. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy at week 8 or 9.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.
