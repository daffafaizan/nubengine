      will be administrated with tranilast (For juvenile patients, 5mg/kg.d with a maximum dose of
      0.3g per day; For adult patients, the dose is 0.1g each time, three times a day). These
      patients will be followed up for 6 months. AIDAI is recorded by patients' or their parents
      one month before the start of treatment, and at the 1st, 3rd and 6th month after the
      treatment. Inflammatory markers, and patients' and physician's global assessment of disease
      activity will be assessed during the 1st, 3rd and 6th month follow-up. Side effects will be
      monitored and recorded as well. Experimental data before and after the administration of
      tranilast will be analyzed and be statistically processed, to figure out whether tranilast is
      effective and safe for CAPS patients.
