      randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) and the app, reSET-O (n = 100), and half will
      be assigned to TAU only (n = 100), in order to evaluate treatment retention rates in
      individuals with opioid use disorder after initiating medication assisted treatment. All
      subjects will participate in the study for a total of six months, and all subjects will
      attend five research appointments across the six months. Participants assigned to TAU +
      reSET-O will be expected to engage with the app, reSET-O, for the full six months. The app
      works as an extension of cognitive behavioral therapy as it provides psychoeducation related
      to opioid dependence and use, and is designed as an adjunctive treatment with medication
      assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
