      portion of dark chocolate contains 400-800 mg of polyphenols, compared to red wine (170 mg
      /100ml) or an apple (200 mg/piece). Cocoa polyphenols, most notably the catechins, can exist
      in both lipid and water-based environments (amphipathic), meaning they can spare both
      lipophilic and hydrophilic vitamins. There have been a number of human trials conducted using
      chocolate or cocoa and measuring various endpoints. Most have been conducted with dark
      chocolate. An article in Nature found that the bioavailability of epicatechin from milk
      chocolate was substantially reduced compared to dark, and even dark taken with a glass of
      milk (Serafini et al 2003). The hypothesis was that the milk proteins bind to polyphenols,
      making them unavailable. Subsequent studies have not been able to reproduce this, but none
      have been conducted using solid chocolate as the first study, all have been done using a
      drink matrix, which may completely alter the binding interactions of the polyphenols and
      protein. To this end, this study is designed to compare solid chocolates as a source of
      polyphenols for improving a risk biomarker for vascular disease.

      This study is designed as a blinded, three arm crossover trial. The primary outcome measure
      is to compare endothelial function after consumption of 3 chocolates (1 milk, 1 dark, 1
      polyphenol-free control) with a secondary outcome of arterial stiffness. All volunteers will
      take all chocolate types in a crossover design. Subjects will undergo medical screening,
      anthropometry, physical activity and dietary assessments before randomization for the order
      of consumption.
