      fluorescent porphyrins in gliomas will be used under investigation for identification and
      resection of high and low grade gliomas. Surgery will be done using a modified neurosurgical
      microscope, with a fluorescent kit that enables switching from the conventional white light
      to a violet-blue excitation light for visualization during tumor resection. If deemed safe by
      the neurosurgeon, any area of the resection bed determined to be fluorescence-positive for
      tumor will be removed with appropriate designation of tissue for histopathological
      evaluation. After this resection, additional fluorescence images will be obtained and the
      process repeated until the image is negative for tumor. At all times, the decision to resect
      will be limited by clinical judgment of safety.

      The desire is that a more complete resection will occur due to the surgeon's ability to
      better visualize and distinguish between tumor and normal tissue, and thus be able to remove
      as much, or most of, the tumorous tissue, resulting in a better outcome for the patient, or
      for future patients.
