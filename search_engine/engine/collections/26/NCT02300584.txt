      the Savvy Caregiver, an evidence-based dementia caregiver psychoeducation program, to family
      caregivers of community-dwelling persons with dementing illnesses (PWD) for whom attending
      in-person meetings poses difficulties. The program - named Tele-Savvy - uses iPad and PC
      technology and on-line conferencing capacity to deliver the program through daily
      asynchronous self-learning modules and weekly, hour-long synchronous group meetings with
      program facilitators. Tele-Savvy addresses all of the learning objectives of the current
      in-person Savvy program (Savvy entails in-person participation in six weekly two-hour group
      sessions).
