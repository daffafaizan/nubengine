      and consensus on when to start eating after endoscopic treatment. In 2015, a randomized
      controlled study in Taiwan of China confirmed that compared with liquid diet given 48 h after
      endoscopic treatment, liquid diet given 4 h and started enteral nutrition would not increase
      the risk of rebleeding, and could improve the nutritional status of patients. However, some
      patients after endoscopic treatment would suffer from post-sternal pain, abdominal pain,
      nausea, vomiting and other discomforts, affecting appetite and delay the diet time. Based on
      the above research background, we observed and evaluated the safety and effectiveness of
      early enteral nutrition in patients with cirrhotic esophageal and gastric varices after
      endoscopic treatment, and analyzed the influencing factors of enteral nutrition in patients
      with cirrhotic esophageal and gastric varices after endoscopic treatment, so as to further
      clarify the optimal time for patients to eat after endoscopic treatment.
