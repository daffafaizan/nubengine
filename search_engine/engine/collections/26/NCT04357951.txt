      characterized by the presence of motor and/or vocal tics. For many youth with TD, the
      severity of tics results in considerable functional impairment and a poor quality of life.
      While historically managed with psychotropic medications, behavior therapy has demonstrated
      efficacy for reducing the severity of tics. However, only 50% of youth with TD exhibit a
      positive treatment response to behavior therapy, and many treatment responders continue to
      experience bothersome tics. Thus, there is a need to investigate strategies to improve
      therapeutic outcomes from behavior therapy for youth with TD.

      This pilot study aims evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of behavior therapy
      augmented by d-cycloserine (DCS) compared to behavior therapy augmented by placebo. After an
      initial assessment to determine eligibility, youth with TD will be randomly assigned to
      receive four sessions of behavior therapy augmented by either DCS or placebo. D-cycloserine
      is an FDA-approved antibiotic medication that has been shown to enhance extinction learning
      in several studies. The investigators' proof-of-concept work has found that a single session
      of DCS-augmented behavior therapy reduced the severity of tics targeted in treatment on the
      Hopkins Motor/Vocal Tic Scale (HM/VTS) compared to placebo-augmented behavior therapy. This
      highlights the exciting potential of combining DCS with behavior therapy to improve
      reductions in tic severity. However, prior to a large-scale clinical trial, it is essential
      to determine the feasibility and efficacy of augmenting behavior therapy with DCS over
      multiple treatment sessions.
