      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy would decrease the risk of death from any cause in
      comparison to optimal heart failure (HF) care without ICD insertion in patients with NIDCM,
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤35% and presence of myocardial fibrosis on cardiac
      magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.
