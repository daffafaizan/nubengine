      apnea and determine pathways for intervention, aiming to prevent the development of
      cardiovascular disease in these individuals.

      This proposed research aims to evaluate both NTPDase activity in lymphocytes and levels of
      circulating endothelial cells (CECs) in patients with intermittent hypoxemia (IH) due to
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and healthy controls. This is an original approach to define
      mechanisms which underlie the high incidence of occlusive vascular events in patients with
      OSA. The evaluation of such pathophysiological mechanisms will lead to a better understanding
      of the pathways involved and the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the
      reduction or avoidance of endothelial injury with the ultimate goal of reducing morbidity and
      mortality associated with these pathologic events in sleep apnea. The standard of care will
      be used in this protocol, which involves the use of CPAP (continuous positive airway
      pressure) for treating sleep apnea.
