      high schools, will be enrolled in the trial. Participants will be recruited either through
      in-class presentations focusing on marijuana or via referrals from school staff. They will
      first be assessed regarding use of marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs, as well as pertinent
      attitudes and goals. Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

        -  The experimental intervention is a two-session motivational enhancement treatment. A
           personalized feedback report, containing information from the participant's assessment
           as well as normative comparison data, is reviewed, with the Health Educator employing
           motivational interviewing strategies intended to enhance motivation for reduction or
           cessation of marijuana use. Specific goals for change and behavior change strategies are
           discussed with participants who wish support to change their marijuana use.

        -  The comparison condition involves two educational sessions focusing on the health and
           behavioral effects of marijuana.

        -  The third condition (delayed treatment control) involves a minimal baseline assessment
           followed three months later by a reassessment interview. Those assigned to this
           condition will then be given their choice of either active treatment.

      Following completion of their two intervention sessions, participants in the two active
      treatments will be offered an additional four sessions of cognitive-behavioral skills
      training in which the focus is strategies in quitting marijuana. All participants will be
      reassessed at 3 and 12 months following their initial assessment interviews.
