      as an important mediator of lung inflammation and damage in cystic fibrosis. We hypothesize
      that the addition of treatment with doxycycline in CF inpatients will reduce MMP-9 activity
      and inflammatory markers in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients compared to CF patients
      not treated with doxycycline.
