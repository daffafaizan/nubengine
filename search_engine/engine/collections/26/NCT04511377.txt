      disabilities of daily life. It is a disorder that can be caused by trauma, overuse,
      inappropriate usage of shoulder as well as degenerative change, which is increasing due to
      enlarged geriatric population. Current method of post-operative rehabilitation is home-based
      self rehabilitation using brochure, combined with one or two times of education at the
      hospital before discharge. Patients often find difficulty in doing rehabilitation by
      themselves at home without supervision which resulted in decreased compliance.

      With development of technologies using multi-motion sensor and AR(augmented-reality) system,
      the investigators have developed a digital healthcare system(Uincare Homeplus) which can
      supplement patients' rehabilitation at home by giving them proper instructions as well as
      feedback.

      In this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators aimed to compare the
      efficacy of the newly-developed digital healthcare system with conventional rehabilitation
      program.
