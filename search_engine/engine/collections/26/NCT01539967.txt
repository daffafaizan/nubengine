        1. From a prospective database, patients are selected if they were operated by Laparoscopic
           Sleeve gastrectomy at least two years before.

        2. these patients are convoked by their surgeon, who proposed them to participate at this
           study. During this consultation, the BAROS score is calculated by the surgeon and
           reported in the case report form of the patient.

        3. After checking the possible contraindication, a gastric computed tomography volumetry is
           done and the residual gastric volume is calculated by two independent radiologists.
