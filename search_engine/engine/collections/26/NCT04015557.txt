      A phase I-II clinical cross-over, not blinded, trial will be conducted. Adult patients with
      homocystinuria and paired-sex and age- healthy controls will be enrolled. Individuals with
      hepatic, renal or gastric disease; smokers, illicit drugs users or those who are
      hypersensitive to any of the components of the drugs tested (acetaminophen and
      N-acetylcysteine ) will be excluded.

      Patients will be submitted to two procedures:

      Step 1: In this stage, individuals will receive a single standard dose of Acetaminophen
      (1.5g) orally and blood samples will be drawn at time 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after the
      administration.

      Step 2: In this stage, individuals will receive again a normal dose of acetaminophen (1.5g)
      orally and one hour later a single dose of oral N-acetylcysteine (70 mg per kilogram of body
      weight)(. Blood samples will be drawn at the same points.

      In plasma we will measure methionine, homocysteine, cysteine and glutathione by LC-MS/MS.
      Taurine will also be determined by Biochrom 30 Amino Acid Analyser. Pyroglutamate will be
      determined as a marker for glutathione depletion.

      As markers of oxidative stress we will assay thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, protein
      carbonyl content, thiol content, DNA damage 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence assay, and
      activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione
      peroxidase . Liver function parameters aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase
      (ALT) activities will also be determined.

      All measurements will be performed at all 5 points of blood collection and in the two stages
      of the trial.
