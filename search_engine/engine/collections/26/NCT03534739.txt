      inhibitory control (DNIC), an endogenous pain inhibitory pathway in which pain inhibits pain.
      Conditioned pain modulation is less efficient in individuals with chronic pain conditions and
      it is a predictor for the development of chronic pain.

      Massage is a common manual therapy intervention for individuals with musculoskeletal pain.
      Greater changes in pain sensitivity occur following pain inducing massage suggesting a
      mechanism dependent upon the efficiency of the conditioned pain modulation response. Previous
      research has indicated pain inducing massage is more effective than pain free massage
      suggesting a mechanism dependent upon conditioned pain modulation.

      The study team will evaluate the association between pain inducing massage and the
      conditioned pain modulation paradigm. Participants with neck pain will be randomly assigned
      to receive a pain inducing massage, pain free massage, or a coldpressor task. Pre-and post
      intervention pain will be assessed. The study team will determine if analgesia induced by
      pain inducing massage is similar to the conditioned pain modulation paradigm and if baseline
      conditioned pain modulation predicts responders to pain inducing massage and short term
      clinical outcomes in patients with a history of neck pain.
