      study based at the University of Texas Health Science Center of Houston. This study seeks to
      develop an emergency- initiated opioid system of care for individuals with prior opioid
      overdose and opioid use disorder. The study involves both assertive outreach on individuals
      who have recent overdoses within the last 72 hours, as well as individuals who are admitted
      to local hospital emergency departments. The study explores the effect of the combination of
      assertive outreach, same-day induction into medication-assisted treatment, ongoing
      maintenance treatment, behavioral counseling, peer recovery support, and paramedic follow-up
      on patient outcomes. The primary outcome is engagement and retention outpatient treatment.
      Secondary outcomes include quality of life assessment as well as subsequent relapses and
      overdoses. The hypothesis is that patients with earlier induction into MAT treatment in the
      emergency department, who receive routine follow-up, are more likely to engage and be
      retained in a longer-term treatment program for their addiction.
