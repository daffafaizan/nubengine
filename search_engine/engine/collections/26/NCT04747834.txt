      this clinical investigation - up to 50 eyes in Cohort 1 and up to 50 eyes in Cohort 2. Only
      one eye per subject will be enrolled into the study. This is multicenter, multi-cohort,
      prospective clinical study designed to provide longitudinal, observational, non-comparative
      clinical outcome data for mechanical non-phacoemulsification lens extraction using low-energy
      segment removal with a micro-interventional irrigation/aspiration port (MICOR-304) to
      evacuate the lens prior to intraocular lens insertion.

      Participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion will be asked to enroll in the study. The
      investigator or designee will explain the study purpose, procedures and responsibilities to
      the potential participant and provide sufficient opportunity to ask questions, while allowing
      adequate time for consideration of the information provided. Upon participant confirmation of
      interest, written informed consent will be obtained and the subject will be enrolled in the
      study. One copy of the informed consent document (ICD) will be retained with the subject's
      medical records and one copy will be provided to the subject.

      Study subjects will be stratified into two Cohorts. Cohort 1 is comprised of eyes with
      mild-to- moderate cataracts only (Grade 1 to 2). Cohort 2 is comprised of eyes with moderate
      to more dense cataracts only (Grade 2+ to 3+).

      Subjects will be seen at the screening visit, intraoperative visit, and at post-operative
      days 1, 7, and 30.
