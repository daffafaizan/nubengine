    
      The purpose of this post market prospective study is to examine the effect of the adjunctive
      use of the Orthofix SpinalStimâ„¢ device on lumbar fusion rate in high risk subjects who have
      undergone lumbar fusion surgery. High risk subjects are those who are currently using
      nicotine, who are having a multi-level fusion, who have had a prior failed fusion at any
      lumbar level, who are diabetic or who are osteoporotic. Because this is a post market
      prospective study, subjects who are enrolled in this study will be identified by the
      Investigator as needing lumbar fusion surgery and asked if they would like to participate in
      a study looking at the efficacy of lumbar fusion with adjunctive use of the SpinalStim bone
      growth simulator. The type of lumbar fusion surgery performed (lateral lumbar interbody
      fusion [XLIF], posterior lumbar interbody fusion [PLIF], anterior lumbar interbody fusion
      [ALIF], posterolateral fusion) is up to the Investigator; the subjects in the study must be
      agreeable to using the bone growth stimulator daily for 6 months post surgery.
