      Two different methods of determining a centric relation were performed: the traditional
      method using wax occlusal rims and the Gerber method, based on gothic arch tracings. The
      success rate of establishing a centric relation in both methods was evaluated
      (rentgenodiagnostics). The influence of the method used to obtain the centric relation on
      patients stomatognathic system (condyle centralization, pain) was also evaluated. The
      comparison between two methods was performed and results were analyzed. A centric relation
      was analyzed in temporomandibular joints and a corelation between TMD symptoms and centric
      relation was evaluated.
