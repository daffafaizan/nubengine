      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of arsenic trioxide in patients with relapsed
      or refractory low-grade lymphomas.

      II. To determine the incidence of complete and partial responses to arsenic trioxide in
      patients with previously treated low-grade lymphomas.

      III. To evaluate basic science correlates of arsenic trioxide activity in order to improve
      our understanding of the mechanism of action for arsenic trioxide in patients with low-grade
      lymphomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients with responding or stable disease may receive 6 additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
