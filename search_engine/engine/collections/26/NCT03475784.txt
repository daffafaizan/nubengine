      therapy in prophylaxis against postdural puncture headache.

      The restrictive group will not receive preoperative fluid loading, and will receive
      intraoperative crystalloids at rate of 10 mL/Kg/hour followed by postoperative crystalloids
      at rate of 2 mL/Kg/hour for hours. The Liberal group will receive preoperative fluid loading
      of 5 mL/Kg, and will receive intraoperative crystalloids at rate of 10 mL/Kg/hour, followed
      by postoperative crystalloids at rate of 6 mL/Kg/hour.

      Both groups will be compared regarding demographic data, total peri-operative fluids,
      incidence of postdural puncture headache, nausea, vomiting, and intraoperative hemodynamics
      (heart rate and systolic blood pressure) in addition to neonatal outcomes.
