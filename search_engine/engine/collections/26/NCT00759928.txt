      survival in patients with Refractory Solid Tumors; however, this absolute benefit is limited
      for the majority of patients. Incorporating other biologic agents into the second- or
      third-line treatment setting may prove to be a successful strategy in improving treatment
      efficacy (which has been recently demonstrated in several tumor types). Additionally, recent
      data suggest that smoking may influence the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of erlotinib by
      increasing the metabolic clearance. Data suggest that the geometric mean erlotinib AUC(0-inf)
      and C(24h) are significantly decreased in smokers compared with nonsmokers (Hamilton et al.
      2006). For this reason, this trial will enroll separate cohorts of patients who are current
      smokers and patients who are nonsmokers. Nonsmokers are patients who have not consumed
      tobacco or nicotine-containing products for 1 year before the start of the study. Patients
      classified as current smokers must have smoked a minimum of 10 cigarettes per day for up to 1
      year.
