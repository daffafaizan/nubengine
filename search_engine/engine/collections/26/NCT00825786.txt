      subject will receive two injections before surgery begins. These two injections will consist
      of the mixture of mepivacaine (15 ml) and ropivacaine (15 ml).

      Group S: Mepivacaine followed by Ropivacaine. Subjects will receive two injections before
      surgery begins. One injection will contain mepivacaine (15 ml) and the other will contain
      ropivacaine (15 ml).
