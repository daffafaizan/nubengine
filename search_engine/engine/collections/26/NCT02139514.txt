      structure the behavioral and brain effects of an evidence-based intervention for adults with
      high-functioning autism, Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training (Kandalaft et al., 2012;
      Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders). Adults with autism will be randomly assigned
      to receive either (a) two hours per week of intervention services for five weeks, or (b) a
      treatment as usual control. The intervention will focus on enhancing social skills, social
      cognition, and social functioning. Outcome measures will evaluate changes in these social
      skills, cognition, and functioning using standardized assessments. We will perform structural
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at three time points-before the
      treatment, after the treatment, and a 3-month follow-up (i.e., Time Point #1, 2, and 3).

      All the recruitment will be taking place at Yale Child Study Center (YCSC), while the
      intervention will be delivered online by therapists located at the Center for BrainHealth at
      the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). The intervention is called Virtual Reality-Social
      Cognition Training (VR-SCT) and has been approved by the IRB at UTD (approval number #06-54).
