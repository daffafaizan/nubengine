      and can serve as a tool for the evaluation of the severity of RV dysfunction and prognosis in
      pulmonary hypertension according to recent data. In-depth evaluation of phasic RA function
      was previously undertaken either by echocardiographic speckle tracking or by cardiac magnetic
      resonance (CMR) imaging-derived feature tracking. However, it is currently unknown if right
      atrial remodeling is present.

      As described for left atrial fibrosis, the presence and extent of atrial fibrosis can be
      quantified using CMR late gadolinium enhancement. The protocol for the assessment of left
      atrial fibrosis will be used and adapted to the RA. Patients will undergo 3-dimensional late
      gadolinium enhancement CMRI along with a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography and
      cine imaging in order to define the anatomy of the RA and the superior and inferior vein.
      High-resolution late gadolinium enhancement images of the RA will be acquired 15 to 30 min
      after gadolinium-based contrast agents administration using a 3-dimensional
      inversion-recovery prepared, respiration navigated, and electrocardiogram triggered
      gradient-echo pulse sequence with fat saturation. Following acquisition of the scans, the
      endocardial borders of the RA will be defined in each slice by manual tracing. After manual
      adjustment of the epicardial RA surface, the quantification of fibrosis based on the relative
      intensity (signal intensity) of late gadolinium enhancement will be performed. Finally, a
      3-dimensional model of the RA will be rendered with the maximum enhancement intensities being
      projected on the model surface.
