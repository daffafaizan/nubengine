      care approach, among high-risk HIV-negative transgender feminine, transgender masculine, and
      gender non-conforming youth and young adults for reducing sexual risk behaviors and
      increasing PrEP uptake. Transgender youth and young adults are enrolled for 9 months in the
      RCT. During the RCT, 275 participants will be enrolled and randomized to either: (1) text
      messaging (n=108), (2) WebApp (n=83), or (3) an informational website control (n=83)
      condition. Participants will include HIV-negative youth and young adults (ages 15-24) who are
      self-identified transgender feminine, transgender masculine or gender non-conforming.
      Participants will be recruited from venues in Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and
      Philadelphia. There will be four data collection time points: baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-month.
      Visits will be conducted in-person at the venues, online, or some combination of in person or
      online. An ACASI will be completed using online survey tools. An HIV test, sexually
      transmitted infection (STI) panel, urine screen for recent illicit drug use, and blood
      microsampling or dried blood spot, for those who report PrEP uptake, to verify PrEP adherence
      will be collected in-person at the participants local venue, or via mailed self-collection
      kits. Process data of each participant activity at each step of the intervention, as well as
      the control intervention, will be collected. The study aims to measure the effects of the
      information-only (Info) arm compared to a text messaging intervention (Text+Step) to a WebApp
      intervention (WebApp+Step) for reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing PrEP uptake.
