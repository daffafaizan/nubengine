      :Bichat hospital in Paris and Toulouse University Hospital. The effectiveness of this
      management has been demonstrated since recurrence stroke risk is reduced by 80% at one year.
      An English study (EXPRESS study) [2] showed a gain of 624 pounds with an ambulatory
      management compared to a conventional one. No studies are available in France on this
      subject.

      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a collection of medical and economic data
      on a prospective way. The investigators collect medical (Cerebrovascular events, Stroke) and
      economic (direct and indirect costs) data concerning patients who were managed in TIA clinic
      in Toulouse Hospital. The medical data will be compiled with available French and
      International literature. The economic data will be compiled with available data in PMSI and
      health insurance database. This study aims to prepare a multicenter cohort to compare the
      cost effectiveness ratio between ambulatory and conventional management.
