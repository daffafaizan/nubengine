      on outcomes in fresh embryo transfer cycles be ameliorated by co-treatment with aromatase
      inhibitors? The research questions are:

        1. Can the impact of ovarian stimulation on late follicular phase sex steroid levels (and
           hence endometrial receptivity) be mitigated by co-treatment with aromatase inhibitors
           during ovarian stimulation?

        2. Does co-treatment with aromatase inhibitors 'normalize' the endocrinology of the
           midluteal phase
