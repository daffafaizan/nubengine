      patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the antitumor activity of
      this drug in the subpopulation of these patients with measurable disease. III. Evaluate the
      quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this drug in these patients. IV. Evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for
      5 days. Courses repeat every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients with no evidence of PSA decrease by the start of
      course 3 receive no further treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
