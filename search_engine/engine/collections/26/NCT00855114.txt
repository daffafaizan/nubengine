      Primary

        -  Determine whether the administration of everolimus results in a decrease of total
           choline, a surrogate marker of response, in at least 30% of women with resectable breast
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether tumors with activated mTOR signaling, as measured by phosphorylation
           of 4E-BP1 and activity of cap dependent translational complex, will identify those women
           responsive to everolimus.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-7 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 24 hours after completing everolimus, patients
      undergo surgery.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and during surgery for the analysis of mTOR
      targets (i.e., 4E-BP1, p70S6 kinase phosphorylation), Ki67, cleaved caspase 3, and activity
      of cap dependent translational complex by immunohistochemical assays. Patients also undergo
      MRI/MRS before and after everolimus therapy for total choline and glucose levels measurement.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.
