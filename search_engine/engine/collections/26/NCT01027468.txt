      neovascular related macular degeneration meeting recommended criteria for inclusion and
      protocol criteria for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy undergoing intravitreal
      bevacizumab monotherapy were evaluated. Data of treatment-naive eyes (Group 1, n = 114) were
      analyzed separately from eyes that had undergone previous photodynamic therapy plus
      intravitreal triamcinolone (Group 2, n = 67). Re-treatment criteria were based on clinical
      outcome following the official European label regimen. After 1 year of continuous service at
      an academic referral center, follow-up was performed in private practices in collaboration
      with the referral center. Main outcome parameters were best-corrected visual acuity and
      central retinal thickness.
