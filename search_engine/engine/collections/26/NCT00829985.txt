      of the world. Currently, there are no effective ways to prevent the development of nasal
      allergies and asthma, and there are no cures for these diseases. Sublingual immunotherapy
      (SLIT) may help reduce symptoms of allergy and asthma. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of a cockroach extract given sublingually to adults with
      perennial (year-round) nasal allergies, asthma, or both.

      At study entry, participants will receive a dose of placebo and then up to five incremental
      doses of cockroach extract or placebo at 15-minute intervals while observed by the clinical
      research staff. Doses will continue to be given until a sign or symptom occurs that indicates
      the participant is having difficulty tolerating the drug, or until the maximum study dose is
      reached.

      For the next 6 months, participants will take the maximum study dose of cockroach extract or
      placebo daily at home.

      This study will consist of 8 study visits. Skin tests, breathing tests, and blood collection
      will occur at study screening and other visits during the study. At study entry, participants
      will be taught to use an EpiPen in the event of a severe allergic reaction at any time during
      the study. A physical and oral exam, breathing test, and blood collection will occur at study
      entry and all follow-up visits.
