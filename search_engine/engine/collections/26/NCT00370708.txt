      the deliveries nationwide, which is far beyond the acceptable international normal range,
      according to the official site of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic
      Republic of Iran [http://www.mohme.gov.ir/HNDC/Indicators/Simaye_Salamt/Simaye_Salamat.htm].
      This high rate of elective cesarean deliveries might be due to several reasons which are far
      beyond the scope of this study. Here we tried to see whether the reduction in the time of
      hospitalization for these patients is safe at the expense of earlier oral realimentation and
      to see whether this strategy increases the patients' satisfaction or not.
