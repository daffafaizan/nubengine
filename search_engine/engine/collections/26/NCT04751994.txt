      iron drops or b) placebo drops. Infants with significant illness or any clinical syndromes
      that would affect interpretation will be excluded. Low birthweight infants and infants born
      prematurely will not be excluded. Venous blood samples will be collected at enrollment (age 6
      weeks) and after 14 weeks (98 days) of iron/placebo supplementation.

      Participants will be visited daily in their villages by Fieldworkers (FW) to administer the
      iron/placebo dose and will interview mothers to complete a short health questionnaire. The
      iron will be dosed at 75% of WHO guideline dose (ie 1.5mg/kg/day). Weekly, a more detailed
      morbidity and breastfeeding questionnaires will be administered. Infants will be weighed and
      measured monthly, along with a faecal sample being taken.

      During the daily visits, the FWs will record any adverse events (AEs) and ensure the safety
      of participants. If a child is found unwell or if the mother/guardian reports that the child
      is unwell, the study nurse will check on the child and decide on treatment/referral to the
      nearest health centre
