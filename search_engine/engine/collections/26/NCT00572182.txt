    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of MK0752
           administered for 3 consecutive days of every 7 days in 28 day courses to young patients
           with recurrent or refractory CNS malignancies (Dosing regimen 1 - closed to accrual
           2/23/2010).

        -  To estimate the MTD and recommend a phase II dose of MK0752 administered once weekly in
           28 day courses to young patients with recurrent or refractory CNS malignancies (Dosing
           regimen 2).

        -  To compared the MK0752 systemic exposure attained with each dosage level on the
           different dosing regimens.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MK0752.

        -  To document and describe toxicities associated with MK0752.

        -  To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of MK0752 within the confines of a phase
           I setting.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral MK0752 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24 (dosing regimen 1
      - closed to accrual 2/23/2010) or days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (dosing regimen 2). Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Treatment may be extended up to 19 courses if the patient is benefitting from the
      treatment.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
