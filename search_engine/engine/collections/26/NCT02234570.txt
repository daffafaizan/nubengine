    
      This Phase I study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety
      and pharmacokinetics of escalating single oral doses of oxfendazole (0.5 to 60 mg/kg) in
      healthy volunteers. Up to 70 healthy males and females (non-chldbearing potential), ages
      18-45 volunteers recruited from one site will participate in this study. The study duration
      is approximately 18 months with subject participation of 2 weeks. The primary objective
      assess the safety and tolerability of oxfendazole in healthy adults. The secondary objectives
      assess the pharmacokinetic profile of oxfendazole and assess the metabolism of oxfendazole.
      Two sentinel subjects will receive the study product (1 drug/1 placebo) in each group and be
      monitored 48 hours for adverse events prior to completing enrollment of the remaining 8
      subjects in the group.
