      chances of curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the optimal surveillance
      interval for different risk patients is still controversial. The AASLD and EASL-EORTC
      guidelines recommend chronic hepatitis B patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance at a
      time interval of 6 months, but the Japanese HCC guideline recommend the very-high risk
      patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance at a time interval of 3 or 4 months.

      The incidence of HCC is 0.3%-0.8% in the chronic hepatitis B patients and 2%-8% in cirrhotic
      patients, thus recalling a different follow-up strategy for different stage of chronic
      hepatitis B patients. Besides, ultrasound is the admitted surveillance tool for HCC for its
      convenience and cost-effectiveness. However, the sensitivity of ultrasound detecting HCC will
      remarkably decrease because of the influence of ribs, pulmonary and gastrointestinal gas,
      cirrhosis and fatty liver. So it is necessary to incorporate computed tomography (CT) or
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into the follow-up strategy of very high risk patient such
      as patients with cirrhosis or history of HCC.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether different surveillance time intervals and
      surveillance methods are beneficial for chronic hepatitis B and cirrhotic patients with
      different risk of HCC, ultimately establish an all-round and convenient follow-up strategy of
      Chronic Hepatitis B for early detection and diagnosis of HCC.
