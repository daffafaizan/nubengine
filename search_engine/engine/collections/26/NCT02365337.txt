      factor for pregnancy rates in women undergoing COH cycles and also are displaying different
      and inconclusive results. This dedicated negative affects may be mediated through endometrial
      and/or ovarial factors. In experimental animal models Vitamin D receptors have been found in
      endometrium and ovaries and deficient levels might have been a cause of impaired
      folliculogenesis. In one of human study Vitamin D has been suggested as a positive regulator
      of anti- Mullerian hormone (AMH) production. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the affects of
      Vitamin D on folliculogenesis, oogenesis and embryo quality in COH cycles by using time lapse
      monitoring.
