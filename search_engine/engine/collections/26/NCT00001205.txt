      patients with cysticercosis, while allowing for sample collection to improve diagnostic
      assays and explore host-parasite interactions. Cysticercosis is defined as an infection with
      the larval form of Taenia solium and includes infection of the brain (neurocysticercosis
      [NCC]) that accounts for most of the symptomatic disease and serious complications.
      Evaluation and treatment follows accepted clinical practice and information learned is
      observational. Two drugs, praziquantel and albendazole, have been used extensively in the
      treatment of cysticercosis and are the accepted therapies. Albendazole is approved for the
      treatment of cysticercosis while praziquantel is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration but has proven efficacy and safety, and combined therapy is now standard of
      care to treat NCC. To decrease the treatment-provoked inflammation systemic corticosteroids
      and/or other immunosuppressive agents will be used. Anti-seizure medications are also
      commonly used.
