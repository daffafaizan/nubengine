      determined using locally validated methodologies from a newly obtained tumor sample
      (preferred) or the most recent archival tumor sample available. Based on the molecular
      alterations of the tumor, subjects were assigned to one of the treatment arms. Subjects with
      multiple molecular alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the relevant
      pathways were excluded, except under the conditions described in Inclusion criteria.

      The treatment period began on Cycle 1 Day 1 and continued in 28-day cycles until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death or the subject
      transferred to another Novartis study that could continue to provide the study drug.

      All subjects were required to be followed up for 30 days for safety after receiving the last
      dose of study treatment. Subjects who discontinued study treatment for any reason other than
      disease progression were followed up for progression of disease. All subjects were required
      to be followed for survival. For subjects transferred to another Novartis study, an end of
      treatment visit (EOT) was required to be performed and the subject would not enter the
      follow-up period.
