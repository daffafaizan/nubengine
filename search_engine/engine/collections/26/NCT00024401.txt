      disease progression in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
      DHA-paclitaxel. II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III.
      Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Assess the quality of life
      of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DHA-paclitaxel IV over 2 hours on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses, and at end of study
      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
