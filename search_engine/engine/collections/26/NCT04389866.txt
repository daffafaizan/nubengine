      jawline.

      JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC will be injected in each of 16 women with sagging of grades 1-3 using a
      published jawline evaluation scale.

      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups:

      Patient Group 1: JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected
      into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular area) (the latter area will be
      added if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl attenuation)

      Patient Group 2: JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-3 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected
      into the lateral cheek (zygomatic) area plus JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe
      is 1 cc) will be injected into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular
      area) (the latter area will be added if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl
      attenuation)

      High-resolution photographs from multiple angles will be taken in identical lighting and
      position with the VISIA CR and with the Fotofinder at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Additional
      real-time video telemedicine visits will take place at 6 months and 12 months. In addition, a
      72-hour safety phone call will be completed with the subject after each injection session.
      All visit timing will be based on the last injection session. 2 blinded dermatologists will
      rate the patient's severity of jowling based on the Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) (1) at the 2-
      and 4-week visits. The patient will also rate their jowling based on the JRS as well as their
      satisfaction with the procedure.
