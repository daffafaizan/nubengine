      However, many clinicians miss opportunities to provide this counseling due to a lack of
      processes in place to provide this counseling and access to evidence based care once the need
      is identified. The purpose of this study is to build upon baseline data collected on
      pregnancy intention and receipt of contraceptive and preconception counseling. Half of the
      study practices will be randomly selected to receive comprehensive One Key QuestionÂ® Training
      through the nonprofit Power To Decide. These practices have already displayed interest in
      taking part in this intervention.The training will act as our intervention, and will be given
      to help improve the quality of preconception and contraceptive counseling in Primary Care and
      Obstetrics/Gynecology. All of the participating practices will then be surveyed again to
      determine changes in contraception and preconception counseling. After patient data
      collection is complete, a research assistant will return to each practice to collect surveys
      from clinicians and staff (this includes: physicians, nurses, medical assistants, patient
      support associates, or anyone that participated in the OKQ training) at the intervention
      practices to assess the experience of implementing OKQ and their perceptions of its utility
      for patients. Following the Phase II collection of surveys, the remaining control practices
      will be given the option to receive Power To Decide training.
