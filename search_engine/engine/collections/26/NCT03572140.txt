      worldwide .Mortality related to HCV infection has been estimated at approximately 300,000
      deaths per year..

      Direct antiviral agents (DAAs) effectively eradicate HCV and rapidly improve residual liver
      functions. Current HCV eradication rates have exceeded 90% in a very short time .

      Hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (GT4) is genetically diverse, with 17 confirmed subtypes, and
      comprises approximately 13% of infections worldwide [3]. In Egypt, GT4 accounts for
      approximately 90% of infections, with subtype 4a predominating .

      Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir are generally well tolerated with only a few adverse effects
      reported.

      Hepatitis C virus resistant associated variants (RAVs) are seen in most patients who do not
      achieve sustained virological response (SVR). These resistance-associated mutations depend on
      the class of direct-acting antiviral drugs used and also vary between hepatitis C virus
      genotypes and subtypes.

      Donaldson et al performed an analysis on four phase III clinical trials in search of common
      RAVs against sofosbuvir, discovering L159F, C316N, and V321A were associated with virological
      failure. Interestingly, this study also verified S282R mutation as associating with failure.

      NS5A RAVs can be very common, with Y93H detected in up to 15% of the population and L31M in
      up to 6.3%. Other RAVs tend to also be fairly common detected in approximately 0.3%-3.5% of
      the population
