      fewer muscles at the front of the hip so the surgeon works between them rather than cutting
      through muscle fibers. However, the anterior approach is more difficult to access so usually
      requires a specialized table.

      The posterior approach is easier to access, but the incision cuts through muscle fiber. This
      may lengthen recovery time. However, a specialized table, which can be quite expensive, is
      often not required.
