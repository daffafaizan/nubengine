      factors for quinolone resistance in bloodstream isolates of Klebsiella species. Additionally,
      the adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy for Klebsiella bloodstream infections will be
      assessed. This research is important because identification of risk factors may allow earlier
      initiation of appropriate therapy in patients infected with these bacteria. Additionally, we
      will identify whether horizontal spread is responsible for this increasing trend.
