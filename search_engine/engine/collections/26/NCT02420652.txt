      I. To determine the effect of metformin (metformin hydrochloride) and aspirin on the change
      in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in men with rising PSA after definitive
      therapy for localized prostate cancer and stable disease during a run-in period with the
      study regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of administering metformin and aspirin.

      II. To determine the effect of metformin and aspirin on PSA levels and the serum
      obesity-related prostate cancer (PCa) biomarkers (insulin, insulin-like growth factor
      [IGF]-1, interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha).

      OUTLINE:

      RUN-IN STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and
      aspirin PO once daily (QD) for 4 months. Patients with disease progression (PSA increase of >
      50% and minimum of 2ng/ml rise in PSA) come off study. Patients achieving disease response
      (>25% decline in PSA) continue to receive study agents in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable disease. Patients with stable disease continue on to the randomized study
      regimen.

      RANDOMIZATION STAGE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride PO BID and aspirin PO QD for 6 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride placebo PO BID and aspirin placebo PO QD for
      6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12-16 weeks for 1 year.
