      tertiary referral breast unit -Ain Shams University hospitals with non metastatic breast
      cancer during the period from September 2012 to September 2013. All of them signed an
      informed consent to share in this study that was approved in the ethical committee held on
      April 2012 - Ain Shams University. Our patients were divided into 2 equal groups: group A
      (35patients) who underwent standard quadrantectomy, group B (35 patients) who underwent
      oncoplastic surgery. In group A all quadrantectomies were done by general breast surgeons
      while in group B the oncoplastic procedures were done by well trained oncoplastic breast
      surgeons not assisted by plastic surgeons. The following data were reported in all cases
      including: age, family history, tumor size, volume and weight of the specimen, location of
      tumor, margin length, (primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis) staging, molecular subtype
      and patient satisfaction.
