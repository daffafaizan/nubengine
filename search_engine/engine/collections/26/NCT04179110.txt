    
      This is a phase II, non-randomized single center study designed to evaluate response and
      survival of treatment with the combination of pembrolizumab and ramucirumab in patients with
      progressive metastatic TCC after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

      The primary and secondary objectives are as follows:

      Primary:

        -  Objective: To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) in patients treated with
           pembrolizumab and ramucirumab

        -  Hypothesis: The ORR will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published
           literature of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Objective: To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with
           pembrolizumab and ramucirumab

        -  Hypothesis: The PFS will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published
           literature of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone

        -  Objective: To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients treated with pembrolizumab and
           ramucirumab

        -  Hypothesis: The OS will be ≥15% greater than the historical rate in published literature
           of patients treated with pembrolizumab alone

        -  Objective: To evaluate differences in ORR, PFS and OS in patients treated with
           pembrolizumab and ramucirumab stratified by Bellmunt criteria.

        -  Hypothesis: Patients with high Bellmunt criteria scores will have lower rates of ORR,
           PFS and OS.
