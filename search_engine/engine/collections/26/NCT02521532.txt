      and decrease systemic blood pressure in multiple populations, including COPD. The chronic
      effect of dietary nitrate in OSAS has not been reported.

      The investigators hypothesize that chronic nitrate consumption might increase exercise
      tolerance, and exhaled NO but decrease blood pressure and have little impact on quality of
      life and pulmonary function.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial. At baseline,
      mid-point and endpoint exercise tolerance, pulmonary function, quality of life and ambulatory
      blood pressure will be assessed in conjunction with demographics and blood draw. After
      baseline measures, each subject will be randomized to consume nitrate rich beetroot juice for
      14 consecutive nights when assessments will be repeated followed by 14 nights of placebo and
      endpoint assessments or the converse.
