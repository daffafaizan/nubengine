      maternal HIV testing with existing routine immunization services in rural health facilities
      in Southern Zambia with the aim of determining whether infant and postpartum maternal HIV
      testing rates would increase without harming immunization uptake. The evaluation randomized
      60 health facilities to one of three study arms: 1) Control (status quo); 2) Simple
      Intervention; and 3) Comprehensive Intervention. The Simple Intervention included restocking
      of HIV test kits and reminding health facilities of existing HIV testing guidelines by
      government health officials. The Comprehensive Intervention included the Simple Intervention
      components, as well as community sensitization, hands-on operational support to integrate
      services and improve patient flow, and opt-out HIV testing for mothers and infants according
      to existing guidelines. The change in the average number of monthly HIV tests and
      immunizations (DPT1) between the intervention period and baseline were compared between
      treatment and control facilities.
