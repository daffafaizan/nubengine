    
      This is a feasibility study of an artificial pancreas (AP) system with our previously
      validated target eMPC and HMS algorithms, with the addition of a trust index of the predicted
      glucose value integrated into the portable Artificial Pancreas System (pAPS). The system will
      be evaluated on up to 20 subjects, with the goal of 10 subjects completing a 48-hour
      closed-loop session at one clinical site (William Sansum Diabetes Center). During the session
      subjects will bolus for all meals and snacks and perform a 45-minute walking session.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to establish that closed-loop insulin delivery with a
      target enchanted model predictive control (eMPC)/Health Monitoring System (HMS) algorithms
      with a trust index of the predicted glucose value is safe and effective, to analyze and learn
      to improve upon the accuracy of the predicted glucose values, and to collect efficacy data to
      inform a future larger study.
