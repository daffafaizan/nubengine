    
      The NEEDED observational study was designed to be performed in two phases:

      Phase 1 (NEEDED 2013) was a pilot study targeting 100 subjects to test the logistics and
      identify the optimal blood sampling time points following the race. A total of 97 subjects
      completed the pilot phase in June 2013.

      Phase 2 (NEEDED 2014) aim to recruit another 1000 subjects from the participants of the race
      in June 2014.

      The study populations will be followed for cardiovascular events for up to 20 years following
      the baseline blood samples.

      The results from the two phases will be pooled for the main statistical analyses.
