      than 50% from 2008 to 2015 among US adolescents. Paralleling the rise in MDD, suicide is now
      the 2nd leading cause of adolescent deaths. Despite the US Preventive Services Task Force
      (USPSTF) 2009 endorsement of universal screening for adolescent MDD in primary care, MDD
      screening occurs in less than 2% of office visits.

      The primary goal of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of universal versus
      targeted adolescent MDD screening in a school setting. Universal screening was chosen to be
      conducted in schools because, compared to medical settings; schools are more likely to
      regularly engage with adolescents.

      The hypothesis is that universal school-based screening with the validated Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ) will result in increased rates of MDD screening, identification and
      treatment engagement. The Penn State team brings a breadth of experience in pediatrics,
      community-engaged research, adolescent health, psychiatry and engagement with minority
      populations.
