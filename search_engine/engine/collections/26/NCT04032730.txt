      living with HIV (1). Globally, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and
      extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the most drug-resistant forms of TB, has
      approximately doubled over the past fifteen years (1-3). Nowhere has this increased incidence
      generated more concern than in South Africa where interactions between TB and generalized HIV
      epidemics are causing 'explosive' TB incidence (4-6) and case-fatality are threatening to
      undermine the progress reached with antiretroviral therapy (ART) (7, 8).

      Medication adherence, a key predictor of outcomes in M/XDR-TB and HIV treatment, is
      understudied in high burden TB-HIV settings (9-11). Patient losses during transitions in the
      care continuum are frequent (12), increase mortality and limit control of the linked
      epidemics. Demands of M/XDR-TB HIV treatment are severe including extraordinary pill burden,
      severe adverse effects, lengthy treatment, isolation and stigma with few parallels in modern
      medicine (13-15).
