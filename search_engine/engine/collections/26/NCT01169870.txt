    
      This is a prospective, two-armed, parallel group, randomized phase II study for the
      evaluation of Genexol-PM and paclitaxel. Up to 42 eligible patients will be enrolled in each
      treatment arm (a total of 84) according to the trial design. Patients will be randomly
      allocated to arm A (Genexol-PM) or arm B (Paclitaxel). They will be stratified by ER
      status(positive v negative), performance(ECOG 0 or 1 v 2), and prior adjuvant taxane (no v
      yes) The treatment will be continued up to 6 cycles, or will be discontinued before 6th cycle
      iin case of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. After
      discontinuation of study therapy, patients will proceed to the post-therapy follow-up phase
      of the study.

      Patients may be enrolled in the study if they have documented measurable disease. Response
      will be documented by physical examination prior to each treatment cycle and a CT scan every
      two cycles or if disease progression is suspected. Responses will be assessed
      unidimensionally according to the RECIST. All partial or complete responses require
      confirmation with a second evaluation at least 4 weeks following the first documentation of
      response.

      All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated before each cycle using the NCI
      CTC (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) version 3.0 scale. For peripheral
      neuropathy, the scale in Table 4 will be used to determine dose adjustments. Life-threatening
      toxicities should be reported immediately to the Study Chairman.
