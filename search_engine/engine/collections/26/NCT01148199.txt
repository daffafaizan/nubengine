      randomization to temporary placement of fully covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) or
      multiple plastic stents placement were randomized according to a computer generated
      randomization sequence and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups.

      Final success will be defined as clinical resolution of the stricture without the need to
      repeat endoscopic, percutaneous or surgical treatment.
