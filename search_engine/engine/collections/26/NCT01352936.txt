      list extracted from the medical management system of Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang
      Hospital. Hospitalized patients who had been prescribed either vancomycin or teicoplanin for
      treating bloodstream infection caused by MRSA and had at least one serum creatinine data
      within 7 days after initiating glycopeptide therapy were recruited for this study. The major
      outcome variables of interest were the new onset of nephrotoxicity, which was defined as
      decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for more than 25% or 50% from baseline based on
      serial serum creatinine (SCr) measurements. Other variables including age at admission,
      gender, comorbidities, laboratory data, concurrent medications (e.g., drug name, dose, route,
      dosing interval, starting date and end date), and medical cost information were also obtained
      from the database.

      We performed this observational clinical study with 2 main goals: (1) to determine the rate
      of nephrotoxicity and mortality in patients with MRSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin or
      teicoplanin; (2) to determine whether vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity increase length of
      stay and costs.
