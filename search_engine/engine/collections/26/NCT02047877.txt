    
      This study is designed to measure the concentration and describe the distribution of cytokine
      IL-10 and IL-12p70 in a previously healthy pediatric population suffering direct lung injury
      by an infectious etiology, not yet described in the literature.

      In addition, this study seeks to determine whether tracheal aspirates (TA) obtained in early
      acute respiratory failure can be substituted for distal airway aspirates, obtained by
      non-bronchoscopic broncho-alevolar lavage (nb-BAL), for the purposes of investigating markers
      of inflammation. We will compare the ratio of IL-10 to IL-12p70 at each time point measured
      in tracheal secretion, bronchial secretion, and blood to assess for sample equivalence.

      Finally, this study will affirm the safety profile for repeated nb-BAL, establish a protocol
      for respiratory sample collection and storage for future larger scale studies, and generate
      feasibility data regarding consent rate, estimates of data completion, and fraction of
      missing data for us to determine whether a future study involving the ratio of IL-10 to
      IL-12p70 can be used as a predictor of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in this
      population.

      The data generated by this study regarding safety, comparison of nb-BAL and TA, and cytokine
      concentrations will be used as preliminary data informing the design of a larger multicenter
      study testing the hypothesis that IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels in airway secretions can predict
      risk for ARDS in this population. This may be approached via application to the Pediatric
      Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis (PALISI) clinical research network group.
