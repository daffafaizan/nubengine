      role in treating hyponatremia and the signs and symptoms of water retention associated with
      HF, LCWA, and SIADH. Lixivaptan was previously evaluated in disease states characterized by
      hyponatremia with euvolemia (SIADH) and hyponatremia combined with fluid overload (HF, LCWA).
      Lixivaptan demonstrated correction in serum sodium concentration together with marked
      aquaresis in subjects with hyponatremia.
