      asthmatic patients, who had at least one year regular follow-up in our respiratory clinic,
      and were not receiving any vitamin D supplementation.

      In the second phase patients with vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D values below 20 ng/ml), were
      recruited in a one year longitudinal study, during which they received vitamin D
      supplementation. The study started and ended in late autumn-winter season when, at our
      latitude, sun exposure is lowest. Symptoms, spirometry and number of exacerbations were
      recorded during both study phases.
