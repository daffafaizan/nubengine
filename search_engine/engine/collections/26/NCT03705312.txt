      risk of death and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) and leads to progressive
      remodelling of an already damaged left ventricle. Medical therapies and cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) have demonstrated favourable effects on LV remodelling in
      heart failure patients.

      Given the benefits and safety of transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip device
      in severe MR, it is conceivable that this technology could also be safely used in those with
      moderate MR to reduce mitral regurgitation, improve symptoms and result in LV remodelling. At
      present, the optimal treatment strategy for heart failure patients and moderate (2+, 2-3+)
      mitral regurgitation is uncertain therefore the EVOLVE-MR study proposes to evaluate
      transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip in such patients to study the effects on
      LV remodelling and functional capacity.

      EVOLVE-MR is a randomized study of MitraClip and medical therapy in symptomatic heart failure
      patients with moderate (2+, 2-3+) secondary mitral regurgitation. The objective of this study
      is to determine the impact of both therapies on left ventricular remodelling and functional
      capacity of the target patient population.
