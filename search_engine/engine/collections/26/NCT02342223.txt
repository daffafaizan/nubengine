      Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) because it affects the quality-of-life and adherence to
      medication regimen. Treatment of HIV facial lipoatrophy helps to improve patient wellness by
      removing the social stigma associated with HIV facial lipoatrophy. Currently, there are few
      medical therapies that can treat HIV facial lipoatrophy and are FDA-approved for this
      indication. Juv√©derm Voluma (Allergan) may benefit patients on HAART because it may provide a
      more immediate aesthetic enhancement and potentially has fewer adverse effects, which results
      in a more natural appearing facial enhancement outcome. Voluma is the only agent that is
      FDA-approved for facial volume loss. We anticipate Voluma having less adverse effects than
      current FDA-approved drugs for HIV lipoatrophy as Voluma is a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based
      agent. The benefit of using hyaluronidase to "correct" or "modify" facial HA-based volume
      therapy is also a benefit for HIV patients, which currently does not exist as a
      post-injection modification option for other FDA-approved filling agents used to treat
      patients with HIV facial lipoatrophy. Voluma is currently FDA-approved for correction of
      age-related volume loss in the midface, and there's no alteration in the chemical or
      biophysical properties of Voluma that is being used in our proposed study. In addition to
      conventional injection techniques, we will implement the 'smile and fill' technique pioneered
      by our clinical research group to achieve better mid-face aesthetic outcomes.
