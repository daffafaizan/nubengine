      Arizona and the University of Vermont. The primary outcome of interest will be the percent of
      participants achieving a 5% weight loss, which is the amount of weight loss that prior
      studies suggest is required to improve asthma control.

      This will be a single arm-phase II futility trial; the "futility" to be assessed is the
      ability to produce weight loss. Such designs are widely used in efficiently informing
      decisions to proceed to Phase III clinical trials. This trial design is appropriate when the
      effect of the placebo arm can reasonably be estimated (weight loss is likely to be close to
      0), and the toxicity of the treatment is minimal (no toxicity is anticipated related to
      weight loss). This is a 6-month study of 40 participants (20 at each site). All participants
      will be assigned to the weight loss intervention, which is described in detail below
