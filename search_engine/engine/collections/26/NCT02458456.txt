      exercise for lowering blood pressure. A randomised controlled study will be conducted with
      participants who are either pre-hypertensive, blood pressure between 120/80 and 140/90, or on
      medication to control their blood pressure. Previous studies have utilised a sedentary
      control so we intend to use a sham group to determine if it can be used as a working control
      for future studies.
