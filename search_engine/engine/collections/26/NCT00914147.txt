      Primary

        -  To obtain the distribution of DLCO, FVC, and FEV_1 by pulmonary function testing (PFT)
           in patients with heavily pretreated locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors referred
           to the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) Phase I Clinical Trials Program.

        -  To estimate the mean DLCO to within 4 units (% of predicted) of the true mean with 95%
           confidence.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the percentage of patients who meet the defined eligibility criteria
           (including PFT levels, especially DLCO) from the entire population enrolled in the KCI
           Phase I Clinical Trials Program.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo pulmonary function testing comprising spirometry test, lung
      volumes, and DLCO measurement utilizing the single-breath breath-holding technique. Patients
      then proceed to treatment on a phase I clinical trial.
