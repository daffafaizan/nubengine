      Specific Aim 1. Characterize (A) the differences in pain sensitivity between incident cases
      and controls at low back pain onset and (B) changes in pain sensitivity over time in incident
      cases.

      H1.A Incident cases will have increased pain sensitivity compared with controls at low back
      pain onset.

      H1.B Incident cases will have increased pain sensitivity over time.

      Specific Aim 2. Compare (A) genetic polymorphisms at low back pain onset between incident
      cases and controls and mRNA expression of candidate genes at LBP onset and at 6 weeks between
      incident cases and controls; and (B) differential expression levels of candidate genes over
      time in incident cases.

      H2.A Incident cases will have a higher frequency of polymorphisms and differential expression
      levels of candidate genes at low back pain onset compared with controls.

      H2.B Examine expression levels of candidate genes over time in incident cases.

      Specific Aim 3. Determine the contribution of enhanced pain sensitivity, cofactors
      (clinical/psychosocial/environmental), genetic polymorphisms, and mRNA expression of
      candidate genes on the risk of persistent low back pain.
