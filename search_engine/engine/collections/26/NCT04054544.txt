      intestinal gluten specific CD4+ T cell subsets in participants with celiac disease (CeD).
      Participants will receive 8 grams (g) of gluten daily for 13 consecutive days. Blood samples
      will be taken at pre-dose, Day 6, and Day 14. Duodenal biopsy samples will also be collected
      on Day 14. Participants will also complete a symptom diary.
