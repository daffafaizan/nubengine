      drugs are effective against a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drugs are
      being studied.

      The FDA has not approved abemaciclib or letrozole for ER+ endometrial cancer, but both drugs
      have been approved for other uses.

      Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop cancer
      cell growth. Letrozole is a hormonal therapy that works by lowering the production of
      estrogen in the body. Estrogen may help to stimulate cancer cells to grow, so lowering the
      levels of estrogen in the body may work to slow cancer cell growth. In this research study,
      the investigators are hoping to learn whether the combination of abemaciclib and letrozole is
      effective at slowing or stopping endometrial cancer cell growth.
