    
      OPTIMAL-REPERFUSION is an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, randomized,
      open-label, superiority trial with blinded evaluation of outcomes. A total of 632 STEMI
      patients presenting within 6 hours after symptom onset and with an expected time of medical
      contact to percutaneous coronary intervention â‰¥120 min will be randomized to a reduced-dose
      facilitated PCI strategy (reduced-dose fibrinolysis combined with simultaneous transfer for
      immediate invasive therapy with a time interval between fibrinolysis to PCI < 3 hours) or to
      pharmacoinvasive treatment. The primary endpoint is the composite of death, reinfarction,
      refractory ischemia, congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock at 30-days.
