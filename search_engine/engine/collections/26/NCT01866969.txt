      I. Identify patient and caregiver factors associated with increased caregiver burden and
      decreased quality of life in caregivers of older adults with cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine characteristics of informal caregivers of older adults with cancer admitted to
      hospital.

      II. Determine type and amount of care informal caregivers provide for older adults with
      cancer admitted to hospital.

      III. Determine quality of life in informal caregivers of older adults with cancer admitted to
      hospital.

      IV. Identify caregiver needs, both informational and resource related. V. Explore the
      association between re-admission to the hospital within 30 days and caregiver burden.

      VI. Explore whether feedback of information attained from the assessment of the caregiver
      influences services implemented by the health care team.

      VII. Determine reasons for non-participation.

      OUTLINE:

      Caregivers complete a questionnaire about their sociodemographics, physical health, social
      supports, social activity, mental health and caregiver burden. They will also provide an
      assessment of the person they care for.
