      is challenging. Thus, it is essential to monitor temperature in order to be able to take
      measures to avoid the appearance of hypothermia. Once the temperature has decreased, its
      treatment is difficult since the application of heat to the body surface takes a long time to
      reach the core thermal compartment. Intraoperative warming alone cannot avoid postoperative
      hypothermia. The application of forced-air warming system during the preoperative period has
      been shown to be the most effective measure to prevent hypothermia and maintain
      intraoperative normothermia. However, it would not be efficient to provide a long-time
      prewarming in short-term surgical procedures. Thus, the ideal warming time prior to the
      induction of anesthesia has long been investigated. Due to the searching of optimal
      prewarming time and the lack of evidence about the efficiency of prewarming in patients
      submitted to transurethral resection, the conductance of this clinical trial is justified.
