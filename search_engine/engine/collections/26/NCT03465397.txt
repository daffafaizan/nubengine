      groups, and without masking.

      This is a prospective intervention study in which two strategies for determining
      immunosuppressive treatment in kidney transplant patients from a live donor with low
      immunological risk are compared according to solid phase antibody detection techniques (cPRA
      0% and isolated negative antigen) and crossmatch by negative cytotoxicity. Patients are
      randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive one of two immunosuppressive treatment strategies.
