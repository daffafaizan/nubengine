      patients with recurrent or extensive stage small cell lung cancer previously treated with
      chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation (in individual patients) study. Patients receive dose
      escalated lepirudin subcutaneously once or twice a day for 3-4 days. Dose escalation
      continues in each patient until aPTT prolongation occurs or the maximum dose level is
      reached. The patient then continues treatment on the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
