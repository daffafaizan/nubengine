      for people living with HIV (PLWH) who smoke tobacco. It is a resource that is ready for
      clinical use, but its feasibility and efficacy have yet to be studied. Main study goals are
      (1) to evaluate the website's feasibility (i.e., recruitment, adherence, retention, and
      satisfaction) in a cohort of 69 PLWH smokers, and (2) to complete a prospective, randomized
      controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the online program to standard care (total N =
      138) with a primary outcome of 3 month point-prevalence abstinence.
