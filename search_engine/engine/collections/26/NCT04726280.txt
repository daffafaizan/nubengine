      interscalene brachial plexus block is associated with a lower incidence of diaphragmatic
      hemiparalysis after an arthroscopic surgery of the shoulder, without any reduction of the
      analgesic efficacy.

      Our prospective randomized controlled trial will include two parallel groups: a group will
      receive a volume of 20 mls of ropivacaine 0.75%, while the other group will receive a volume
      of 10 mls.

      All participants will have a preoperative ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus with
      an extrafascial injection of 10 or 20 mls of ropivacaine 0.75%. In both groups, participants
      will have an examination of the hemidiaphgragm with the ultrasound, before and 30 min after
      the block. The respiratory function will also be assessed with a bedside spirometer before
      and after the block, and at 12 and 24 postoperative hours. During surgery all participants
      will receive multimodal analgesia inclusive of iv dexamethasone 8 mg, iv magnesium sulfate 40
      milligram kg^2, iv ketorolac 30 milligrams, and iv acetaminophen 1000 milligrams, according
      to the current practice in our institution. In the postoperative period, Participants will be
      prescribed an IV pca of morphine.

      Assignment to one of these two groups will be done according to a computer-generated list of
      random numbers, and the sealed envelopes method will be used.
