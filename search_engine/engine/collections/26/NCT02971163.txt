      Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) has a 61-bed adult Emergency Department with a volume of over
      100,000 patient visits/year or approximately 300 visits/day. MSH is a large academic tertiary
      care medical center located in East Harlem and serves a large black and Hispanic community.

      Projected Recruitment: There are approximately 60 MSH ED visits for syncope per month of
      which 35 per month are by patients above age 30. Roughly half of these do not have a clear
      etiology of their syncope discovered in the ED. The researchers project that of the 17
      potentially eligible patients per month, three will be successfully enrolled for a projected
      72 patient enrollees at the completion of the 24-month recruitment period. The PI, clinical
      research coordinators, and SRAs will monitor the real-time electronic tracking system for all
      ED patients and will identify any patient over age 30 with a chief complaint of syncope or
      loss of consciousness.
