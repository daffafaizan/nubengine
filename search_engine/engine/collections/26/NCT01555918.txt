      Part 1: On Day 1, Period 1, subjects will receive a single dose of isavuconazole orally or
      intravenously according to the treatment sequence allocation. Subjects will remain resident
      in the unit in order to collect blood for pharmacokinetics (PK) and to assess the safety
      tests. They will be released in the morning of Day 15 after collection of blood for safety
      tests. Subjects will have a washout period of 2 weeks returning to the unit for Day -1 of
      Period 2 (Day 29). Subjects will receive a single dose of isavuconazole orally or
      intravenously (opposite mode of administration from Period 1). Subjects will remain resident
      in the unit and will be released in the morning of Day 15, Period 2 (Day 44) after collection
      of blood for tests.

      Part 2: Subjects will be allocated to multiple intravenous (IV) (Group 1) or oral (Group 2)
      dosing. On Day 1, Group 1 will receive multiple intravenous (IV) dosing of isavuconazole as a
      2-hour infusion, three times a day (TID) with 8 hours between doses for 2 days followed by
      isavuconazole as a 2-hour infusion every day (QD) for 10 days. Group 2 will receive multiple
      oral (PO) dosing of isavuconazole TID with 8 hours between doses for 2 days followed by
      isavuconazole PO QD for 10 days. Subjects in Group 1 and 2 will remain resident in the unit
      in order to collect blood and urine for PK evaluations and to assess the safety tests. They
      will be released in the morning of Day 26 after collection of blood for tests.
