           device will be compared with those obtained by the reference devices used by the
           hospital on daily or periodic monitoring (the devices will be identified by name and
           version at the final report).

        2. Eligible real time color signal obtained by the TensorTip during the measurement shall
           be recorded simultaneously with the measurements obtained by the reference devices (as
           described in the above point).
