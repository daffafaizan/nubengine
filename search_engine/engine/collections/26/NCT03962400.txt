      be percent of time within a specific INR range. Subjects will be randomized to to control and
      treatment groups and stratified 1:1 based on sex. The control group will have warfarin doses
      adjusted by experts in the treatment of patients with warfarin. The treatment group will have
      warfarin doses determined using a clinical support tool based on reinforcement learning.
      Based on simulations of the experimental design with an expectation that the percent of INR
      values within the target range increase by 20%, 70 subjects per group are required for
      statistical significance. Based on an attrition rate of 15%, the investigators will enroll 80
      subjects per group. Statistical analysis will compare the percent of patients within the
      target INR range between groups as the primary outcome with number of adverse events between
      groups as the safetly outcome.
