      Questionnaire (AIHQ) developed by Combs (2007) will be used. The participants will be asked
      to read 15 vignettes, to imagine the scenario happening to her or him (e.g., ''You walk past
      a bunch of teenagers at a mall and you hear them start to laugh''), and to write down the
      reason why the other person (or persons) acted that way toward you. Two independent raters
      will subsequently code this written response for the purpose of computing a ''hostility
      index'' (described below). The participant will then rate, on Likert scales, whether the
      other person (or persons) performed the action on purpose (1 ''definitely no'' to 6
      ''definitely yes''), how angry it would make them feel (1 ''not at all angry'' to 5 ''very
      angry''), and how much they would blame the other person (or persons) (1 ''not at all'' to 5
      ''very much''). Finally, the participant will be asked to write down how she or he would
      respond to the situation, which will be later coded by two independent raters to compute an
      ''aggression index'' (described in Combs, 2007).

      Socio-demographic data, subsyndromic symptoms of depression and anxiety, paranoia symptoms
      and cognitive functions will also be assessed to explore the confounding factors.
