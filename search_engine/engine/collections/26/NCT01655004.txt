    
      This is a prospective non-randomised open-label study of exemestane in post-menopausal,
      hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer patients, with pre-specified analysis of
      exemestane pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics according to UGT2B17 genotype (UGT2B17*2/*2
      versus those with at least one wild-type allele). A total of 110 patients will be enrolled
      over a period of 30 months. Eligible patients will receive exemestane 25mg daily orally (as
      part of standard care) until progression of disease or intolerable toxicities. At the time of
      study entry, blood samples will be drawn for genotyping studies (for research purposes) but
      investigators will be blinded to the results. Pharmacokinetic sampling for exemestane and its
      metabolites will be performed at baseline and on day 29 (+/- 3 days) before dosing and 0.5,
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after exemestane ingestion. Patients will be evaluated on an
      8-weekly basis for toxicities and efficacy assessments during the first 6 months of
      treatment, followed by 12-weekly thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicities, or patient withdrawal.
