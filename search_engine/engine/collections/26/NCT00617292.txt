    
      CAH is a genetic steroidogenesis disorder. The most common form, 21OHD, leads to cortisol
      deficiency and, in turn, an excess of androgen, a hormone that promotes the development and
      maintenance of male sex characteristics. As a result of this androgen excess, prepubescent
      males and newborn, prepubescent, and grown females exhibit mature masculine characteristics.
      Prenatal treatment with dexamethasone, a corticosteroid that decreases androgen levels, has
      been shown to prevent the development of abnormal genitalia in female infants. The long-term
      effects of this treatment, however, have not been evaluated. This study will determine
      whether prenatal dexamethasone treatment causes any long-term side effects by examining
      children and young adults who received dexamethasone as fetuses and their mothers, who were
      exposed to dexamethasone while pregnant.

      This study has three parts. In Part 1 of the study, participants will provide written consent
      for release of their medical records from their physicians. Participants' physicians will
      then complete a medical form and/or provide copies of selected medical records for each
      participant. Parts 2 and 3 can be completed in 1 day. In Part 2 of the study, participants
      will complete questionnaires in their homes. Participants will answer questions about the
      following experiences: medical procedures, such as hormone treatment and genital surgery;
      education; work; hobbies; play activities and chores during childhood; identification with
      the male or female gender; relationships with parents; interest in being a parent; and
      overall adjustment. Part 3 of the study will consist of neuropsychological testing at the
      study site. This testing will focus on memory, attention, and overall cognitive abilities.
