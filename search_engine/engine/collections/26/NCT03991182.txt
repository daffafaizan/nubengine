      mixed-methods process evaluation to understand the impact of parenting groups on child
      development outcomes when delivered at scale. The specific objectives are to: 1) assess the
      impact of the intervention on early childhood development outcomes; 2) assess the degree to
      which the intervention was implemented according to the project plan and to document
      adjustments made during the course of the project; 3) describe and document the perceptions
      of caregivers on parent groups, as well as any behavioral changes in parenting or in mother
      support networks resulting from participating in parenting groups; and approaches to
      achieving caregiving gender equality at household level; and, 4) generate a set of
      recommendations for the Government of the Republic of Zambia to further adapt and/or scale up
      community parenting groups based on the summative findings from this study.

      For the impact evaluation the investigators will collect data from two main sources: 1)
      Household Surveys and 2) In-depth interviews at both baseline and endline data collection. In
      addition, at endline we will assess child development using the Bayley Scales for Infant and
      Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III).

      For the process evaluation, the investigators will conduct record review of parenting groups
      attendance registers and SMAG log books. The investigators will conduct in-depth interviews
      with health systems staff (province, district and health facility), SMAGs, and head women
      from all intervention sites, and focus group discussions with caregivers who meet the study
      eligibility criteria in both intervention and control zones.
