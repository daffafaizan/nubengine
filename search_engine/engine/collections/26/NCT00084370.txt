      Primary

        -  Compare histologic and molecular alterations in tissue biomarkers of patients at high
           risk for ovarian cancer treated with celecoxib followed by prophylactic oophorectomy vs
           prophylactic oophorectomy only.

      Secondary

        -  Compare alterations in gene expression pattern in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 months and then undergo
           prophylactic oophorectomy.

        -  Group II: Patients undergo immediate prophylactic oophorectomy.
