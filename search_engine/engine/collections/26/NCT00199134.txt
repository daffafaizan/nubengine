      adjuvant and metastatic setting, and have demonstrated a superiority when compared to other
      hormone therapy agents as tamoxifen. FRAGRANCE is a trial of neoadjuvant hormone therapy
      activated in September 2004 at the Jules Bordet Institute. The main objective of this study
      is to find a genetic signature of de novo resistance to letrozole The standard dose of
      letrozol, 2,5 mg/day, is given orally during 4 months previous to the definitive breast
      surgery. The advantages of the neoadjuvant setting are a) the possibility to directly
      evaluate the response to therapy, which is of great value to decide adjuvant treatment; b)
      the increase chance of performing breast conserving surgery; c) and, because a tumor sample
      is obtained before and after treatment, the identification of predictive markers of response
      or resistance to treatment, including a genetic signature, obtained using the microarray
      technology. Eligible patients are women with early hormonal receptor positive breast cancer,
      with any contra-indication or refusal to the administration of chemotherapy The side effects
      of letrozole are already well known, and include more commonly hot flashes, nausea and
      vomiting, headache, arthralgia/myalgia, fatigue, and oedema. After surgery, adjuvant
      treatment will be done according to the standard practice of the Institute, considering the
      possibility of continuing letrozole for a total of at least 5 years, if a satisfactory
      response is achieved The first part of this trial will include 49 patients.

      This trial will soon become a multicenter, multinational trial of 160 patients.
