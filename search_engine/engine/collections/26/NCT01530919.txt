      invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy, to determine the positive and negative predictive
      value of sestamibi scanning to detect parathyroid adenomas, and to differentiate adenomas
      from parathyroid hyperplasia. In addition, this study aims to determine the value of
      intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay to verify biochemical cure of primary
      hyperparathyroidism, to determine whether minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy is
      cos-effective, and to collect abnormal parathyroid tissue at the time of surgery for tissue
      analysis.
