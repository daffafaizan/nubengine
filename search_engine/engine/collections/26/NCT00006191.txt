      levetiracetam, on cortical excitability in humans. This drug may be useful in patients with
      myoclonus, and its mode of action is not well understood. We plan to determine if oral
      administration of levetiracetam in therapeutic dosage alters cortical excitability measured
      by transcranial magnetic stimulation as well as long-term potentiation measured by pinching
      practice in humans.
