    
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide a resource for clinical and laboratory research
      through enrollment of known immunodeficiency patients into a national registry, the US
      Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET). The registry data will expand NIH s and the nation s
      knowledge base about immune deficiency disorders and genetic mutations that lead to these
      disorders. Additional registrants from NIH protocols will not only increase the understanding
      of the molecular basis of these disorders, but also will serve to document and track the
      incidence and progression of complications.

      Objectives and specific aims

      The purpose of this proposal is to create a mechanism for depositing NIH data into USIDNET.
      The patient Registry is designed to obtain longitudinal data on a large number of patients
      with primary immunodeficiency diseases, and genetic carriers of these defects in order to:

        -  Learn more about the phenotypic variations seen in a large number of individual patients
           with the same rare molecular diagnosis.

        -  Determine the natural history of these genetic disorders of immunity and establish
           genotype-phenotype correlations.

        -  Learn effects of various treatment protocols used in these patients over time, including
           unexpected side effects that may be unique to a particular diagnostic group.

        -  To evaluate quality of life using standard tools and correlate these with genotype and
           treatment history.

        -  To promote collaborative research amongst interested investigators by identifying a
           larger pool of potential research subjects than would be available at their own
           institutions

        -  To identify patients with a specific diagnosis for potential participation in
           multi-institutional clinical trials designed for diagnosis or therapy or their specific
           disease.
