      Although the prevalence and severity of asthma have increased over the last several decades,
      the specific causes remain unknown. One possible mechanism is a change in diet. Yet,
      epidemiological and interventional studies designed to identify a key nutrient or antioxidant
      vitamin that may be responsible for the increase in disease severity have produced
      inconsistent results. A recent pilot study showed a soy isoflavone supplement reduces exhaled
      nitric oxide (FeNO) and ex vivo LTC4 synthesis in patients with inadequately controlled
      asthma. This clinical trial is designed to test the novel hypothesis that dietary
      supplementation with soy isoflavones is an effective treatment in patients with poorly
      controlled asthma. The study will include 380 patients with low dietary soy intake, 12 years
      of age or older, who are taking either inhaled corticosteroids or leukotriene modifiers and
      have inadequately controlled asthma. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with
      either a soy isoflavone supplement (containing genistein, daidzein and glycitein; 100 mg
      daily of the glycoside forms) or placebo for six months. The results of this trial will
      increase understanding of the role of diet in asthma; could identify a novel, safe and
      relatively inexpensive treatment for patients with asthma; and potentially will have a
      substantial impact on public health in the United States.
