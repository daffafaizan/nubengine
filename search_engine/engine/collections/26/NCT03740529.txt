    
      This study includes 3 parts: phase 1 (LOXO-305 monotherapy dose escalation and dose
      expansion), phase 1b (LOXO-305 combination therapy dose expansion), and phase 2 (LOXO-305
      monotherapy dose expansion). In phase 1, patients will be enrolled using an accelerated
      titration design. The starting dose of LOXO-305 in oral tablet form is 25 mg/day (e.g., 25 mg
      once daily [QD]). Once the MTD and/or RP2D is identified in phase 1 dose escalation,
      enrollment will continue to phase 1 dose expansion and can commence to phase 1b (Arms A and
      B). For phase 2, patients will be enrolled to one of seven phase 2 dose expansion cohorts
      depending on tumor histology and prior treatment history. Cycle length will be 28 days.
