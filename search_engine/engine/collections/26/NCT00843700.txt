      low-income and ethnic minority patients receive care. Among the most in need of effective
      treatments are depressed women with histories of early interpersonal trauma, who suffer
      disproportionate burden characterized by chronic depression, multiple comorbidities, and
      marked interpersonal difficulties. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT), based
      in a community mental health center, is to evaluate the effectiveness of Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy-Trauma in Community Settings (IPT-TCS). IPT-TCS is Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      with modifications specifically designed for the treatment of depressed patients with trauma
      histories seen in community settings. This trial (n=180) will compare IPT-TCS to active
      treatment as usual (TAU) for women with major depression and histories of childhood sexual
      abuse. We hypothesize that IPT-TCS will be more effective than TAU in reducing depression at
      32-weeks after treatment assignment. Improvements in social functioning, health-related
      functioning, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and mental health functioning are also expected.
      To monitor post-treatment course, outcome variables will be assessed at 6-month intervals
      over a 2-year period, and longer-term effects will be examined via repeated-measure analyses.
      This trial is designed to provide definitive results regarding the effectiveness of IPT-TCS
      compared to usual care in a community mental health center.
