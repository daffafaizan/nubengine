        -  Objective 1: To assess the safety and physical and physiological tolerance of the child
           to the activity performed with the exoskeleton in the rehabilitation sessions.

        -  Objective 2:

        -  To assess the safety of a progressive treatment algorithm to achieve the safe
           progression of patients throughout the therapy

        -  To assess whether an improvement is achieved in parameters related to the physical
           rehabilitation of the patient using the exoskeleton, in respiratory capacity,
           self-perceived quality of life (physical and emotional well-being and self-esteem) as
           well as to assess the effectiveness of a psychological intervention to provide support
           in coping with the situation of using the device for the first time in those children
           who have not used it before.

      The time period of the study will be as long as necessary to reach the desired number of
      participants, in this case 10 children (N=10). The participants will be patients affected by
      neuromuscular diseases or cerebral palsy and will be selected on the basis of the following
      inclusion/exclusion criteria:

      Inclusion criteria: 1. Children with neuromuscular disease or cerebral palsy who present gait
      disturbances or no gait disturbance. 2. Children between 3 and 11 years of age.

      Exclussion criteria: not fulfil the usage criteria of the device.
