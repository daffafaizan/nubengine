      management postoperatively. However, some recent studies have not been able to reproduce
      these benefits and have raised the issue of adverse consequences of hypoglycemia associated
      with intensive therapy. Our own data show an association of increased graft rejection
      proportional to postoperative glucose levels in patients who have undergone a liver
      transplant. Preliminary data suggest that this may improved by better glycemic control using
      the Glucose Management Service here at Northwestern.

      In this study, we propose to determine whether improved glycemic control using intensive
      insulin treatment immediately postoperatively will improve outcomes in patients undergoing
      liver transplant using a prospective, controlled, randomized, parallel-group study design
      targeting two different glucose levels, 140 and 180 mg/dL. Postoperative glucose management
      with insulin will be supervised by the Glucose Management Service as is routine, with the
      only research aspect being the two different glucose targets and the outcome analysis with
      liver transplant rejection as the primary outcome and infections and hypoglycemia being the
      principle secondary outcomes.
