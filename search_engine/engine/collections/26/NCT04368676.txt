      impacts on the healthcare system. Frontline healthcare workers are dealing with increased
      demands and fears for their own, as well as their family's safety. Adding to the stress is
      the limited ability to maintain social connectedness as physical distancing measures are in
      place. The investigators plan to conduct an open-label feasibility randomized controlled
      trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga
      (SKY) (n=30) versus an online control mind-body intervention called the Health Enhancement
      Program (HEP) (n=30) in 60 hospital and long term care frontline staff that are managing
      COVID-19 patients. Participants will be blinded to the treatment hypothesis while data
      analyst will be blinded to treatment allocation. Both SKY and HEP will be taught online in
      two phases in the first week followed by weekly reinforcement sessions for the following 4
      weeks. Feasibility measures will be assessed as well as self-rated measures of insomnia,
      anxiety, depression, and resilience. The investigators expect that it will be feasible to
      conduct an online RCT of two mind-body interventions, SKY and HEP, in staff managing the
      COVID-19 pandemic, and that the investigators will be able to remotely monitor safety and
      efficacy of these interventions.
