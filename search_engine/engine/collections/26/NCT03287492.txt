      I. To compare patients' perception of helpfulness in communicating with their physicians
      between a question prompt sheet (QPS) and a general information sheet (GIS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare caregivers' perception of helpfulness in communicating with their physicians
      between the QPS and the GIS.

      II. To examine the level of patients' and caregivers' overall satisfaction with the
      consultation with the use of the QPS versus the GIS.

      III. To examine physicians' views about the information material and overall satisfaction
      with the use of the QPS versus the GIS.

      IV. To explore how the use of QPS affects the average speaking time of patient or physician
      during the consultation visit.

      V. To establish demographic and clinical predictors of patients' perception of helpfulness of
      a QPS.

      VI. To examine the overall patients' preference between the QPS and GIS in an open label
      phase.

      VII. To compare the change in patient anxiety state with the use of the QPS versus the GIS.

      VIII. To explore the factors underlying patients' preferences for the QPS or GIS.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive QPS and answer questions from physician. At follow up visit,
      participants receive both QPS and GIS.

      GROUP II: Participants receive GIS and answer questions from physician. At follow up visit,
      participants receive both QPS and GIS.
