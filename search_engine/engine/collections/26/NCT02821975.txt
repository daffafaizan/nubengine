      by measuring the compliance and effect, investigating whether patients returned earlier to
      work and examine patients' physical and psychological health. This is done by comparing an
      intervention group and a control group.

      Outpatients from psychiatric department Odense in Denmark will be recruited from December
      2015 to July 2017.

      At enrolment the participants wil be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group or the
      control group. After the participants will complete a clinical interview and answer the The
      Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. The participants' cognitive function and
      depression severity will be measured at baseline and three months follow-up. At nine months
      follow-up the participants will receive an email with the SF-36 questionnaire and questions
      about their education and work status, which they were required to answer.

      The intervention is a cognitive computer program, consisting of different computer games. The
      intervention will start at enrolment and finish at the three months follow-up. The
      participants in the intervention group will do trainings session lasting 10-20 minutes three
      times a week. Each participant ends up with a total of 36 training sessions.
