    
      This is a double-blind, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study to
      assess the effects of IV FCM compared to placebo on the 12-month rate of death,
      hospitalization for worsening heart failure, and the 6-month change in 6 minute walk test
      (6MWT) distance for patients in heart failure with iron deficiency.

      After an initial screening period of up to 28 days, eligible participants will be stratified
      by region and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to FCM or placebo for treatment.

      Study drug administration will occur on Day 0 and Day 7 (Â±2) as an undiluted slow IV push,
      with additional study visits planned at 3 month intervals, and additional dosing administered
      every 6 months as applicable. In a subset of sites, a sub-study will be conducted to
      characterize serum phosphate levels over time in participants with heart failure and iron
      deficiency after dosing with FCM. For all participants, hematology, ferritin, and transferrin
      saturation (TSAT), with appropriate safety evaluations, to determine additional treatment,
      will occur at 6 month intervals.
