      diabetes. However adoption of aerobic activities may be challenging for some individuals with
      diabetes, especially the elderly and the obese. There is increasing interest in resistance
      training and no study have looked at direct comparison between the two.

      Subjects with diabetes but is generally sedentary (determined by means of a questionnaire)
      were recruited and randomized in one of the two groups. Subjects are supervised in a group
      and a completer is defined as one who completed 18 sessions within 8 weeks.
