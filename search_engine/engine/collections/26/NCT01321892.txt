      fluorescence and reflectance imaging of the upper aerodigestive tract can help clinicians
      more accurately determine intraoperative margins during ablative cancer surgery. This is an
      ex vivo study designed to evaluate the feasibility of using prototype optical imaging
      technology to enhance the discrimination between areas of noncancerous "normal" and cancerous
      mucosa. The results of this laboratory study will be used to further refine and develop this
      technology for in vivo application.

      Primary Aim:

      (1) To collect data to develop imaging algorithms to distinguish between normal and cancerous
      upper aerodigestive mucosa.

      Secondary Aims:

        1. To compare the combination of wide-field fluorescence/reflectance and high resolution
           fluorescence microscopy images of upper aerodigestive epithelium to histopathologic
           analysis of biopsied tissue.

        2. To compare the ability of sequential wide-field/fluorescence microscopy imaging to
           discriminate between normal and cancerous oral cavity mucosa with that of white-light
           images obtained after staining with toluidine blue.
