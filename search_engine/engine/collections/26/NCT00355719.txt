      treatment-derived toxicity without compromising efficacy.

      Of the recent antiretroviral drugs, atazanavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) whose
      pharmacokinetic profile allows it to be given in a single daily take with a scant impact on
      lipid metabolism. This second characteristic makes atazanavir a good alternative for patients
      with a high vascular risk. However, one of its drawbacks is that it may present clinically
      relevant interactions with other drugs.

      Another antiretroviral agent with a scant impact on lipid metabolism is nevirapine. Different
      studies have described an improvement in lipid profile, as well as a less atherogenic
      tendency in patients treated with nevirapine. Moreover, the combination of nevirapine with PI
      drugs in the context of nucleoside-sparing strategies may permit a suitable control of viral
      replication, and an improvement in the mitochondrial toxicity derived from treatment with
      NTRI, which may possibly result in a minor incidence or in a clinical improvement of
      lipodystrophy.

      The combination of atazanavir with nevirapine may be of major interest in HIV-infected
      patients that have had a cardiovascular event (secondary prevention) or are at a high risk of
      having one (primary prevention). Similarly, this combination of drugs may be promising as a
      nucleoside-sparing strategy. However, according to preliminary data, the joint administration
      of nevirapine with atazanavir may lead to a reduction in the atazanavir plasma concentration.
      Thus, before evaluating the clinical utility of this combination of drugs, pharmacokinetic
      studies evaluating the existence of significant pharmacokinetic interactions between both are
      necessary
