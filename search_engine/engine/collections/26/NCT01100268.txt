      tasks. These data suggest that the inability to sustain focus may interfere with hoarders'
      ability to organize, categorize and make decisions about discarding possessions. Stimulants
      are first-line treatments for ADHD, improve CPT performance in people with ADHD and enhance
      school performance in children with ADHD. Extended release formulations, such as
      methylphenidate ER, are associated with better medication compliance. Together, these data
      suggest that adjunctive methylphenidate ER might be a novel way to improve attention in
      compulsive hoarders which might improve hoarding symptoms.

      The investigators hypothesis is that adjunctive methylphenidate ER will improve attention in
      compulsive hoarders aged 18-55. The investigators will also explore the safety of
      methylphenidate ER administration in compulsive hoarders.
