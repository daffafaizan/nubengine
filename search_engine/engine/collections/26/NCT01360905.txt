    
      Clinical Investigation for a non-inferiority/equivalence study that aims to determine the
      acceptable performance of the Monica AN24 during the first and when possible the second
      stages of labor by determining whether the Monica AN24 fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine
      contractions (UC) monitoring device is non-inferior/equivalent to Doppler FHR and
      tocodynamometer UC using direct fetal scalp electrode (FSE) FHR and intrauterine pressure
      catheter (IUPC) UC as a reference, either collected simultaneously with the Monica and
      Doppler FHR/tocodynamometer UC data, or from previous studies to define the expected accuracy
      and success rate when comparing Monica FHR and UC with Doppler FHR and tocodynamometer UC
      respectively
