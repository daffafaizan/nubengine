      speech analysis and conventional psychological instruments, as primary measurement the
      SCL-90-Scale, as secondary instruments the PRIME-MD (explicit in use the PHQ-9 for depressive
      symptoms and the GAD-7 for anxiety), B5T and an ADHD-VAS-Score (t0). Then the investigators
      check the status of the participants later at t1 (4-6 weeks after t0) and t2 (4-6 weeks after
      t1).

      The speech measuring instruments is the "VoiceSense" digital voice analysis tool, which
      enables the analysis of 200 specific speech parameters and the assessment of the findings
      through the use of psychometric instruments and questionnaires.

      The hypothesis is that the data of the voicesense analysis tool compared to the psychological
      instruments provide a good match and the voicesense technique can be used as a predictive and
      course-description tool in mental illness.
