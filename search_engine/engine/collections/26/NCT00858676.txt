      activities of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase involved in digestion and absorption of
      carbohydrates in the intestine. A clinical study involving patients with type 2 diabetes
      demonstrated that acarbose decreased the post-load glucose level and improved glycosylated
      hemoglobin control. A prospective study involving patients with impaired glucose tolerance
      (IGT) demonstrated that acarbose inhibited progression to type 2 diabetes and significantly
      reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It has also been reported that acarbose slows
      increase in the intima-media thickness and inhibits the progression of atherosclerosis. A
      significant proportion of patients with acute coronary syndrome and those with stable angina
      pectoris suffer from diabetes or IGT, and their prognosis is poor.
