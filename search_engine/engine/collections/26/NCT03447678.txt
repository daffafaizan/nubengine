    
      Approximately 65 subjects with PD-L1 low (PD-L1Lo), EGFR wt, EML4/ALK fusion negative NSCLC
      will be enrolled in this trial for examination of the biological characteristics associated
      to efficacy and safety of Pembrolizumab. Subjects will receive Pembrolizumab iv at dose of
      200 mg every three weeks. Subjects will be evaluated every 9 weeks (63 +/- 3 days) with
      radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment. Subjects will continue with the
      assigned study treatment until RECIST-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity
      or consent withdrawal.

      Treatment with Pembrolizumab will continue until two years of therapy have been administered,
      documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that
      prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the
      subject, subject withdraws consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial
      treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons. Pembrolizumab treated
      subjects who obtain a confirmed Complete Response (CR) per RECIST 1.1 may consider stopping
      trial treatment. These subjects may be eligible for re-treatment with Pembrolizumab after
      they have experienced radiographic disease progression at the discretion of the investigator,
      this re-treatment will be the Second Course Phase.
