    
      Secondary objectives for this protocol include the following:

        -  To describe CD133+ graft content post-selection and to describe the yield and purity of
           CD133+ content of the graft obtained.

        -  To describe the negative selection efficiency of this strategy by assessing the
           processed product for tumor specific markers, when applicable.

        -  To characterize the proliferation of clonal progeny of CD133+ cells.

        -  To characterize lymphocyte and hematopoietic reconstitution (including the kinetics of
           platelet engraftment) in these patients.

        -  To estimate one-year disease-free and overall survival in these transplant recipients.
