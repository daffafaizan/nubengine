      acute infectious process starting from teeth or peridontium, benign or malignant diseases
      starting from mucosa or teeth/peridontium and an overall reduction of nutrition indices and a
      decrease of quality of life markers. More recently, an augmentation of systemic inflammatory
      reaction markers has been shown correlated with periodontal diseases, leading to an increase
      of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetic risk in those patients. A large panel of oral and
      dental diseases has been described in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
      a terminal stage or dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis). In CKD patients, the
      influence of oral diseases on the progression of the chronic kidney disease is not
      established today, as most of the studies are focused on stage 5 CKD or dialysis patients.
      That's why the interactions between dental health and CKD will be evaluated in these
      patients, at different stages of the disease (stages 2 to 5). In this study, it is
      hypothesized that the augmentation of inflammation and the alteration of nutrition due to
      oral diseases have an impact on the alteration of CKD patients, through the chronic
      inflammatory pathway. We will evaluate the oral and dental health at Day 0, 6 months and 12
      months using several indices: the oral hygiene-simplified index, the community periodontal
      index in treatment needs index, the decayed missing filled per tooth index, the number of
      functional teeth index, the oral health impact profile index, the saliva composition, the
      evaluation of halitosis and a mucosa evaluation. In parallel, an evaluation of the influence
      of chronic oral diseases on nutrition, inflammation and progression of chronic kidney disease
      will be done: biological check-up, nutrition intake statement and body mass index.
