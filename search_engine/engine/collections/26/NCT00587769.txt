      myocardial infarction, or coronary angioplasty within the past 3 months or an untreated
      cardiac dysrhythmia; 3) personal history of seizures; 4) closed head trauma with any loss of
      consciousness or amnesia in the last 5 years; 5) ever history of closed head trauma with > 30

      hematoma/brain contusion; 6) a history or psychosis, bipolar disorder, bulimia or anorexia

      bupropion or varenicline in the previous 3 months; 12) current (past 14 days) use of
      antipsychotic or antidepressant; 13) an allergy to bupropion or varenicline; 14) untreated
      hypertension or baseline systolic blood pressure > 180 or diastolic > 100; 15) have another
      member of their household already participating in this study.

      The primary aims and hypotheses of this study are:

        1. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of 12 weeks of combination therapy with
           bupropion SR and varenicline for increasing the point prevalence smoking abstinence
           rates at 12 weeks among cigarette smokers.

           Hypothesis: The combination of bupropion SR plus varenicline for 12 weeks will increase
           the point prevalence smoking abstinence rates at 12 weeks among cigarettes smokers.

        2. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of combination therapy with bupropion SR and
           varenicline for decreasing craving and nicotine withdrawal symptoms among cigarette
           smokers trying to achieve smoking abstinence.

      Hypothesis: 12 weeks of combination therapy with bupropion SR and varenicline will
      significantly decrease craving and nicotine withdrawal among cigarette smokers trying to
      achieve smoking abstinence.
