    
      Primary Objectives:

      The primary objectives of this study are:

      â€¢ to determine the proportion of HPV-positive patients in whom 5-azacytidine increases APOBEC
      RNA expression.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  to investigate response (proliferation, apoptosis), as well as reactivation of IFN
           pathways in patients treated with 5-azacitadine for HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC.

        -  to investigate the clinical activity of 5-azacitadine in patients with HPV-positive and
           HPV-negative HNSCC.

        -  to investigate the safety of 5-azacitadine in patients with HPV-positive and
           HPV-negative HNSCC
