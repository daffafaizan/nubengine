    
      All patients scheduled for kidney biopsy will be invited to participate in a standard
      isovolemic furosemide stress test before the biopsy procedure. The latter will consist in 1.5
      miligrams per kilogram of weight of intravenous furosemide administration, with urinary
      output follow up and measurement. The urinary output will be replaced intravenously with
      normal saline to avoid dehydration and/or hypotension. A standard 5ml sample of blood will be
      taken before the test and aliquots of urine before and after furosemide administration will
      be frozen.

      After completion of the formely mentioned test, patients will proceed to their scheduled
      kidney biopsy along with interventions considered appropiate by their attending physician.

      Kidney biopsy sample will be examined by histopathology service and the degree of
      interstitial fibrosis will be described. The degree of fibrosis will be correlated with the
      degree furosemide excretion and urinary output.
