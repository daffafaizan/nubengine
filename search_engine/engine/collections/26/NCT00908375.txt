      approved by the FDA for use in post herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia
      there are few studies of its efficacy in patients with radicular pain from herniated disc,
      spinal stenosis or failed back surgery syndrome. This study was conducted to evaluate the
      efficacy of pregabalin in these pain states.
