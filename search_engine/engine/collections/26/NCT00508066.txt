      supply of medication without the need for repeat injections. This method has shown
      encouraging results with respect to pain levels, narcotic use, faster rehabilitation and
      shorter hospital stay in patients undergoing laparotomies, iliac crest bone graft harvest,
      and sternotomies. In addition, there have not been any reported complications when used in
      these scenarios.

      We hope to confirm better pain control, less narcotic use (i.e. PCA), fewer narcotic side
      effects, better response to physical therapy and earlier discharge. Which may be generalized
      to the spinal surgery patient population as less pain and suffering and a better overall
      hospital course
