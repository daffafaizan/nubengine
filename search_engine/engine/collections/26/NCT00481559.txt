    
      This treatment protocol will be available on a cost recovery basis to IRB-approved
      Investigators treating an eligible patient at any site in the US. In order to continue to
      make Voraxaze™ available following FDA approval and prior to being commercially available.
      Protherics needs to charge for the product, so there will be a cost to obtain Voraxaze™ under
      the Open-Label Treatment Protocol. Protherics is permitted under the FDA regulations (21 CFR
      312.8) to charge for Voraxaze, to recover those costs associated with its manufacture,
      research and development, and handling, but do not include other commercial costs (profit).

      Patient eligibility is based on MTX concentrations and laboratory values obtained per
      standard of care. Once an Investigator identifies a potential patient, he/she will contact
      the Voraxaze central call center (1-877-398-9829) to receive information regarding drug
      shipment. Eligible patients will have routine demographic, MTX, and Voraxaze therapy
      information collected.

      Each patient will receive a single dose of Voraxaze 50 Units/kg in a bolus intravenous
      injection over 5 minutes. In addition to Voraxaze, patients will continue to receive standard
      of care treatment including leucovorin therapy, and supportive care such as hydration,
      alkalinization of urine and, if necessary, hemoperfusion/dialysis.
