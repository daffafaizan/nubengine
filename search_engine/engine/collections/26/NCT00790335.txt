      myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and acute massive pulmonary embolism in adults.
      Previous studies have established the ability of rt-PA to lyse venous thrombus in patients
      with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and suggest that successful rt-PA mediated thrombolysis can
      prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), a morbid, late complication of DVT that occurs in
      nearly 50% of patients.

      rt-PA is delivered directly into venous thrombus using a catheter/device which is embedded
      within the thrombus by a physician under imaging guidance. This method of rt-PA delivery,
      pharmacomechanical catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis (PCDT),is thought to be
      safer, more effective, and more efficient than previous methods. The question of whether PCDT
      using rt-PA improves long-term DVT patient outcomes with acceptable risk and cost has not yet
      been addressed.

      The rationale for performing the ATTRACT Trial is based upon:

        -  the major burden of PTS on DVT patients and the U.S. healthcare system

        -  the association between rapid clot lysis and prevention of PTS

        -  the proven ability of rt-PA to dissolve venous thrombus in proximal DVT

        -  recent advances in CDT methods which may lower bleeding risk

        -  the major clinical controversy on whether CDT should be routinely used for first-line
           DVT therapy
