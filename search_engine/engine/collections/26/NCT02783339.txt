      registry designed to demonstrate the potential treatment of intracranial, saccular aneurysms
      with the Next Generation Neuroform Stent System. The study will evaluate the permanent
      morbidity and mortality rate within the 12 to 16 months following the procedure. The study
      will evaluate as well the percent occlusion of the treated target lesion on angiography in
      the absence of retreatment, or parent artery stenosis at the target location at 12 to 16
      months. Subjects with documented saccular aneurysms arising from a parent artery may
      potentially benefit from stent assisted coiling, provided they meet the other eligibility
      criteria.
