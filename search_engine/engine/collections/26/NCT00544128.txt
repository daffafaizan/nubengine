      containing ritonavir boosted atazanavir combined with Epzicom will offer non inferior
      antiretroviral efficacy compared to ritonavir boosted atazanavir combined with Truvada. This
      non inferiority hypothesis is studied by a randomized, open label, multicenter trial over 48
      weeks as the primary endpoint and long term safety of both arms are followed for 144 weeks.

      The primary endpoint is the antiretroviral effect over 48 weeks.

      The secondary endpoints are;

        1. The immunologic effects from baseline at the 48th and 144th week

        2. Reasons of treatment failure by 144th week

        3. Adverse events and their rate of incidence by 144th week

        4. Serum concentration of tenofovir in selected patients

        5. Serum concentration of atazanavir in selected patients

        6. Renal complication in tenofovir arm
