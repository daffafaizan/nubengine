    
      This Phase 1/2a, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, dose-escalation study of KO-539, a
      menin-MLL(KMT2A) inhibitor, will determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses
      using a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) adaptive design when administered to
      patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML. If an maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cannot be
      identified, a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. A expansion phase in
      patients with NPM1m and KMT2A-r R/R AML patients is planned following determination of the
      MTD/RP2D. KO-539 will be administered as a once daily oral dose in 28 continuous day cycles.
