      PCR that is obtained daily from clinical laboratories, at COVID-19 outpatient and hospital
      clinics, or the Emergency Rooms in Chile. After telephonically pre-screening eligibility of
      the index case and his/her household, and participants providing informed consent, households
      will be randomized 1:1 to three doses of IFN beta 1a or standard of care. Only the index case
      and treatment-eligible household members will receive IFN if their household is assigned to
      treatment arm. Other non-eligible household participants (e.g. children) will be monitored by
      serial SARS-CoV-2 saliva PCR and diary cards, and at day 29 all participants will be
      evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood.
