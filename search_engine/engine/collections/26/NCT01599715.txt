    
      The study will attempt to accomplish 3 aims:

      Aim 1: Compare outcomes of the two-hour BH Class with the condensed DVD version.

      To accomplish this aim we will conduct a comparative effectiveness trial of 600 women 55
      years and older randomized to BH Class or DVD. Women will be followed for 24 months
      post-intervention in order to assess long-term outcomes and sustainability.

      Aim 2: Conduct an economic analysis comparing the two-hour BH Class with the DVD version.
      Describing the costs, quality of life, and analyzing the willingness to pay and employment/
      productivity data will be the primary economic focus of this study.

      Aim 3: Conduct a qualitative analysis to gain insight into elements of the intervention that
      contribute to sustainability.
