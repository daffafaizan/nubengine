      volunteers will be investigated. The healthy volunteers receive 1. furosemide and 2.
      aminohippurate sodium "PAH" as single dose. The main objective is gender-specific comparison
      of the pharmacokinetic parameters of furosemide in relation to the effect of furosemide
      (urinary excretion). Secondary objectives are the gender-specific comparison of renal and
      systemic PAH clearance with the clearance of furosemide and the influence of various genetic
      polymorphisms on the variability of furosemide pharmacokinetics.
