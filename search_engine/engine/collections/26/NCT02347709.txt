      The relationship between neuropathy and diabetic lower extremity wounds is strong and in
      fact, 80% of patients with an existing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) have neuropathy.
      Understanding the factors that contribute to the increased risk of wounds in patients with
      neuropathy is important in creating optimal strategies to reduce this risk.

      Traditionally, the severity of diabetic neuropathy has been evaluated using the clinical exam
      and nerve conduction studies. More recently, new techniques such as intra-epidermal nerve
      fiber density have shown promise in evaluating neuropathy especially the small nerve fiber
      neuropathies that might affect pain sensation and autonomic function. There are also new
      molecular markers that may correlate with the risk of neuropathy that may also be useful in
      clinically evaluating the diabetic patient with neuropathy.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the degree of loss of epidermal nerve
      fibers near a foot wound in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The secondary purpose will be
      to determine whether the degree of epidermal nerve fiber loss, the clinical examination,
      nerve conduction studies or the molecular profile correlates with appearance of lower
      extremity ulcers in patients with diabetes.
