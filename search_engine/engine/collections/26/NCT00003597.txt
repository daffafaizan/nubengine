        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and toxicities associated with the administration of
           recombinant human thrombopoietin in children with solid tumors receiving
           myelosuppressive chemotherapy with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE).

        -  Determine a safe dose of recombinant human thrombopoietin with filgrastim (G-CSF) in
           this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the time to platelet count recovery following chemotherapy in this patient
           population.

        -  Evaluate the depth and duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and the number of
           platelet transfusion events in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of recombinant human thrombopoietin.

      All patients receive chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 0 and
      1 and etoposide and ifosfamide IV over 60 minutes on days 0-4. Chemotherapy is continued in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 6 courses every
      21 days.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of recombinant human thrombopoietin IV
      on days 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. After
      the MTD is determined an additional cohort of patients are treated at this dose level every
      other day on days 4-20. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 5
      and continuing until absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1000/mm3 for 2 consecutive
      days or day 33.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study.
