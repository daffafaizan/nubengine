      exercise performance, there are potential nutritional interventions that can be put in place
      to further increase performance gains.

      Energy for the contraction of muscles is created in the mitochondria. HIIT can improve the
      function of mitochondria, therefore improving performance.

      Β-alanine is a commonly used supplement that can improve exercise performance by increasing
      the amount of carnosine in muscle. Carnosine has many functions that may help improve
      exercise capacity.

      The present study will seek to quantify whether a period of HIIT alongside β-alanine
      supplementation will improve the adaptation to training, and therefore performance, more than
      a period of HIIT alone.
