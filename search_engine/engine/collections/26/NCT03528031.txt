      intake and markers of metabolic syndrome and may reduce visceral adiposity. Visceral adipose
      tissue is positively correlated with risk of cardiometabolic syndrome that predisposes to
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial (HAT) aims to
      investigate an impactful outcome (visceral fat reduction) in a relevant population (Americans
      with an increased weight circumference) with a reasonable lifestyle modification (consumption
      of 1 avocado per day). HAT will evaluate the effect of providing one avocado per day for
      consumption over a 6 month period on established health parameters, including visceral
      adiposity, hepatic lipid content, markers of metabolic syndrome and high sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) when compared to a habitual diet. Blood specimens will be drawn
      and analyzed for fasting total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, glucose, insulin, hsCRP and
      RBC fatty acid profiles. Two non-contrast MRIs will be performed (at screening to assess
      eligibility and final participant visit 8 for randomized participants) to assess the volume
      of visceral adipose tissue and hepatic fat fraction. Four 24-hour dietary recalls will be
      conducted for study participants to capture dietary intake data. Questionnaires include the
      following: health and demographic including eating habits and physical activity; diet, food
      and avocado satisfaction (intervention group only); quality of life; and quality of sleep.
