        -  Determine the incidence of grades II, III, and IV graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in
           patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia transformed from
           MDS, or myeloproliferative disorders treated with immunologically engineered, filgrastim
           (G-CSF)-mobilized, allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft failure, relapse, and transplant-related mortality by
           day 100 in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD, in terms of number and duration of
           immunosuppressant therapies, in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility of partial T-cell depletion in G-CSF-mobilized peripheral
           blood stem cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive conditioning with oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Immunologically engineered, filgrastim
      (G-CSF)-mobilized, allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0.

      Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising methotrexate IV on days 1, 3,
      6, and 11 and cyclosporine IV over 1-4 hours (orally twice daily when tolerated) on days -1
      to 80 and then gradually tapered over 5 months beginning on day 81.

      Patients are followed regularly through day 100 and then at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
