    
      patients with acute coronary syndrome (STEMI, NSTEMI, UA) will be included and different risk
      scores will be calculated for each patient.

      after that in-hospital and short-term outcome beside left ventricular systolic and diastolic
      functions (at admission and 3m later) will be assessed to be correlated with different risk
      scores to determine which score system was able to predict left ventricular remodeling and
      what was the cut off value, sensitivity, and specificity of the score
