      Molecule as a novel PET/CT radiotracer to monitor EGFR-ECD expression status and classify
      EGFR-ECD benefit NSCLC patients. The investigators want to evaluated the use of
      [68Ga]-labelling Anti-EGFR Affibody Molecule in lung cancer imaging in adult NSCLC patients
      with different EGFR-ECD expression status of primary and metastatic cancers.
