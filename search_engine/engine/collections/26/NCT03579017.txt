      health-care. Thus, a rapid screening tool valid for use in Norway is urgent. However,
      cognitive assessment for patients with ALS can be difficult due to the complexity of
      cognitive impairment, as well as motor challenges with writing, drawing and speaking.
      Therefore, only ALS-specific, multi domain screening instruments with integrated behavioral
      sections should be used. Internationally, the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis screen (ECAS), is recommended for the purpose. Besides being quick and easy
      to administer, the ECAS is shown to be sensitive and have high specificity to ALS-specific
      dysfunction and behavioral changes. The introduction of ECAS has probably contributed to a
      more nuanced picture of cognitive impairment in ALS than previously assumed. Therefore the
      ECAS has been translated and culturally adapted into Norwegian (ECAS-N). Based on scores from
      healthy people, Norwegian age- and educational-adjusted norms for verbal fluency (n=277) and
      cut-off-scores (n=85) for abnormal findings are established. However, further investigation
      of psychometric properties of the ECAS-N is needed. The objectives of the study are: 1. To
      investigate if the ECAS-N reflect cognitive impairment (internal consistency), and is robust
      to measurement errors due to different times of testing (test-retest reliability) and
      different raters (interrater reliability) 2. To investigate if the ECAS-N can be used to
      distinguish between people with ALS-specific cognitive impairment, and those who do not have
      cognitive impairment, and those who have cognitive impairment due to other disorders
      (construct validity).
