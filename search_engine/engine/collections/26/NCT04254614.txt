      disease (IBD). However, biologics are associated with increased risk of infections.
      Therefore, it is important to regularly monitor patients during the course of therapy. This
      process can be time consuming for patients as well as clinicians. Mobile applications, have
      the potential to guide patients and facilitate monitoring of biologic treatment. In this
      study we aim to evaluate the use of a mobile application to guide IBD patients during
      biologic treatment. Adult patients with diagnosis of IBD treated with biologics will be
      included. The mobile application with personalised content will give patients information
      about their treatment, reminders for example when blood tests and questionnaires to check for
      adverse events.
