      xenotransplantation in humans to increase the efficacy of immunizing subjects against their
      pancreatic cancer. In this protocol, the transfer of the murine
      alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase [alpha(1,3)GT] gene to immunotherapy component cells results
      in the cell surface expression of alpha(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (alpha gal) epitopes on
      membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute
      rejection response. This response occurs when organs are transplanted from lower animal donor
      species into primates and results in rapid destruction of transplanted tissue and an
      augmented response against transplant antigens, including antigens not related to the alpha
      gal epitopes. Human hosts have pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies that are thought to
      result from chronic immunological stimulation due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are
      naturally expressed on normal gut flora and these antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum
      IgG. Opsonization and lysis of the immunotherapy component cells mediated by this antibody is
      believed to increase the efficiency of antigen processing by targeting vaccine components to
      antigen presenting cells via the Fc gamma receptor.
