    
      The study is an open-label observational study involving a minimum of 10 centers. A minimum
      of 100 patients, including a minimum of 30 stand-alone balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV)
      treatment patients, will be enrolled. Enrollment will continue until all 3 of these
      conditions are met.

      BAV-only patients will be followed through a 6-month post-treatment telephone follow up.
      Patients treated with the V8 device for BAV as a bridge to transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or as an intraprocedural
      predilatation prior to TAVR, will exit the study at the time of the TAVR or SAVR implant or
      at 6 months post-BAV treatment, whichever comes first.
