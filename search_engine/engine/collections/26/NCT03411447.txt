      potentially responsible for gastric-content aspiration. Several studies involving technetium
      99m (99mTc) labeling of gastric contents have established that gastric-fluid microaspiration
      is common in critically ill patients receiving both endotracheal ventilation and enteral
      nutrition. However, to our knowledge, no studies have specifically addressed the role for
      enteral nutrition in the occurrence of microaspiration. The objective of this ancillary study
      is to compare the frequency of gastric-content microaspiration in patients given enteral
      versus parenteral nutrition during the NUTRIREA2 trial. The new knowledge of risk factors for
      microaspiration provided by this study may help to improve strategies for preventing
      microaspiration and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
