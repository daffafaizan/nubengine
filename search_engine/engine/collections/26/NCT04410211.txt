      gastrointestinal endoscopy in a single tertiary Centre in Malaysia. The study was approved by
      University Malaya Medical Centre medical research ethics committee. All patients gave written
      and informed consent. Patients were fasted, and three psychometric tests were performed as a
      baseline before sedation. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive IV Midazolam
      (Group M) or inhalational Sevoflurane (Group S) via nasal mask. Standard monitoring was
      applied. Patients in Sevoflurane group received the inhalational agent via a nasal mask with
      stepwise increment until and Observed Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale of 3 or maximum
      1.0 minimum alveolar concentration was achieved. Patients in Midazolam group were given a
      stat dose of IV Midazolam 2.5mg. Both groups received 30mcg of IV Fentanyl and lignocaine 1%
      gargle prior to the procedure. The unblinded observer monitored the level of sedation and
      recorded the patient's vital signs. A second blinded observer performed the psychometric
      tests before and at the end of the procedure. He also recorded the time to fulfil discharge
      criteria as well as the satisfaction scores from the patient and endoscopist.
