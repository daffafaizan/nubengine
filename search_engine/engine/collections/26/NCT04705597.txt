    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, double-blind study of
      BGE-175 administered PO or NG in participants â‰¥ 60 years of age and hospitalized with
      documented COVID-19 who are not yet in respiratory failure.

      After signing informed consent, participants will be screened upon presentation at the
      hospital. Screening will include full physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory
      evaluation, oxygen saturation, pre-diagnostics to measure prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) status, and
      baseline assessment of World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for COVID-19. If
      confirmed that the participant qualifies for this protocol according to listed inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, participants will receive the first dose of study medication, PO. The
      participant will then receive study medication PO or NG (if intubated or unable to swallow
      medication) once daily, at approximately the same time each day for up to 13 additional days.
      Study medication will be administered in addition to standard of care deemed appropriate by
      the treating physician(s). Participants will be randomized to receive BGE-175 or placebo.
      Participants will be monitored daily for all relevant efficacy outcomes, oxygen saturation,
      and adverse events. Blood will be drawn periodically for safety laboratory measurements,
      plasma kinetics, lymphocyte subsets, C-reactive protein, and cytokines. Nasopharyngeal swabs
      will be collected to measure viral load. Participants will be monitored for 14 days after
      administration of the last dose (Day 28) and followed through Day 57.
