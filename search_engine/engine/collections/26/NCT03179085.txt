      Specific Aim 1: Screen 600 participants from four different American Indian tribes in New
      Mexico to identify incident cases of CKD and identify participants for the proposed study of
      HBKC;

      Specific Aim 2: Conduct a 12 month study of HBKC among 240 Native Americans randomized in a
      1:1 allocation to HBKC group versus Delayed Intervention (DI) group to demonstrate
      improvement in Patient Activation Measures (PAM) and adherence to treatment. We will
      demonstrate that CKD clinical risk profiles will improve with HBKC as compared to DI at 12
      months and 4 months post intervention (16 months);

      Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that HBKC will improve psychological factors that map onto
      important cultural variations in treatment efficacy and health outcomes. Specifically, we
      will show improvement in potential mediators (treatment engagement, self-efficacy, coping and
      increased knowledge) and moderators (stigma, and chronic stress, and depression) of health
      disparity and outcome.

      Study Outcomes: (1) The patient activation measures and adherence; (2) Changes in clinical
      phenotypes including Cr, UACR, A1c, body weight, BMI, fasting glucose, blood pressure (BP),
      plasma lipids, and inflammatory markers; (3) Changes in the quantitative traits such as diet
      and scores from a battery of mental-health, self-efficacy, and quality of life instruments.

      Health Impact: The active participation of New Mexico tribal leadership and the Albuquerque
      Area Indian Health Board, as well as the accessibility to native CHR personnel, render the
      outcomes that will be demonstrated by this proposal easily sustainable over the long term. If
      successful, this program has the potential to change best-practices for CKD progression and
      to reduce health disparities in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.
