      series of PEEP maneuvers designed to assess lung recruitability, PEEP responsiveness, and
      optimal PEEP. EIT imaging and esophageal manometry will be employed throughout the protocol
      to quantify the effect of PEEP on lung function. Patients will be randomized to be ventilated
      at PEEP levels supplied by the ExPRESS strategy or by the EIT hyperdistention/collapse
      algorithm. The biological response will be assessed by measuring serum cytokines.
