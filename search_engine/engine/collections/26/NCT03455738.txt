           arterial tone that can predict norepinephrine-dependent arterial pressure. Eadyn is
           calculated using the ratio of respiratory pulse pressure variation (PPV) over the
           respiratory stroke volume variation (SVV). Guinot et al demonstrated a decrease in the
           duration of norepinephrine treatment with the use of Eadyn. To date, studies that have
           validated Eadyn at bedside have used cardiac output (CO) calibrated pulse contour
           analysis (PiCCO™, Pulsion™) or oesophageal doppler. Such monitoring systems need
           dedicated and specific arterial line and venous access that may limit their use at
           bedside. In addition to CO calibrated pulse contour analysis, CO uncalibrated pulse
           contour analysis has been developed and is considered less invasive. Nevertheless, one
           limitation of the latter CO monitoring is inaccuracy of CO measurement in patients who
           are being treated with norepinephrine. These limitations may affect the predictability
           of Eadyn.

        -  Purpose : To date, no study has evaluated the ability of Eadyn measured by uncalibrated
           pulse contour analysis to assess arterial pressure response to a decreased dose of
           norepinephrine. We tested the hypothesis that Eadyn calculated from uncalibrated pulse
           contour analysis predicts the arterial-pressure response to a norepinephrine decrease in
           patients treated with norepinephrine
