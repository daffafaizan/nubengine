      Swedish registers in order to study risk factors associated with severe Covid-19 as well as
      different disease outcomes, with a focus on cardiovascular disease, different treatments and
      socioeconomic factors. Cases are identified through the Swedish intensive care register (SIR)
      and controls through the Swedish population register (RTB). Further information on the study
      participants is gathered by linkage to registers on: prescribed drugs; history of in- and
      outpatient care; income, education and migration. Follow-up data such as future
      hospitalization and mortality will be gathered prospectively.
