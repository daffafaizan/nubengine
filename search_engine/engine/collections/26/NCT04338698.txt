      of Pakistan will oversee a comprehensive cohort study. Within this cohort, a multicenter,
      adaptive, randomized controlled trial will evaluate, among eligible SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19)
      infected patients receiving standard supportive care who consent to randomization following a
      new diagnosis in Pakistan, if Hydroxychloroquine Phosphate/Sulfate alone (control
      intervention) vs a series of alternatives (comparator interventions) including Oseltamivir
      and Azithromycin alone and in combination with Hydroxychloroquine Phosphate/Sulfate is
      effective in clearing the coronavirus and improving the clinical course of the disease. Those
      not consenting to randomization will be followed up for outcomes of SARS-Cov-2 infection with
      supportive care only. Findings of this study are expected to inform clinical care and public
      health protocols and policies for management of SARS-Cov-2.
