      analysis of the these scans can give a more accurate and sensitive information regarding the
      DLB brain glucose metabolism which in turn may give better insight about DLB mechanism and
      allow better assessment of the disease.

      Glucose metabolism in the brains of DLB patients is characterized by a pattern of bilateral
      parietal and posterior temporal hypometabolism with specific occipital hypo metabolic
      signature [9]. The use of FDG-PET scans allows the mapping of the topographic hypo metabolic
      view of the brain in different stages of the DLB condition. These metabolic maps, in turn,
      can be used both for diagnostic purposes as well as for research of the DLB mechanism [10]
      [11]. FDG is also a modality assisting in the differentiation between AD, PD and DLB [12]. To
      notice, the disadvantage of the FDG-PET scans is the lack of quantification. Visually
      analysis of brain FDG metabolism without quantitative analysis is limiting its use as a
      biomarker and the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of the scan. This is the main reason
      why it is considered only a supportive biomarker [9].

      In these study the investigators will investigate the utilization of dynamic FDG PET scans in
      order to track in more close and precise way the path of the glucose metabolism in the brain.
      In addition, the investigators would like to use the dynamic scans to perform quantification
      of the FDG distribution in the brain in order to show the advantage of the quantification in
      the diagnostic process.
