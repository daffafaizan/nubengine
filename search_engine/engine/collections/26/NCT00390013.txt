      pain) and vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS, chronic vulvar pain localized to the vaginal
      opening). We propose that vulvodynia is a neuropathic pain (pain that effects the nervous
      system) as characterized by pain from stimuli that is not usually painful, stimuli that would
      not usually be painful causing significant pain, and burning pain. Gabapentin has been shown
      to be effective in treating chronic pain.
