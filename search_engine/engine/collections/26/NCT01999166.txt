      osteoarthritis. Families with osteoarthritis of known or suspected genetic basis will be
      enrolled. Individuals will undergo clinical assessment and genetic analyses for the purpose
      of: 1) definition and characterization of phenotype, 2) determination of the natural history
      of the disorder, and 3) genotype/phenotype correlation. Genetic linkage studies may be
      performed for disorders in which the genetic bases is not yet known.
