      SMA flow and intestinal perfusion is blunted post transfusion. This is worse in SGA infants
      and/or in the presence of a PDA.

      Questions: 1) Does PRBC transfusion alter postprandial SMA flow increases and intestinal
      oxygenation indices in preterm infants receiving enteral feeds? 2) Is there a difference in
      postprandial SMA flow and intestinal perfusion changes in recently transfused SGA infants
      compared to AGA infants, and in those with and without a PDA? Primary Outcome: Post-prandial
      SMA flows changes before and after PRBC transfusion.

      Secondary outcomes: Pre-post prandial changes in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-measured
      intestinal oxygenation parameters before and after PRBC transfusion.
