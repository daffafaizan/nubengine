    
      The Neurogenetics Branch (NGB) within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
      Stroke (NINDS) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide genetic diagnosis to
      participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed neurological conditions.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective of this protocol is to provide a resource of participants for
      enrollment into new research protocols throughout the NGB and other NIH laboratories.
      Evaluating and diagnosing participants will allow the NGB specialists to maintain their
      expertise and gain additional knowledge of the course of various neurological disorders. The
      information obtained will allow for the evaluation and diagnosis of the studied neurological
      diseases. This understanding may lead to ideas for future protocols. In some cases, blood or
      other biologic samples (including urine, saliva, or a cheek (buccal) swab) will be obtained
      for future laboratory studies.

      STUDY POPULATION

      The number of participants to be enrolled will be set to 3,500 participants with neurological
      diseases and their unaffected relatives.

      DESIGN:

      This is an observational diagnostic study of multiple neurological diseases and their
      pathophysiology.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      No formal outcomes will be measured; however the clinical assessments of enrolled
      participants can be used to characterize the disease manifestations. In addition, DNA samples
      obtained may be used to identify and verify causative mutations as well as identify novel
      genes, which may help establish pathogenic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations.
