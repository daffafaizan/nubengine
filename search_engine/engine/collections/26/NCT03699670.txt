      hemodynamic and / or respiratory instability and need resuscitation and / or hemostasis
      immediate act before a complete exhaustive work-up can be realized. Usually this is a whole
      body CT scan. These gestures are guided by imaging examinations (extensive focused ultrasound
      [eFAST] +/- chest X-ray +/- pelvis X-ray) which are less accurate but faster at the patient's
      bedside. The ability of extended focused ultrasound to properly guide immediate resuscitation
      and hemostasis should be evaluated to assess effectiveness and safety of the method.

      This trial is a national prospective cohort (6 French centers). Each participant will benefit
      from an initial lesion work-up by clinical examination, followed by an extended focused
      ultrasound (eFAST including abdominal ultrasound [right upper, left upper, and suprapubic
      quadrant], bilateral anterior and lateral pleuropulmonary ultrasound, sub-xyphoid pericardial
      ultrasound, transcranial Doppler), and possibly chest and pelvis frontal x-ray.

      Based on clinical, radiographic and ultrasound data, the investigator will decide to perform
      immediate resuscitation and haemostasis gestures, or therapeutic abstention, before the
      realization of the complete lesion work-up by whole body CT scan.

      This study could validate and strengthen the place of ultrasound in the initial severe
      traumatic patients' care and seems to be the continuity of the Peytel et al. research,
      studying new modalities of the eFAST. Our study could extend the scope and the conclusions of
      the Peytel et al. study to what is routinely done in the French and European Trauma Centers.
