    
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study. 60 men and women over the age
      of 55 with indications of pre-diabetes will be recruited for participation and randomly
      assigned to one of four 12 week exercise training programs: 1)Supervised aerobic exercise 3
      days per week followed by a carbohydrate drink along with daily oral administration of
      Metformin. 2) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a protein drink along
      with daily oral administration of Metformin. 3) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week
      followed by a carbohydrate drink along with daily oral administration of matching placebo. 4)
      Supervised aerobic exercise 3 days per week followed by a protein drink along with daily oral
      administration of placebo.

      Daily administration of Metformin will begin as one 500 mg tablet for the first week and will
      increase by 500 mg/day/week until reaching 2000 mg/day by week 4 during a 12 week exercise
      training program. The titration dosing scheme and taking metformin/placebo with meals will
      help reduce the most common side effects (i.e.,gastrointestinal discomfort). If participants
      experience gastrointestinal discomfort, the dose will be lowered to 1500 mg/day.
