    
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common preventable and treatable disease
      characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive. The diagnosis
      requires an evidence of obstructive pattern by spirometry measured before and after
      bronchodilators.

      The degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction differs between patients, and does not
      predict the response to bronchodilator therapy. It can be seen in terms of forced vital
      capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1),or Inspiratory capacity
      (IC) or residual volume (RV).
