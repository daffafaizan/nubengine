      by SARS-Cov-2, it is justified to urgently conduct tests with possible antiviral drugs. The
      high molecular weight heparin (HMWH) (heparin enriched by ultrafiltration process) proposed
      by this study, has a potential inhibition activity over viral replication, demonstrated by
      preliminary in vitro tests, carried out in a model established in partnership with the
      Laboratory of Clinical and Molecular Virology (LVCM) of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences
      of the University of São Paulo (ICB-USP).

      Along with the findings in the literature, such as the study carried out by Phelps, M.K. et
      al (2020), among others, the use of inhaled heparin presents adequate levels of safety to be
      used in a clinical trial. Taking into account that the dose of high molecular weight heparin
      (enriched by this study team) with antiviral activity in vitro is much lower than the doses
      currently presented in published clinical trials using inhaled UFH, we have the safety
      premise to carry out this study. The intentions of this study differ from what has been
      presented in the world literature so far, as it does not aim to induce anticoagulation, nor
      to effectively inhibit the formation of pulmonary fibrin, but rather, to act as an inhibitor
      of viral replication.

      Also, as characteristics of the product to be tested, this heparin (HMWH) is presented in a
      buffered solution free of low-sulfated low-weight molecules, which is obtained in a sterile
      environment through ultrafiltration of the unfractionated solution of porcine origin
      available in Brazil (Hemofol - Cristália) using Centriprep-10kDa® centrifuge filter
      (Millipore ™) used as recommended by the manufacturer.

      The high molecular weight heparin (HMWH) - enriched heparin - had two process patents filed,
      one under the description "HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT DEFINITION HEPARINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS", BR
      102014027804-4 A2 - granted by the Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industrial (INPI) and
      another with the description "COMPOSITION OF HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT NON-FRACTIONAL HEPARINE
      FOR ANTIVIRAL ACTION ", BR 102020 011964-8 - deposited at INPI.
