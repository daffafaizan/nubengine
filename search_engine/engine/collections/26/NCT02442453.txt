      oxidative stress associated with chronic periodontitis.The objectives were-1) To evaluate the
      presence of oxidative stress by biochemical evaluation of SOD levels and free radical damage
      in the form of MDA levels in whole saliva of chronic periodontitis patients.

      2) To show efficacy of curcuma longa gel as topical antioxidant agent on activity of SOD and
      lipid peroxidation product MDA.

      3) To compare SOD and MDA levels after SRP and SRP plus topical application of curcuma longa
      gel.

      4) To compare the clinical parameters such as Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Sulcus
      bleeding index (SBI), Probing depth (PD), Clinical attachment level (CAL) between test group
      (TG) and control group (CG).
