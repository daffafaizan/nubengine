      consist of healthy, able-bodied individuals with no history of lower extremity trauma. The
      second group (Group 2) will consist of individuals with unilateral, below-knee functional
      deficits that require an AFO for daily activities (e.g. fracture, muscle and/or nerve injury,
      ankle arthritis, or peripheral neurologic disease).

      We will obtain a brief medical history to identify major medical conditions or prior injuries
      that could influence limb geometry and lead to reliance on an AFO for Group 2 participants.

      A 3D representation of each participant's lower limb geometry will be obtained using a
      Structure Core scanner (Occipital, Inc.), which uses an infrared structured light projector
      to construct a 3D image of an object. The scanner is connected to an iPad; to operate the
      scanner, the user rotates the iPad camera around the desired object. In seconds, the entire
      geometry is digitally reconstructed. Measurements will be evaluated using digital imaging
      analysis software (Standard Cyborg, Inc.). The different conditions being tested are full
      weight bearing, partial weight bearing, and non-weight bearing. The effect of limb loading on
      multiple measures of limb geometry will be evaluated. Limb measurements will include 1) width
      of the metatarsal heads, 2) width of the calcaneus, 3) foot length, 4) foot height, 5) arch
      height, 6) medial-lateral width between ankle malleoli, 7) minimum circumference above the
      ankle malleoli, 8) maximum calf circumference , 9) medial-lateral width of the knee condyles
      10) anterior-posterior width at mid patellar tendon, 11) distance from bottom of foot to
      tibial tubercle.
