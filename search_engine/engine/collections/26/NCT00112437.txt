      Participants who completed 12 months of the base study and 12 months of the first extension
      were invited to continue in three additional extensions: MK0-822-004-10, which extended the
      study to 36 months, MK-0822-004-20 (NCT00112437) which extended the study to 60 months, and
      MK-0822-004-30 (NCT00112437), which extended the study to 120 months.

        -  In the first extension, participants continued to receive the same treatment they
           received in the 12-month base study.

        -  In the second extension, participants were re-randomized to odanacatib 50 mg OW or
           placebo OW for 12 months.

        -  In the third extension, participants who were initially randomized to odanacatib 3 mg or
           placebo OW in the base study received odanacatib 50 mg weekly in Years 4 and 5; all
           other participants remained on the same treatment they were during Year 3.

        -  In the fourth extension, all participants received odanacatib weekly in Years 6-10.
