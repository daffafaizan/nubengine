      screening for active TB (Screen TB)

      Population: A total of 800 people presenting at primary health care clinics with presumed
      active pulmonary tuberculosis, aged 18 to 70 years, male or female gender, will be recruited.
      They should be willing to give informed, written consent, including consent for HIV testing.
      They should have symptoms that could be compatible with active TB (cough > two weeks, plus at
      least one of the following: fever, weight loss, haemoptysis and night sweats). Participants
      should not have been on TB treatment for the past 90 days and should not have received immune
      suppressive therapy, be known with alcohol of drug abuse, have a haemoglobin level <9g/dl or
      be pregnant or breastfeeding. HIV co-infection is not an exclusion criterion. Participants
      will be recruited from primary health care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa, Windhoek in
      Namibia, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Banjul in The Gambia and Kampala in Uganda.

      Number of Sites: Five sites

      Study Duration: 3 years

      Subject Duration: 18 months for TB cases, 2 months for non-TB cases

      Objectives:

      The overall objective of the study is to incorporate a six-marker serum signature into a
      multiplex UCP-LFA format, referred to as TransDot, for finger-prick blood testing. The end
      point of the study is the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the UCP-LFA TransDot test
      on finger-prick blood for active TB and will be prospectively compared against gold standard
      composite diagnostic criteria (GeneXpert, MGIT culture, TB sputum smear, CXR, TB symptom
      screen and response to TB treatment).
