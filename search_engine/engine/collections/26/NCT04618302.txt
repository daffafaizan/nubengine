      diffusing capacity measurements for nitric oxide (DLNO) in healthy individuals during light
      and moderate intensity cycling exercise. Healthy subjects will perform repeated single-breath
      DLNO measurements during light (i.e., at 50% of the first ventilatory threshold) and moderate
      intensity exercise (i.e., 80% of the first ventilatory threshold) on a stationary cycle
      ergometer.
