      However, the field lacks a clear understanding of how liquids of different consistencies
      behave during swallowing. In order to improve understanding of the effectiveness of altered
      liquid consistency for improving dysphagia, the investigators are studying liquid flow
      through the oropharynx. This study explores this question in individuals with spinal cord
      injury. Participants will swallow 20% w/v barium thickened to different consistencies (thin,
      slightly thick, mildly thick, moderately thick and extremely thick) using commercially
      available food thickeners. Swallowing will be observed under videofluoroscopy. Simultaneous
      measures of airflow via nasal cannula will be used to study respiratory-swallow coordination
      in this study sample.
