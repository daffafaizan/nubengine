      subjects' characteristics will be documented by a locally validated questionnaire. Allergy
      skin prick tests, spirometry, methacholine inhalation test and induced sputum will also be
      done. Asthma and rhinitis control will be evaluated by locally validated questionnaires, the
      Asthma Control Scoring System (ACSS) and the Rhinitis Control Scoring System (RCSS),
      respectively. Nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) and oral peak expiratory flow (PEF) will
      also be recorded to obtain the nasal blockage index (NBI). On the second visit, nasal
      biopsies will be taken.
