        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol and
           docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and duration of response in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and flavopiridol IV continuously over
      24 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and flavopiridol until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-11
      months.
