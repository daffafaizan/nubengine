      replacement, flapping defects appear as complications in the long-term course, so-called
      paravalvular / paraprothetic leaks (PVL). In some patients, due to the severity of the
      defect, a new procedure is required - with a not inconsiderable disease or even mortality
      risk. For a number of years, the catheter-based closure of the defect has been increasingly
      used by means of the implantation of plug-devices as a new treatment method for patients with
      a high surgical risk. The existing data on the operation method and safety of the method
      already used at some centers are promising. In order to demonstrate the clinical routine of
      patients with an interventional occlusion of a PVL in a timely manner, the Stiftung IHF
      Ludwigshafen will publish a multicentric register entitled "Deutsches Plug Register" The goal
      is, among other things, the documentation of patient characteristics, indications, and
      complications of treated patients.The German Heart Foundation promotes the setting up of the
      plug register.

      In this time, 200 patients with valve prosthesis defects, with which the indication for plug
      implantation was placed prospectively and retrospectively, are to be included in the
      register.
