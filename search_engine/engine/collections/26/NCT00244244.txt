      stress. Arimoclomol extends survival by five weeks when given both pre-symptomatically and at
      disease onset in a mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic mouse model of ALS.
      Furthermore, it has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects
      in other rat models of nerve damage. Molecular chaperone proteins are critical in the
      cellular response to stress and protein misfolding. Recent data suggest that the SOD1
      mutation responsible for ALS in some patients with familial disease reduces the availability
      of a variety of molecular chaperones, and thus weakens their ability to respond to cellular
      stress. Protein misfolding and consequent aggregation may play a role in the pathogenesis of
      both the familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Therapeutic agents such as arimoclomol that
      improve cellular chaperone response to protein misfolding may be helpful in ALS.
