      that of the U.S. Cigarette smoking has been identified as the most significant risk factor
      for bladder cancer, followed by occupational exposures to chemicals such as aromatic amines
      and their derivatives, diesel exhaust, oil mist, pesticides, and polynuclear aromatic
      hydrocarbons. A variety of non-occupational exposures have been suggested as potential risk
      factors as well, including smoking black vs. blond tobacco, dietary factors, certain
      medications and medical conditions, chlorination by-products in drinking water, and fluid
      intake. Various genetic polymorphisms also appear to affect bladder cancer risk. Research is
      needed to further explore hypotheses generated by previous etiologic studies of bladder
      cancer. An ongoing study of bladder cancer survival by the Institut Municipal d'Investigacio
      Medica in Spain provides an excellent opportunity for NCI to perform such research. NCI will
      build upon the ongoing study by funding an interdisciplinary case-control component to
      evaluate bladder cancer risk in relation to various external factors (e.g., occupational and
      environmental exposure) and host factors (e.g., genetic susceptibility marker, and early
      effect markers). This hospital-based case-control study will involve personal interviews
      using a state-of-the-art, computer-assisted technique, and collection of blood and toenail
      samples from participants.
