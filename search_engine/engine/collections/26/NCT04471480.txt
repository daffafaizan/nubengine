      In recent years, although the level of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy of esophageal
      cancer has improved, and studies have confirmed the role of anlotinib and PD-1 mAb in the
      posterior line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the prognosis of esophageal
      cancer is still not ideal. How to expand the clinical benefits of immunotherapy in esophageal
      cancer has become a research hotspot. Recent studies have shown that PD-1 mAb combined with
      other therapies with different mechanisms can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. In the
      impawer150 study, platinum containing dual drug chemotherapy plus anti angiogenesis therapy
      combined with immunotherapy showed statistically and clinically significant PFS benefits in
      the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, which provides a new choice
      for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. So far, there is no
      report on the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with
      platinum containing dual drug chemotherapy plus anti angiogenesis drugs combined with
      immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin plus
      cisplatin in the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer.
