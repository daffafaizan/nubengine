    
      Rationale A) primary endpoint

        1. to verify the safety of protein sparing modified fast by enteral route ( EMF )in cycles
           of ten days/months repeated for six months,

        2. To compare EMF with oral PSMF clinically ( appetite control, polmonary function tests
           and metabolic pattern) and on metabolic parameters (hypertension, glucose intolerance,
           dyslipidaemia) maintaining body composition (particularly fat free mass and muscular
           strength) in 15 patients with disease-causing obesity not responding to medical
           treatment and/or cognitive/behavioural therapy, who are candidates for invasive
           treatment such as the gastric balloon or surgery but do not intend to undergo them
           compared with 15 undergoing the same regimen without the naso-gastric tube. To verify
           the effects of treatment with regard to the enteral-hormonal structure during the acute
           phase (selected sub-group) and while undergoing treatment.

      B) Secondary endpoints:

        1. To verify the percentage of patients who maintain the weight reached 6 months after
           stopping treatment with the naso-gastric tube associated with a high-calorie
           normal-protein diet.

        2. Verify clinical safety of EN in these patients.
