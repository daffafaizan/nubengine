      A total of 7 dosage groups were set at this stage, which were 5 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, 40
      mg/m2, 60 mg/m2, 90 mg/m2, and 120 mg/m2, respectively. Accelerated dosage titration was
      performed in the first 3 dose groups, 1 subject was enrolled in each group; the last 4 dose
      groups were perfromed into dosage groups by the principle of "3+3" dose increment rule, and
      the number of subjects enrolled in each group is 3 to 6 cases.

      Dose extension:

      According to the test results of the dose escalation phase, two extensions of MTD (tentative
      60 mg/m2, 90 mg/m2) were selected for the expansion trial. Each dose level was planned to
      enroll 6 subjects (12 in total), subjects were administered once every 3 weeks (1 treatment
      cycle every 3 weeks), and received 4 treatment cycles in a row for Hemay102. Safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and initial anti-tumor efficacy were
      evaluated.
