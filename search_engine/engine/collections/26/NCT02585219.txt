      advanced MRI will consist of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging by contrast
      technique (DSC) and spectroscopy (MRS). The post-operative MRI and PET scan will be produced
      within 48 hours after surgery (with the aim that operative effects are not visible on the
      baseline scan). This corresponds to the current practice of conventional MRI follow-up at the
      end of the radiotherapy.

      The comparison with the pre-operative scan is to assess the viability of the post-operative
      scan. It will assessed whether the preoperative tumor uptake will disappear in accordance to
      the resection, as shown by the advanced MRI sequences. In addition, it will be assessed
      whether there are no interfering postoperative effects. The 11C-MET-PET scans will be
      interpreted in comparison with the quantitative results obtained with advanced MRI sequences
      (perfusion / diffusion / oxygenation / spectroscopy). If an immediate postoperative
      11C-MET-PET proves to be feasible, than this will provide a basis for further research. This
      future research consist out of the differentiation between tumor progression and therapy
      change, one of the most urgent clinical dilemmas in neuro-oncology.
