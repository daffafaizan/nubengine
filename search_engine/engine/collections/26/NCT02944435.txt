      manufacturing of CB-839. Previous studies have used a capsule formulation of CB-839. This
      study will enable a PK comparison between CB-839 capsules and CB-839 tablets.

      This is a Phase 1, comparative, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover PK comparability
      study of CB-839 administered as capsule and tablet formulations in healthy adult subjects.
      Serial blood samples for PK analyses will be collected over a 24 hour period after each
      administration of CB-839. All subjects will be monitored for safety throughout their
      participation in the study.
