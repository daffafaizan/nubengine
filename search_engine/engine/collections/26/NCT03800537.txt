      studies to determine whether they can provide better, faster and more useful information for
      clinical diagnosis. Quantitative MRI has been a continuous interest in the MRI community, but
      extremely challenging due to long acquisition times and sensitivity to motion. Recently, the
      investigators have introduced a novel MRI data acquisition approach, namely MR Fingerprinting
      (MRF), for simultaneous measurement of several important parameters in a single MRI scan.

      In this study, the investigators propose to apply MR Fingerprinting at UNC and evaluate its
      performance for different neurological diseases. The investigators hypothesize that the
      quantitative MR imaging technique will lead to improved tissue characterization and
      diagnosis.
