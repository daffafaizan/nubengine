      and clinic records such as patient databases (convenience selection) and invited to
      participate in the study. After having signed and dated the informed consent form, they will
      receive an appointment for a screening visit, during which they will undergo an ophthalmic
      examination and review of their medical and ophthalmic history as well as prior and current
      treatments. The eye at higher risk of disease progression will be selected for the study if
      both eyes are eligible.

      On study day 0 (SD0), subjects will receive TF for a 24-hour recording of the profile of
      ocular dimensional changes, starting between 11 am and 3 pm, with simultaneous recording of
      24-hour blood pressure (BP). The recordings will be carried out in ambulatory conditions with
      the subjects pursuing as close to normal daily activities as possible. Subject activities
      will be captured in a logbook. After completion of the recording, subjects will receive an
      ophthalmic exam to exclude or adequately address any side effects and provide the logbook to
      the investigator.

      At 3-month intervals following the TF recording until 2 years after the TF recording,
      follow-up visits will be scheduled for assessment of the visual field (VF), the retinal nerve
      fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT), optic disc photo and
      intraocular pressure (IOP). 24-hour TF recording (starting at the same time as on SD0) will
      be performed at 1 and 2 years and, if glaucoma subjects undergo a glaucoma surgery in the
      follow-up period, an additional 24-hour TF profile will be recorded approximately 3 months
      after the intervention (again starting at the same time as on SD0).
