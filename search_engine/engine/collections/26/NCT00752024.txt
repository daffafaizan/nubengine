      choices in the treatment of a large-scale deep supratentorial intracerebral hematoma. It uses
      hardware access technology, in a relatively short time to enter the hematoma center, with
      suction liquefaction technology. It has the advantage of a higher clearance rate of the
      hematoma, simple convenience, small trauma and low-cost. We carry on the suitable improvement
      in this technology's foundation in view of its deficiency, the introduction of the concept of
      the individual, will further reduce the rate of bleeding and mortality, improve survival,
      such as long-term quality of life.

      We will adopt scales such as the rate of rebleeding, mortality, complication,NIHSS, MRS, BI,
      GOS scale to analysis and evaluating efficacy and safety of this technology and conservative
      treatment in the treatment of HICH.
