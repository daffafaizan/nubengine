    
      OVERVIEW: This Phase I/II study is designed to first identify doses of MLN9708 and
      bendamustine that are associated with an acceptable adverse event profile when delivered
      together in 28-day cycles. Additionally, the study aims to assess the efficacy of the
      combination in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Responders (stable disease
      or more),will continue to receive up to eight cycles total in the absence of further
      progressive disease.

      OVERVIEW OF THE DOSE ESCALATION/DE-ESCALATION: This study aims to assess the combination's
      efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Responders (stable disease or
      more) will continue to receive up to eight cycles total in the absence of further progressive
      disease. The dose of MLN9708 will be fixed at 4 mg given on days 1, 8 and 15. Dexamethasone
      will be administered at 40 mg (oral) on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 28 day cycle. Dexamethasone
      administered as 40 mg oral on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 28 day cycle. Three doses of bendamustine
      will be evaluated (Dose 1: 70 mg/m^2, days 1 and 2; Dose 2: 80 mg/m^2. days 1 and 2; and Dose
      3: 90 mg/m^2, days 1 and 2).

      PHASE 1 DESIGN: A 3+3 design was employed. At each dose, three patients were initially
      evaluated. When no dose limiting toxicities were observed, the bendamustine dose will be
      increased.

      PHASE 2 DESIGN: Design for Phase II portion of study: The MTD or a recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for the combination. The plan is to treat additional patients at that dose to assess
      efficacy and response to treatment. The investigators plan to enroll 19 patients (including
      those treated at the MTD in Phase I).
