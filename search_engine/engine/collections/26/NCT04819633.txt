      obesity has already been shown in their development. Higher levels of serum sestrin proteins
      have already been associated with DNA damage, hypoxia and oxidative stress and sestrin plays
      an important role in autophagia. In order to evaluate the role of serum sestrin in the
      development of leiomyomas 30 patients between 18-45 years of age who were diagnosed with
      uterine leiomyomas with transvaginal ultrasonography will be included in the study group.
      Their serum sestrin levels will be determined and compared with that of 30 healthy subjects
      recruited during the same study period at the same clinic.
