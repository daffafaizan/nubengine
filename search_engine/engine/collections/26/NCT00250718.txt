      chlorambucil, dexamethasone, and vincristine is for patients who have blood cancers that have
      returned or not responded to prior treatment. Some patients may also receive a medication
      called rituximab if their doctor thinks it is appropriate. This drug combination will be
      given to study participants in a low dose continuous basis. The study will also collect
      information about the side effects of the above drug combination on patients with these types
      of cancers. Previous studies on patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma indicate that some
      patients treated with this drug combination achieved a high response. The aim of this study
      is to test this drug combination in a controlled setting.
