        -  To perform pooled DNA sequencing in 56 genes from the genomic DNA of unaffected children
           and matched non-tumor and blast DNA from patients with high-risk (HR) acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) enrolled on COG HR ALL protocols.

        -  To identify loci enriched for genetic variation between DNA of unaffected children and
           DNA of these patients.

        -  To individually validate novel, putatively functional single nucleotide polymorphisms
           (SNPs) identified via pooled sequencing with another genotyping platform.

        -  To correlate HR ALL with clinical phenotypes, co-morbidities, toxicities, outcomes to
           the genes or pathways found to harbor a significant increase in genetic variation.

      OUTLINE: DNA specimens from unaffected children (pool 1) and from patients with non-tumor
      (pool 2) and leukemia blasts (pool 3) are analyzed for genetic pathophysiology of pre-B acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia by microarray and PCR assays. Sequencing is performed on each of the 3
      PCR pools of DNA.
