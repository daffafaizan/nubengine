      questionnaire was created in accordance to existing literature. The questionnaire was
      translated in several languages by bilingual people familiar with mountain biking. The
      questionnaire focussed on demographic data, training volume, number of races per year, number
      of injuries since practising mountain biking, wearing of protective gear items and accident
      mechanism. The survey was conducted during the Swiss Epic Mountain Bike Event in 2017. All
      riders were asked to voluntarily participate in the survey.
