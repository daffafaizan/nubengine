      in asthmatic subjects aged 5-11 years of age. Fluticasone furoate is currently under
      development as the inhaled corticosteroid component of a combination product containing an
      inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist.

      The study will be a randomized two-way crossover, with a placebo control. During each
      treatment period subjects will receive a daily dose via a novel dry powder inhaler for 14
      days. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited to this study, with the aim that 20 will
      complete the study. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and serum cortisol levels will be
      investigated.
