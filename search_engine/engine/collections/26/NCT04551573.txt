    
      Subjects will receive once-daily Biktarvy for 4 weeks to ensure all moieties of interest
      reach steady-state prior to the baseline PK assessment. Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled
      in one of two groups for PK analysis as follows:

      Group one will continue Biktarvy and have rifapentine dosed daily for 4 weeks (10 mg/kg;
      600mg dose).

      Group two will continue Biktarvy and have rifapentine dosed weekly for 4 weeks (15 mg/kg;
      900mg dose).

      After 4 weeks of Biktarvy dosing, subjects will have a baseline intensive PK of plasma
      bictegravir (BIC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), tenofovir (TFV) levels at all time points,
      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be collected at 24 hours post-dose for IC
      TFV-DP. This will occur prior to receiving their first dose of directly observed oral
      rifapentine co-administered with Biktarvy, thus serving as their own control. Rifapentine
      will thereafter be administered by directly observed therapy (DOT) or ingestion monitored by
      smart phone application (e.g., Time Stamp App or other phone app platform). Intensive PK
      assessments will be repeated after 4 weeks of RPT dosing for both Group 1 and 2.

      Intensive PK sampling will be performed at time 0 (pre-dose), 15 and 30 min; 1, 2, 3, 4, 8,
      12 and 24 hours post-dose with BIC/TAF/FTC alone and when coadministered with rifapentine.
      Plasma will be isolated at all time points, and PBMCs will be isolated at 24 hours post-dose.

      PK levels will be measured by colleagues at the Colorado Antiviral Pharmacology (CAVP)
      Laboratory at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Plasma concentrations of
      BIC, TAF, TFV, and IC TFV-DP in PBMCs will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry.
