      toxicity) after exposure to a number of pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical agents. Past
      experience with the survey used in this study has indicated that consumers and health
      professional perform about the same. Most individuals answer less than 50% of questions
      incorrectly.

      Pharmacy students will be asked to participate in a short (5-7 minutes) survey (see below)
      that contains 21-short cases involving an exposure to a pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical
      agent. All cases involve children less than 19 years of age. Participants will be asked to
      indicate their year in pharmacy school (1st or 2nd) and their gender (f/m). The survey will
      be given after a scheduled examination or other classroom activity and will not involve class
      time. Students will be provided a link to an online version of the survey.

      Conclusions will be derived through the analysis of the data. At a later date, all students
      in the class (whether they participated in the survey or not)students will be provided a link
      to video that describes the correct answers to each of the cases and an explanation.
