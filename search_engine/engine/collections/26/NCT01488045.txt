      the evaluation of multiple medical conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite its
      widespread use, there continues to be debate concerning the best pharmacologic approach to
      patient satisfaction and discomfort of the procedure and to minimize side effects.

      Aim Two standard pharmacologic (Propofol or Fentanyl and low-dose Midazolam) approaches for
      colonoscopy will be evaluated systematically to determine if these two approaches are
      equivalent in terms of patient rating of satisfaction and patient discomfort to the procedure
      and side effects

      Study Design This is a prospective randomized study of 262 participants undergoing outpatient
      colonoscopy at an independent academic medical center. The primary outcome of this study is
      participant's satisfaction, and the secondary outcome is discomfort of the patient as
      perceived by the physician performing the procedure.

      Other Variables of Interest.

        -  Duration of procedure as defined by time the patient arrives in the room to the time the
           patient is appropriate for discharge.

        -  Difficulty of procedure rated by the physician on a scale of 0-10

        -  Colonoscopy completion rates (intubation of cecum).

        -  Complications including oxygen desaturation or hypotension.

        -  Cost of the two medication regiments
