    
      Enrollment will occur in sequential, ascending, dose-sequence design, where a higher CC-930
      dose level and longer duration of dosing (cohort) will not be initiated until supportive
      safety profile is demonstrated in the preceding cohort. There will be 4 cohorts as described
      here;

      Cohort 1: 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks Cohort 2: 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks Cohort 3: 100
      mg once daily for 6 weeks Cohort 4: 100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks
