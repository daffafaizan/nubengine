      I. To provide a source of CD34-selected stem cells for patients with malignant and
      nonmalignant disorders undergoing bone marrow transplantation from haploidentical (human
      leukocyte antigen [HLA]-mismatched) related donors or HLA-compatible unrelated donors

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Monitoring the safety of the CD34-selected stem cells for the recipient, as measured by
      adverse events related to stem cell infusion, incidence of engraftment of neutrophils and
      platelets, incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, and one year overall survival, disease-free
      survival, and primary disease recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Donor stem cells undergo CD34 selection ex vivo using the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System using
      standard operating procedures (SOPs) from the manufacturer. Recipients undergo standard of
      care preparative regimen, bone marrow transplantation with CD34-selected peripheral blood
      stem cells via infusion over 1 to 2 hours on day 0, and then receive standard of care GVHD
      prophylaxis.

      After completion of study treatment, recipients are followed up at least once weekly while
      inpatient until transplant day 100, every 1-3 months for the first year and yearly
      thereafter.
