      temperatures to induce an apoptotic and inflammatory response and consequent adipocyte death
      in the treated area. Although the practice of this technique has been increasing, there are
      some gaps in the literature about the exact mechanism of action and only a few randomized
      clinical trials that proves its effectiveness and safety. Then, the aim of this study is to
      analyse the effects of cryolipolysis on localized fat on women's abdomen. This is a
      randomized controlled clinical trial that will include 28 women who will be randomized to
      Control Group (CG) or Intervention Group (IG). The CG will perform the Evaluation Protocol
      with the following assessments: ultrasonography, thermographic analysis, blood analysis,
      bioimpedance and measurement of skinfold and abdominal circumference. The IG will receive a
      single cryolipolysis's session on lower abdomen and the Evaluation Protocol. The follow up
      for both groups is 90 days. Expected main result at the end of the study is the reduction of
      the local subcutaneous fat tissue.
