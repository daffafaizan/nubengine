      ameliorate the distress and disability caused by psychotic illnesses. The TIPS project in
      Scandinavia used a combination of public and targeted education campaigns coupled with rapid
      availability of comprehensive services to improve the identification, referral and early
      treatment of psychotic illness. By targeting the dual 'bottlenecks' of inadequate mental
      health literacy and delayed access to effective treatment, TIPS significantly reduced DUP2
      and experimentally demonstrated improved clinical presentations and outcomes.

      Effective service models for new onset psychosis exist in the U.S. Multi-element specialty
      'first-episode' services (FES), highlighted in this FOA, provide care that is adapted to the
      specific needs of younger patients and their families and can improve symptoms and functional
      outcomes during the critical early phase of psychotic illnesses. The NIH-funded Specialized
      Treatment in Early Psychosis (STEP, New Haven) project, included the first U.S.-based
      randomized controlled trial to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of a public-sector
      approach to FES.5 The Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis (PREP, Boston) clinic has
      advanced a similar model of care within an analogous public-academic collaboration.

      What is required, as the next logical step, is a test of the effectiveness of TIPS' powerful
      approach to early detection in a policy-relevant U.S. setting, where relatively fragmented
      pathways to care raise both the challenges and potential public health impact of early
      detection. The expertise within the investigators investigative team in the design of early
      detection and the presence of 2 similar, effective, geographically separated and
      collaborative FES programs (STEP and PREP) presents an excellent opportunity to conduct such
      a test and thereby advance secondary prevention for psychotic illnesses in the U.S.
