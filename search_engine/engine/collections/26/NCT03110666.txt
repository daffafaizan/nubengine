      treatment for knee osteoarthritis with injections of bone marrow concentrate (BMC),obtained
      from the Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentration System (BioCUE) at the bone-cartilage interface
      via percutaneous injections. The PerFuse system will also be evaluated to determine if it can
      be used to deliver the BMC to the osseous sites. Follow-up is 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.
