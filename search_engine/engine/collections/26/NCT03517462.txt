      treatment. Previous studies have been unable to fully assess clearance Mf from the posterior
      chamber of the eye. This study will be the first to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) in
      patients with onchocerciasis to document parasites and pathology in the anterior and
      posterior chambers of the eye, and assess ocular changes following standard ivermectin
      treatment.

      This will be a biomedical prospective cohort study.

      The cohort will be stratified based on Mf levels to achieve approximately the following
      distribution of individuals with roughly one-third of participants in each group.

        1. Individuals with positive skin snip Mf density of ≥ 1 Mf/mg), but no observable Mf in
           eyes using slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy

        2. Individuals with positive skin snip Mf density of ≥ 1 Mf/mg and 1-10 Mf in either eye at
           baseline (based on the highest number counted in either eye)

        3. Individuals with positive skin snip Mf density of ≥ 1 Mf/mg and >10 Mf in either eye at
           baseline.

      All participants recruited into the study will be treated with a single dose of ivermectin
      (150 ug/kg) by mouth under direct observation. This is the standard of care for treatment
      with onchocerciasis.

      Participants will be evaluated following treatment with detailed parasitological and ocular
      examinations 7 days, 3 months and 6 months after treatment.
