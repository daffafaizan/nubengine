      catheterization. Monitoring heart failure patients is challenging in many. The study will
      enroll patients undergoing right heart catheterization (RHC) for the evaluation of heart
      failure and PHTN, based on the regular clinical practice. The regular indices as the right
      ventricle pressure (RVP), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure
      (PAWP), and cardiac output will be measured with the Swan Ganz Catheter and recorded.

      Noninvasive measurement of the respiratory flow will be acquired by a medical approved
      flow-meter that is mounted on a simple plastic breathing mask.

      Non-invasive system that includes three accelerometers that are attached to the chest and
      epigastrium of the patient will be used to measure respiratory chest wall dynamics.

      Through evaluating the correlation between the invasive and non-invasive measurements the
      study intends to prove the ability of the non-invasive system to provide the required
      information.
