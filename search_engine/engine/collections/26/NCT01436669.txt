      which will allow cancer patients receiving chemotherapy to test their blood count at home
      (haemoglobin, haematocrit, white cell count and neutrophil count). The system will also allow
      patients to record their temperature and symptoms. The Philips home telemonitoring system is
      called the Zodiac and consists of a telecommunications hub connected to a haematology
      analyser. The Hub connects to medical device software running on a remote server which
      controls the flow of information between the Hub and the clinician. This is designed to
      enable the patient to self test their full blood count in their home and transmit the data
      remotely to a clinician for review. In addition to testing their full blood count, the
      patients can input their temperature and any symptoms they have onto the device. The
      clinician will then be able to send appropriate instructions back to the patient. The Philips
      Zodiac system can also send a preprogrammed automated message based on the results of
      testing.
