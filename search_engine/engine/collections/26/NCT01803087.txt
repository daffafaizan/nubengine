    
      The proposed clinical pharmacology study is aimed to investigate the systemic availability of
      BDP/B17MP (active metabolite of BDP) and formoterol after single oral inhalation of CHF 1535
      100/6 pMDI (to reach a total dose of BDP 400 µg and formoterol 24 µg) with and without spacer
      device (AeroChamber Plus™) and in comparison to a free combination of BDP pMDI plus
      formoterol pMDI licensed products (to reach the same total dose of BDP and formoterol) in
      adolescent asthmatic patients. The systemic exposure to BDP/B17MP and formoterol after
      inhalation of CHF 1535 pMDI in adolescents will be additionally compared to the systemic
      exposure in adults without the spacer device.

      The chosen doses correspond to the maximum daily dose of the two components administered as
      fixed combination.
