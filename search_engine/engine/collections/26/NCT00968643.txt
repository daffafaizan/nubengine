      Primary

        -  To compare the response in patients with malignant spinal cord compression treated with
           single fraction (10 Gy) radiotherapy vs standard multiple fraction (20 Gy) radiotherapy.

        -  To compare the toxicity of these treatment regimens in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Examine the safety, practicability, and efficacy of treatment with a single 10 Gy
           fraction of radiotherapy in these patients.

        -  Analyze the initial neurological status, document the response to treatment, and
           calculate median survival of these patients.

        -  Perform an economic impact analysis comparing the two treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Patients undergo radiotherapy to the area of spinal cord compression
           once daily for 5 days (total of 20 Gy).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo a single fraction of radiotherapy to the area of spinal cord
           compression (total of 10 Gy).

      Patients complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 quality-of-life questionnaire at baseline, at 5 weeks,
      and then every 3 months thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 5 weeks, at 3 months,
      and then every 3 months thereafter.
