      (MR-HIFU) is an effective technique for alleviating the pain associated with bone metastases
      in paediatric cancer patients. This technique meant to be an adjunct therapy to the
      standard-of-care, which includes radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Safety of the technique
      will be assessed through evaluating non-targeted heating using MRI-based temperature mapping,
      and inspecting patients post-treatment for skin burns. or other signs of serious adverse
      events. Efficacy of the technique will be assessed by evaluating/recording patients observed
      pain, quality of life, and pain medication usage both before and up to 3 months following
      treatment.
