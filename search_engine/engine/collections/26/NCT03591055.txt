    
      Objective: To design and evaluate the implementation and impact of a multimodal intervention
      focused on elderly patients living in the community in preventing or delaying frailty,
      functional decline and risk of institutionalization, hospitalization and death.

      Design: Study in two phases: a qualitative study to develop the intervention and a randomized
      clinical trial with parallel arms and control group.

      Intervention: Participants in the control group will receive the usual standard care and
      regular referrals. Patients in the intervention group will be first derived to a nurse case
      manager for initial application of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Then
      patient-centered interventions will be prescribed, according to the different target areas
      identified in the geriatric assessment, along with medication review, aerobics exercise plan
      and memory workshops following the model adapted in Phase I.

      After 3 and 18 months, measures of functional and cognitive performance, quality of life,
      frailty, adverse outcomes (institutionalization, hospitalization, death) and health care
      costs will be collected.
