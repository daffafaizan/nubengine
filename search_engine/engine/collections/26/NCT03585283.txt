      27.2% female and 17.4% in male population. Approximately 1/3 of acute onset neck aches become
      chronic. It causes increasing the cost of treatment and also the loss of labor.

      Myofascial pain is usually considered caused by myofascial trigger points. The trigger points
      in the neck muscles have been associated with a possible source of referred facial and
      cranial pain. Mechanical neck pain is a non-radicular pain caused by local musculoskeletal
      structures and is characterized by a spasm of the cervical muscles. Posture, emotional
      stress, cold and fatigue are etiologic causes, and pain is also reflected to the cervical,
      occipital and scapular regions depending on the severity of muscle spasm and the presence of
      trigger point in myofascial pain syndrome.

      Myofascial releasing is a specific type of passive soft tissue mobilization. Triggers points
      often considered as a pathology that occurs after excessive load or trauma on soft tissue
      which disturbs blood circulation. Fascial restriction can be found with triggers points and
      taut band.

      In this study effects of myofascial release on triggers points will be investigated.
