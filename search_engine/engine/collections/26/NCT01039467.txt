      adverse effects in patients, particularly those with intact or intermittent atrioventricular
      (AV) conduction.

      Medtronic Adapta® pacemakers include Managed Ventricular Pacing®, a pacing mode designed to
      promote intrinsic conduction, and also Search AV™+, a feature designed to reduce unnecessary
      ventricular pacing in patients with intact or intermittent AV conduction.
