      in the form of atrophic-erosive and ulcerative lesions showing an increased tendency to
      malignant transformation. OLR epithelial cells show anomalies in both enzymatic activity and
      carbohydrate metabolism, which may be related to hormones regulating carbohydrate, insulin
      and insulin-like Growth Factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2) metabolism. The role of
      insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) is of great importance in normal growth and cell
      development (cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis), and is involved in different
      aspects of cell transformation in malignant phenotype. A change in the expression of IGF1,
      IGF2 and IGF2R proteins is described in several types of malignant tumors including oral
      cancer. However, data on their role in the development of malignant lesions of the oral
      cavity are scarce, and the results are inconsistent. Our hypothesis is that patients with
      diabetes mellitus and oral lichen ruber lesions will have a disturbance of insulin-like
      growth factors 1 and 2 and hence a greater risk of malignant transformation, compared to
      patients with oral lichen ruber without diabetes and healthy patients without alterations in
      the oral mucosa.
