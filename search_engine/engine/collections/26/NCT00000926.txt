      rates of condom use in sub-Saharan African populations, which constitute the majority of HIV
      infections, dictate the need for prophylactic methods women can control.

      This trial will be conducted in Zimbabwe and Malawi. The Phase III trial is preceded by a
      2-week safety and acceptability pilot study to determine the extent of genital irritation
      caused by N-9 and the placebo. Following the pilot study and prior to screening for
      enrollment in the Phase III trial, potential volunteers will participate in a 2-month
      behavioral counseling program that will encourage the use of condoms. Only participants who
      decide they cannot or will not be consistent condom users are enrolled in the main study.
      Study participants are given N-9 gel or placebo to use each time they have vaginal sexual
      intercourse for 18 to 36 months. Participants have a follow-up evaluation once a month; a
      pelvic exam and blood tests are performed every third month.
