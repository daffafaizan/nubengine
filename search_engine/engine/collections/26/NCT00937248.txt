      between 1995 and 2004 (Public Health agency of Canada _ Health 2004). Preoperative
      radiotherapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, is an accepted treatment for patients with
      locally advanced rectal carcinoma followed by surgical resection (Bosset and Horiot 2001;
      Sauer, Fietkau et al. 2003; Birgisson, Talback et al. 2005). The current standard treatment
      at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) is preoperative pelvic radiation therapy to a total dose
      of 50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks. The total radiation dose is reduced to 45 Gy/25 fractions/5
      weeks when there is a concern about the volume of small bowel within the treatment volume.
      Radiation therapy is delivered with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 225mg/m2/24h, by protracted venous
      infusion (PVI) or oral capecitabine, 825 mg/m2 BID for 5 weeks, starting the first day and
      completing the day of last day of radiation therapy.
