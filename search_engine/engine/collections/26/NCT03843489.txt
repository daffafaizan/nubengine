      accuracy for neonates, calls for the devices to be first tested in adults during hypoxia
      tests with arterial samples compared to measured oxygen saturation. This has been previously
      completed on the devices that will be tested in this protocol. In order to verify safe
      clinical performance in the neonate, the FDA then requires testing using neonatal arterial
      samples that are collected in the normal course of care; which is the primary purpose of this
      protocol. As a secondary purpose the data will be utilized to evaluate the impact of
      calculated oxygen saturation versus measured oxygen saturation and related issues.

      Neonates/infants who will have an arterial line or sheath placed in the normal course of care
      will be included in this study. The pulse oximeter sensor must be placed on the
      Neonates/infant's foot or hand. Neonates who either have repaired PDA but are having the
      placement of the sensor on the foot (which will be arterial blood only) will be allowed as
      long as other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.
