      adequate surgical exposure. Although once lung deflation was achieved, the overall clinical
      performance appears to be similar, BB takes longer to deflate the operative lung and there is
      some conflict reports as to BB provides a similar degree of lung deflation compared to that
      of DLT.

      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of BB and DLT for achieving lung collapse,
      and to evaluate the efficacy of disconnection technique with monitoring the carbon dioxide
      trace on a capnograph in BB. The investigators further evaluated the disconnection time,
      which is the time to loss of carbon dioxide trace on the capnograph, needed to facilitate
      lung collapse.
