      carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70% to 85% of primary HCC and is the leading cause of death in
      patients with cirrhosis. We developed a novel no-touch combined directional perfusion
      radiofrequency ablation system.By inserting two or more electrodes around the tumor and
      activating them simultaneously.The hypertonic saline solution can be directed into the focal
      tissue from a lateral pore through a tube within the electrode to provide more uniform and
      thorough necrosis.The maximum ablation volume was increased while the loss of normal tissue
      in the non-injection direction was reduced, thus reducing the incidence of postoperative
      complications. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy
      of novel no-touch combined directional perfusion radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of
      small hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis.
