    
      The present study is designed to assess the antimicrobial effect of a single CO2 laser beam
      (DEKA SmartXide2 c80-El.En, Florence Italy) in the treatment of diabetic infected foot
      ulcers. CO2 laser debridement will be compared with standard surgical care. The primary
      efficacy endpoint will be the reduction of bacterial load between pre- and immediately after
      debridement. Secondary endpoints will be adverse events and pain during treatment. Two
      bacterial sample with a flocked nylon swab will be collected before and after debridement.
