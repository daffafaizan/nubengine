      (stem cells, produced by the bone marrow, generate the cells that form the blood elements,
      help fight infection and assist in clotting) and kidney transplantation from the same donor
      to try to avoid the need for long-term anti-rejection drug therapy. The desired result of
      this study is to allow your body to develop "tolerance" to the transplanted kidney. Tolerance
      means that your body would see the transplanted kidney as part of you and not try to get rid
      of, or reject it. To prevent rejection, drugs called immunosuppressive agents must be taken
      on a daily basis. The purpose of this study is to determine if this procedure is safe and to
      try to substantially reduce or even eliminate the need for anti-rejection medications.
