      safe drinking water in SAM treatment protocols. Intervention groups will include: 1) standard
      SAM treatment (control group); 2) standard SAM treatment + flocculent-disinfectant water
      treatment (P&G Purifier of Water); 3) standard SAM treatment + chlorine disinfectant
      ("Aquatabs", a locally available mass market product); and 4) standard SAM treatment +
      ceramic water filter (locally available mass market product). All intervention groups will
      receive the standard SAM nutrition treatment and hygiene education. The control group will
      receive standard Community Managed Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) treatment only and households
      will use existing water treatment methods to represent the conventional CMAM program and to
      enable comparison with the other study arms (with improved water provision methods). A RCT
      was identified because it is a rigorous gold standard methodology design that is feasible
      given the context, and appropriate for determining whether or not safe drinking water is
      effective in CMAM programs. Site level randomization will be used and is preferable to
      individual randomization from a management perspective and because it increases likelihood of
      fidelity to the planned intervention. Limitations of the proposed design include 1) potential
      for bias because the study is not blinded and 2) possible contamination of the comparison
      groups. In order to minimize these risks, efforts will be made to geographically separate the
      comparison groups to reduce the risk of sharing of water treatment products. Blinding is not
      possible given the obviously different nature of the three PoU water treatment approaches and
      the need for a control group.
