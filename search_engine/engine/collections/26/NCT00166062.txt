    
      All eligible ER patients will be screened during study times for IPV victimization and
      perpetration. All victims will be followed at 1 week and 3 months to determine any adverse
      outcomes. Perpetrators will only be followed in the ED for adverse outcomes after screening.
      All patients who disclose IPV victimization or perpetration will get a list of community
      resources. Victims will be asked at follow up what resources they used.
