      correlated with craving for cocaine in active cocaine abusers. The proposed research is
      designed to assess the role of dopamine in cue-elicited as well as spontaneous craving for
      cocaine. Cocaine abusers and control subjects will be presented with a stimulus complex
      related to drug abuse (cocaine cues: videotape depicting drug use, drug paraphernalia) or to
      nature (neutral cues: videotape depicting items such as shells and pinecones). The effects of
      each cue condition on striatal D2-like dopamine (DA) receptors and changes in intrasynaptic
      dopamine will be measured by positron emission tomography (PET). The PET data will then be
      correlated with subjective self-reports of mood, particularly measures of craving. These
      results will be compared between the two subject groups. This research will help clarify the
      role of dopamine in cue-elicited responses that contribute to cocaine abuse. Ultimately, the
      results obtained may lead to the development of anti-craving medications.
