      safely take prescribed (Rx) medications. A risk communication and surveillance strategy is
      needed in primary care to ensure that patients are adequately informed about medication risks
      and are taking prescribed regimens safely.

      The investigators devised an Electronic health record-based Medication Complete Communication
      (EMC2) Strategy that leverages electronic health record (EHR) and interactive voice response
      (IVR) technologies to:

        1. prompt and guide provider counseling,

        2. automate the delivery of Medication Guides at prescribing,

        3. follow patients post-visit to confirm prescription understanding and use, and

        4. deliver a care alert back to providers to inform them of any potential harms.
