      Interventional single group prospective trial in a patient population with identified
      dysglycaemia within the past 36 months defined as 2h post-challenge glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L after
      a standard oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c ≥5.7% (39-46 mmol/mol). This phase clinical
      trial will evaluate the efficacy and underlining mechanisms of a vegan diet in promoting
      cardiometabolic health in those with dysglycaemia. Specifically, this trial will aim to
      investigate the effect of an 8-week vegan diet with follow-up at 1, 8 and 12 weeks.

      Study Setting

      The study will be co-ordinated within the Leicester Biomedical Research Centre (Leicester
      Diabetes Centre) at the Leicester General Hospital. Clinical measurement sessions will be
      carried out by the appointed research team. Participants will be asked to visit the study
      centre on five occasions.

      Intervention Description and Definition

      The participants will be asked to follow a diet that excludes foods hypothesised to support
      the syntheses of TMAO, particularly meat (any), eggs and fish (any). A number of studies
      suggest that dairy products may also have an effect in modulating TMAO production whereas
      other studies do not. Therefore, in order to avoid any potential contaminating or confounding
      effect, dairy products will also be avoided.

      The diet employed in this study is broadly aligned to a vegan diet. The term vegan will be
      used to aid behaviour change and food choice. For example, an increasing array of products
      are now pack marked as vegan. The participants will be asked to keep their diet similar to
      their original and the Registered Dietitian involved in this study will plan their weekly
      menus accordingly.
