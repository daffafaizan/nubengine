      patients do not undergo systematic assessment and treatment for nasal blockage. This is
      unfortunate, as optimal diagnosis and treatment of nasal blockage in asthmatics can reduce
      asthma morbidity and use of anti-asthmatic medication.

      The "Unified Airways" concept considers the upper and lower airways as one unified airway. In
      recent years there has been increasing awareness about the relationship between inflammation
      in the upper and lower airways, with disease in the upper airways affecting the lungs through
      neurological, immunological and mechanical mechanisms, resulting in asthmatic symptoms.

      Conditioning and filtration of the inspired air are important functions of the nose, and oral
      breathing results in inhalation of poorly conditioned and filtered air in to an already
      inflamed lower airway. Together will these mechanisms lead to a worsening of the asthmatic
      disease.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of intranasal corticosteroid therapy,
      which is known to reduce mucosal inflammation and nasal blockage, on asthmatic symptoms. The
      primary outcome variable is improvement in asthma symptomatology. The secondary outcome
      variables are improvement in nasal blockage.
