      patients will thus have the classic positioning technique (PP), as well as the technique
      under study (verticalization). For simplicity, the investigators will use the term
      "verticalization" even if the final positioning that is targeted is only a
      "pseudo-verticalization" to a 55° angle. The cross-over scheme with 4 sequences of 4 periods
      allows to get rid of the first order carry-over effect.

      Progressive verticalization protocol in 7 steps from the strict supine position to a 55°
      inclination of the raising bed, according to the clinical responses of the patient with ARDS,
      as follows:

      - Verticalization in the bed

      The verticalization maneuver will take place in 7 steps of 15 minutes maximum each:

      S1. The first one corresponds to the flat position (strict dorsal decubitus) S2. The second
      is the positioning of the patient at 25° of inclination. S3. The third is the 45° positioning
      S4. The fourth at 55°, which corresponds to the greatest inclination imposed to the patient.

      S5. The fifth corresponds to the 45° return S6. The sixth is the return to 25° S7. Finally,
      the investigators reposition the patient flat back.

      Examinations:

        -  Arterial Gazometry At the beginning, at the end and one hour after each positioning
           technique.

        -  Chest ultrasound

        -  Others All adverse events will be recorded in a clear and detailed manner.
