    
      Through the engagement and empowerment of 15 trained COVID-19 health ambassadors, the
      investigators will jointly implement and evaluate a theoretically based and
      culturally-sensitive socio-behavioral intervention that will: a) reduce mistrust, fatalistic
      beliefs, and related psychosocial barriers that hinder COVID-19 testing and vaccination; b)
      increase receptivity and willingness for uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination; and c)
      assess perceived impact of psychosocial and health outcomes related to COVID-19 testing and
      vaccination for 310 African American and Latinx public housing residents.
