      and receive short-messaging service text messages, providing a perfect medium for delivering
      information and support. Since short-messaging service is little exploited in clinical
      research or practice in Chinese population, this study examined the effectiveness of one-way
      messaging which is less expensive and is easier to undertake. We aimed to determine the
      effectiveness of using SMS to provide pre-diabetes and diabetes information by promoting
      healthy lifestyle modification and reducing the two-hour post-glucose loading plasma glucose,
      the risk of acquiring Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among professional drivers with pre-diabetes.
