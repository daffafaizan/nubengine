      community-based rehabilitation program starting at 12 weeks after TKA, or usual
      post-operative care without outpatient physiotherapy. A third group of asymptomatic controls
      will be recruited to provide comparisons at various time points. All post-TKA participants
      will undergo five clinical assessments: 1 week before TKA, and at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks
      after TKA. The untreated asymptomatic controls will be assessed at baseline, and 12 and 52
      weeks from baseline
