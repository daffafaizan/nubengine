      from nares of patients who are colonized with this organism. Bacterial colonization of the
      anterior nares (inside of the nose) is believed to play an important role in the development
      of infection of central venous catheter, such as the line used for hemodialysis, and
      subsequent bloodstream infection.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to be lethal against all classes of microorganisms:
      Gram-positive and, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi (fungus), viruses, parasites and even
      spores. In addition to the antimicrobial effects PDT also demonstrates an anti-inflammatory
      effect.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PDT in nasal decolonization of S.
      aureus in hemodialysis patients
