    
      The present RCT comprises two groups, a perfusion (group 1; HOPE) and a control conventional
      cold storage (group 2; CCS) group. Patients with proven written informed consent on waiting
      list for orthotopic liver transplantation will be recruited. Randomization is performed with
      an online randomizing tool for clinical trials (www.randomizer.at) at the time of allograft
      arrival at the transplant center and acceptance of the organ for transplantation. Stratified
      randomization model will be used to ensure balance of prognostic variables between the
      treatment groups.

      In case of randomisation to group 1, HOPE will be applied to the allograft in the operation
      room, directly after the back table preparation. The application of HOPE to the liver
      allograft will not delay the implantation due to the fact that it is performed parallel to
      the recipient hepatectomy.

      Commercially available and machine-perfusion approved Belzer MPS® UW solution (Belzer Organ
      Preservation Solutions, Bridge for Life) will be used as perfusate for machine perfusion.

      Patients will be followed for one year after OLT.

      Interim analysis: After n=12 per randomized group is reached, data will be analyzed by an
      independent Data Monitoring Committee. The RCT will be stopped if one of the following
      criteria is reached:

      Significantly higher serum ALT levels (p<0.001 using Student's t-test) in the HOPE group
      compared to the CCS group (Efficacy).

      The proportion of Grade ≥ III complications is significantly higher (p<0.05, Fischer's exact
      test) in the HOPE group when compared to the CCS group (Safety).
