      osteoarthritis (OA) progression. Our previous research suggests that doxycycline might help
      prevent or slow OA development by reducing breakdown of cartilage in joints. The target
      population is one that is at high risk for the development of bilateral knee OA: overweight
      middle-aged women with unilateral knee OA at baseline. We hypothesize that doxycycline will
      decrease the severity or rate of progression of OA. We are recruiting 432 study participants
      across six clinical centers and randomizing them to treatment or placebo groups
      (N=216/group). Participants will receive either doxycycline (treatment) or placebo for 30
      months.

      We will use several strategies to maximize compliance with the study medications and
      retention of participants in the study, including a "faintness-of-heart" test, which will be
      used at the outset to eliminate people unlikely to comply, and use of a computerized medicine
      cap to provide information on compliance with the prescribed dosing regimen between visits.
      These strategies will permit study personnel to aim their efforts to enhance compliance at
      those participants who can best benefit from these efforts.

      The primary outcome variable is minimum joint space width (or joint space narrowing, JSN) in
      the medial tibiofemoral compartment of the knee that is normal at baseline. In addition, we
      will examine changes in an algofunctional index (WOMAC), global arthritis activity, general
      health status (SF-36), and use of health services in the two treatment groups.
