      parent/guardian to participate in this research study. Participants will be evaluated at
      baseline, 4-weeks, 8-weeks and 12-weeks. Data collections at each assessment visit will be
      identical except for the baseline visit. The baseline evaluation will consist of
      questionnaires related to past medical history in addition to all other procedures. All
      evaluations will include patient-reported outcome measures, clinical measures, and
      measurement of tendon structure, mechanical properties, and muscle-tendon function Treatment
      sessions will occur immediately following the evaluation sessions (4 total). During treatment
      sessions, participants will be provided with education, therapeutic exercise instruction, and
      discussion of their training diary and home exercise program. Treatment sessions will last
      30-45 minutes. In addition to the 4 in-person treatment sessions, virtual visits will take
      place 2 weeks in between each in-person visits, (one virtual visit maximum every 4 weeks) as
      needed. Virtual visits will be no longer than 30 minutes to discuss patient needs.
