      neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy protocol and developed peripheral neuropathy will be
      randomized to receive true acupuncture (intervention group) vs sham acupuncture (control),
      once a week, for 8 weeks. The primary outcome is improvement of the symptoms by Neuropathic
      Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) scale (Bouhassira,2004). The secondary outcomes are
      improvements on Visual analog scale (VAS) and Quality of life by FACT-taxane (Cella, 2003)
      questionnaire. These scales will be assessed in the Screening visit (baseline), week 4, week
      6, week 8 and week 12. The study has duration of 12 weeks.
