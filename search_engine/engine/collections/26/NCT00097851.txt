      be randomized to receive weekly docetaxel alone, or PI-88 in combination with weekly
      docetaxel. Both groups will receive docetaxel (30 mg/m2), administered by intravenous
      infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The second group only will receive PI-88 (250
      mg/day) in addition to docetaxel; PI-88 will be administered by subcutaneous injection on
      days 1-4, 8-11 and 15-18 of each cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint is the non-progression
      rate at 6 months. In the extension phase of the study, patients in the combination arm who
      have stable disease or an objective response after up to six treatment cycles will remain on
      PI-88 alone as maintenance therapy. Patients who initially receive docetaxel alone and who
      have disease progression or unacceptable toxicity before the completion of six cycles will be
      eligible to receive PI-88 alone as third-line therapy.
