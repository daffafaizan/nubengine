    
      Plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL will be injected intratumorally at a
      dose volume of ¼ of the calculated lesion volume and a dose volume per lesion of 0.1 mL for
      lesions of volume < 0.4 cm3. Six pulses at field strengths of (E+) of 1500 V/cm and pulse
      width of 100 μs at 1-second intervals will be administered using the OncoSec Medical System
      (OMS) to each previously injected tumor.

      Three treatment regimens will be explored:

      Main Study: Treatment on Days 1, 5 and 8 for 1 cycle. Additional cycles may be repeated every
      3 months at the Investigator's discretion.

      Addendum Regimen A: Treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 6 weeks. Subsequent cycles may be
      given at 6-week intervals, for up to 9 treatment cycles in total.

      Addendum Regimen B: Treatment on Days 1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks. Subsequent cycles may be
      given at 6-week intervals, for up to 9 treatment cycles in total.

      NOTE: An Addendum was added to the Main Protocol with the purpose of exploring the safety and
      efficacy of an increased treatment frequency schedule.
