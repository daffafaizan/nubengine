      evaluation in 40 patients with thermal injury in order to evaluate the effects of pulmonary
      rehabilitation in patients with thermally injury.

      The investigators will study 40 patients who had burn injury. Burned patients will be
      randomized into two groups. The experimental group(EG) will participate in a 12-week
      pulmonary rehabilitation program daily for 60 minutes. The control group(CG) will participate
      in a 12-week conventional exercise program daily for 60 minutes. Spirometer will be done to
      evaluate pulmonary function. Pulmonary function tests include forced vital capacity(FVC), 1
      second forced expiratory volume(FEV1), forced expiratory flow rate between 25 and 75% of the
      FVC(FEF 25-75) FEV1/FVC ratio expressed as a percentage(FEV1/FVC %) and peak expiratory
      flow(PEF). Maximum voluntary ventilation(MVV) and respiratory muscles strength(MEP[maximal
      expiratory pressure], MIP[maximal inspiratory pressure]) will be measured by mouth
      pressure-meter in sitting position. Pulmonary function tests will be performed for all groups
      at baseline and after 12 weeks programs. A 6-minute walk test and health-related quality of
      life will be also evaluated.
