      including non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans and Latinos. Having PAD can limit how far
      you can walk. Many patients with PAD are also overweight or obese. Weight loss among
      overweight or obese adults with PAD may improve walking distance. Given how common obesity or
      being overweight is among persons with PAD, interventions are needed to address weight loss
      in this population.
