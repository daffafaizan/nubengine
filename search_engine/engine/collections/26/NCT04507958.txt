      number of critical ill patients are rapidly growing. Critical ill COVID-19 patients
      inevitably require endotracheal intubation for ventilator support. The chest X-rays,
      ultrasound, and stethoscope are three tools that can detect whether or not bronchial
      intubation has occurred. Auscultation by using the stethoscope is the routine first-line tool
      for this purpose. However, clinician who wears the full personal protective equipment (PPE)
      is very difficult to perform adequate auscultation with conventional stethoscope. In
      addition, the X-ray machines and ultrasound are very difficult to enter the negative-pressure
      isolation room and may raise the risks of infection spread. By using the electronic
      stethoscope amplified by the Bluetooth speaker, the clinician with full PPE may still hear
      the proper lung sound. In addition, electronic stethoscope has a good portability that can be
      easily brought into the isolation room. For patients undergoing surgery with general
      anesthesia, endotracheal tube is often mandatory and auscultation with stethoscope is
      routinely applied. Therefore, the investigators can simulate the circumstance that clinician
      with a full PPE to use the electronic stethoscope for confirmation of the proper endotracheal
      tube position. In addition, patients undergoing thoracic surgery require the single-lung
      ventilation which could be a proper simulation scenario for detection of bronchial intubation
      by using electronic stethoscope for clinicians with PPE.
