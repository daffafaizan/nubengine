      end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis. The effects of ESA, however, are unclear. This
      study compares the result of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) versus supportive care
      for chronic kidney disease patients receiving palliative care. The investigators design a
      retrospective observational study to evaluate the effect of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
      in treating anaemia of renal disease among adult patients receive palliative care instead of
      dialysis. The primary objective is to assess whether ESA can reduce the transfusion burden
      and hospitalization.
