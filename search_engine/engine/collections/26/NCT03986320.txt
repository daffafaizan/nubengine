      and functional disability. Gait is one of the most important activities of daily living
      affected in this patient population. Recent technological developments in passively powered
      dermoskeleton can create powerful adjunctive tools for rehabilitation and potentially
      accelerate functional recovery. Here, the investigators present the development and
      evaluation of a lower limb dermoskeleton, namely Keeogo™ (B-Temia), for use in rehabilitation
      institutions to assist individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke who are able to stand and
      initiate a step in performing ambulatory functions.

      Keeogo™ Dermoskeleton is a low-profile, assistive exoskeleton (or 'dermoskeleton') that
      orthotically fits to the lower limbs. Keeogo™ is worn on the user's lower body using a belt
      and contact areas attached around the thighs and calves.
