      to either MRA therapy or CPAP therapy. Group A receives MRA. Group B receives CPAP. The total
      duration of the study is 12 months. Measurements will be done at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12
      months.

      Intervention: Group A will be treated with a bibloc MRA (Somnodent). The mandible will be set
      at 70% of the patient's maximum advancement and will be adjusted to the convenience of the
      patient. Titration will be continued until symptoms abate or until further advancement causes
      discomfort.

      Group B will be treated with CPAP. Proper CPAP-pressure will be set for each patient
      separately. Patients are fitted with a comfortable CPAP mask before titration of the
      CPAP-pressure. For CPAP-titration, patients are instructed to adopt their own typical
      sleeping habits.
