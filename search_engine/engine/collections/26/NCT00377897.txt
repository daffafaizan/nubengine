      500 ml of bone marrow is harvested in both iliac crests. After isolation and concentration of
      the BMMNC in 30 ml, 40 injections of around 0.75 ml will be done in the gastrocnemius of the
      ischemic leg, within 3 hours after preparation of the cell therapy product.

      Patients will then be followed-up every week during one month and then every month during one
      year.
