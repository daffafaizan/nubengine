      aspects of the multifactorial pathophysiology remain unclear. Elevated homocysteine
      concentrations are shown to be associated with an increased risk for CVA in newborns. We want
      to study the possible homocysteine lowering effect of folinic acid in newborns.

      We will include newborns in our prospective randomized folinic acid intervention study from
      patients admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. We will measure total homocysteine
      (tHcy) and folate concentrations at three time points. The intervention group will be treated
      with folinic acid (70 Âµg/kg/day) for two weeks.
