      spectrum disorder (ASD), and they are subserved by specific neural systems underpinning
      social perception and processing that are recognized to be atypical in ASD. Considering the
      neurodevelopmental nature of the disorder, and the recent findings regarding aberrant
      neuroplasticity in ASD, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) holds promise to
      directly modulate brain activity in these systems. The objective of this research proposal is
      to utilize a multimodal approach to provide a proof-of-concept for the ability of rTMS to (a)
      influence functioning in the brain systems involved in social ASD symptomatology and (b)
      modify associated social cognitive behaviors in adults with ASD. Toward achieving this
      objective, we propose to assess critical aspects of social cognition using the
      electroencephalogram (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPS), eye-tracking (ET), and
      behavioral tasks prior to and following a single rTMS session to provide preliminary insight
      into the potential of rTMS as a tool to modify social brain function in cognitively able
      adults with ASD.
