      been recognized for many years, but their functional capacity in response to physical
      exercise has partially remained elusive. Via endothelial shear stress, the fundamental
      stimulus for collateral development, exercise theoretically leads to collateral vasodilation
      and recruitment by an increase in heart rate and blood pressure during exercise. Moreover,
      the phenomenon of "walking through angina" indicates that collateral function and physical
      activity are related and their interaction is of clinical relevance.

      The purpose of the present study in humans with stable coronary artery disease was to assess
      the instantaneous response of coronary collateral function to dynamic physical exercise.
