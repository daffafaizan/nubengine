      Primary

        -  To determine the safety and efficacy, as determined by response rate (complete response
           [CR] + near CR + partial response), of lenalidomide administered with rituximab in
           patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD20+ multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effects of this regimen on patient lymphocyte subsets (T, B, and NK cells)
           in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from these patients.

        -  To perform detailed phenotypic analyses of NK cells in patient blood and bone marrow
           samples at baseline and post-treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment with
      lenalidomide repeats every 28 days for at least 4 courses. Patients also receive rituximab IV
      once weekly in weeks 2-5 and in week 13. Patients with stable disease then receive rituximab
      once every 8 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Peripheral blood samples are collected at baseline, and after courses 2 and 4. Samples are
      examined by flow cytometry for lymphocyte subset analysis (T-, B-, and NK-cell percentages
      and absolute numbers) and NK-cell phenotyping (CD16, CD56, NKG2D expression). Samples are
      also examined by immunologic assays of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Bone
      marrow aspirate samples are also collected at baseline and after course 2. Bone marrow
      mononuclear cells are isolated and evaluated by CD138+ plasma cell selection, ex vivo
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays, and bone marrow lymphocyte subset analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days.
