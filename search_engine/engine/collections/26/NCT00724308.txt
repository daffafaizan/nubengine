      problem among VA users and among persons with a diagnosed mental illness. The prevalence of
      smoking among VA mental health patients has remained high, in part because smoking cessation
      treatment rates have remained low. Telephone-based counseling represents the most feasible
      approach to increasing smoking cessation treatment among VA patients. The approach used in
      this study has been used very effectively in a primary care-based population that includes a
      large percentage of mental health patients. This project would target the program
      specifically at patients seen in VA Mental Health Clinics.
