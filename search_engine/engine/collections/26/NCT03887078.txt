      behavioral treatments are effective for weight loss, bariatric surgery is an increasingly
      important option. Although these procedures are more helpful than psychosocial treatments,
      post-operative weight losses vary widely, and a notable subset of patients demonstrate
      suboptimal weight loss or substantial weight regain. Adherence to treatment recommendations
      is a likely contributor to these variable outcomes. Smartphone applications (apps) designed
      to augment behavior change or enhance adherence, have expanded exponentially in recent years,
      and are a potentially useful option to improve outcomes, but rigorous research on apps is
      limited, and high-quality, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials with large
      samples are required. This study will test a combined smartphone app and health coaching
      system to improve adherence and behavioral/psychosocial outcomes for patients receiving
      bariatric surgery. The aims have not been modified since the original phase 1 and will
      compare usual pre-operative care and pre-surgical use of Noom Coach for Bariatric Health on
      post-surgery adherence and psychosocial variables in a larger test (n=200) to explore whether
      usage of the app is a viable predictor of subsequent post-operative weight trajectories 12
      months following surgery. This study will also examine app usage as a viable predictor of
      subsequent post-operative weight and psychosocial trajectories in the 12 months post-surgery
      and establish sensitivity and specificity of early optimal response to surgical intervention
      using weight loss, diet and exercise adherence, and psychosocial adjustment.
