      • Efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation defined by achieving an exit block for all pulmonary
      veins per patient.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Detecting (silent) cerebral thromboembolism using neuro(psychological) tests and brain
           MRI prior and within 2 days after PV ablation.

        -  Detecting (silent) cerebral thromboembolism using neuro(psychological) tests and brain
           MRI within 6 months after PV ablation.

        -  Determination of spontaneous recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation using a
           subcutaneously implanted loop recorder (Reveal XT®).

        -  Characterization of non-neurological major complications (death, atrial-esophageal
           fistula, pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial tamponade)

        -  Rate of iatrogenic interatrial septal defects after transseptal puncture for PV
           ablation.
