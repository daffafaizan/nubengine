      active-controlled study (R076477-SCH-303) and was conducted at 52 sites in 11 countries. The
      primary objective of the open-label extension was the long-term assessment of safety and
      tolerability of flexibly-dosed ER OROS® paliperidone. The secondary objective was the
      assessment of long-term efficacy expressed as a function of change in the total Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score, effect on positive and negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia by means of change in PANSS factor scores, and personal and social functioning,
      overall functioning, and quality of life parameters as measured by Personal and Social
      Performance Scale (PSP), Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S), and
      Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (SQLS), respectively. Subjects in the open-label phase
      received flexibly dosed ER OROS® paliperidone (3 mg to 12 mg/day) for 52 weeks
