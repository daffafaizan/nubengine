      disease in women treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or worse (CIN1+).

      Women treated by LEEP for CIN1+ will be invited to participate. Follow-up visits will be
      performed at 6 months and 12 months after treatment and will include cytology, colposcopy
      when indicated and HPV testing. Two weeks before each follow-up visit at the colposcopy
      clinic, a home-based Self-HPV will be organized. A sample of 168 women will be included.
      Agreement between the two methods (Dr-HPV vs. S-HPV) will be measured using the kappa
      statistic (Îº).

      the investigators expect to find that Self-HPV may be an accurate method to predict residual
      and recurrent disease in women previously treated by LEEP.
