      online program or through visit with a therapist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine,
      and is some cases both. Participants will be randomized with equal probability to an ONLINE
      ONLY treatment arm or to a STEPPED CARE arm, whereby they will be assigned to on line or
      therapist-led treatment, based on their clinical presentation; but those assigned to this arm
      who start treatment with an online program and do not have sufficient response after 2 months
      will be switched over to a therapist-led treatment.
