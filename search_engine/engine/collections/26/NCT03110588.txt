      months. The combination of prednisone, abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide may be
      anticipated to be feasible therapy with minimal or no adverse drug interactions. This is a
      phase I trial to study the feasibility of the proposed therapy.

      Patients will undergo a combination of oral daily drug intake at varying doses over a period
      of three weeks. Monitoring including blood collection for laboratory testing will be done on
      Day 1 of each three-week cycle with additional monitoring during the first cycle. Imaging and
      correlative studies will be done every 12 weeks. Therapy will continue until disease
      progression or severe toxicities.
