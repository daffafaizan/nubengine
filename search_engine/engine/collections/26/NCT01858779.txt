      cerebral ischemia without detection of AF after standard stroke unit diagnostic procedures.
      During the acute in-hospital phase at the stroke unit, patients and, if available, relatives
      are introduced to and trained for peripheral pulse self measurements. Experiences on this
      educational process, including feasibility and diagnostic accuracy have already been gained
      during a pilot phase of the study (n=256 patients). Pulse rate and subjective perception of
      absolute pulse arrhythmia are assessed by the patient and/or relatives at least three times
      daily or during palpitations, with results being documented in a patient diary. After
      hospital discharge, the patient continues with daily measurements (min. 3 times per day) for
      6 months. In parallel the patient will transmit ECGs using a handheld mobile ECG-device as a
      control to the study center. This ECG will be reviewed for episodes of atrial fibrillation.
      If the patient recognizes new pulse arrhythmias or an excess of pulse rate beyond an upper or
      lower limit of >120/min or <45/min, resp., the patient is requested to transmit an additional
      ECG to the study center. In this case, a 12-lead ECG and further diagnostic tests (e.g.
      cardiac marker or echocardiography) is initiated. As an internal control group the same
      patients will receive standard 72h holter ECG at 3 and 6 months which will be evaluated for
      episodes of atrial fibrillation by an investigator blinded for clinical data as well as
      results from the pulse measurements. Detection rates (pulse measurements, holter ECGs) as
      well as time of first diagnosis of atrial fibrillation using the different diagnostic
      approaches will be important endpoints of the study.
