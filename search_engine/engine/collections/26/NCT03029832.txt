      to enrollment challenges. As only 5 participants were enrolled, the study blinding will not
      be maintained, and placebo infusions will not be administered. Patients assigned to the
      MOXR0916 arm may continue study treatment with the combination of atezolizumab and MOXR0916
      or with atezolizumab alone based on a discussion of benefit and risk with the treating
      investigator.
