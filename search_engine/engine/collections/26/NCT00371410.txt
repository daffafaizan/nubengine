      diffuse diabetic macular edema (DME). Intractable diffuse DME was defined as a
      biomicroscopically, angiographically and tomographically proven diffuse DME, which did not
      respond to or recurred after the previous intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) and/or
      macular focal laser photocoagulation. The central macular thickness (CMT) had to be greater
      than 250 Î¼m. Preoperative ocular examination included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
      using the ETDRS chart, applanation tonometry, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus
      examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography. Pars plana
      vitrectomy with removal of retinal internal limiting membrane (ILM) was performed in all the
      50 subject eyes. On the day after vitrectomy, triamcinolone acetonide (0.1 mL, 40 mg/mL) was
      injected intravitreally. Macular focal laser photocoagulation was performed 2 weeks after
      vitrectomy. As main outcome measures, BCVA was recorded and the CMT was measured using OCT by
      independent observers for all subjects at 3 and 6 months after the laser photocoagulation.
