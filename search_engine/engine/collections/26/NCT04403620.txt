      patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx cancer after surgical resection
      with pathology showing intermediate risk factors requiring post-operative radiation therapy
      without concurrent chemotherapy. During Phase 1, the maximum tolerated dose/fractionation and
      tolerability will be determined. During Phase 2, patients will be randomized between
      conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (6 weeks) vs. hypofractionated radiation
      therapy (3-4 weeks depending on Phase 1 results) to establish non-inferiority of
      hypofractionated radiation therapy.
