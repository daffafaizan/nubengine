      proximal deep vein thrombosis despite thromboprophylactic measures. Diagnostic method of the
      first choice is Point-of-Care ultrasound examination. This method is usually performed by a
      trained intensive care physician. However, if this examination could be performed by trained
      nurses, its availability would be greatly increased. The results of the investigator's pilot
      study showed that general nurses are able to diagnose proximal deep vein thrombosis in
      critically ill patients by compression ultrasound test with a sensitivity of 88,9 % and a
      specificity of 99 %. Before implementation of this examination into the optional competencies
      of general nurses, the results need to be confirmed in a larger group of patients. This is
      the goal of proposed clinical study.

      In this prospective observational study, the patients will be investigated by extended duplex
      ultrasound (compression ultrasound test combined with colour doppler imaging in the range
      from the groin to the popliteal region) by a trained nurse and on the same day, the
      examination will be repeated by a trained physician - intensivist. The results of the
      examinations of each patient will be blinded until both tests will be performed.
