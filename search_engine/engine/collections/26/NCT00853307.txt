      to treat people who have platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. This study looked at the antitumor activity
      by response rate who would take alisertib.

      The study enrolled 31 patients. Participants were categorized as per the disease state into 2
      categories, refractory and resistant. Participants received:

      â€¢ Alisertib 50 mg

      All participants took alisertib 50 mg capsules every 12 hours each day for 7 days followed by
      a 14-day rest period in a 21-day cycle (up to 26 cycles).

      This multi-center trial was conducted in France, Poland and the United States. The overall
      time to participate in this study was 12 months, unless it is determined that a participant
      would benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 months. Participants made multiple visits to
      the clinic, and were contacted up to a maximum of every 12 weeks up to 12 months after last
      dose of study drug for follow-up assessments.
