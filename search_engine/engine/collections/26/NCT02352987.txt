      keratosis, which occurs in the palm and sole, is a common symptom of arsenicosis. The
      objective of this study is to find the effectiveness of combination of topical administration
      of the ethanol extract of leaf of neem (Azadirachta indica), propylene glycol (40%) and
      salicylic acid (10%) in the treatment of palmar arsenical keratosis. On the basis of
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 patients of moderate palmar arsenical keratosis will be
      recruited from an arsenic affected area. They will be divided into two groups: study group
      and placebo comparator group. Each group consisting of 15 members. Study group will be given
      combination of ethanol extract of leaf of neem, propylene glycol (40%) and salicylic acid
      (10%) to apply on palm overnight once daily for 12 weeks. On the other hand placebo
      comparator group will be given salicylic (10%) acid to apply on palm overnight once daily for
      12 weeks. Water and nail samples will be collected before starting recruitment to confirm
      arsenicosis. After conclusive recruitment of the subjects the objective, nature, purpose and
      potential risks and benefits of all procedures of the study will be explained in details to
      the patients and informed written consent will be taken from them. Detail history, clinical
      examination and photograph (palm) will also be collected. Clinical improvement will be
      assessed by measuring palmar nodular size on both hands, before starting treatment and after
      12 weeks completion of treatment and perception of patients about their improvement. The
      study will explore the effectiveness of topical use of combination of ethanol extract of
      neem, propylene glycol and salicylic acid for the treatment of palmar arsenical keratosis.
