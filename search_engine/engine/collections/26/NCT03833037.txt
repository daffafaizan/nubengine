      To analyze exhaustively a series of cases of synovial sarcoma (as an example of classic
      subtype of soft tissue sarcoma) to analyse the complementary tests performed and their
      evolution over time.

      To analyse the results of surgical treatment and adjuvant therapies in synovial sarcoma and
      its evolution over time.

      To study the prognostic factors dependent on the patient and the applied therapeutics.

      To establish a results-based treatment and follow-up algorithm for patients diagnosed with
      synovial sarcoma.

      To describe the epidemiological characteristics of the group of patients in the study.

      To evaluate the overall survival and disease-free survival as well as the mortality of the
      disease.

      To assess the rate of local recurrence and remote dissemination of synovial sarcomas in the
      series.

      To demonstrate the influence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of
      the tumor.

      Conduct a study by age group with respect to the influence on patient survival. To carry out
      a study by tumor-sized groups with respect to the influence on the survival of the patients.

      To carry out a chronological study on the influence of the advances in the treatments on the
      survival of the patients.

      Compare the results obtained with the published literature.
