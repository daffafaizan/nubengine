      may be at risk in any intraocular surgical procedure, while others showed no significant
      differences between diabetic and non-diabetic corneal endothelium.The purpose of this study
      is to investigate the differences in corneal endothelial cell density and morphology in
      diabetic patients and normal patients after phacoemulsification with intraocular lens
      implantation.To investigate if haemoglobin A1c can be used as a predictor of corneal
      endothelial cell changes after phacoemulsification.

      Specular microscopy photos will be taken pre-. and 3 month postoperatively. Cellular
      parameters will be compared between the two groups prior and post surgery. Clinical
      significant difference is defined as 1 SD (300 cell/mm2)
