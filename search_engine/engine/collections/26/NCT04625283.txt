      receptor. Unfortunately, activation of the mu receptor also results in undesirable side
      effects, such as respiratory depression, sedation, bowel ileus, nausea, itching, and
      tolerance. Therefore, in order to effectively treat pain with the least amount of opioids
      required, a multi-modal approach must include medications with different mechanisms of
      actions at alternative receptors. Some examples of non-narcotic pain medications include
      acetaminophen (Tylenol), anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS), muscle relaxants, local anesthetics,
      gabapentinoids (Lyrica), and ketamine, to name a few. In light of the opioid epidemic,
      medical providers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) are strategically combining
      these medications in a bundled pain-regimen after surgery. These regimens have been shown to
      decrease opioid consumption, improve surgical outcomes, and reduce hospital stays, thus
      coining the term 'enhanced recovery pathway' or enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). The
      combination of these medications has an indisputable synergistic effect. However, it is
      unknown how each medication contributes individually to the overall efficacy of the pathway.
      Ultimately, the investigators aim to perform a series of randomized controlled trials in
      which we isolate each component of the pathway to investigate its effects on length of stay,
      total opioid consumption, pain scores, and surgical outcomes. The investigators will begin
      with studying ketamine.
