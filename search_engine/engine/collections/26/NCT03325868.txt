      clinics, with peak prevalence of 32% in 40-49 years old. Prior histologic studies in women
      undergoing hysterectomy show prevalence of with some variation due to differing histologic
      diagnostic criteria 10-37.1%. Heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea are commonly
      manifested in women with adenomyosis. However, data on treatment of adenomyosis remains
      scarce. For women desiring definitive options, hysterectomy remains the treatment of choice.
      However, for women who desire future fertility, the currently accepted first-line therapy is
      progestogen therapy, particularly the levonorgestrel-IUD. Other limited studies have used
      danazol and GnRH agonists, but its use is limited by significant side effects.

      Recently, the selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM) have emerged as successful
      medical treatment options for leiomyoma. The SPRM ulipristal acetate has been studied
      extensively in the treatment of leiomyoma and more recently endometriosis. Ulipristal acetate
      exerts both antagonist and agonist properties. Amenorrhea was achieved in 80% of women taking
      5mg of ulipristal daily by treatment month 2 and up to 90% of women taking 10mg daily.
      Anovulation was achieved in 80% of women taking 5mg and 10mg dosing. Ulipristal acetate has
      not been studied as a treatment option for women with adenomyosis. We aim to study the effect
      of daily ulipristal on heavy menstrual bleeding in women with adenomyosis.
