    
      Observational study that will allow us:

      Analyze and evaluate the skeletal muscle of patients with hemophilia involvement.

      Describe the periarticular muscular deficit, depending on the degree of injury, age, presence
      of inhibitors and the development of physical activity.

      Identify the relationship between the functional deficit by clinical assessment performed
      with the use of validated scales measure force production with patients.

      Observe the presence of joint bleeds in children with hemophilia and synovial hypertrophy
      developing therein.

      Detect biomechanical abnormalities of the lower limbs and their impact on gait in patients
      with hemophilia.

      Assess the factors that influence the perception of illness and quality of life of patients
      with hemophilia.
