      study Data Monitoring Committee meeting communicated to Novartis the following safety
      findings in the study population: high rate of premature discontinuation of study medication,
      high rate of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and high rate of related serious
      infections leading to hospitalization. In light of the safety findings, Novartis followed the
      DMC recommendation to discontinue the study medication in this age group and to stop
      enrolling new patients in this study (regardless of age).
