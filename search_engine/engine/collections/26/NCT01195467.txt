      that includes EFV in combination with other antiretrovirals. These regimens are convenient
      (once daily dosing) and highly efficacious. However EFV has several potential drawbacks
      including continued CNS toxicity, the potential for teratogenesis and a low barrier to the
      development of virological resistance.

      Clinically controlled trials frequently reported undesirable nervous system side effects in
      patients receiving 600 mg EFV with other antiretroviral agents, including dizziness,
      insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and abnormal dreaming. CNS symptoms of moderate
      to severe intensity were experienced by 19.4% of patients compared to 9.0% of patients
      receiving control regimens. These symptoms were severe in 2.0% of patients receiving EFV 600
      mg daily and in 1.3% of patients receiving control regimens. In clinical studies 2.1% of
      patients treated with 600 mg of EFV discontinued therapy because of nervous system symptoms
