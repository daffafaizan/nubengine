    
      Protease inhibitors such as indinavir sulfate may be effective in patients with advanced HIV
      disease who have received prior AZT therapy. Since studies suggest that triple drug therapy
      may have an advantage over both monotherapy and two drug therapy, the combination of
      indinavir sulfate with AZT and 3TC should be evaluated.

      Patients are randomized to receive open-label AZT and 3TC with or without indinavir sulfate
      for at least 48 weeks. Patients who develop intolerance to AZT or have progressive disease
      after 24 weeks on study may substitute stavudine ( d4T ) for AZT. Patients are followed at
      weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 and every 8 weeks thereafter up to week 96. [AS PER
      02/25/97 AMENDMENT: Accrual has been halted because interim analysis has shown triple therapy
      superior to double-agent therapy. An open label extension phase has been added for the period
      through 06/30/97. Patients who had been randomized to AZT/3TC are given the option of
      continuing on assigned ACTG 320 study drugs, crossing over to open-label indinavir, or
      permanently discontinuing all study therapies and going off study. Patients who were
      randomized to AZT/3TC plus indinavir or who were crossed to such therapy are given the option
      of continuing their currently assigned therapies. It is strongly suggested that patients who
      were on AZT/3TC who wish to receive open-label indinavir consider changing the nucleoside
      analog component of their regimen if at all possible.] [ AS PER 06/06/97 AMENDMENT: The
      availability of the current ACTG 320 treatment has been further extended for approximately 12
      additional weeks (but not beyond 09/30/97). This extension will allow patients to continue
      receiving study medications until ACTG 372 is open to accrual (the rollover protocol for
      subjects originally randomized to the triple drug component of ACTG 320 or who are crossed
      over due to a confirmed study endpoint is finalized).] [ AS PER 09/15/97 AMENDMENT:
      Open-label therapy will be provided for no more than 90 days beyond the enrollment of the
      first subject on ACTG 372.]
