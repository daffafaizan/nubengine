      respiratory rate of 15 bpm with an I:E-ratio of 1:2.

      Salbutamol/ipratropium bromide and magnesium sulphate will be administered at baseline (t=0h)
      and measurements will be made for an hour.

      At T=1h the first dose of 0.5 mg/kg enoximone will be administered and will be repeated at
      T=2h and T=3h. Ventilator derived variables will be obtained every fifteen minutes and
      echocardiography, arterial and central venous bloodgas analyses every hour until t=6h.
