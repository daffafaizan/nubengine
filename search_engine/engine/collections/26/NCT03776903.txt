    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the ZIKV Detectâ„¢ 2.0 IgM Capture
      ELISA using archived confirmed ZIKV positive and confirmed ZIKV negative human serum samples.
      The FDA guidance document (ZIKA SEROLOGY DE NOVO/510(K) PRE-MARKET SUBMISSIONS - Recommended
      Analytical and Clinical Studies for Zika Virus IgM Assays; Dated 02Jun2017; FDA/CDRH/OIR/DMD)
      allows for the utilization of archival serum specimens to evaluate test performance. This
      study will follow this guidance. Test samples will be collected from endemic sites (both
      presumed positive and presumed negative samples) and from non-endemic sites (presumed
      negative samples). All samples will be shipped to the sponsor for randomization and will be
      tested at three sites in the United States.
