      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic esophageal cancer
           treated with fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and cisplatin as first-line
           therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical benefit in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine local relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day
      1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours and cisplatin IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 15 days for up to 12 courses in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
