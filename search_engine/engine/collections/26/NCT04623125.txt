      via teleconferencing software), and a preliminary picture naming test of approximately 300
      pictures, used to select individual items for treatment. Participants then undertake online
      picture naming training for 30 minutes a day, over two weeks. Pictures are repeated according
      to three different schedules to be compared: random presentation, non-adaptive spaced
      repetition, and adaptive spaced repetition. We compare the number of pictures successfully
      learned and the verbal reaction time for the pictures assigned to the three conditions.
