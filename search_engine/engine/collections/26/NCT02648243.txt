      members at discharge and post-discharge on the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients
      with ACS at Heart Hospital in Qatar. This research project aims to determine this.

      The investigators hypothesize that a clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention consisting of
      medication reconciliation and counseling at discharge and tailored follow-up post-discharge
      will decrease hospital readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause mortality
      at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge when compared with control arm
      and pharmacist delivered intervention at discharge only among ACS patients. The investigators
      also hypothesize that the effect of the intervention will increase patients' adherence to
      evidence-based secondary prevention medications for CAD, and patient satisfaction with
      pharmacy services. besides, this intervention will reduce the treatment burden on patients.

      Study objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention at discharge
           and tailored follow-up post-discharge on decreasing hospital readmissions, ED visits and
           mortality in ACS patients.

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on improving patient adherence to
           evidence-based secondary prevention CAD medications.

        3. To study the effect of the intervention on reducing the burden of treatment on patients.

        4. To assess the effect of the intervention on increasing patient satisfaction with
           pharmacy services at Heart Hospital in Qatar.
