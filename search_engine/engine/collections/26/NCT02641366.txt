      affixed to points on your hand, wrist, elbow and/or shoulder. These sensors are painless and
      otherwise noninvasive. They will be used to measure the precise location of the hand and arm
      in space during the neurologic examination. This exam will test the tremors during short,
      simple tasks using the hand and arm. This information will be stored along with your name and
      medical record number for analysis after your testing is complete.

      The sensors that are used to measure movements are connected to thin, flexible wires that
      will be attached with adhesive tape. The motion sensors use a magnet that produces a weak
      electromagnetic field. This electromagnetic field poses no direct harm, but could potentially
      interfere with medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers or deep brain stimulators if placed
      very close to the electromagnetic emitter.
