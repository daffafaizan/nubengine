      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of cediranib (cediranib maleate) plus
      olaparib in combination in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of the following
      tumor types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of oral administration of cediranib in combination
      with olaparib in patients with select advanced solid tumors.

      II. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) in each tumor cohort.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the prevalence of the mutations of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes in
      tumors using the BROCA panel and to correlate tumor regression with mutations status.
      (Integrated) II. To evaluate changes in tumor hypoxia on cediranib treatment compared to
      baseline by [F-18] fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) in patients with NSCLC.

      III. To evaluate levels of angiogenesis/inflammatory markers including VEGF at baseline and
      on treatment.

      IV. To evaluate levels of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at baseline and on
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1. Patients undergoing
      FMISO scan also receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) beginning the day after the second
      FMISO scan and the rest of the patients receive olaparib PO BID beginning day 4 of cycle 1.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days (35 days for cycle 1) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 4
      weeks thereafter.
