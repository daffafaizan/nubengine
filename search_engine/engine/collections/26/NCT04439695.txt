    
      Subjects will be screened up to 14 days (Day -14 to Day 0) before randomization.

      On the planned day of vaccination (Day 1), subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (N
      = 30 subjects/group) to receive study vaccine or placebo by intramuscular (IM) injection.

      Approximately 5 subjects per group (N = 20) will be enrolled in parallel initially, and
      safety data through Day 8 will be collected. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)
      will convene to review Day 8 safety data before any additional subjects will be enrolled. If
      there are no safety concerns in the IDMC meeting, study enrollment will continue.

      Blood and serum samples for safety laboratory tests and HAI titers will be obtained at
      baseline on Day 1 before administration of vaccine dose and after vaccination.
