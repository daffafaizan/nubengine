      model it is generally necessary to utilize human peripheral blood cells for studying aspects
      of either in vivo or in vitro HIV infection. We wish to be able to continue to elucidate many
      pathogenic aspects of HIV infection using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a
      model.
