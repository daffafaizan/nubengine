      may occur in the luteal phase of menstrual cycle. Therefore, luteal phase ovarian stimulation
      (LPOS) was considered as a potential feasible stimulation method during in vitro
      fertilization (IVF) cycle. In the beginning, in order to avoid delaying cancer treatment,
      LPOS was applied for fertility preservation of cancer patients, showing no difference in
      numbers of oocyte retrieved, mature oocytes and fertilization rate between luteal or
      follicular phase stimulation. In the recent, LPOS was used for infertility women, suggesting
      that LPOS owned quite good IVF outcomes. In previous studies, premature luteinizing hormone
      (LH) surge, a major reason worsening ovarian quality in poor ovarian responders (PORs), was
      seldom found in LPOS. High progesterone in luteal phase may aid in suppressing premature LH
      surge. An updated research claimed that numbers of oocyte retrieved, mature oocytes and
      fertilized oocytes in LPOS significantly increased when compared to follicular ovarian
      stimulation. Therefore, the investigators presumed that LPOS was a more effective method than
      follicular stimulation in PORs.
