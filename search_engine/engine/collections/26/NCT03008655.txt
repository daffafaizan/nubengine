      observer-blinded study with split-face design. Each side of the face was randomly allocated
      to either six session at two-week interval of low influence 1064 Nd:YAG laser (6 mm spot
      size, energy fluence 1.2 - 1.4 J/cm 2 at 10 Hz) or low influence 1064nm Nd:YAG laser combined
      with intradermal tranexamic acid injection.Complication Improvement of melasma was assessed
      by Melasma area severity index (MASI),physician's global assessment (PhGA), MELASQOL scale,
      patient's global assessment (PGA), and patient's satisfaction at baseline,6th week,10th week
      after first treatment and 3 months, and 6 months after last treatment.
