        -  Determine the effects of toremifene in terms of response rate, duration of response,
           duration of survival, and toxicity in patients with chemotherapy resistant papillary
           carcinoma of the ovary.

        -  Assess whether a dose response effect is likely for this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      Patients receive one of two doses of oral toremifene daily for 4 weeks. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before therapy and then every 4 weeks during therapy.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The study was closed before any patient accrual.
