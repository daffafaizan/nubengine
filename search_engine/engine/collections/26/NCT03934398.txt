      stiffer and/or not work as well and if it can impact blood pressure over a 24-hour period of
      time. The investigators also want to determine if there are any risk factors or blood tests
      that can predict how stiff arteries are or how well arteries function. The investigators hope
      that the information from this study will help the investigators prevent blood
      pressure-related cardiovascular disease in children. This knowledge could help shape future
      guidelines on how to best prevent and treat high blood pressure and heart disease in
      children.
