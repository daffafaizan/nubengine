      in infants and children. Pharmacological stress induced cMRI could provide crucial
      information such as coronary arteries origin and proximal pathway, wall motion abnormalities,
      myocardial perfusion and viability, enabling accurate monitoring of symptomatic and
      non-pediatric patients. Investigators would build a prospective series of stress cMRI exams
      in pediatric symptomatic and non-patients, with suspected or previously diagnosed coronary
      artery disease. Investigators would put the results in comparison with ECG, Exercise test,
      stress Cardiac Ultrasound and Angiography. At the end of the study, if supported by results,
      the aim is to replace the current diagnostic procedure (ECG, Exercise test, stress Cardiac
      Ultrasound and Angiography) which need long hospitalization, expose the patient to radiation
      dose, is uncomfortable for the patient, and is characterized by a non-negligible risk due to
      invasive procedure, with a single exam (stress cMRI) which is dose-free, minimal risk
      related, without hospitalization, and less expensive for National Care System.
