    
      Asymptomatic women 25 years and older with no history of breast cancer will be recruited from
      a prospective population of patients scheduled for screening mammography (Group A). A similar
      population of women called back from screening for 2-D FFDM-detected abnormalities will also
      be recruited to provide an enriched population of true-positive and false-positive 2-D FFDM
      and tomosynthesis cases (Group B). Pregnant women, women unable to tolerate compression of
      the breast associated with mammography, women with implants, and women with breasts too large
      to accommodate adequate positioning of the breast for DBT are excluded from trial
      participation.

      A total of 550 participants will be recruited--500 women will enroll for collection of
      prospective imaging data in this trial (Group A); 50 additional participants, recalled for
      diagnostic assessment after positive screening findings, will be recruited for DBT imaging
      data collection and retrospective image analysis (Group B). Participating institutions for
      this trial will be clinical research institutions in Pennsylvania with Hologic tomosynthesis
      units.
