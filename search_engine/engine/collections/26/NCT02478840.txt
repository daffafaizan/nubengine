    
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the impact of the long-term treatment with
      Lamazym upon the level of biomarker oligosaccharides in serum and upon the endurance as
      measured by the change from baseline in the number of steps climbed in 3 minutes (3MSCT).

      As secondary objectives, the long term efficacy of Lamazym will be investigated upon
      endurance as measured by the change from baseline in the number of meters walked in six
      minutes (6MWT), upon pulmonary function, motor proficiency by BOT-2 and hearing capability by
      audiometry. In addition, cognitive development will be assessed by Leiter-R test. CNS
      involvement will be evaluated with MRI/MRS (for patients who previously participated in
      rhLAMAN-02 trial), CSF biomarkers (Tau, NFL, GFAp) and CSF biomarkers oligosaccharides.
      Clearance of oligosaccharides in urine will be measured.

      Long-term safety and Pharmaco-Kinetic (PK) profile after long-term treatment as measured by
      rhLAMAN levels in plasma will be assessed as well.

      Quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires (CHAQ and EQ-5D-5L).
