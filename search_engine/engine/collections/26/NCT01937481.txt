      a time when young children establish healthy eating habits and physical activity patterns.
      These habits can place children at risk for obesity and are shaped by many characteristics,
      including individual characteristics as well as school, family and societal environmental
      characteristics. Predictive behaviors, or behavioral antecedents, within these environments
      can influence child behaviors. While many predictive behaviors have been shown to influence
      dietary intake, physical activity, and weight status, two potential behavioral antecedents -
      food preference and motor performance - need further exploration. Understanding the context
      in which child behavioral patterns are developed is critical to developing a model to address
      childhood obesity.

      The Colorado LEAP project is a longitudinal cohort study utilizing a controlled
      quasi-experimental design in 5 rural Colorado communities. Two communities serve as
      intervention communities with the other 3 as matched controls. Intervention sites receive The
      Food FriendsÂ® nutrition and physical activity programs in preschool and 'booster' programming
      in kindergarten and 1st grade. Assessments are administered 4 times - twice in preschool
      (Fall and Spring) and once in both kindergarten and 1st grade (Spring). Observational
      measures with children are conducted at the school; parent/home measures are sent home and
      returned to school via the child; and school personnel complete school environment and policy
      assessments.
