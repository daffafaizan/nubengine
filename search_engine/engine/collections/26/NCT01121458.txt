    
      CARVE is a Phase 4 open-label descriptive observational trial in PAH patients undergoing
      invasive vasoreactivity testing in the cath lab at the Dallas VA Medical Center. Patients
      clinically indicated for RHC and assessment of pulmonary artery vasoreactivity will be
      enrolled if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study will involve the following
      tests:

        1. Performance of clinically indicated RHC with assessment of pulmonary hypertension and
           pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).

        2. Performance of clinically indicated pulmonary vasoreactivity assessment with IV
           Nitroprusside (standard of care)

        3. For patients who are responsive to Nitroprusside, or those who have an inconclusive
           result because of intolerability to Nitroprusside, pulmonary vasoreactivity assessment
           with study drug (IV) will be conducted.
