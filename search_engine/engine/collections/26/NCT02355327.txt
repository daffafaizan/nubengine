      urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor problems. A device that is sometimes recommended
      to women in Austria to enhance their pelvic floor muscles are vibrating vaginal pelvic floor
      training balls. To date, only a small study on vibrating balls exists, and it researched
      women with urinary incontinence and not women after childbirth. Therefore, research is needed
      to scientifically objectify the popular claim of these ballsÂ´ effectiveness in the postpartum
      period and further evidence based practice.

      Method: The tested study features comprise

        -  recruitment strategies,

        -  inclusion and exclusion criteria,

        -  the necessary number of participants,

        -  the randomisation procedure,

        -  the interventions themselves,

        -  concordance and retention measures,

        -  data collection,

        -  effectiveness outcomes,

        -  a survey of women's views of and experiences,

        -  statistics and content analysis.

      Results: The results of this trial will inform the features and feasibility of a future full
      RCT. It will be concluded that a full RCT to determine the effectiveness of vibrating vaginal
      pelvic floor training balls post partum is feasible as planned, feasible with modifications
      or not feasible. If considered feasible, the results will enable the full study to be planned
      correctly.
