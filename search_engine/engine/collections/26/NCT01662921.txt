      the treatment of diabetes during pregnancy: insulin aspart and insulin lispro.

      The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin glulisine are unique and insulin
      glulisine may be the best rapid-acting analog for the treatment of post-prandial
      hyperglycemia. We believe that insulin glulisine should be evaluated in women with
      gestational diabetes for its potential efficacy.
