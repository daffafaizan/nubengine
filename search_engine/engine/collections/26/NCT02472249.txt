      norepinephrine in the hepatic artery. These blood flow variations have never been dynamically
      evaluated before. If indeed blood flow modulation in liver is favorable, the use of
      norepinephrine prior to localized chemotherapy has great potential to enhance treatment and
      diminish side effects. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer, will
      be selected for this study. Included patients will have a trans-arterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) procedure scheduled as treatment for their cancer. During their procedure, they will
      be brought to an advanced CT-scanner. CT perfusion imaging will be performed prior, and after
      the injection of the study drug in the liver artery. Patient's treatment will then be
      completed. Perfusion color maps will illustrate blood flow. Perfusion values will be
      correlated to see how the drug modulates blood flow in tumor and in normal liver.
