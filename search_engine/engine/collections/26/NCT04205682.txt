      Although alcohol related disorders are a leading cause of preventable death in Australia,
      their treatment is generally not evidence-based. Contemporary treatment for managing alcohol
      withdrawal in Australia involves administration of benzodiazepines that, while often
      effective for managing withdrawal symptoms, have concerns regarding their use including: a
      major abuse liability potential in this population; their sedating effects and potential for
      adverse events (e.g. falls, overdose, cognitive impairment) if used in combination with other
      sedatives; and an increased risk of relapse due to symptoms of alcohol dependence that return
      after cessation of treatment (e.g. increased sleep problems and anxiety). However, no other
      safe and effective alternatives to benzodiazepines in treating alcohol withdrawal have yet
      been demonstrated.

      This project will pilot the clinical efficacy and tolerability of Cannabidiol (CBD) relative
      to placebo in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in an inpatient setting across two study
      sites.

      This is a double-blind, randomised controlled design. The trial will recruit 52 participants
      undergoing alcohol withdrawal, using a 1:1 random allocation into one of two treatment groups
      as follows: (1) CBD (Day 1: 1200 mg/day; Day 2-4: 800 mg/day; Day 5: placebo washout; n =
      26), or (2) matched placebo (n = 26). All participants will be administered a symptom
      triggered diazepam medication regimen, as per conventional best-practice management of
      alcohol withdrawal.
