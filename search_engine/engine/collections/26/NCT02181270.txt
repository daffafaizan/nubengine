      Subjects passing screening will then have body composition measurement and aerobic capacity
      (VO2 peak) measured. Blood samples will also be taken and subjects will complete an oral
      glucose tolerance test. Upon completion of this testing subjects will be randomized into one
      of two groups: Continuous moderate exercise group or High-intensity interval exercise .

      Continuous moderate exercise group (CME): Subjects will perform a 5-10 minute warm-up at 50%
      VO2peak. Thereafter, the intensity of exercise will be increased to 70% VO2peak by increasing
      the speed and incline of the treadmill. Subjects will exercise at this intensity for 60
      minutes. A 5 minute cool-down (50% VO2peak).

      High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE): Subjects will perform 5-10 minute warm-up (50%
      VO2peak). Following the warm-up, the speed and incline of the treadmill will be increased so
      that subjects reach an exercise intensity that corresponds to 90% Heart Rate max. Subjects
      will exercise at this intensity for 4 minutes, after which the treadmill speed and incline
      will be reduced to an intensity between 55% and 70% Heart Rate max for 3 minutes. This
      procedure will be replicated three additional times for a total of four intervals/recovery
      periods. The total exercise commitment will be ~45 minutes.

      After 4 wk of exercise training all subjects will undergo all of the initial testing.
