    
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center), open-label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), single-arm study to investigate safety and efficacy of
      abiraterone. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (consists of 14 days before
      study commences on Day -1); Treatment phase (consists of 28-daily dosing cycles wherein
      abiraterone 1000 milligram [mg] once daily along with 5 mg prednisolone twice daily will be
      given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed); and Follow-up phase
      (up to 5 years or until survival after the first dose of study drug). Abiraterone will be
      orally administered daily as at least 1 hour before the meal or 2 hours after the meal. Dose
      reduction will be allowed at the Investigator's discretion but not lower than 500 mg per day.
      Participants will discontinue study treatment at disease progression unless, in the
      Investigator's opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit
      from abiraterone. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily through decline in prostate-specific
      antigen (substance in blood that is measured to check for prostate cancer) after 12 weeks of
      therapy. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
