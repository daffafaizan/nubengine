      with more changes in fetal heart rate and uterine tonus than epidural analgesia, and the
      opinions in literature are not fully consolidated. The decrease of cathecolamines levels are
      implicated in this changes, but there is not studies in patients with comorbidities or with
      modern labor analgesia.

      OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effects of combined spinal-epidural analgesia and epidural
      analgesia on maternal cathecolamines levels, fetal heart rate and uterine basal tone in
      pregnancies with comorbidities

      METHOD: This is experimental, analytical, prospective, randomized, double-blind. It will
      include 50 pregnant women with gestations with comorbidities, admitted on labor. Pregnants
      will be randomly divided into two groups: combined spinal-epidural analgesia and epidural
      analgesia. The primary dependent variables to be evaluated will be the change in
      cathecolamine levels, uterine tone and changes in the fetal heart rate.
