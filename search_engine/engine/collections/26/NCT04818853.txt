    
      COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-COV2 which emerged
      in late 2019 in Wuhan, China (1). This illness is associated with viral prodromal symptoms,
      then subsequently fever, cough, and shortness of breath (1). In a subset of patients, lower
      respiratory tract infection associated with respiratory failure develops. Among these
      patients, progression to severe respiratory failure and ARDS requiring ventilator support has
      occurred in an alarming number of patients at rates that are many-fold higher than what is
      typically associated with seasonal influenza A or B (2). One of the most feared complications
      of post-influenza respiratory failure is the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
      which may occur in as many as 15-20% of those requiring ventilator support (based on European
      data) (3-6). Among those developing IA following influenza A or B, mortality of 50% or
      greater is reported (3-6).
