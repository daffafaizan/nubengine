      nature, and mechanism linking bisphenol A to type 2 diabetes remains unclear. The
      investigator's preliminary data suggests that in young adults, single oral BPA consumption
      significantly decreased glucose, insulin, and C-Peptide responses to an oral glucose
      tolerance test, suggesting that immediate consumption of bisphenol A has an effect on muscle
      insulin sensitivity, hepatic glucose suppression and/or digestion and absorption to lower
      blood glucose, insulin, and C-Peptide concentrations. The present experimental study
      evaluating the effects of bisphenol A over several days on the pathogenesis of type 2
      diabetes will directly assess each of these potential mechanisms using gold standard measures
      (euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique and hepatic glucose suppression with glucose
      stable isotope infusion, and fecal microbiota).
