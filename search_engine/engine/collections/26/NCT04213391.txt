      mechanism of sulforaphane in treatment of AD. The study will recruit 160 AD patients, then
      these patients will be randomized to sulforaphane group or placebo group (80 patients per
      arm) for 24 weeks clinic trial. Clinical efficacy and safety assessment will be done at
      screen/baseline, 4 week, 12 week, 24 week. The specific aims are to compare sulforaphane
      versus placebo on: 1) clinical core symptoms; The investigators hypothesize that (1)
      sulforaphane is superior to placebo in the treatment of clinical symptoms in patients with
      AD, measured by the ADAS-cog, MMSE Scale, Moca; (2) Biological samples will be collected, and
      stored so that the hypothesis sulforaphane may alter oxidative stress indexes or inflammatory
      biomarkers, and influence histone deacetylase inhibitor mechanism or inflammatory mechanism
      et al that may be significantly correlated with clinical improvement. (3) Safety index
      including blood and urine routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation index and clinical
      effect index about neuropsychological scales will be recorded.
