      persistent AF is insufficient due to AF substrate extending to left atrium. Strategy of
      catheter ablation for persistent AF is not established despite attempts of numerous left
      atrial substrate modifications. Additional PWI on PVI is one of expected effective strategies
      for persistent AF, because PW originated from common tissue of PV and is considered to play a
      part in AF trigger and maintenance. However, this strategy is also not established in the
      recent international consensus statement. Following two reasons are considered. One is the
      procedural difficulty in creating durable PWI, and another is the existence of patients who
      can recover by only PVI. The latest technology, ablation index, can create durable PVI, and
      may create durable PWI. Several reports suggested that PVI only strategy was sufficient in
      the patients with persistent AF who could maintain sinus rhythm after pharmacological or
      electrical cardioversion. Therefore, we planed this randomized clinical trial that compared
      between PVI alone and additional PWI on PVI using ablation index in the patients with
      persistent AF without pharmacological sinus rhythm conversion.
