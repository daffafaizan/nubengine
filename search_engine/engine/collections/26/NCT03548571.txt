      into the trial. Ex vivo generated DCs will be frozen and stored in the vapour phase of liquid
      nitrogen.

      At first surgery, tumor biopsies will be cultured under sphere-forming conditions under ex
      vivo conditions for enrichment of glioblastoma stem cells. mRNA will purified and amplified
      from these autologous tumor stem cells.

      At specified intervals patients randomized to the vaccine group will receive intradermal
      injections of DCs transfected with mRNA from autologous tumor stem cells, survivin and hTERT.
      Injections will be given as three separate injections at three separate sites.

      Vaccination will be continued for as long as there are vaccines available.
