      colonoscopy. Deep sedation ensures amnesia for the procedure and may ensure better operating
      conditions, but may result in cardiorespiratory side effects and prolonged recovery.
      Differences exist between countries regarding the prevailing depth of sedation with deeper
      sedation in general being administered in Australia than the United States. This study aims
      to explore that controversy.
