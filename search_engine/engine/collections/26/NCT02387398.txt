    
      Cardiac arrest is a major public health issue. Arizona has been a leader in improving
      long-term survival by introducing new and innovative resuscitation approaches including
      "Chest Compression-Only CPR" and "Cardiocerebral Resuscitation". Post-resuscitation care is
      the next great opportunity for further improvements. Early coronary angiography (CAG)
      combined with therapeutic hypothermia has become the recommended standard of care for
      post-cardiac arrest patients manifesting ST segment elevation on their electrocardiogram
      (ECG). However, the majority of cardiac arrest victims do not have ST segment elevation.
      There is clinical equipoise as to whether these patients will benefit from early CAG.

      Subjects who are qualified for the study will be randomized 1:1 to one of two groups.

      ° Intervention Group-Early coronary angiography (door-to-angiography) within 120 minutes of
      admission to Emergency Department.

      or

      ° Control Group-No early coronary angiography (within the first six hours from admission)

      All enrolled patients, will be treated with therapeutic hypothermia which is standard of
      care, beginning simultaneously with both groups or within at least 2 hours of hospital
      arrival.

      Subject will be followed for 180 days for safety and long-term survival.
