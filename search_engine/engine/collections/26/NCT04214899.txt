    
      -  Identify the main epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with Heart
           Failure with reduced ejection fraction, as well as the medical treatment models used.

        -  Determine the prescription rate of a cardiovascular pharmacological treatment and the
           prescription and implant rate of a cardiac medical device in patients with Heart Failure
           with reduced ejection fraction.

        -  Determine the mortality rate and its classification in patients with Heart Failure with
           reduced ejection fraction.

        -  Identify the barriers, if any, to prescribing and implanting a cardiac medical device in
           those patients with a Class I recommendation according to the ACC/AHA/HRS 2017
           guidelines.

        -  Determine the population with a profile of 1.5 primary prevention of sudden cardiac
           death (patients with Heart Failure in primary prevention who have one or more of the
           following risk factors: syncope or pre-syncope; left ventricular ejection fraction less
           than 25%; presence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; more than 10 ventricular
           extrasystoles per hour observed in a 24-hour Holter).

        -  Collect data on the use of resources associated with the follow-up of patients diagnosed
           with Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction during a period of 12 months to
           perform a secondary economic analysis.
