      patients, the acquisition of tissue samples is difficult and traumatic. It is of great
      significance for the diagnosis and treatment of these patients to determine MSI status by
      blood testing. In addition, the heterogeneity of malignant tumors is usually strong, blood
      testing can overcome the heterogeneity of tissue, and can dynamically monitor the patient's
      condition. 50 patients with gastric cancer, duodenal cancer and small intestinal cancer will
      be enrolled in the study. Among them, 30 patients with MSI-H and 20 patients with MSS
      confirmed by IHC/PCR.The investigators will use 520 gene panel for NGS sequencing of tissue
      and blood samples from selected patients to study the sensitivity and specificity of NGS in
      detecting Microsatellite State in blood.
