      snoring and sleep problems are so common in the community, and how the home and neighborhood
      environment impacts sleep in children. Investigators want to know if factors such as the
      quality of air, household dust, environmental noise, and family routines impact sleep and
      other health and behavioral factors associated with sleep.

      Investigators want to test how sleep is influenced by factors such as: the quality of air
      inside and outside the child's home (including measuring pollution, second hand smoke, and
      dust); temperature and humidity; family routines and interactions; and characteristics of the
      home. Investigators will ask participants to come in for a one time visit for undergoing
      procedures as well as answering questions regarding general health, asthma and sleep. 10% of
      the participating children will have a second home assessment and sleep monitoring procedures
      performed 6 months after the initial home assessment.
