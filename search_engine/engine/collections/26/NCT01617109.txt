      laboratory indicates that vitamin D status may decline in Soldiers during BCT, even during
      the summer months in the Southeastern United States. Stress fractures may affect up to 5% of
      male and 21% of female Soldiers during training, resulting in attrition in up to 60% of
      affected personnel, but a recent report indicates that vitamin D and calcium supplementation
      may attenuate stress fracture risk by up to 20% in female Navy recruits. However, biochemical
      measures of nutritional status and associated markers of bone health were not collected in
      that study, leaving questions regarding the vitamin D and calcium requirements for military
      personnel during periods of elevated bone turnover.
