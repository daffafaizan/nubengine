    
      Pazopanib has been formulated as an eye drop for the topical treatment of age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in a first
      study conducted in healthy volunteers (MD7108238). In the present study, three dosing
      regimens of pazopanib eye drops, administered for 28 days, will be evaluated in subjects with
      occult or minimally classic subtypes of choroidal neovascularization due to AMD. This study
      is designed to measure pharmacological activity of topically administered pazopanib in target
      tissues (choroid and retina) of patients with AMD by weekly evaluation of central retinal
      thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Evaluation of efficacy will be
      performed on an exploratory basis by weekly measurement of visual acuity. The ocular and
      systemic safety and systemic pharmacokinetics of pazopanib treatment for 28 days will also be
      evaluated.
