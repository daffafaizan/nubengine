    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rates of complete remission (CR) plus CR with incomplete recovery (CRi)
      achieved with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) (cytarabine) plus the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1)
      inhibitor MK-8776 (Chk1 inhibitor SCH 900776) vs. ara-C alone for adults (ages 18-75) with
      relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and compare the toxicities of ara-C + MK-8776 vs. ara-C alone. II. To
      determine the disease free and overall survival of those achieving response to treatment.

      III. To determine the impact of MK-8776 on AML blast cell deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair
      protein expression profiles and correlate the expression profiles with CR/CRi in response to
      ara-C + MK-8776 vs. ara-C alone.

      IV. To evaluate and compare the amount of DNA damage induced in AML blasts by ara-C + MK-8776
      vs. ara-C.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3
      and 10-12 and Chk1 inhibitor SCH 900776 IV over 30 minutes on days 2, 3, 11, and 12.

      ARM B: Patients receive cytarabine as in Arm A.

      In both arms, courses may repeat every 28 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
