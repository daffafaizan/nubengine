      conducted in approximately 14 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na√Øve subjects.
      Subjects who meet all screening requirements may enter the study and initiate treatment as
      soon as all screening procedures have been completed and results are available and on file.
      The 14-day screening period may be extended to 28 days to allow receipt of all Screening
      assessment results and to accommodate scheduling.

      Subjects who fulfill eligibility requirements will receive dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg once
      daily in combination with the fixed dose dual nucleoside reverse transcripatase
      inhibitor(NRTI) abacavir/lamivudine ABC/3TC for 96 weeks. One pair of pharmacokinetic (PK)
      samples in plasma and CSF (matching time) for determination of DTG concentration will be
      collected at Week 2 and Week 16. Samples for plasma HIV-1 RNA will be collected at Baseline
      and various time points throughout the study and samples for HIV-1 RNA levels in the CSF will
      be collected at Baseline, Week 2 and Week 16. Safety, additional measures of antiviral
      activity and development of viral resistance will also be evlauated. The primary analysis
      will take place after the last subject completes 16 weeks on therapy; additional analyses
      will be conducted after the last subject completes Weeks 2 and 96 (end of study).

      Subjects are considered to have completed the study if they remain on therapy (i.e., have not
      permanently discontinued investigational product [IP]) and complete the Treatment Phase,
      including the Week 96 visit.
