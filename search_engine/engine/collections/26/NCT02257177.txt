      either a single dose of TD139 or matching placebo via DPI (dry powder inhaler) in an
      ascending dose fashion.

      A single cohort of up to 24 patients will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to
      receive a single dose of TD139 or placebo via DPI once daily for 14 days in a 2:1 TD139 to
