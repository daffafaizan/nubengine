      echocardiography from Day1 (first echocardiography performed within 12h after the diagnosis
      of septic shock) to Day3, after vasopressor discontinuation (Day end), and on Day28 or at
      hospital discharge (if occurs before Day28). Echocardiographic data will be anonymized and
      stored in DICOM format in a dedicated database for independent measurements by an expert in
      echocardiography blinded from the clinical data of the patients including vital status. Vital
      and biological parameters usually monitored for the management of septic shock will be
      collected at the time of each echocardiographic assessment. Patients' vital status will be
      collected on Day28. The potential influence of LV diastolic dysfunction and LV hyperkinesia
      on prognosis will be assessed.
