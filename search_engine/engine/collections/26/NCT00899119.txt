        -  Harvest and store adequate CD34+ stem cells from patients with Waldenstrom's
           macroglobulinemia (WM) for potential future use in transplantation strategies.

        -  Evaluate the ability to harvest stem cells after therapy for WM (e.g., fludarabine-based
           chemotherapy) by evaluating the number of days to adequate harvest.

        -  Collect aliquots of stem cells for future research analysis as part of a WM database
           project.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo collection of autologous stem cells beginning on day 4 or 5 and
      continuing until an adequate number of stem cells are collected. Cells are then
      cryopreserved.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
