    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current standard-of-care treatment, the
      addition of an ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block decreases post-amputation phantom
      limb and stump pain.

      Hypothesis 1: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, phantom limb and/or stump pain
      will be significantly decreased four weeks following a multiple-day ambulatory continuous
      peripheral nerve block as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (as
      measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).

      Specific Aim 2: To investigate the possible relationship between the addition of a
      multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block to standard-of-care treatment of
      post-amputation phantom limb and/or stump pain and cortical reorganization.

      Hypothesis 2: Following upper or lower extremity amputation with subsequent phantom limb
      pain/sensation and/or stump pain, the addition of a multiple-day ambulatory continuous
      peripheral nerve block to standard-of-care treatment will result in cortical reorganization
      during and four-weeks following the perineural infusion (as measured by MRI).
