      risk of mobility limitation, falls, fractures, mortality, and lower quality of life. The
      European Working Group on Sarcopenia has recently revisited one of the widely used most
      acknowledged definitions and launched the revised European consensus on definition and
      diagnosis (EWGSOP2) (4). Applying the EWGSOP2 is a three-tier process: first, screening by
      the Sluggishness, Assistance in walking, Rising from a chair, Climb stairs, Falls (SARC-F)
      questionnaire; second, diagnosis by low muscle strength, and low muscle mass; third, severity
      grading by low muscle function. The EWGSOP2 recommends the assessment of sarcopenia in every
      population, both in community-dwelling and acute care older patients. However, the evidence
      about the performance indicators of the SARC-F questionnaire to screen for sarcopenia in
      acute patients admitted to an acute care unit is really limited.
