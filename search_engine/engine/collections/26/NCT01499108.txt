    
      Hypotheses Primary hypothesis • Liraglutide treatment causes a reduction in 24h BP

      Secondary hypothesis:

        -  The effect on BP may be mediated by an increase in natriuresis, thereby affecting ECV

        -  The effect on BP may be mediated by a decrease in arterial stiffness and central aortic
           pressure

      Purpose Primary purpose

      • To assess how quickly the antihypertensive effect of liraglutide treatment set in after
      initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes

      Secondary objectives

        -  To measure the effect of liraglutide treatment on natriuresis.

        -  To measure the effect of liraglutide treatment on ECV

        -  To measure the effect of liraglutide treatment on arterial stiffness

        -  To measure weight change after initiation of liraglutide treatment
