      appear during the night and are often associated with secondary insomnia. They are common
      especially in older age. There is no evidence that any method of prevention of nocturnal leg
      cramps is both safe and effective. There are no previous trials concerning cramp prevention
      by using compression stockings. The objective of this study is to assess in a prospective
      randomised controlled trial whether leg cramps can be prevented by the daily use of
      knee-length compression stockings or magnesium supplements.

      Methods The study will be set in Finland, and 50-84-year-old volunteers will be recruited
      through Google Ads, the Finnish Health Library and Finnish primary health care centres. The
      participants must have a minimum of two episodes of leg cramps per week for the past four
      weeks to be included in the study. The participants (n = 225) will be allocated to three
      equal groups: the compression stocking arm, the magnesium supplement arm and the placebo arm.
      The participants will go through four weeks of follow-up without intervention, and then
      another four weeks of follow-up with the assigned intervention. The material for the study
      will be collected through electronic questionnaires.

      Discussion This protocol describes a study that compares compression stockings, magnesium
      supplements and placebo for the prevention of leg cramps. The results of this study can
      significantly improve knowledge on the methods of preventing leg cramps.
