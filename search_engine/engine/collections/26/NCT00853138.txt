      prevalence rate and significant impact on children's mood, daily functioning, and overall
      quality of life. Effective psychological treatments have been developed to change behaviors
      and thoughts important in the child's ability to cope with chronic pain. However, the
      majority of children do not have access to these treatments due to a variety of barriers such
      as geographical distance from pediatric pain treatment centers.

      The purpose of this study is to develop a more accessible method of delivering effective
      psychological treatment to reduce pain and increase function in children. Children with
      chronic headache, abdominal, or musculoskeletal pain will be randomized to either receive the
      web-based treatment right away or to be in a wait-list control condition and receive the
      treatment 8 weeks later. Both groups of children will continue to receive clinical care
      through specialty medical clinics. Children's level of pain, their ability to perform, daily
      functional activities, and overall quality of life will be evaluated before treatment begins,
      immediately after treatment, and at a 3 month follow up.
