      habits. Parents will be divided into non-smokers and smokers. Half of the smoking mothers
      will receive guidance regarding the association between parents smoking and respiratory
      diseases in the infant. They will also get ideas on how to reduce smoke exposure by their
      infant. 3 months and 1 year later all parents will be contacted by phone and asked about
      their children's health.
