      they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria they will be offered enrollment. Subjects who choose
      to enroll will be randomized to receive either hydrocortisone 120mg PO, or placebo PO, one
      time in the Emergency Department. They will be given a packet of general information on
      traumatic stress and contact information for psychiatric assistance if they require it, but
      no further PTSD treatment will be given. Any further medical treatment will be at the
      discretion of the treating team.

      At 6 weeks after enrollment subjects will be contacted by phone, and a brief structured
      interview, based on the PCL-S (a well-validated screening instrument for PTSD), will be
      administered by phone. Participants who screen positive will be informed that they may be
      suffering from PTSD, and will be offered the opportunity to seek care with the Einstein
      Psychiatry Department's PTSD program.

      At 6 months after enrollment subjects will again be contacted and administered the PCL-C, as
      well as questions regarding other psychiatric comorbidities, substance use, and involvement
      in any further episodes of violence. In addition, review of subject medical records over the
      year since injury will be undertaken to determine if there is any difference in subsequent
      health-care utilization between those who received hydrocortisone vs placebo and between
      those who screen positive for PTSD vs those who don't.
