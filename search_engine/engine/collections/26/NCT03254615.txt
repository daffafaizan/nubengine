    
      A community intervention trial will be conducted at four public elementary schools of the
      Coyoacan Delegation in Mexico City. It will include healthy first graders during the
      2017-2018 school year whose parents agree to participate through verbal informed consent and
      a signed privacy notice. These parents will complete a baseline 3-day beverage record (two
      weekdays and one weekend day). The four schools will be assigned to one of three groups:
      Group I will receive the educational strategy during the first grade; Group II will receive
      it during first and second grades; and Group III will receive it during the first, second,
      and third grades. All schools will have water dispensers inside the classrooms, and the
      children will receive a reusable 600-mL bottle so they are able to consume water on demand
      throughout the day. A second record of beverage consumption will be obtained by completing
      multiple interventions within each group, and a third record will be completed 1 year later.
