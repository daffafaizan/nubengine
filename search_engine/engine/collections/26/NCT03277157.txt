      transit time, increasing stool frequency, and normalizing stool form. A 20-week randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study will be carried out. Participants will
      complete a 4-week baseline period during which stool frequency, stool consistency (transit
      time), and gastrointestinal symptoms will be collected by paper questionnaire, and
      participants will collect a single stool. Dietary intake data (3-day) will be obtained during
      the baseline period. Participants will be randomized on or about day 29 and will consume
      Bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis B94 (B. lactis B94) or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a
      4-week washout, 4 weeks on the alternative, and second 4-week washout. Participants will be
      randomized by sealed envelope method, prepared by a UF faculty member not affiliated with the
      study.

      During the intervention and washout periods, participants will complete daily questionnaires
      to assess stool frequency and form (Bristol Stool Form Scale). Furthermore, they will
      complete Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20(± 3 days).
      During these same weeks (± 3 days) dietary intake data (28-day record) and stools will be
      collected (1 per period). Participants' height and weight will be taken at baseline, and
      weight during weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.
