      screened to rule out physiological sleep disorders. Sleep schedules will be regulated to the
      average bedtime of a two-week baseline sleep log. Subjects will undergo two two-night,
      home-based monitoring phases, one an experimental and one a control condition, separated by a
      washout period of at least five nights. The order of conditions will be counterbalanced
      between subjects in double-blind fashion. In the experimental condition subjects will wear
      sleepwear constructed of two fabric types arranged bilaterally, with typical cotton spandex
      insulating material on one side and specialized conductive material on the other. In the
      control condition subjects will wear sleepwear that is similarly lateralized in terms of
      appearance but constructed with typical cotton spandex insulating material on both sides.
      Ambulatory monitoring will include body position, EEG, actigraphy, skin temperature at
      multiple proximal sites, and sternal skin moisture. Subjective scales of insomnia severity,
      menopausal symptoms and sleepwear rating will also be employed.
