    
      OLT1177 Gel is being developed for the topical treatment of pain and inflammation emanating
      from musculoskeletal and certain skin inflammatory conditions.

      This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of OLT1177 Gel in healthy
      subjects when given as single-dose or multi-dose applications. The study will be conducted in
      two parts, Part A and Part B. In Part A, approximately 18 healthy subjects in 3 dose
      escalating cohorts will be randomized to receive a single dose of the investigational drug (5
      subjects OLT1177 Gel and 1 subject placebo gel). Upon completion of Part A, a new subject
      population of approximately 18 subjects in 3 dose escalating cohorts will be randomized in
      Part B of the study. Subjects will receive a total of 8 doses over 3 consecutive days given 6
      hours apart while awake during the day and will be followed for up to 30 days for safety
      assessment.
