    
      Summary: This retrospective/prospective, non-randomized controlled study, whereby patients
      will be included in 1 of 2 groups depending on their current treatments as outlined below.
      Patients will be assigned to a specific group by the clinician/PI based on their current
      regimen with the intent to stay on this regimen for the next 3 years.

      Duration of Study and Subject Participation: Study subject enrollment is anticipated to occur
      over about 12 months and study duration per subject will be 3 years. Thus a total study
      duration of 4 years is anticipated.

      Intervention: By using musculoskeletal ultrasound, the investigators will measure joint
      health among participants and assess joint health changes over 3 years compared between group
      A (factor prophylaxis) vs. group B (emicizumab prophylaxis) as assessed by MSKUS at baseline
      and after 3 years. Other outcomes such as bone density, comparative assessment of joint and
      overall health status, and exploration of potential biomarkers for joint and bone health will
      also be assessed.
