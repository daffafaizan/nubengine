      quality of life and treatments represent a major health cost. Prevention or delayed onset of
      the disease remains a key target. Animal studies have shown that provision of high amounts of
      fish oil in the diet improves insulin sensitivity but human trials have proved equivocal.
      Recent dose-response trials in animals have shown the improved insulin sensitivity only
      occurs when the proportion of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA),
      docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, exceeds 14% of the total phospholipid
      fraction within tissue cell membranes. To achieve such values in humans would require a high
      dose of n-3 PUFA supplied over a prolonged period of time. This is tested within the current
      study where a daily dose of 6 g day of fish oil (containing a total of 3g docosahexaenoic
      acid plus eicosapentaenoic acid) is supplied for 9 months. As well as improving control of
      glycemia increased insulin sensitivity may also enhance protein metabolism and reduce the
      impact of frailty in older subjects.
