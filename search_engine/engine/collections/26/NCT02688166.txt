      radiotherapy for lung and breast cancers will demonstrate evidence of cardiac strain and
      dysfunction proportional to the extent of cardiac exposure during the course of radiation.
      The investigators intention is to conduct a pilot study of 10 patients receiving moderate
      doses of radiation exposure to the heart (5 lung cancer patients and 5 breast cancer
      patients) when treated by our current institutional standards with the idea that this could
      lead to a grant if early signs of cardiac injury can be measured. These patients' treatment
      plans would include contours to measure dose received by multiple structures within the heart
      (coronary vessels and all cardiac chambers) as well as the heart/pericardium itself. The
      investigators would obtain biomarkers by bloodwork before, during, and after radiotherapy for
      correlation with clinical outcomes and Cardiac MRIs obtained prior to and 1 year after
      completion of radiotherapy.
