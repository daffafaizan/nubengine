      from 105 patients over 65 years-old undergoing reversed shoulder arthroplasties by proximal
      humerus fractures, in 3 or 4 parts.

      Patient information is obtained from the clinical records in their usual preoperative
      assessment, and follow-up on the usual routine checks, at the first week, 90 days and 1 year.

      Minor and major complications rates are evaluated according to preoperative risk (ASA),
      underlying diseases and according to anticoagulant / antiaggregant treatments.

      Likewise, transfusion rates related to ASA, as well as length of hospital stay related to it.
