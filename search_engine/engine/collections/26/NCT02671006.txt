      hypothesized and could be either synergistic or revealing different types of urticaria. But
      most of these mechanisms seem to converge to Mast cells releasing histamine and other
      products. These mechanisms include auto-antibody and / or cytokines inappropriate production.
      However, internal dysregulation of Mast cell have also been reported, that could be either
      primary or secondary to extrinsic mediators mentioned already. Basophils closely related to
      Mast cells, easily accessible and usually serve as surrogate for clinical analysis of allergy
      or urticaria.

      Flow-cytometry (FCM) is a recent tool with increasing interest due to its exceptional
      capacity of analysis of a large number of cells, individually, at high speed and measuring
      many parameters at a time. FCM has been extensively used in characterization of cell sub
      populations in several diseases such as hematology disorders or immunology and among them the
      basophil. FCM is now the gold standard for ex vivo functional analyses of basophil activation
      as part of the diagnosis of allergy.

      The present project aims to explore phenotypic and functional changes that could reflect the
      dysregulation in Urticaria. This would have diagnosis and physiopathological interest with
      potential impact on optimizing disease monitoring and treatment.
