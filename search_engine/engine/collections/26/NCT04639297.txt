      significant intraoperative risks that can influence postoperative neurologic outcomes. Spinal
      cord monitoring had made it possible to track the spine and nerve root sensory and motor
      tracts. This has improved the ability to conduct minimally invasive surgery by allowing
      surgeons to operate without direct visualization of the neurologic elements.

      Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of the spinal cord is primarily accomplished by both
      somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and transcranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEPs). Due
      to a shortage in personnel trained to evaluate neuro-monitoring results, surgeon-driven
      systems have been established. An example of a surgeon driven monitoring system is
      NeuroVisionÂ®, which interacts with the surgeon during the operation by providing real-time
      visible and auditory tcMEP and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) waveforms. This stands
      in comparison to hospital based methods of IONM.
