    
      Subjects with skin laxity and evaporative dry eye will be recruited for enrollment in this
      study. Subjects must present with subjective and objective indicators for periorbital skin
      laxity and wrinkle grade of 2 or greater out of a 4 point scale. To qualify, subjects must
      present with high symptoms score on subjective Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI©)
      Questionnaires (scores≥ 15); Rapid Tear Break up (< 5 seconds) and Grade ≥ 1 of Flourescein
      Staining in one area of the cornea. Each of these parameters are to be assessed prior to
      treatment and at each follow up visit. Treatment is to be performed on periorbital skin only
      around one eye of the subject using the THERMIeyes® standard protocol. This may result in
      some redness of the periorbital skin. Subjects are to be seen and treated 2-3 weeks apart for
      a total of 3 treatments. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after the final
      treatment. A Validated Grading Scale for Crow's Feet will be used to evaluate changes in skin
      wrinkles and dry eye signs and symptoms scores will be compared with pre-treatment findings.
