        -  To observe the safety of imatinib compared with that of historical data for locally
           unresectable advanced GIST without metastasis.

      Secondary Objective

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) in resected patients during follow up

        -  R0 resection rate

        -  objective response rate, tumor shrinkage rate

        -  Correlation of mutation status with response

        -  Correlation of PK with response

        -  Surgical morbidity and mortality and safety follow up

        -  Quality of life

        -  Overall survival (OS)
