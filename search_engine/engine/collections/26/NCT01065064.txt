      AcrySof® ReSTOR SN6AD1 intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.

      Prospective study of 50 patients with cataract that had phacoemulsification and AcrySof®
      ReSTOR IOL implantation. Uncorrected distance vision acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual
      acuity (CDVA), distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), and distance-corrected
      intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) were measured postoperatively. A patient-satisfaction and
      visual phenomena questionnaire was administered at the end of the study.
