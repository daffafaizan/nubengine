      perioperative mortality rates have declined in recent years, pancreatic resection is still
      associated with significant postoperative malnutrition, maldigestion, and glucose
      intolerance, mostly as a result of pancreatic insufficiency. Quantifying individual
      pancreatic function remains a challenge, but is essential in improving the survival and
      quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients. Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) has recently emerged as a widely-accepted noninvasive
      technique to assess morphological changes in pancreatic ducts, as well as functional
      secretory capacity of the gland. The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP as a means to
      evaluate for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. This will be a prospective study of twelve
      patients who have undergone pancreatic resection and who have symptoms of abdominal pain,
      steatorrhea or weight loss. We will be comparing quantitative parameters of S-MRCP (maximal
      change in pancreatic duct diameter and volume before and after secretin administration) with
      endoscopic pancreatic function testing (maximal bicarbonate concentration in duodenal
      aspirate after secretin administration).
