      the effectiveness of collaborative care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease cared for
      in primary care practices. In the prior trial, we demonstrated that guideline-level medical
      care resulted in improved quality of care and improved behavioral and psychological symptoms
      over one year among patients and their caregivers. However, despite finding significant
      differences among study groups on Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, we did not find a
      significant difference between groups in functional decline. Both study groups experienced a
      significant decline in function over 18 months. The current study proposes to test a
      home-based intervention specifically designed to slow the rate of functional decline among
      older adults with Alzheimer's disease.

      In addition to building on our past research, the study also builds from recently reported
      research which demonstrated the short-term efficacy of home-based occupational therapy
      interventions among older adults with dementia. These trials show that older adults with
      dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, can both participate in and benefit from
      occupational therapy-based interventions delivered in the home.

      The specific aim of this study is to conduct a two-year, randomized, controlled clinical
      trial to improve functioning among older adults with Alzheimer's disease by comparing a
      control group receiving best practices primary care with an intervention group receiving best
      practice primary care plus a home-based occupational therapy intervention. We will test the
      primary hypothesis that subjects with Alzheimer's disease in the intervention group will have
      improved function at two years compared with the best practice primary care control group.
