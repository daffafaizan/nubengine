    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether huperzine A, donepezil, and
      galantamine impact militarily relevant aspects of neurocognitive performance in humans,
      compared to placebo.

      Secondary: Secondary objectives are to correlate neurocognitive performance effects with
      degree of inhibition and therefore sequestration of red blood cell AChE by huperzine A,
      donepezil, and galantamine, and to monitor the safety of the study drugs in healthy adult
      (18-39 years) males and females.

      In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups design, normal, healthy,
      adult male and female volunteers will be administered one of the drug/doses. They will be
      tested prior to and periodically for militarily relevant performance tasks for up to 8 hours
      post-dose and for cholinesterase levels via finger prick.
