      active-controlled therapeutic trial is to determine whether treatment with huperzine A
      sustained-release tablets can improve cognitive function in individuals with AD.

      A total of 390 participants will be randomly assigned to three groups of equal size. This
      will allow a comparison of huperzine A sustained-release tablets 400µg once a day, huperzine
      A tablets 200µg twice a day, and placebo.

      The study is divided into 2 periods:

        1. A two-week placebo run-in period

        2. A 6-month double blind treatment period, consisting of three months of titration and
           three months of fixed dose treatment.
