      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The gut flora in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an arthritis
      that can occur with IBD, has not been well studied. The immune cells in the colon directly
      interface with bacteria and may be influenced by them. The interactions between the colon
      immune system, bacteria and autoimmunity hasn't been studied. The study goal is to
      specifically study the link between bacteria, the colonic immune system, and the autoimmune
      diseases of AS and IBD. This will be done by collecting clinical data by questionnaires,
      blood samples, colonic tissue during endoscopy, and microbiome data in subjects with IBD, AS,
      and controls.
