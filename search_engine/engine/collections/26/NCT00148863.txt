      many patients, there is no efficacy of this treatment on hepatitis C, and there is no
      treatment recommended for them. Interferon gamma has anti-infectious and anti-fibrosis
      activity. This study will evaluate the effect, after a second treatment with peg-interferon
      alpha 2a and ribavirin for 12 Weeks, of the addition of interferon gamma in non responders
      patients. 65 patients will be included in order to include 27 patients who are non responders
      after 12 weeks of a second treatment and are eligible to receive interferon gamma. Patients
      will then receive peg-interferon alpha 2a (180 micro g once a week, by injection), ribavirin
      (1,000 to 1,200 mg per day, according to weight) and interferon gamma (100 micro g thrice a
      week, by injection) during 8 months
