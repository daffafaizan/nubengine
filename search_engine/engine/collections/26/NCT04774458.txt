      cervicalgia or cervical radicular pain. To achieve a successful procedure, accurate access to
      the cervical epidural space is needed. However, careful attention is required for this
      cervical epidural procedure due to a possibility of serious complications such as spinal cord
      infarction and quadriplegia due to blood vessel damage, convulsion due to an intravascular
      drug administration, cerebral infarction due to vascular embolism, subdural or subarachnoid
      injection, hematoma, and spinal cord injury. Although the use of fluoroscopy improves the
      safety and accuracy of cervical epidural access, this technique still has significant
      drawbacks, such as false loss of resistance and difficulty in assessing the depth of the
      needle tip in lateral views in relation to the epidural space. To overcome this issue,
      cervical epidural access using the contralateral oblique (CLO) view has been introduced and
      the ideal angle of CLO view for the cervical spine is reported as 50 degrees.

      However, it has not been reported on the safety and clinical utility of using the CLO view
      during cervical epidural access. Therefore, the investigators planned this study to observe
      the safety and clinical utility of the CLO view at 50 degrees for the cervical epidural
      block.
