      compared to the general population, even for "simple" heart disease.

      Regular physical activity is known to reduce the risk of acquired heart disease.

      Cardiac rehabilitation programs have been largely developed to manage adult coronary and
      heart failure patients, which is not yet the case routinely in patients, adults and children,
      carriers of DC.

      The investigators assume that patients who participate in this program will improve their
      quality of life compared to controls.

      The orginality of the rehabilitation program consists in its design : initial
      hospitalizationfor a short period of time (5 days) at the rehabilitation center, followed by
      11 weeks of rehabilitation at home under the supervision of a specialized sports trainer .
