      which causes back pain and affects the functionality of axial skeleton. Besides the effect
      upon axial skeleton, the disease also affects the peripheral joints. In most patients,
      tenuous affection of peripheral joints occurs however, in some others the disease causes
      impaired spinal mobility and articular instability. This causes proximal girdle muscles and
      trunk muscles of the patients to be exposed to excessively stress and in conclusion
      deformities develop. Maximum force generated by a muscle or muscle group directly effects the
      physical ability of an individual, and manual muscle dynamometers are used to directly
      evaluate the muscle strength. In this manner the investigators aim to evaluate trunk and
      proximal girdle muscles' powers in male patients with ankylosing spondylitis and analyze the
      correlation between muscle powers, and functionality and disease activity.
