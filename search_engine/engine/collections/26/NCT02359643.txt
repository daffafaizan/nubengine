      each hospital after informed contents are obtained. The patients are initially treated with a
      single dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) during a 12-hour period.

      Principal clinical features of KD that occur in the acute stage within 5 days of the onset of
      fever will be recorded. After the informed content from the parents, PB samples will be
      obtained before IVIG treatment (pre-IVIG, KD1), within 3 days after complete initial IVIG
      treatment (post-IVIG, KD2) as the acute stage samples and then 1 month, 6 month and 12 month
      followed-up as subacute/convalescent stage samples. CAL was defined as the internal diameter
      being at least 3 mm of the coronary artery (4 mm if the subject was over the age of 5 years)
      or the internal diameter of a segment at least 1.5 times as large as that of an adjacent
      segment by echocardiogram.

      High dose aspirin will be given (> 30 mg/kg/day) until the fever subsided at group 1
      randomly. After fever subside (<38C, for 48 hours) low-dose aspirin (3-5 mg/kg/day) will be
      prescribed for all patients until all signs of inflammation resolved in both group 1 and 2.
