    
      This is a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-controlled,
      non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HS-10234 25 mg qd versus TDF 300
      mg qd. Patients with chronic HBV infection who are positive or negative for the hepatitis B e
      antigen (HBeAg) will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 25 mg HS-10234 or 300 mg
      TDF with matching placebo. Randomization will be done by a computer-generated allocation
      sequence stratified by plasma HBV DNA concentration (HBV DNA< 8 log10IU/mL；HBV DNA ≥8
      log10IU/mL) and previous treatment experience (treatment-naive and treatment-experienced).
      All patients will receive 144 weeks of antiviral therapy. After 96 weeks of double-blind
      treatment, all subjects will be eligible to receive open-label HS-10234 until 144 weeks.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with HBV DNA less than 20 IU/mL
      at week 48 in all patients who are randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study
      drug using a missing-equals-failed approach. Key pre-specified safety endpoints are bone and
      renal parameters at week 48. Other pre-specified endpoints include viral suppression,
      serologic response, normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and the emergence
      of resistance mutations at week 48, 96 and 144.
