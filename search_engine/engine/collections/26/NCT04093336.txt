    
      In Phase 1 study, the eligible patients with acute cerebral infarction 5-7 days after onset
      will be randomized to MSCs group or control group and receive intravenous MSCs 2 x 10^6/kg or
      placebo as a single dose, respectively. Each group will enroll 10 patients and patients will
      be followed for 2 years to observe the adverse events and evaluate the safety of MSCs for
      acute ischemic stroke patients.

      The safety and preliminary effectiveness of MSCs in the treatment of acute cerebral
      infarction will be summarized after all patients of Phase 1 study were followed for 3 months
      post infusion, and the report will be submit to the academic committee and the ethics
      committee to evaluate before approval to begin the Phase 2 study.

      In Phase 2 study, 100 patients with acute infarction within 12 hours after onset or 5-7 days
      after onset will be enrolled and randomized to MSCs group or control group. Patients will
      have baseline laboratory examinations and cerebral image (MRI or CTP). Enrolled patients will
      receive intravenous infusion of 2*10^6/kg MSCs or placebo for a single dose and follow for 24
      months to assess the adverse events, neurological functional recovery and quality of life.
