      therapies require weeks of treatment and cause significant toxicity. In Peru, the standard
      therapy is daily intravenous (IV) pentavalent antimony (20 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. It appears
      that Leishmania infections can be eliminated by T helper 1 immune responses. These findings
      argue that a vaccine that augments mucosal leishmaniasis patients' T helper 1 responses will
      eliminate the infection and disease. This study is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled, sequential dose-escalating trial to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of three injections of 5, 10, or 20 μg of Leish-111f protein + 25 μg of MPL-SE
      adjuvant given at 4 week intervals as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy with pentavalent
      antimony (20 mg/kg/day for 28 days) in patients with mucosal leishmaniasis.
