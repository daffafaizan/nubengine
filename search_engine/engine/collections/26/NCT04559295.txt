      disc, facet, epidural space, and sacroiliac joint pain create a clinically meaningful
      improvement in pain and function. Further analysis will determine if there be any variance in
      patient reported outcome due to the individual's pre-procedure cell count and analysis.

      Hypothesis 1: An injection of autologous BMC into discs, facets, sacroiliac joints, and
      epidural space will improve pain and function in patients with IDD

      Hypothesis 2: There will be a direct relationship between an individual's BMC composition and
      the patient's reported outcomes
