      while undergoing extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy treatment for renal calculi. Improved
      tolerability of treatment would result in longer duration of time on the lithotripsy machine
      and may lead to better stone fragmentation. Outcomes will be completion of treatment and
      scores on the short form McGill pain questionnaire.

      Patients will be randomised into three groups. The randomisation will not be blinded as this
      is not possible within the design of the study. The first group will be given stress balls to
      squeeze during treatment and will also receive standard care (the offer of oral analgesia).
      The second group will be given headphones to listen to music during treatment and will also
      receive standard care. The third group will receive standard care.

      Prior to commencing extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, patients will be given the
      shortened Health Anxiety Inventory score to complete. Following lithotripsy treatment,
      patients will be given the short form McGill pain questionnaire to complete.

      The initial pilot study will aim to recruit sixty patients and further recruitment will take
      place on the basis of the outcomes of the pilot study.
