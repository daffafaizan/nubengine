    
      A Phase I, single-center trial to assess the safety and tolerability of an intrathecal
      infusion (lumbar puncture) of autologous, ex vivo expanded bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells in a well-defined population of spinal cord injury patients.

      Safety will be evaluated by neurological and non-neurological tests performed after
      short-term (1 to 30 days) and long-term (2 to 12 months)follow-up evaluation periods after
      cell infusion.
