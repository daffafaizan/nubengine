    
      Patients undergoing laryngeal microsurgery will be randomized into either intubation group or
      THRIVE group.

      On arriving operating room, the patients will be preoxygenated by facemask or high flow nasal
      cannula with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes according to the allocated group. After inducing
      general anesthesia, patients in intubation group will be oxygenated by endotracheal tube,
      while patients in THRIVE group will be oxygenated by high flow nasal cannula with flow rate
      of 70L/min. During the surgery, the endotracheal tube can be removed and reintubated in
      intubation group patients to provide surgical field by a surgeon, respectively.

      The monitored pulse oximetry, oxygen reserve index, and transcutaneous partial pressure of
      carbon dioxide will be recorded during surgery.
