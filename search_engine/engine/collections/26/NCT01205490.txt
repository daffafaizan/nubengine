      spine positions, including rotation and manipulation in-vivo under clinically relevant
      circumstances using two advanced forms of MRI technology on the VA and posterior cerebral
      vessels. According to the knowledge of the investigators, a study utilizing MRI and
      functional blood oxygen level dependent (fBOLD) imaging to examine blood flow and perfusion,
      turbulence and evidence of micro-trauma within these vessels has yet to be conducted.
