      participants (below) identified with in-clinic hypertension and abnormal nocturnal dipping on
      24 hour ABPM will be asked to participate in a feasibility trial of losartan. Participants
      will be offered a consultation with Pediatric Nephrology prior to study enrollment.
      Participants that consent /assent will undergo repeat 24 hour ABPM to confirm abnormal
      circadian blood pressure prior to receiving losartan. At baseline, participants will undergo
      evaluation for biomarkers of kidney injury and hypertension. Participants will start on
      losartan at 25mg of losartan and randomized to titrate clinic BP <95th or 75th percentile
      based on NHLBI BP tables. Participants will be followed monthly x 6 months and receive
      standard of care labs. ABPM and blood/urine biomarkers of kidney injury, buccal swab for
      circadian genes, and hypertension will be repeated at 3 and 6 months. Participants will
      undergo monthly evaluation for adherence through pill counting and questionnaires. Safety of
      dosing will be monitored by internal review and external review (DSMB).

      Prospective Pediatric Cohort to Evaluate Hypertension and Kidney Injury. Patients with HbSS
      or SB0 thalassemia, ages â‰¥ 6 years and have signed informed consent will undergo clinic BP,
      annual ABPM and biomarkers to determine the incidence of HTN and potential role for
      biomarkers as monitors for the development of hypertension or kidney injury/disease. Urine
      will be collected annually and evaluated for current known biomarkers of kidney disease and
      stored for future analysis of relevant biomarkers. Uric acid will be processed from collected
      blood annually.
