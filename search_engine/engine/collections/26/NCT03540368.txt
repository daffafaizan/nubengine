      the form of tranexamic acid injection compared to placebo in patients with acute upper and
      lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Tranexamic acid were administered intravenously 1 gram
      loading dose, followed by 3 grams maintenance dose in infusion for 24 hours. Other routine
      and standardized drugs for gastrointestinal bleeding will still be given. Statistical
      analysis will use: Chi square test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov with alternative Fisher test for
      categorical dependent-variable; Independent T-Test with alternative Mann-Whitney test for
      two-group numerical dependent-variable; and one-way ANOVA with alternative Kruskal-Wallis for
      more than two-groups numerical dependent-variable.
