    
      The study aims to examine the effect of screening for sepsis using an electronic sepsis alert
      versus no alert in hospitalized patients admitted to wards using an active sepsis alert
      system compared with wards with no active (masked) sepsis alert system on hospital mortality
      by day 90.

      The wards will be randomized in a stepped-wedge cluster fashion.
