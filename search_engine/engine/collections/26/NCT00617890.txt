      robatumumab to be given intravenously. These participants will first receive robatumumab
      according to randomized treatment, and have surgery performed 10 to 14 days after initial
      dosing. Participants will be allowed to recover from surgery four to six weeks prior to
      additional robatumumab administration at their randomized dose level. robatumumab will then
      be administered on the same calendar day once every two weeks. Participants will continue to
      receive robatumumab until disease recurrence, or until completing a year of dosing at the
      same dose level assigned, whichever occurs first.

      Participants with unresectable osteosarcoma or Ewing Sarcoma will be assigned treatment to
      robatumumab IV administered once every two weeks and will continue to receive robatumumab
      until disease progression. Participants who achieve a CR or PR after tumor evaluations may
      undergo surgical resection. After surgery, participants are eligible to receive 10 mg/kg
      robatumumab until disease recurrence/progression or one year of total dosing, whichever
      occurs first.
