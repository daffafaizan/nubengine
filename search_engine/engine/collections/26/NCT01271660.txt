      collect the baseline clinical and laboratory data during the 4-week run-in period for each
      subject. After a run-in period, there will be the second step of patient selection to achieve
      a more homogenous study population. Then, patients will be randomly allocated into the
      treatment (pregabalin) and placebo (dummy) arms, by a web-based randomization program. After
      a treatment period (75 mg twice daily during the first 1 week as titration, 150 mg twice
      daily for 4 weeks as standard dose), the investigators will gather further study information
      of a standard dose period (150mg twice daily for 4 weeks) from the target population and the
      study subjects will enter the 1-week tapering period (75mg twice a day) to discontinuation.
      The primary outcome will be the difference in the frequency of muscle cramps between the
      run-in and treatment phases. The investigators also intend to assess the response rate,
      defined as the proportion (%) of patients showing â‰¥50% reduction in the number of muscle
      cramps, mean change in the average pain intensity, mean change in the score of the Short Form
      36 (SF-36, QualityMetric) health survey questionnaire, mean change in the frequency of muscle
      cramps during sleep, and mean change in the average cramp threshold frequency by the
      neurophysiologic study (nerve excitability test) and analyze the reasons for drop-out cases.
