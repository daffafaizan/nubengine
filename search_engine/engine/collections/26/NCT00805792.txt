      enhance recovery following stroke by improving attention, learning and memory thereby
      enhancing rehabilitation. The null hypothesis is that the probability of a favorable outcome
      among post-stroke donepezil users is equal to that observed among similar participants in an
      existing National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) resource, the Phase
      III clinical trial of Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke. The NINDS
      tPA stroke trial has been used as historical control data in pilot trials of reperfusion and
      neuroprotection.

      The MASTER trial will be a multicenter, single-arm NINDS Recominant tPA trial-controlled,
      modified 2-stage adaptive clinical trial set in 2 tertiary care hospitals in the United
      States. Participants will be men and women with acute (< 24 hours of onset of symptoms)
      ischemic stroke. A favorable outcome will be defined as National Institutes of Health Stroke
      Scale (NIHSS) values of 0 or 1 at 90 days post-stroke.
