      systematic review of behavioral assessment scales for DOC has indicated that, when compared
      to other scales, the CRS-R meets the highest psychometric standards for the evaluation of
      severely brain-injured patients and may be used to assess DOC with minor reservations.
      However, that report mentions few evidences or studies with small sample sizes for some
      aspects of its reliability and validity such as its internal consistency and its test-retest
      reliability.The report also states that the diagnostic validity of the CRS-R remains
      unproven. In this study, the investigators will therefore aim to provide further psychometric
      data as regards those variables in a large sample of patients with DOC
