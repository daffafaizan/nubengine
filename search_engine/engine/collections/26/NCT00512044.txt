      patients. The stapled hemorrhoidectomy according to Longo under general anesthesia (or
      spinal) is considered standard of care [1]. Cohort studies show that a pudendal bloc with
      local anesthesia is safe and efficient [2-4]. The majority of procedures are actually
      performed in private clinics or in an ambulatory setting underlining the importance of
      economic issues such as procedure time (anesthesia and operation time) and hospital stay.

      We hypothesize that stapled hemorrhoidectomy under local anaesthesia shortens anaesthesia
      time and hospital stay and reduces costs with no disadvantages regarding pain, satisfaction
      and complication rate.
