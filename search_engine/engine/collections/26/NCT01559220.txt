    
      Open label pilot study

        -  Expected direct benefit on the modulation of neuronal networks.

        -  Expected indirect benefit via potential enhancements of memory, executive functions,
           cognition behavioral control, and functional abilities.

      Up to 10 subjects will be implanted with bilateral DBS systems, participants are expected to
      be on study for about 23 months.

        -  Develop a multidisciplinary clinical research protocol to evaluate the efficacy of
           ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens, and internal capsule for the amelioration of
           disability caused by Alzheimer's Disease.

        -  Enroll up to 10 patients into an open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
           DBS for Alzheimer's Disease patients with mild to moderate disability.

        -  Determine an initial DBS titration and stimulation settings protocol for use in
           subsequent controlled trials.

        -  Evaluate the outcomes of this study based on clinical, laboratory, biomarker, imaging,
           cognitive, behavioral, and functional assessments.

        -  Determine what domains of cognitive, behavioral and functioning impairment show the
           greatest response to DBS.

        -  Examine the potential benefit of stimulation combined with behavioral and rehabilitation
           interventions in comparison to stimulation alone.

        -  Evaluate the influence of DBS on physiological and functional changes in cortical and
           subcortical networks.
