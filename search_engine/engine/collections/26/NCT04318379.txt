    
      GC002 is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and the immune responses of a lentiviral
      based HCV immunotherapy (HCVax™) in chronic HCV patients. Chronic HCV patients will be
      enrolled sequentially into low dose and high dose groups. Following the vaccination subjects
      who received at least one vaccination will be followed up for safety and immunological
      response through week 28. All vaccine recipients will take part in a long-term safety
      follow-up for 6 months following the completion of the vaccine series to assess delayed
      adverse events.

      Vaccination will first start at low dose. The investigators will enroll low dose group first.
      Two subjects will be staggering enrolled every 2 weeks. Following the assessment and review
      of prior vaccinations, if no vaccine definitely or probably-related severe adverse event
      (grade 3 or above) or SAE occurs the vaccination schedule for low dose and high dose will
      continue until complete enrollment.

      Each subject will receive HCVax™ vaccine at 0, 8, 16 weeks through subcutaneous route.
      Following vaccination subjects will have clinical, immunological and virologic assessments
      throughout the 28-week study.
