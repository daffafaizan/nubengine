      to two techniques for determining where to position the right and left lateral laparoscopic
      ports, and port symmetry will be assessed at the end of surgery. We also plan to study
      patients undergoing any type of gynaecological surgery to determine the incidence of sensory
      neuropathy involving the lower abdomen according to the route of surgery.
