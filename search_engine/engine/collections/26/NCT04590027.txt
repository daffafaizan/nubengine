      This study analyzed regional analgesia for inguinal procedures in toddlers comparing caudal
      block with local wound infiltration and assessed post-operative pain scores as well as
      process times.A number of documents were compiled to inform and record data: a standard
      anaesthesia protocol, a documentation sheet for intraoperative recording, an information
      leaflet for the parents and a documentation sheet for the post-operative course of 24 hours .

      Caudal anaesthesia was performed after induction of anaesthesia. In patients getting wound
      infiltration ropivacaine 0.375% 0.5 ml kg-1 was injected subcutaneously after closing of the
      fascia transversalis.

      Parents were informed about the study and invited to participate upon arriving on the
      outpatient ward if the patient fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: scheduled for
      elective inguinal procedure, age three to 72 months, no contraindication for either local or
      caudal analgesia, no comorbidities. If parents agreed to participate, written informed
      consent was obtained. Pain score and administration of analgesics, vomiting, interval until
      micturition and interval until mobilization as well as sleep quality during the first
      post-operative night were documented by the parents in the provided booklet.
