      patients who fail fluconazole treatment during the treatment of severe infection, and to
      determine if fluconazole failures are more frequently associated with fluconazole-resistant
      or fluconazole-susceptible strains of C. albicans (i.e. does in vitro resistance matter?).
      Perhaps the breakpoints are not correct and need to be changed, as has recently happened with
      vancomycin.

      A third objective is to calculate fluconazole PK/PD parameters such as AUIC, and compare the
      calculated AUIC values of patients who fail with fluconazole-susceptible vs
      fluconazole-resistant isolates. Specifically for fluconazole, the question here is whether
      dose matters, and can aggressive dosing offset higher MICs. Thus in all cases, we will also
      determine the AUIC of fluconazole in order to fully characterize the impact of dose chosen on
      the outcomes of treated patients who fail to respond to fluconazole. The clinical,
      microbiological, and pharmacoeconomic outcomes of patients who fail fluconazole therapy and
      are subsequently hospitalized with severe infections caused by C. albicans will be documented
      and described.
