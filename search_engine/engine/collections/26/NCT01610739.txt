      with no change in the actual procedure performed. Using the SPY Scope, we will measure blood
      flow prior to the carpal tunnel release, and again measure once carpal tunnel release has
      been performed, in order to compare the values. This may add roughly 15 minutes to the total
      procedure time, however, no steps in the actual operation will be altered or affected in any
      way.
