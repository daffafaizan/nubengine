      percentile in patients presenting with chest pain are indicative for future cardiovascular
      events, even when acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was ruled out. Most of these non-ACS-patients
      are discharged without specific/ preventive therapy (anti-platelet or anti-lipid), although
      "positive" troponin values (any value at any time during hospitalisation above the 99th
      percentile) seem to clearly indicate underlying myocardial ischemia. In summary, there is an
      unmet need and huge potential to reduce mortality and morbidity in Chest Pain Unit patients
      by specific therapy. The investigators propose that platelet inhibition by Aspirin or lipid
      lowering by Atorvastatin will prevent plaque rupture and superimposition of thrombosis to
      coronary atherosclerosis in this population. It is planned to conduct a controlled clinical
      trial: 3,000 troponin positive patients presenting at emergency room (ER)/ CPU with symptoms
      suggestive for ACS, but an ACS was ruled out, will be assigned randomly to Aspirin 100 mg
      and/ or Atorvastatin 20 mg versus placebo (2x2 factorial design).
