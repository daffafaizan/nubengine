    
      OLI-103 is a Phase 1 open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose study in up to 8 subjects that
      will be conducted at a single center in the US. Safety assessments will be performed
      throughout the clinic period and multiple PK samples will be collected. Subjects will be
      confined to the clinical research center for at least 8 days.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of
      [14C]-olinciguat and to characterize and determine, where possible, the metabolites present
      in plasma, urine, and feces after a single oral dose. The study will help identify and
      characterize olinciguat metabolites, evaluate the likelihood of effects of liver or kidney
      impairment on the disposition of olinciguat, and assess the likelihood of drug-drug
      interactions with olinciguat.
