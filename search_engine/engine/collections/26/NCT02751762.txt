      (NDA) holders of extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids to conduct one or more studies
      to provide quantitative estimates of the serious risks of misuse, abuse, and addiction
      associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for management of chronic pain, among
      patients prescribed opioid products. Although abuse and misuse of prescription opioids have
      increased over the past decade, there is debate about the magnitude of misuse, abuse, and
      addiction among patients who are treated with opioids for chronic pain. Further, although
      there appears to be comorbidity of opioid use disorders with other substance use and
      psychiatric disorders, there is insufficient data to estimate how the risk of these outcomes
      varies by the presence of risk factors among patients treated with opioids long-term. This
      study seeks to fill that gap. The primary objective is to quantify the serious risks of
      misuse, abuse, and addiction associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for
      management of chronic pain among patients prescribed opioid products. Patients will be
      recruited from seven Health Care System Research Network (HCSRN) sites; one U.S. Department
      of Veterans Affairs (VA) site; and clinics participating in two Primary Care Practice-Based
      Research Network sites. The data sources for the proposed study will be: 1) patient reported
      outcomes through in-person interviews (or phone if unavailable to participate in-person), 2)
      web-based assessments (or phone if unable to complete via web), and 3) electronic medical
      record and claims data. The study design includes two components: 1) a prospective
      longitudinal study of patients who have recently initiated long-term opioid therapy or
      initiated ER/LA opioid therapy, and 2) a cross-sectional study of patients who have been
      treated with opioids (including at least one ER/LA opioid) for at least one year.
