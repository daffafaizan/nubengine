      and first aid training. The Online IMM course was designed to teach participants in six
      modules: Principles of care; CPR for infants; CPR for children; How to relieve infant
      choking; How to relieve child choking; and Preventing injuries. Participants were also able
      to view text articles on first aid topics, such as Wound care or Caring for burns. Although
      the users of the Online IMM training program did not have direct contact with a manikin
      during their training, there were opportunities to practice CPR skills through the use of
      interactive animations. These animations demonstrated and then encouraged users to practice
      key functions similar to actual CPR skill delivery: including the location, depth and rate of
      compressions, opening the airway and giving breaths. Participants were encouraged to view the
      entire program; however, they could navigate and review all program content as much or as
      little as desired.
