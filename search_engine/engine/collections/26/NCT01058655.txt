    
      Primary Objective

      Phase I

        -  To determine the safety, tolerability, and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus
           and tivozanib administered in combination to patients with advanced gastrointestinal
           tumors.

      Phase II

        -  At the MTD, to assess progression-free survival associated with everolimus and tivozanib
           in patients with refractory, metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

      Phase II

        -  To assess tumor response rate.

        -  To assess overall survival.
