      cervical cancers, an effective screening modality for HPV-OPSCC does not exist. A central
      problem in the early diagnosis of HPV-OPSCC is the relative inaccessibility of the tonsillar
      crypts, where oncogenic infections are thought to originate. Unlike the relatively smooth
      surface of the cervix which permits mechanical sampling with Pap tests and which can be
      evaluated visually for evidence of dysplasia, much of the tonsillar epithelium is found below
      the surface in a complex network. As a consequence, any screening modality cannot depend upon
      direct access to malignant lesions. What is needed is a minimally invasive, diffusible or
      circulating marker of HPV-OPSCC, and a means to collect and detect it.
