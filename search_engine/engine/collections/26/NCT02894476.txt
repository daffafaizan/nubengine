      questionnaire in outpatient consultation (EQS-C). Data collected during the study included
      patient sociodemographic, clinical and health status characteristics, as well as physician
      characteristics. Self-perceived quality of life was assessed using the generic SF-12 and a
      specific questionnaire in illness disease, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction
      Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF).
