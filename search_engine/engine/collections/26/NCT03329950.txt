    
      This study will determine the MTD of CDX-1140 while also evaluating the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of CDX-1140 alone (Part 1) or in combination with CDX-301 (Part 2),
      pembrolizumab (Part 3), or chemotherapy (Part 4) in patients with cancer.

      Eligible patients that enroll to the dose-escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of several dose levels of CDX-1140. The dose-escalation part of the study will test the
      safety profile of CDX-1140, alone or in combination with CDX-301, pembrolizumab or
      chemotherapy and determine which dose(s) of CDX-1140 will be studied in the expansion
      portions of the study.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
