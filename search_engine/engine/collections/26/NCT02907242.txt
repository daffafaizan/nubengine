    
      This is a multicenter, open-label randomized trial with groups in parallel. Singleton
      pregnancies are recruited after routine second trimester scan (19+0 to 22+6 weeks of
      gestation) and randomly allocated at that moment to revealed or concealed strategy. A routine
      scan will be booked at 36-37 weeks. For a reduction of the stillbirth rate of 3‰ (from 5‰ to
      2‰), assuming a type I error of 5% and aiming for a power of 80% a total of 11,582 subjects
      (5791 per arm) were projected. The participating centers sum up 12,000 deliveries a year. It
      is not possible to blind participants, obstetricians, or outcome assessors to the study
      group.

      General hypothesis: A proportion of fetuses with "normal" growth as per current standards
      have placental insufficiency and restriction of their growth potential. These fetuses exhibit
      biophysical changes expressed by abnormal cerebroplacental ratio. A combination of this
      marker with fetal biometry for the detection of fetuses affected by fetal growth restriction
      could identify a group of babies on which labor induction once term is reached may prevent
      the occurrence of adverse outcomes.

      Specific hypothesis

        -  The cerebroplacental ratio has predictive value in late pregnancy for placental
           insufficiency.

        -  The cerebroplacental ratio could improve the effectiveness of late pregnancy screening
           for the prediction placental insufficiency-related complications.
