      caused by impaired glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE) activity. The ageing GSD IIIa cohort
      shows that muscle involvement -despite dietary management- is a common disabling phenotype in
      adulthood. Currently, no specific therapy has been established for muscle problems in adult
      GSD IIIa patients.

      However, it could be hypothesized that nutritional ketosis (NK) will be highly beneficial to
      patients. Amongst others, ketone bodies could take on the role of primary energy source in
      exercising muscle. Recently, acute NK in exercise was studied in humans. NK was found to
      enhance muscle mitochondrial function in athletes.

      The investigators will study if acute NK in adult GSD IIIa patients can boost muscle
      mitochondrial function in vivo.
