      with the previous review and with clubfoot treatment in general. These phases are as follows:
      1) study treatment (Botox injection versus placebo); 2) post-treatment manipulation and
      casting; 3) bracing and full-time maintenance; 4) intent-to-treat intervention for management
      of first-time non-responders (NR1) and first-time recurrences (Rec1) post-study treatment;
      and 5) rescue intervention for management of second-time non-responders (NR2) and second-time
      recurrences (Rec2) post intent-to-treat intervention.

      We will utilize a double-blind randomized control trial to assess the efficacy of Botox in
      the treatment of idiopathic clubfoot. Patients, parents, both participating surgeons, and
      members of their clinical and research teams (physiotherapist, occupational therapist,
      orthopaedic technologist, orthotist, research assistant) will be blinded to the study group
      (Botox group versus control group) each subject belongs in. The pharmacist preparing the
      syringes for injection will not be blinded.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Botox (Treatment group) or placebo
      injection (Control group). Subjects in the treatment group will receive Botox injections
      dosed at 10 IU/kg prepared by diluting 100 IU of Botox in 1cc of unpreserved saline. If the
      child has bilateral clubfoot, the contents will be divided equally for injection into each
      gastrocnemius. Placebo injections for the control group will contain unpreserved saline at
      0.1cc/kg (such that a 4.5 kg subject will receive 0.45cc).
