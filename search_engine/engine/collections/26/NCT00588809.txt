    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate (includes complete response-CR, complete response with
      incomplete count recovery CRi, partial response-PR, and minor response-MR) to AZD6244
      (selumetinib).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of AZD6244 in AML samples on p-ERK and evaluate the potential
      utility of p-ERK inhibition as a surrogate marker of biologic activity.

      II. To correlate the effects of AZD6244 with the presence (or absence) of mutated RAS or
      FLT-3 at baseline.

      III. To assess the safety profile of AZD6244 in patients with AML.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1 -28. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 52 weeks.
