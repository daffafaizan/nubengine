      access to care, many returning Veterans still report substantial barriers to seeking
      traditional mental health care. There is a large body of evidence demonstrating that aerobic
      exercise effectively improves many outcomes relevant to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      including; anxiety, depression, insomnia, cognition, and cardiovascular disease. In addition,
      there is a rapidly growing evidence base showing that aerobic exercise produces an increase
      in the growth of new neurons (e.g., neurogenesis) and increases the volume of the hippocampus
      which underscores the potential value of exercise for producing broad benefits to
      psychological health. Recognizing the promise that exercise might hold for attracting more
      Veterans into care and improving overall health in Veterans with PTSD, a team of
      investigators at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center (SFVAMC) with
      funding from the Department of Defense developed a treatment protocol and completed a pilot
      study of Integrative Exercise (Aerobic exercise and Breath Training 3 weekly sessions over 12
      weeks) versus a waitlist control condition. Promising results from this trial have led us to
      the next step which is to conduct a definitive efficacy study of Integrative Exercise versus
      an active health education control condition: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR). The
      control condition will be matched on contact hours with treatment personnel. The goal of this
      revised proposal is to test if Integrative Exercise improves overall quality of life, PTSD
      symptoms, sleep quality, and measures of cardiovascular health in combat Veterans with
      chronic PTSD relative to the IMR condition. Another goal is to test if improvements in
      quality of life are predicted by improvements in cardiovascular fitness as measured by
      exercise capacity on treadmill testing. Finally, the proposal will test if Integrative
      Exercise versus IMR will produce greater improvements in additional health outcomes,
      including mood, subjective sleep quality, and PTSD symptoms.
