      the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) in ambulatory and
      non-ambulatory adult patients with SMA. Subjects with SMA II/III that are 18 years to 70
      years of age who are planning to initiate treatment with SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) as part of
      their clinical care plan will be enrolled in this study. This study does not provide
      SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) or cover costs associated with standard clinical care.These patients
      will be treated by their respective physicians according to standard clinical practice. Study
      visits, some of which including standardized assessments of strength and function, will occur
      at baseline, day 15 after treatment initiation, day 30, day 60, and then 4-month intervals
      through month 30.
