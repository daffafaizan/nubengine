      the 52-week, open-label safety and tolerability Study 31-08-248 and continued to provide
      aripiprazole IM depot treatment.

      Participants received this treatment until aripiprazole IM Depot was commercially available
      in any dosage (including generic formulations) in the country where the study was being
      conducted or the commercial availability of aripiprazole IM Depot was terminated by the
      sponsor, or until the study completion date of 06 Dec 2018 was reached.

      Eligible participants entered this study at the end of treatment visit (Week 52) of Study
      31-08-248. Participants continued to receive aripiprazole IM depot every month (study months
      were every 4 weeks, which were defined as 28 [-2/+10] days) as a continuation of their
      previous monthly dose in Study 31-08-248.
