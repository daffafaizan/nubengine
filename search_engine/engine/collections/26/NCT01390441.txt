    
      In Part A of the base study, participants are randomized to either MK-8808 or MabThera®. In
      Part B of the base study, participants are randomized to either MK-8808, MabThera®, or
      Rituxan®. Participants enrolled in Part A are not eligible to participate in Part B. In both
      Parts A and B, participants will receive one or two courses of therapy, with each course
      including two infusions of the study drugs.

      The extension portion of the study (Part C) will sequentially follow the base study beginning
      at Week 52 and continue for an additional 54 weeks. All participants who meet eligibility
      criteria and continue into the study extension will be treated with open-label MK-8808.
      Participants randomized to MK-8808 in the base study will remain on the same therapy.
      Participants randomized to rituximab (MabThera® or Rituxan®) in the base study will be
      switched to MK-8808 for the extension study.
