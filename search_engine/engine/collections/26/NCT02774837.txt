      participation in any screening activities. Prospective subjects should be screened no more
      than 28 days prior to administration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1. Screening
      evaluations will be used to determine eligibility of each candidate for study enrollment.
      Subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria as
      determined during screening will be eligible for the study. Candidates who fail to meet
      eligibility criteria by screening evaluations may be re-screened one time. Eligible patients
      at the end of screening will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to experimental (combination) arm
      versus control (mono therapy) arm.

      Randomisation will be performed by computer generated random codes (performed by Singapore
      Clinical Research Institute) with a masked allocation sequence. There will be no blinding of
      therapy and the study will be conducted as an open label study since the outcomes are
      objectively measurable.

      After randomisation patients will be monitored 12 weekly for the first 24 weeks, then every
      24 weekly until the last visit at 96 weeks.

      At each visit, patients will have a clinical evaluation and have a panel of laboratory tests:

        -  Hematology: Full blood count, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio

        -  Chemistry: Sodium, potassium, creatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, -aspartate
           transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, creatine
           phosphokinase, alphafetoprotein,

        -  Urinalysis: Urine dipstick (Appearance, color, leucocytes, nitrite, urobilinogen,
           protein, PH, specific gravity, ketone, bilirubin and glucose).

        -  Viral serology: HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBsAg, qHBsAg and anti-HBs
