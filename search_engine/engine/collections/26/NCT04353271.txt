      shown to be effective in inhibiting Covid-19 infection in vitro. The evidence from clinical
      research trials is sparse and has many flaws. Much of the Chinese experience with Chloroquine
      comes from a letter to the editor and a news briefing/conference held on February 15, 2020.
      The letter describes experience with more than 100 patients treated with CQ in multicenter
      clinical trials but the letter provides no quantitative data to back their claims. At least
      one non-randomized clinical trial has been performed in Europe. Covid-19 infected patients
      received 10 days of HCQ daily and underwent daily testing of viral loads from nasopharyngeal
      swabs. The subjects receiving HCQ were much more likely (P<0.02) to clear their viral load
      than subjects who did not receive HCQ. The study had many flaws, which make the conclusions
      less valuable than rigorously designed randomized clinical trial. This study is designed as a
      randomized, blinded trial to either confirm or refute the efficacy of HCQ in early treatment
      of Covid19 infection to ameliorate disease severity, and reduce viral load.
