    
      All subjects will be assigned to aerobic exercise that will use a blend of both unsupervised
      moderate and supervised high intensity exercise. The exercise will consist of walking /
      jogging modalities, dependent on the individual's level of bradykinesia and will be paced by
      the individual's level of perceived exertion. The exercise protocol will be designed to
      target an accumulation of at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week.

      Exercise training will be performed 5x/week for a total of 16 weeks. The training will
      consist of 3 supervised high intensity sessions and 2 at home moderate intensity exercise
      sessions. The high intensity sessions will be performed on a treadmill at an intensity rating
      of ~ 15 and 17 on a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale of 6 to 20. The moderate
      intensity exercise will target an RPE of ~10 - 12 and participants will be asked to complete
      this on their own.
