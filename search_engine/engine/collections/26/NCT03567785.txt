    
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an irreversible, chronic and relentless lung disorder
      of unknown aetiology characterised by a progressive destruction of lung parenchyma leading
      ultimately to respiratory insufficiency and death within 2-5 years after diagnosis. Treatment
      with the anti-fibrotic drug Pirfenidone slows down the disease progression and reduces the
      risk of acute exacerbations. Evidence also showed that treatment with Pirfenidone should be
      continued lifelong to maximise outcomes even in patients who experience disease progression
      during therapy. Unfortunately, Pirfenidone represents a complex pharmacological regimen, in
      which patients have to take 3 tablets 3 times a day at mealtime with a titration period in
      the first 3 weeks (i.e. 3 times 1 tablet of 267 mg during the first week, 3 times 2 tablets
      during the second week, and 3 times 3 tablets a week from week 3 onwards). As for all
      chronically ill patients, adherence to a complex regimen might be challenging and
      nonadherence might reduce the full potential of Pirfenidone in patients with IPF. Adherence
      is defined as "the extent to which a person' s behaviour - taking medication, following a
      diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a
      health care provider"(WHO, 2003) and encompasses three phases namely, initiation,
      implementation and persistence.

      Due to extremely sparse availability of evidence on treatment adherence in the IPF
      population, it needs to be fully ascertained if, why, when and how many patients discontinue
      treatment or struggle to correctly take Pirfenidone as prescribed. Furthermore, the
      investigators also don't know what the impact is of non-adherence to Pirfenidone on clinical
      outcomes in patients with IPF and whether good adherence is associated with a better health
      related quality of life.
