      "prehabilitation" program prior to their surgery or to usual care. The prehabilitation
      program is self-directed program designed to improve health and quality of life prior to
      surgery. The program is currently offered to general surgery patients; this study will
      examine the feasibility and acceptability of such a program in a different patient
      population.
