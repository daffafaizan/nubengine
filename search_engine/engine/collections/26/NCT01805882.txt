      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected, and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. While treatment with ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated
      interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently recommended
      therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to PEG+RBV alone in
      HCV monoinfected patients, treatment is still associated with a high incidence of adverse
      events (AEs), discontinuations, and poor cure rates in several populations. Recent studies
      have demonstrated that the use of a combination of antivirals, which target HCV without
      interferon (IFN), can cure HCV without additional toxicities. However, the determinants of
      response to IFN-free regimens have not been established.

      This is an open label study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment
      with GS-7977 with GS-5885, alone or in combination with GS-9669 and/or GS-9451 (selective HCV
      nucleotide NS5B, NS5A, nonnucleotide NS5B and NS3 inhibitors, respectively) in HCV infected
      treatment naive and treatment experienced patients with early and advanced liver disease. The
      findings from this study will aid in our understanding of determinants of response to an
      IFN-free regimen in HCV infected patients for both patients with early and advanced liver
      disease as well as in patients who are treatment naive and those who have been treated before
      for HCV.
