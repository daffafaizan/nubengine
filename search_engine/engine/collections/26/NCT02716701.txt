      myelin and axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Current therapy for MS primarily
      consists of immunomodulatory drugs aimed at preventing future CNS injury; no treatments are
      currently available to repair existing damage, and symptomatic treatments to improve
      neurological function are quite limited. Rehabilitation approaches, such as exercise, have
      long been a staple of MS therapy. Exercise therapy in MS patients has proven benefits on
      mobility, mood, motor function and quality of life. While the beneficial effects of exercise
      on cardiovascular and musculoskeletal function are well known, there has recently been
      increased focus on the positive effects of exercise on brain structure and function. The
      overall aim of this proposal is to determine whether exercise can promote beneficial changes
      in brain function in MS patients. The investigator's central hypothesis is that
      cardiovascular exercise alters both brain structure and brain function in MS patients, and
      that these changes can be identified and monitored via imaging techniques that evaluate
      regional brain volumes and functional connectivity. When brain activity measured at one area
      fluctuates in a coherent manner with that recorded in a different area, those brain regions
      are considered to be functionally connected. Using resting-state magnetoencephalography
      (MEG), the investigator's laboratory has demonstrated that these patterns of correlated brain
      activity are abnormal in MS patients.
