        -  Determine whether a change in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation is
           detected in tumors of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated
           with erlotinib.

        -  Determine whether a change in other parameters of signal transduction that are
           downstream of EGFR (ERK and AKT) is detected in tumors of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response duration and time to progression in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Correlate EGFR phosphorylation level with clinical findings and time to progression in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate the pharmacokinetics of this drug with a change in EGFR phosphorylation in
           tumor biopsies of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed within 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-10
      months.
