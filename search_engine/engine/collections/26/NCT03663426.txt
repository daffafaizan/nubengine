        1. High dose corticoids pre-operative: 125 mg Methylprednisolone. (Medrol) pre incision and
           24h postoperative

        2. OFA using a multimodal approach including alpha2agonists, lidocaine and low dose
           ketamine (max 1mg/kg).

        3. Avoid opioids post-operative by using multimodal non-opioid analgesics after OFA. Avoid
           epidural to allow rapid mobilization.

      all patients get Tranexamic acid 1 g (2 amp Exacyl 500mg) before and 1 g after surgery. It
      act as antifibrinolytic to reduce postoperative bleeding. (reversibly binding to lysine
      receptor sites on plasminogen) Try to give Continuous deep neuromuscular block (NMB) with a
      post titanic count (PTC) < 3 by continuous infusion and monitoring of NMB.

      Intravenous Fluid restrictions to 1 ml/kg/h as long as pulse pressure (or plethysmograph)
      variation < 20% to reduce wound edema.

      The pericapsular injections of local anesthetic, provided the patient had no
      contraindications such as poor renal function or allergies. 100 ml Ropivacaine 0,2% (max dose
      3 mg/kg) + additives (Adrenaline 2,5 cc) (Ropivacaine: max 3 mg/kg)
