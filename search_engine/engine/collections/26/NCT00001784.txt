      basal ganglia. There is no adequate treatment for dystonia. Recent studies using
      intramuscular and intravenous lidocaine have shown improvement in dystonic movements. It has
      been proposed that patients with dystonia have reduced presynaptic inhibition of alpha
      motoneurons leading to overactivation in response to movement. This may also reflect a
      hyperexcitability at the cortical level, which can be reduced by altering peripheral input.

      Mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic similar to lidocaine, but available orally, may benefit
      patients with dystonia, as has been shown in several recent open-label studies. This trial
      offers the possibility of treating dystonia as well as further elucidating the level of
      dysfunction in the nervous system in dystonic patients. We propose a double-blind cross over
      study comparing mexiletine to placebo in the treatment of patients with idiopathic dystonia.
      The patients will be evaluated by clinical rating scales as well as neurophysiological
      studies. In order to study the physiologic effect and attempt to localize the neuroanatomic
      sight of action of mexiletine, studies of peripheral reflexes, reciprocal inhibition and
      cortical excitation will be performed. These studies will include blink reflex recovery
      curves, tonic vibration reflex, H-reflex and transcranial magnetic stimulation.
