    
      This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase 3b multicenter extension trial, designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of UGN-101 administered to the UUT in patients who were treated in
      Trial TC-UT-03, found to be a CR at the PDE 1 Visit, and are subsequently found to have a
      documented recurrence of LG UTUC at FU.

      Upon signing of informed consent, the patients will undergo their routine ureteroscopy to
      assess durability. A biopsy will be performed at Visit 0, if appropriate, to confirm evidence
      of tumor. If a high grade (HG) UTUC is confirmed by biopsy and/or cytology, the patient will
      be excluded from the retreatment trial. Eligible patients with confirmed LG non-invasive UTUC
      will be treated with 3 to 6 once-weekly instillations of UGN-101 in a retrograde fashion, per
      investigator's discretion.

      Five weeks (± 1 week) following the last Investigational product (IP) treatment, the patient
      will be assessed for efficacy and safety at the PDE 2 Visit. At this visit, the patient will
      undergo ureteroscopy and any remaining lesions will be biopsied, and UUT urine wash will be
      collected for cytology.

      Patients demonstrating CR at the PDE 2 Visit will undergo FU visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      (± 2 weeks) following the PDE 2 Visit.

      The trial will be approximately 15 months, per patient: a 3- to 6-week treatment period,
      followed by 4 to 6 weeks post-treatment leading up to the PDE 2 Visit, and a 12-month FU post
      PDE 2 Visit. This trial will follow the Steering Committee, and a Data Monitoring Committee
      (DMC) has been assigned as established for the primary trial TC-UT-03.
