    
      Ceftriaxone sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection (2:1)plays a therapeutic role by the
      former inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis，the latter making irreversible competitive
      inhibition of β-lactamase.The antimicrobial effect of Ceftriaxone can be enhanced by the two
      combined. The compound specifically aims to the mechanism of bacterial resistance, extending
      the life of Ceftriaxone in the treatment-resistant pathogen infections.
