      surrounding environment of the embryo. Impaired culture conditions are highly correlated with
      poor embryo development. Oxygen is a powerful regulator of embryo function , as it is
      responsible for cell respiration, energy production and rapid cell growth . Increased levels
      of oxygen is associated with an increase in the levels of ROS , which leads to unfavorable
      culture conditions, as it might affect the stability of cell membrane, DNA, and protein
      function .

      In the female reproductive tract, oxygen concentration fluctuates between 2-8%, which is
      considered to be at its highest level in the fallopian tube, while the lowest level is in the
      uterus . Pre-implantation embryo crosses the uterotubal junction after the time of compaction
      on Day 3, where it is exposed to a shift in oxygen tension to 2%. This variation may have a
      role in the metabolic reactions of the embryo, and in its preparation for implantation
      process.

      Some studies suggested that culturing embryos with oxygen tension below 5% may have an
      embryological advantage mimicking nature.

      Embryological laboratories routinely use low Oxygen tension (5%). Our purpose is to
      investigate if ultra-low oxygen tension (2%) has an advantage over low oxygen tension (5%)
      for post thawed human embryo regarding clinical outcomes.
