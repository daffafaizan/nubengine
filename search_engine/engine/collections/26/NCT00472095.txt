      disease, neuropathy, and blindness. Controlling glucose better as measured by hemoglobin A1c
      (A1c) reduces risk for these complications. Information itself is often not enough to change
      behaviors that increase risk for these complications. Latinos in America are particularly at
      risk for diabetes (DM) and its complications. A fotonovela is a booklet telling a story using
      photos with superimposed speech bubbles much like an American style comic book. These are
      commonly read by Latinos. A fotonovela that tells a story about diabetes complications in a
      culturally appropriate context that emphasized impact on family might help motivate Hispanic
      patients to control their sugar better. We propose a single-blinded, randomized, controlled
      trial of a DM themed fotonovela against a non-DM themed fotonovela to assess its effect on
      glycemia as measured by A1c. After a primary care provider has seen a Latino type 2 diabetic
      patient, the investigator will consent them then give them an envelope with the DM themed
      fotonovela or another that is indistinguishable in the sealed envelope. The primary outcome
      is hemoglobin A1c one month or more after randomization. Secondary outcomes will A1c in the
      1-5 month and 6-12 month time period looking for durability of effect. A sample size of 260
      allows for a 30% fallout and gives an 80% power to detect a 0.5% change in A1c with a 1.2%
      standard deviation on that change with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05.
