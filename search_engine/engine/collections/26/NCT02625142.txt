      improve safety. To engage families in care, the recommended practice is to conduct rounds at
      the child's bedside with the family present (family-centered rounds). Family-centered rounds
      strive to engage families in (1) a relationship with care providers, (2) exchange of
      information for decision making, and (3) deliberation about decisions. Bedside rounds
      represent a consistent venue to engage families in the care of hospitalized children, yet no
      studies have systematically identified and examined the barriers and facilitators of family
      engagement during rounds as a means to improve safety.
