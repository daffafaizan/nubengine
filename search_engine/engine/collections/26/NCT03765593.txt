      activity and risk stratification of pSS subsets. The investigator's group aim to determine if
      the proposed biomarkers and their gene expression in saliva, peripheral blood and minor
      salivary gland samples in patients with pSS are increased to know the degree of their
      usefulness in daily clinical practice, to indicate which patients have a highest risk of
      developing a hematological malignancy and to know if these biomarkers are useful to recognize
      patients who have greater activity of the disease to be able to use it in the follow-up of
      the disease and as a future responder of the new biological therapies against B cells, INF
      and monocytes.

      Gene expression is a highly regulated mechanism that controls the function and adaptability
      of all living cells. The field of gene expression analysis has undergone important advances
      in biomedical research. Today, quantification techniques of mRNA expression have led to
      improvements in the identification of the gene and the sub-classification of the disease, for
      example, the expression of specific genes (mRNA) can be quantified by reverse transcription
      and PCR in quantitative real time. This is the most sensitive technique available to detect
      and quantify mRNA, where extremely small sample sizes can be used in mRNA quantification.
      Molecular changes precede histological changes and clinicians in the diagnosis of a
      pathology. For this reason, studying gene expression at the mRNA level allows us to
      anticipate irreversible changes that take place due to the progress of the pathology in
      progress.
