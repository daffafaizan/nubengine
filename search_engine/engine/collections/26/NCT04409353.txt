      lower back pain. This study investigates the effect of at-home virtual reality (VR) pain
      reduction therapy on a set of outcome measures. The primary outcome is Patient-Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference version 8. This study will
      enroll 360 participants into one of three VR therapy groups. Data collection will occur at
      home via personal computer or smartphone (iphone/android), with baseline data collected one
      week before the intervention is mailed to the patient. The patient will have the VR headset
      for 90 days. A post-study survey will be sent to patients 30 days after the end of the study.
