      negatively influencing graft and patient survival. CsA and Tacrolimus are the basis of modern
      immunosuppression. Tacrolimus is superior to CsA in terms of acute rejection and graft
      function. However, increases 2 times the risk of NODAT as compared to CsA. Objectives: a) To
      compare the incidence of NODAT and glucose intolerance with 3 different regimes: Tacrolimus
      with rapid steroid withdrawal; Tacrolimus with steroids minimization; and CsA with steroid
      minimization; b) To compare acute rejection rate, renal function and graft and patient
      survival between different regimes; and c) to investigate the influence of different regimes
      on subclinical atheromatosis. A total of 210 patients will be randomized. The primary
      efficacy variable will be NODAT or glucose intolerance at 1 year; secondary efficacy
      variables will be acute rejection, renal function, and changes of carotid intima-media
      thickness over time.
