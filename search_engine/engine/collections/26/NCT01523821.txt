      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of AAT in patients with steroid non-responsive acute
      GVHD.

      II. Characterize pharmacodynamic effects of AAT on pro-inflammatory cytokines, heparan
      sulfate, and the spectrum of peripheral blood T cells.

      III. Determine clinical responses of GVHD to AAT in patients with steroid non-responsive
      acute GVHD.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I/II dose-escalation study of AAT.

      Patients will receive AAT intravenously (IV) on study days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Patients who
      experience no toxicity and in whom GVHD is stable or improved after the day 7 dose can
      continue therapy with AAT on days 9, 11, 13 and 15 for a total of 8 doses.
