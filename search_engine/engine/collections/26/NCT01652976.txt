      of 5-FU based combination therapies over the historical standard gemcitabine represents an
      opportunity to develop novel combinations of synergistic and effective cytotoxic and biologic
      targeted therapies. Src excess activity has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer and is
      implicated in the invasive and metastatic phenotype clearly represented by this disease.
      Inhibition of Src activity is associated with numerous biologic modifications capable of
      positively modifying this phenotype and appears to have synergy with restoring inherent
      chemosensitivity. The addition of dasatinib to FOLFOX (FOLFOX-D) represents a novel
      therapeutic regimen in pancreatic cancer with safety and pharmacokinetic data already having
      been established in colorectal cancer. This protocol will test the safety and activity of
      this combination in pancreatic cancer where current clinical outcomes remain far from
      optimal.
