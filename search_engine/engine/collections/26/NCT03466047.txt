    
      Ten healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65 years will be recruited. Each subject will be studied
      on six occasions one week apart. On each visit, a baseline serum sample will be drawn from
      each subject. In a randomized way all subjects will receive the following meals in their
      successive weekly visits: Option 1 High protein mixed meal in capsules that break down in the
      stomach, Option 2 High protein mixed meal in capsules that break down in the distal small
      bowel, Option 3 High fat mixed meal in capsules that break down in the stomach, Option 4 High
      fat mixed meal in capsules that break down in the distal small bowel, Option 5 High CHD mixed
      meal in capsules that break down in the stomach, Option 6 High CHD mixed meal in capsules
      that break down in the distal small bowel. On the same day, all subjects will be offered
      standard ad libitum meal to measure their food consumption. After 3 hours (i.e. at 12:00)
      another blood sample will be drawn. All subjects will be asked to rate their appetite on a
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Upon VAS completion the subjects will be allowed to go home.
