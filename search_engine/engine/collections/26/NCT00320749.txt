      pancreatic cancer. However, better treatments offering improved outcomes are needed for
      people with this disease. The combination of docetaxel and capecitabine has shown significant
      and broad clinical activity in a variety of tumors. Laboratory research on the combination of
      capecitabine, docetaxel, and gemcitabine indicates synergistic action against tumor cells.
      The current study will test this combination in patients. The drug administration schedule in
      this study is aimed at maximizing the potential of activation of capecitabine by both
      docetaxel and gemcitabine.

      Treatment: Study participants will be given docetaxel, gemcitabine, and capecitabine. All
      study drugs will be administered through intravenous infusions in three week cycles.
      Docetaxel will be given on days 1 and 8, gemcitabine on days 8 and 15, and capecitabine on
      days 8 through 21. This schedule will be followed by 1 week of rest without administration of
      study drugs. Since the primary goal of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose
      of the study drugs in combination, patients who enroll in the beginning of the study will
      receive lower amounts of the study drugs compared to patients who enroll later in the study.
      Several tests and exams will be given throughout the study to closely monitor patients.
