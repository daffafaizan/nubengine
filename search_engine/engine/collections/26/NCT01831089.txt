      PM01183 in combination with weekly paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab. Once a
      recommended dose is defined for the PM01183 and weekly paclitaxel combination, the
      feasibility of adding bevacizumab to this combination will be explored in a selected cohort
      of patients to characterize the safety profile and feasibility of this combination, to obtain
      preliminary information on antitumor activity, to obtain preliminary information on quality
      of life (QoL), to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this combination and to detect
      major drug-drug PK interactions and PK(pharmacokinetic)/PD(pharmacodynamic) correlation and
      to conduct an exploratory pharmacogenomic(PGx) analysis in patients with selected advanced
      solid tumors.
