      limited and surgery is often associated with incontinence and recurrence.

      The biological properties of stem cells derived from adult tissues make them candidates for
      the treatment of pathologies requiring tissue regeneration or in diseases where the healing
      process is altered.

      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of patients having participated within a
      preceding multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
      NTC00475410]. The present extension aims to collect safety and efficacy data for up to 12
      month from initial administration.

      Fistula closure is defined as absence of suppuration through the external orifice with
      complete re-epithelization of the external orifice and absence of collections >2cm directly
      related to the fistula tract treated, as measured by MRI.
