      subjects returned to the clinical unit every evening, followed by an institutionalization of
      1.5 days (from Day 11 evening to Day 13 morning (i.e. 14 h after the third administration of
      levodopa/carbidopa). Then, a follow-up visit at 5 to 9 days after collection of the last PK
      blood sample (i.e. Day 13). The maximum total duration of the clinical study, including the
      21-day screening period and the post-study follow-up, was expected to be about 39 to 43 days.
