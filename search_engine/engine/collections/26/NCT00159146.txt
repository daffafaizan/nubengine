      studies shown an accelerating effect. In this study we investigate the effect of 20 mg of
      pindolol retarded formulation in combination with Venlafaxine compared to placebo Pindolol
      and Venlafaxine for a duration of 19 days.

      Effect is measured by the Hamilton Depression rating Scale and the Preskorn Scale
      (self-rating).
