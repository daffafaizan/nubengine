      anesthesia because it provides effective analgesia and may decrease haemodynamic
      complication. The fear of nerve injury after regional anaesthesia in diabetic patients is a
      concern that has neither been confirmed nor refuted by current literature. As a matter of
      fact, diabetic patients with neuropathy may be considered at increased risk because of the
      possibility for double crush syndrome when a chronic axon lesion related to diabetes is
      associated with an unexpected distal nerve injury related to regional anaesthesia.
