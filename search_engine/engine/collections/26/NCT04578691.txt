      degenerative, traumatogenic, and neoplastic lesions. Accurate insertion of pedicle screw is a
      crucial step which directly affects the surgical outcomes. In order to place the screws
      safely and accurately, various conventional techniques have been used, focusing on marking
      anatomical locations, entry points and insertion angles. Since the early 1990, the methods
      using computer systems that allow real-time image processing have been explored in order to
      improve the accuracy of pedicle screw placement.

      The Medtronic StealthStation® S7® System is a hardware platform that enables real-time
      surgical navigation using radiological patient images. The application software reformats
      patient-specific CT or MR images acquired before surgery, or fluoroscopic images acquired
      during surgery, and displays them on-screen from a variety of perspectives. The "Anatase"
      Spine Surgery Navigation System is indicated for precisely positioning of surgical
      instruments and/or implants during general spinal surgery, such as pedicle screw placement.

      This study will be a two-arms, single center, evaluator blind, controlled, parallel,
      randomised study in patients with pedicle screw placement in spine surgery. This trial will
      include patients need to undergo pedicle screw placement surgery with indication of spinal
      tumor, traumatic injury or degenerative spine disease (Pedicle screws placed from 10th
      thoracic vertebra to first sacrum), who are ≥20 years and ≤80 years of age with Body Mass
      Index (BMI) < 40 kg/m2 and Spine T-Score ≥ -2.5.
