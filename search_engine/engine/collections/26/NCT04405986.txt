      neurotropism, which may result in more complex clinical scenarios. Can the SARS-CoV-2 enter
      the Central Nervous System (CNS) and infect neural cells ? And if yes, how the CNS damage
      contributes to pathophysiology of the COVID-19, to its signs, symptoms and progression as
      well as to its sequelae. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and
      MERS-CoV do not limit their presence to the respiratory tract and frequently invade the CNS.
      The intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-COV resulted in the rapid invasion of
      viral particles into the brain of mice, possibly through the olfactory bulb via
      trans-synaptic route. The brainstem, which hosts the respiratory neuronal circuit in the
      medulla, was severely infected with both types of viruses, which may contribute to
      degradation and failure of respiratory centres.
