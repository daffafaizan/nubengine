      combination with either a branched chain amino acid restricted diet or a control diet. Before
      and after immobilization, they will receive a stable isotope tracer infusion (5.5 h) combined
      with repeated blood and muscle sampling under insulin clamp conditions, in order to measure
      insulin sensitivity and muscle protein synthesis in the fasted and fed state.
