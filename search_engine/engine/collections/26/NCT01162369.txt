      delirium assessments can take up to 10 minutes to perform making them less likely to be
      incorporated into the routine physician assessment. Using brief (<2 minutes) and easy to use
      delirium assessments may ameliorate this quality of care issue. The Confusion Assessment
      Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) possesses these characteristics, but has only
      been validated in mechanically and non-mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients.
      As a result, it still requires validation in the non-ICU hospitalized patients. Recently, we
      also developed the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (B-CAM) which is a modification of the
      CAM-ICU. The benefit is that it takes even less time than the CAM-ICU. However, it also
      requires validation in hospitalized patients. As result, we propose the following and the
      following specific aims:

      Aim #1: To validate the B-CAM in non-ICU hospitalized patients. The B-CAM will be performed
      by a clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in 150 non-ICU hospitalized
      patients that are > 65 years old. This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrist's
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment
      as the reference standard.

      Aim #2: To validate the CAM-ICU in non-ICU hospitalized patients. The CAM-ICU will be
      performed by a clinical trials associate (CTA) and principal investigator in approximately
      150 non-ICU hospitalized patients that are > 65 years old. This instrument will be validated
      against a psychiatrist's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition
      Text Revision assessment as the reference standard.
