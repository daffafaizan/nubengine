      I. Establish activity of elotuzumab and lenalidomide in the maintenance setting post
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in myeloma patients.

      II. Progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival 2. II. Overall survival. III. Determine incidence of secondary
      primary malignancy. IV. Evaluate the best response rate (stringent complete response
      [sCR]/very good partial response [VGPR]/partial response [PR]) based on International Myeloma
      Working Group (IMWG) criteria.

      V. Evaluate time to progression. VI. Evaluate time to next therapy. VII. Evaluate the
      tolerability and toxicity. VIII. Perform MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Myeloma
      symptom evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive elotuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 21 of
      courses 1-2 and on day 1 of each subsequent course. Patients also receive lenalidomide orally
      (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
