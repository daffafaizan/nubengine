      standard care for the treatment of constipation in orthopedic patients receiving opioids for
      pain control during inpatient rehabilitation. Lubiprostone (AmitizaÂ®) is a locally acting
      chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid, and thus increases intestinal
      motility. It has been approved for chronic constipation, but not in the setting of
      opioid-induced constipation. Senna is a stimulant laxative that increases propulsive
      peristaltic activity of the colon through local effects on the mucosa.

      Subjects will be compared using from the Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC) which has
      previously been found to be a valid and reliable way to measure constipation symptoms and
      clinical course. (Frank, Kleinman et al. 1999) as well as with other measures of
      bowel-related symptoms and functional outcomes.
