    
      The primary objective is to identify in a population of patients bearing advanced, refractory
      colorectal cancers, those who draw no benefit from treatment with regorafenib. There is no
      specific hypothesis underlying sample size and the study is therefore to be seen as
      exploratory.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To analyze PFS and response rate (RR) in relationship with the same covariates as for OS

        -  To assess regorafenib efficacy (OS, PFS, RR) and safety profile in this study
           population.

        -  To assess the Disease control rate (DCR = Complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]
           + stable disease [SD])

        -  To compare the relative benefit (OS, PFS) of regorafenib according to history of
           treatment with bevacizumab.
