      ischemia-reperfusion of the arm or leg, may potentially confer a powerful systemic protection
      against prolonged ischemia in a distant organ. Numerous reports have confirmed it strongest
      endogenous neuroprotection against brain injury after stroke. Ren et al demonstrated that
      remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) performed in the hind limbs can not only
      significantly reduce the stroke volume within 3 hours in rat model, but also ameliorate the
      outcome of the behavioral test. A long-term repeated RIPC therapy can also help improving
      neurological functions. A combination of RIPC and tPA can help with neuroprotection which
      improves the neurological functions. Thus, it is meaningful to transform these basic
      experimental results to the clinical treatment. In the RECAST-1 trial, RIC has shown it
      safety and efficiency in AIS patients without tPA. However, there is no further explanation
      for the patients with IVT. Thus, in this study, we aim to demonstrate the efficiency and
      safety of RIPC in AIS patients performed rt-PA within 4.5 hours.
