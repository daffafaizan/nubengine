      lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or mantle cell lymphoma undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients will be randomized to receive either LAD 11.25
      mg 3 Month treatment or placebo and all patients will be vaccinated with KLH 6 months
      posttransplant. Patients will be evaluated to determine if the rate of immunologic recovery
      in the LAD group is enhanced compared with the placebo group.
