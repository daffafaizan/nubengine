      It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recently, Hypertension Canada has
      updated its guidelines and recommend we should consider a 120 mm Hg systolic blood pressure
      target in high-risk patients aged 50 years or older. This recommendation derives mainly from
      the SPRINT trial. In this trial, blood pressure was measured with an automated oscillometric
      blood pressure (AOBP) device, the Omron HEM-907 (Omron Healthcare). However, it is not known
      if measurements performed with this device in a clinical setting are equivalent to those made
      in a research setting. Therefore, this randomized-controlled trial was designed. It aims to
      compare the blood pressure measurements of 70 patients in a clinical and a research setting.
      Patients will be randomized to a clinical/research or a research/clinical sequence.
