      Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) is common in intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients, rates of 2.7%-10.6% are reported in the literature. This nosocomial infection is
      associated with weaning difficulties resulting in prolonged duration of mechanical
      ventilation (MV) and ICU stay. A case-control study performed in chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with VAT found antibiotic treatment to be significantly
      associated with reduced duration of MV. Another case control-study, performed in VAT patients
      without chronic respiratory failure, found no significant difference in duration of MV
      between patients who received adequate antibiotic treatment and those who received inadequate
      antibiotic treatment. In addition, antibiotic use is known to be associated with subsequent
      multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB), longer duration of MV, and mortality rates. Therefore, a
      randomized controlled study is necessary to determine the impact of antibiotic treatment on
      outcome in VAT patients.

      Patients and methods:

      390 patients will be included in this prospective randomized open multicenter study.
      Inclusion of 390 patients is required to demonstrate a significant reduction of MV duration
      of 5 days (α = 0.025, β = 0.10). An intermediate analysis will be performed. All patients
      intubated and ventilated > 48h who developed a first episode of VAT are eligible. Primary
      endpoint is the duration of MV. Secondary end points are ICU length of stay, mortality,
      ventilator-associated pneumonia, ICU-acquired infection, MRB, and yeast rates.
