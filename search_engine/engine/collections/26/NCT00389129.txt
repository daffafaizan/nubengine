      death, acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke and the number one killer in the
      Western World. Binding the COX enzyme platelet aggregation is inhibited by aspirin, and as
      prophylaxis against death, myocardial infarction and stroke aspirin is the most widely used
      drug worldwide. Low dose aspirin has been shown to improve outcome in patients with ischemic
      heart disease, but approximately 12% of these patients will suffer from a vascular event
      during a 2 year follow-up period despite aspirin therapy. It has been speculated that these
      patients might be "resistant" to the antiaggregatory effect of aspirin, and a diminished
      response to aspirin has been correlated with a less favourable outcome. However, at present
      no international consensus exists on how to measure "aspirin resistance".

      Comparisons: The platelet aggregation in patients with ischemic heart disease on chronic, low
      dose aspirin is compared to platelet aggregation i healthy volunteers evaluated with
      different tests. The traditional way of evaluating platelet function, Platelet Aggregometry
      a.m. Born, will be compared to 3 point-of-care tests (VerifyNow, PFA-100 and Multiplate Whole
      Blood Aggregometer) and to urin- and serum thromboxane metabolites as a measure of COX
      inhibition.
