    
      This study in patients with IPF will determine the validity, responsiveness, and reliability
      of two cough measures (the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), as well as Visual Analogue
      Scales (VASs) for cough severity and distress; one dyspnea measure (the Baseline and
      Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI); and two health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures
      (the obstructive lung disease-specific Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and
      the IPF-specific 'A Tool to Assess QOL in IPF' (ATAQ-IPF). Both the SGRQ and ATAQ include
      cough questions. Study participants will complete all questionnaires at baseline, 6, 12, and
      18 months at the time of their usual clinic visits. Physiologic data will be collected at the
      same time of these visits including pulmonary function testing, exercise oxygen saturation,
      and changes in medications and health status. Changes in cough, dyspnea and QOL scores will
      be correlated with concurrent changes in physiologic markers of IPF severity. If a study
      participant has an acute worsening of their IPF, or undergoes lung transplantation, study
      questionnaires may be given at these additional timepoints when possible.
