      the treatment of HER2 positive early breast cancer with tumor size ≥1cm or node
      metastasis.But in pT1n0m0 breast cancer patients, patients with HER2 positive tumor show
      worse prognosis than those with HER2 negative tumor.A short duration of trastuzumab
      administration contaminately with chemotherapy may have similar efficacy and lowerer toxiticy
      compared with standard one year therapy.Our study aims to study the efficacy and safety of 12
      weeks adjuvant docetaxel plus trastuzumab in patients with tumors ≤1cm, node-negative,
      HER2-positive breast cancer.
