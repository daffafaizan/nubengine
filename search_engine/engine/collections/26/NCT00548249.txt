      maintaining physiological iron levels during chronic hemodialysis, as measured by the primary
      endpoint of the percent of patients whose Hemoglobin (Hgb) decreased by at least 1.0 gram/
      deciliter (g/dL) from baseline. The efficacy and safety findings are to be used to determine
      the optimal concentration of SFP needed to safely maintain iron levels, compensating for iron
      losses during chronic hemodialysis.
