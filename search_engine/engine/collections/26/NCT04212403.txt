    
      Main objective:

      To investigate the safety of omitting antibiotic prophylaxis in TURP (transurethral resection
      of the prostate) and TURB (transurethral bladder tumour resection) in patients without a
      pre-operative catheter or > 100 WBC in the pre-operative urinary sample (TURP) or clinical
      signs of urinary infection (TURB).

      Secondary objective:

      To investigate post-operative bacteriuria after TURB and TURP in our population.

      Principal inclusion criterium:

      Patients undergoing TURP or TURB.

      Primary exclusion criterium:

      TURP: pre-operative catheter or > 100 white blood cells in the pre- operative urinary sample.

      TURB: pre-operative catheter or clinical signs of infection (fever, nyctalgia).

      Primary endpoint:

      Post-operative infection.

      Secondary endpoint:

      Post-operative bacteriuria.
