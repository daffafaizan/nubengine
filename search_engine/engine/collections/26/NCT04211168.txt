    
      This phase II trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study.

      It is estimated that 44 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in 2 years and
      treated with toripalimab plus lenvatinib in PUMCH. The investigators will follow up and
      collect subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including
      overall survival and time to progression, until disease progression or death. Interim
      analysis and final analysis will be conducted when collecting data from 20 and 44 subjects,
      respectively in this trial. Histopathology and multi-omics data analysis will be used to
      explore potential biomarkers of treatment response.
