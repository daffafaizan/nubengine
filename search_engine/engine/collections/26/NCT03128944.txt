      consent, responses to background data - age, gender, height, weight, wrist circumference of
      dominant arm, history of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and cardiovascular
      disease - will be collected; The BPI will be strapped to the right or left wrist making sure
      it is comfortable to the participant and the readings from the BPI will be recorded in a
      computer. The continuous BPI readings will be recorded for 2 minutes. Simultaneously, blood
      pressure readings will be obtained from a cuff-based, commercially available blood pressure
      measuring device placed in the same arm. The research team will take a minimum 3 and maximum
      6 sets of readings. At the end of the BPI readings, we will place an ultrasound probe of the
      wrist at the level of the wrist to assess the size of the radial artery and depth of the
      artery from the skin.

      Participant Timeline: The collection of the background data will take 5 to 10 mins. The
      placement of the BPI and cuff-blood pressure device and the data collection will take about
      15 to 20 mins. The ultrasound image collection will 10 to 15 mins. Overall, the study
      procedures will be less than an hour.
