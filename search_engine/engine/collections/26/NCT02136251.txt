      autologous bone graft in total shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate if the use of autologous bone graft around the anchor peg glenoid prosthesis
      correlates with better shoulder function. Subjects having had this surgery who are five years
      or more out from surgery will have computed tomography and three plain radiographs to monitor
      for bony apposition, radiolucent lines and component loosening. These testings are not a
      study intervention and are for monitoring purposes.
