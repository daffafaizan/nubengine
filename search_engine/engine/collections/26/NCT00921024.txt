    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative efficacy
      and safety study of IV CXA 101 versus IV ceftazidime for 7 to 10 days.

      Subjects are followed up 6 to 9 days after the last dose of study drug to assess clinical
      signs and symptoms of infection. A Late Follow Up evaluation (21 to 28 days after the last
      dose of study drug) occurs for those subjects who respond to therapy. The primary assessment
      of effectiveness is the microbiological response (the eradication at post-therapy of the
      infectious organism identified at the start of study). An additional assessment of efficacy
      includes the overall clinical response, which is described as cured, improved, or failed.
      Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study, clinical
      laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) and physical examinations at
      the start of the study and post-therapy.
