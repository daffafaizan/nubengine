      dantrolene, by determining the treatment related adverse events, in participants with cVSP
      after SAH; and 2) to determine the maximal tolerated dose to be adopted in subsequent studies
      and 3) to determine efficacy trends of dantrolene on brain vessels as assessed by ultrasound
      of brain vessels (transcranial Doppler).

      We hypothesize that dantrolene is well-tolerated and has minimal serious adverse effects in
      patients with cVSP after SAH. The results can potentially bring a new treatment to patients
      with SAH. cVPS after SAH is a frequent cause of disability and death. A successful study
      demonstrating the safety of dantrolene in would be of considerable public health
      significance.
