      study. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer that meet inclusion criteria will
      be randomized into one of two arms, treatment with BTS and narcotic analgesia or treatment
      with narcotic analgesia alone. After randomization a baseline pain score will be assessed
      using the visual analog pain scale. Narcotic dosage and frequency will be evaluated at the
      time of enrollment. A pre-treatment quality of life score will be recorded using the SF-12Â®
      Patient Questionnaire. Patients will also be queried about the presence of nausea and reflux.

      After all baseline assessments are complete patients will be taken to the OR to undergo their
      assigned procedure. BTS and infusaport placement will be performed on patients randomly
      selected for treatment with BTS and narcotic analgesia. BTS will be performed as described in
      the study procedure. Patients chosen to be treated with narcotic analgesia alone will undergo
      infusaport placement only. An evaluation will be completed postoperatively in which the
      length of stay, post-op complications, and chest X-ray results will be recorded. Follow-up
      assessments will be conducted 24-48 hours post-procedure and at the time of discharge.
      Further follow-up assessments will be conducted 14 days, 30 days, and 90 days post-procedure
      during an office visit with the clinical research team or medical oncology.
