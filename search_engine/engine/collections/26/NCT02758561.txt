      uncomfortable openly discussing these topics. Treatments include lifestyle modification,
      medications, and/or surgery. "Decisional conflict" arises when patients have difficulty
      choosing between several viable treatment options. Factors contributing to decisional
      conflict include biased information, poor peer support, and unaddressed fears. Effective
      counselling may help address these factors.

      There are few studies on how decision coaching can help women with prolapse and incontinence
      reach a satisfactory decision about treatment. This study aims to use the principals of
      shared decision making to address decisional conflict surrounding treatment for pelvic floor
      disorders. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      small group workshops on pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence led by a nurse
      continence advisor and a psychologist (decision coach).

      Results of this study will inform future development of interdisciplinary, patient-centered
      approaches to enhanced decision making in women's health.
