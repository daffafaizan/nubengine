      well-established indication for valve operation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.
      However, many patients tend to misinterpretate or even ignore symptom onset, and irreversible
      myocardial dysfunction may occur. Measurement of aortic valve area by transthoracic
      echocardiography using the continuity equation is prone to methological mistakes, whereas
      transvalvular gradients are usually easy to quantify but may underestimate hemodynamic
      effects in the presence of low flow (stroke volume index below 35 ml/m2). All these
      shortcomings in clinical routine may be overcome by objectively and easily assessable
      parameters indicating advanced aortic stenosis. Severe aortic valve calcification is such a
      risk factor for worse prognosis. However, assessment of valve calcification by
      echocardiography is a subjective measurement and highly operator-dependent. Quantification of
      valve calcification by multi detector computed tomography is limited by exposure to
      radiation, availibilty and cost.

      A laboratory parameter already used in clinical routine would fullfill the requirements for
      such a risk stratification much better. Natriuretic peptides may be of interest in this
      context, but their plasma levels are strongly influenced by age, sex, concomitant arterial
      hypertension and/or renal dysfunction and volume status. Recently, high-sensitivity troponin
      plasma levels have been suggested to indicate ongoing myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis.
      A small study with 60 patients suggested that hs-TnT predicte the operative outcome of AS. We
      therefore set out to characterize the clinical value of minimally elevated troponin T plasma
      levels both in patients with asymptomatic and symtomatic aortic stenosis.
