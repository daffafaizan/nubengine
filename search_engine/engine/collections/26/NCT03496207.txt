    
      This is a Phase 2, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      sotatercept plus SOC versus placebo plus SOC in participants with PAH of WHO Group 1,
      functional class II-III.

      Participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:3:4 ratio to receive placebo every 21 days,
      sotatercept 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) every 21 days, or sotatercept 0.7 mg/kg SC every 21
      days, for a period of 24 weeks in the Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period of the study while
      on standard of care therapy. Evaluations will include changes in pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR), six-minute-walk distance (6MWD), quality of life questionnaires,
      echocardiographic parameters, and safety. Participants who have not discontinued early from
      the Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period and have had their post-Treatment Period PVR
      assessment will be able to continue into the 18-month Extension Period in which
      sotatercept-treated participants will receive their latest dose level of sotatercept SC every
      21 days and placebo-treated participants willbe re-randomized 1:1 to receive sotatercept 0.3
      mg/kg SC every 21 days or sotatercept 0.7 mg/kg SC every 21 days while on standard of care
      therapy.
