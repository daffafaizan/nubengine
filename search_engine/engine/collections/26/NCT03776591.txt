    
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical study. The short term outcome, 2 and
      5 year survival and mortality rates will be compared between the groups operated with open D3
      resection at Haukeland University hospital and laparoscopic CME with CVL right hemicolectomy
      at Haraldsplass Deaconess hospital. Computer generated block randomization will be used.

      All patients â‰¤ 85 years with tumor localized in the right colon will be considered to
      participate in the study. The patients will be summoned to the first consultation to the
      hospital they are referred to. They will be informed of the study. A patient who meets the
      inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study and sign the informed consent. A
      patient who accepts will be assigned a sequential participant number and then referred to
      open D3 or laparoscopic CME (right hemicolectomy) according to a pre-specified randomized
      list of treatments.

      All patients referred with right sided colon cancer in the inclusion period will be
      registered, and the reason why some do not participate in the study will be documented.
      Patients who decline to participate in the study will be assigned standard treatment in the
      institution they are referred to.

      Blood samples for analysis of ctDNA/CTCs will be collected preoperatively, 3-10th
      postoperative day, at 3 months and at each check the next five years at six months intervals.
      All sample times except the first postoperative control, correspond to the time of CEA and CT
      in ordinary follow-up. Proteomic technology based analysis of tumor tissue
