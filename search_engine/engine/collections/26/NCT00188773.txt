      of Intralipid and heparin. 15 abdominally obese insulin resistant, but otherwise healthy,
      non-diabetic men will be studied on three occasions each, in random order, 4 weeks apart. We
      have chosen to study abdominally obese, insulin resistant individuals rather than lean
      healthy controls because we have previously shown that these individuals are more susceptible
      to lipotoxicity and we are therefore more likely to see differences between the interventions
      if differences indeed exist. Informed written consent will be obtained from all participants
      in accordance with the guidelines of the Human Subjects Review Committee of the University
      Health Network.

      Subjects will be hospitalized in the Metabolic Investigation Unit (MIU) of the Toronto
      General Hospital for each of their three studies, which will be performed in random order 4
      to 6 weeks apart. On one occasion a saline control study will be performed, on a second
      occasion Intralipid (20% solution @ 40ml/hr) and heparin (250u/hr) will be infused for 48
      hours as previously described and on a third occasion NAC will be administered orally
      concurrently with the Intralipid and heparin. The dose of NAC will be the same as that
      recommended for acetaminophen overdose. An initial loading dose of 140mg/kg NAC followed by a
      maintenance dose of 70mg/kg every 4 hours during the 48 hour infusion of Intralipid and
      heparin. On day three, testing of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) will occur as
      outlined below. Subjects will be provided with an isocaloric diet consisting of 50% calories
      derived from carbohydrates, 30% fat and 20% protein during the 48 hour infusions and will
      fast from midnight for the testing of pancreatic beta cell function on day three.
