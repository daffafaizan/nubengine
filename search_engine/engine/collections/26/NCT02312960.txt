      interventional, company sponsored trials with radium-223 dichloride (feeder trials).

      The primary objectives are to define the long term safety profile of radium-223 dichloride
      (for up to 7 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride); to assess the incidence of
      leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new
      primary malignancy; to assess the incidence of bone fractures and bone associated events
      (e.g., osteoporosis); and, in subjects who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy, to assess the
      incidence of febrile neutropenia and hemorrhage during their chemotherapy treatment and for
      up to 6 months thereafter at a frequency based on local clinical practice.
