    
      Study Type: Observational cohort. Single arm (non-comparative), non-randomized, multi-site
      surgical case series.

      Objective: To prospectively observe the association of the LAP-BAND System device on
      measurements of quality of life, anthropometric, metabolic and biochemical parameters in
      morbidly obese patients when performed by experienced U.S. surgeons. Cost effectiveness
      analysis will also be done.

      Numbers: This study will enroll 240 patients total from six U.S. bariatric surgical practices

      Duration: Individual subject participation will be approximately 15 months. Data will be
      collected at a baseline less than three months prior to surgery or before starting a Very Low
      Calorie Diet (VLCD), then at 6 and 12 months post surgery. The total duration, including
      enrollment, of the observational period for the cohort is expected to be 21 months. Subjects
      have the option to consent for future contact by investigators for a period of 10 years
      following their surgery.
