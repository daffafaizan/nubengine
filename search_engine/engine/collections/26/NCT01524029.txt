      novel technique Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) in the assessment and screening for breast
      cancer. Mammography is the primary imaging modality for the early detection of clinically
      occult breast cancer.

      Despite advances in mammographic technique, mammography is still limited with regard to both
      sensitivity and specificity. In the majority of cases these limitations arise from the
      masking of subtle breast cancer lesions by overlapping breast tissue.

      DBT is a novel technique that tries to overcome these limitations by performing a
      3D-reconstruction of breast tissue from multiple low-dose digital mammographic images
      acquired in several planes in a 15 to 50 degree angle.

      Early studies indicate an advantage of DBT compared to the standard Full Field Digital
      Mammography (FFDM) in terms of an improvement of specificity without cutback in sensitivity.

      Controversy continues over the use of DBT in combination with FFDM or as a standalone
      screening method without concomitant 2D imaging. Unfortunately, the peer-reviewed
      publications evaluating DBT are limited and consist of single institution studies with a
      small number of participants.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the novel technique of DBT compared to routine FFDM
      in a clinical large sample study (600 participants) to provide the path to implementation of
      this new technique into clinical and screening routine.
