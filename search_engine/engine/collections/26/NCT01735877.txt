      stroke disabilities are due to loss of locomotion and activities of daily living, cognition
      and communication skills.Hemispatial neglect has been reported in association with damage to
      several different cerebral structures in a large-scale distributed neurocognitive
      network.Mirror therapy improves the hand function in sub-acute stroke. It also helps in the
      recovery of neglect in stroke patients. But little consensus exists as to whether one
      treatment is more efficacious than others and many studies fail to document duration of
      treatment effects or generalization to daily activities. The aim of our study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of limb activation with MT and limb activation strategy alone in the
      management of stroke patients with unilateral neglect and to make the patient functional in
      activities of daily living.
