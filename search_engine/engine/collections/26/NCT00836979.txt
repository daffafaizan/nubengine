      CN-02Svand-07-H), this study will follow a well characterized cohort of middle-aged and older
      women who have been members of Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan (KPMCP) of Northern
      California continuously since age 18. The cohort is composed of over 2000 women for whom we
      have data from abstracted medical records, in-person interview, voiding diaries, physical
      assessments, laboratory data, and banked sera. Our cohort is unique in including a
      substantial number of women from the 4 major ethnic/race groups (white non-Hispanic, Black,
      Asian and Hispanic.) For this study, we will re-interview as many study participants from
      RRISK and RRISK2 as are willing. This study will also expand to further increase its
      diversity by adding a total of 450 Black, Asian and Hispanic women to the cohort. The overall
      goal of the study is to advance our understanding of mechanisms of Urinary Incontinence and
      facilitate the translational development of novel approaches to treatment and prevention.
