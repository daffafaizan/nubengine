      who remained in an outpatient setting, with pneumonia and moderate illness, defined by
      individuals who have evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging
      and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) >93% on room air and no other hospitalization criteria
      (CURB 65 score below 2points).

      For patients' follow-up, the investigators have created an aftercare ambulatory unit, open
      5/7 days. The investigators were able to conduct 64 consultations between April 2 and May 5,
      2020. Every participant had suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary tract infection.

      The follow-up data was entered into DPI (patient's medical record at HUG) on a specific
      consultation form. Patients followed in the investigators consultation were contacted between
      30 and 60 days after diagnosis by the Covicare team. The Covicare team is call-center
      composed of medical students and primary care physicians who remotely followed patients with
      COVID-19 by calling them by phone or telemedicine every day or every other day depending on
      patients' needs and health status. The investigators will export data from RedCap concerning
      post-hospitalization, satisfaction survey on our care and oral consent for use of data (ARGOS
      study CCER number 2020-01273).
