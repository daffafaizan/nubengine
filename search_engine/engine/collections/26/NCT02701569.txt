      stood on the mid portion of the trampoline bed and made repeated up-and-down bouncy
      movements. Each foot strike equals one step or bounce. With each landing, the mat of the
      trampoline underwent deformation and the springs released the energy stored in them such that
      the participant was made to bounce off the mat. Exercise was administered for between 10 - 15
      minutes after which a 5-minute period of rest was allowed. A heart rate monitor was used to
      guide the intensity of the exercise in the moderate range. Each participant accumulated
      between 20 and 30 minutes of rebound exercise (bouncing on a mini trampoline) per session,
      administered three times per week for 12 weeks. All data were captured at baseline and at the
      end of the 12-week intervention period.
