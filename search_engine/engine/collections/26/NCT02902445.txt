      geographical origins: the Guyana populated with Native Americans, people of European descent,
      people of Asian (Hmong) and a large source population African.

      The first aim of the project will be to characterize the specificity of the VP8 * HBGA of
      RotaTeq and Rotarix vaccines in order to ensure their binding characteristics glycans are
      similar to those of recent P8 clinical strains circulating in France and were maintained in
      the culture passages.

      The second objective will be to validate the impact of recently described polymorphisms HBGAs
      on susceptibility to infection by RVA through GASTROVIMc prospective clinical research.

      The third objective will be to determine the relative role of recognition and HBGAs
      ganglioside in the initial attachment and viral entry.

      The expression of HBGAs and ganglioside by permissive cell lines in culture human stem RVA be
      manipulated to define the role of glycans in attachment and infection.
