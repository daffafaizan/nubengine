    
      This is an open label, randomised, stratified, 2-arm, multicentre phase 2 clinical trial
      recruiting 160 participants over 12 months and followed until 150 events occurred
      (approximately another 18 months). Participants will be randomised to enzalutamide or
      enzalutamide and Lu-PSMA in a 1:1 ratio. A minimisation approach will be used to minimise
      chance imbalances across the following stratification factors: study site, volume of disease
      (>20 versus â‰¤20 sites of disease measured on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT), prior treatment with early
      docetaxel for castration- sensitive disease (yes vs no), and prior treatment with early
      abiraterone for castration-sensitive disease (yes vs no).
