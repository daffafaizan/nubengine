      The underlying question is whether Chilean PC should incorporate this treatment among its
      regular programs based on its effectiveness.

      To answer this question, a randomised comparison between the manualized BMT and EUC will be
      undertaken. The main hypothesis is a superiority one:

      • Participants under BMT will perform better than EUC in the reduction of alcohol
      consumption.

      Also, there are ancillary questions that deserve special attention. The following hypotheses
      will help with the explanation of the results:

        -  Active BMT components (i.e., the working alliance and fidelity to the MI strategies)
           mediate the effect.

        -  Participant´s AUD severity mediates the effect.

        -  Participants under BMT will receive a higher amount of additional care (physician
           consultations, social worker consultations, participation in alcoholic anonymous, and
           others).
