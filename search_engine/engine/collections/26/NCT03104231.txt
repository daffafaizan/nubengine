      patients, who are over 18 years old. The only exclusion criteria of the study is the
      previously diagnosed dementia. The study is based on the questionnaire designed by the
      authors of the study, enclosing questions about sex, age, education, current job, AF history
      and knowledge about consequences of AF and the possibility of stroke prevention due to the
      OAC therapy. Subsequently, the brief VR-3D will be shown using the oculus glasses and a
      smartphone. The movie's plot informs about the risk of stroke and importance of the OAC
      therapy to prevent the incidence of the thromboembolic complications of AF. Consequently,
      patients will be asked several questions, including what was the movie about, whether AF can
      affect patient's life in a negative way, is it possible to reduce the risk of stroke and by
      what kind of drugs. Similar questions will be asked to the patients immediately after the
      movie, one week and one year later, via the Telephone follow-up.
