      and demographic profile of a group of patients with depressive disorders and a sub-group of
      TRD cohort, followed by validating the cultural meanings and recovery constructs of TRD
      through professional and lay focus groups. In the second to third year, we will examine the
      effectiveness of a 8-week, nurse-led psychosocial intervention with group approach in a
      randomized control trial (RCT) compared to the controls receiving usual care with follow-ups.
      Detailed psychiatric assessment and study interviews will be performed at baseline, 3, 6, and
      9 months after the intervention by a senior psychiatrist and a research assistant using
      standardized operation forms.Structured measurements will be utilized to collect primary
      outcome variables of psychological distress, suicide risk and resilience as well as secondary
      outcome measures of quality of life, community reintegration level, perceived satisfaction,
      and main clinical variables (e.g., treatment adherence, service use such as ER/OPD attendance
      or hospitalization days). The control group receives usual care of pharmacological therapy
      provided by the psychiatrists in the Psychiatric Department.
