      I. Determine the activity of CCI-779 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelogenous
      leukemia in blastic phase.

      II. Correlate the effect of this drug with altered mitochondrial respiration in the leukemia
      cells of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (acute myeloid leukemia,
      myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase [CML-BP]
      non-lymphoid vs acute lymphoblastic leukemia, CML-BP lymphoid).

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-74 patients (12-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 8-46 months.
