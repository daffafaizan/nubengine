      Cardiac biomarkers are proteins made by the heart. When cardiac biomarkers are above normal
      levels, there may be damage to the heart. The relationship between cardiac biomarkers and
      radiation therapy has not been well studied. Learning more about this relationship may lead
      to better ways to check the heart during radiation therapy. How cardiac biomarkers can play a
      role in predicting future heart problems during radiation therapy will also be studied.

      Study Tests:

      If you agree to take part in this study, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure
      certain cardiac biomarkers up to 2 days before radiation therapy, following the first
      treatment of radiation, within 2 days of finishing radiation therapy, and about 1 to 2 months
      after completion of radiation therapy. Once the blood testing is completed, any leftover
      blood samples will be destroyed.

      You will also have electrocardiograms (ECGs -- tests that measure the electrical activity of
      the heart) at the same time points as the blood draws.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after the last blood draw and ECG.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
