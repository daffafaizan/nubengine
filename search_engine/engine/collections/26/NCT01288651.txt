      heart failure which eventually will lead to death. During progression of the disease the
      physical performance of the patients deteriorates. Maintaining their exercise capacity is a
      major goal in PAH treatment. Iron treatment is known to have a positive effect on physical
      performance in patients with left heart failure and iron deficiency. Whether this is also
      effective in patients with right heart failure (PAH) and iron deficiency is until now
      unknown.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of intravenous iron supplementation on exercise capacity
      in iron deficient IPAH patients.

      Study design: Intervention study

      Study population: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and iron
      deficiency

      Patients receive an iron bolus infusion of 1000 mg iron after baseline measurements.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: six minute walking distance (6WMD) Secondary endpoints: cardiopulmonary
      exercise test, myoglobin concentration in quadriceps muscle, quadriceps muscle fiber
      strength, serum iron parameters, serum inflammatory parameters, quality of life (QOL), and
      NYHA functional class.

      The patients will be hospitalised two days at the beginning and two days at the end of the
      study to perform the exercise and strength tests, six minute walking distance and for biopsy
      of the quadriceps muscle. Also NYHA functional class will be determined and a QOL
      questionnaire has to be filled in. After the baseline measurements an iron infusion will be
      given (Ferinject 1000mg).

      The investigators hypothesize that iron deficient IPAH patients will benefit from iron
      treatment with improved exercise capacity reflected in an increased 6MWD.
