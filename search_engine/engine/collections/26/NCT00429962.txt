      secondary to AMD. However, the treatment does not provide benefit to all patients and the
      treatment regimen requires monthly intravitreal injections. Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF-A
      monoclonal antibody fragment. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy acts through occluding newly
      formed vessels. The combination of these therapies acting through different modes of action
      bears the potential to provide a more convenient and less frequent therapy while
      maintaining/improving the increase in vision improvement observed with ranibizumab
      monotherapy. The strategic goal is to evaluate whether intravitreal ranibizumab in
      combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy is an effective, safe and convenient
      treatment for patients with subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD and explore potential advantages
      of such treatment compared to ranibizumab monotherapy
