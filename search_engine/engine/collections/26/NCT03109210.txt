    
      This dual-site randomized clinical trial will use a "SMART" design to test a stepped care
      model relative to standard positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and determine if (1)
      augmentation of PAP therapy with online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy improves short-term
      outcomes of comorbid obstructive sleep apnea(OSA)/insomnia; and (2) providing a higher
      intensity 2nd-stage cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to patients who show sub-optimal
      short-term outcomes with OCBT+PAP improves short and longer-term outcomes. After completing
      baseline assessment, the 384 comorbid OSA\insomnia patients enrolled will be randomized to a
      1st-stage therapy that includes usual care PAP + OCBT (n=288) or UC (usual care PAP + sleep
      hygiene education; n=96). Insomnia and OSA will be reassessed after 8 weeks. OCBT recipients
      who meet "remission" criteria will continue PAP but be offered no additional insomnia
      intervention and will complete study outcome measures again after an additional 8-weeks and
      at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. OCBT recipients classified as "unremitted" after 8 weeks of
      treatment will be re-randomized to a 2nd-stage treatment consisting of continued, expanded
      engagement in OCBT or a switch to therapist-directed CBT (TCBT). Those receiving the
      2nd-stage intervention as well as the UC group will be reassessed after another 8 weeks and
      at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points.
