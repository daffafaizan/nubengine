      patients of all age groups. Anterior transfer of tibialis posterior tendon is now regarded as
      the gold standard treatment as this allows walking without wearing an orthosis and thus
      substantial improvement in quality of life. This equally applies to developing and developed
      world.

      The rationale for our study is that that there is a clinical equipoise with regards to these
      two techniques of Tibialis posterior tendon transfer and through our study we aim to compare
      the clinical and functional outcomes of these two techniques. Both these techniques have been
      widely described in literature (References attached) and are being extensively used in
      surgical management of foot drop. The selection of technique depends on surgeon choice and
      patient factors.

      There are no studies in literature which compare the clinical and functional outcomes with
      regards to both these methods. Although there are many studies to demonstrate the functional
      and clinical effectiveness of the respective procedures, there is a paucity of clinical
      trials comparing these two surgical techniques with regards to clinical and functional
      outcomes. Furthermore there are no head to head clinical trials to compare the outcomes with
      regards to these two methods of Tibialis Posterior tendon transfer (Pub med search dated

      This study is of great interest to health care professionals managing foot drop both in
      developing and developed world. The answer to our research question; whether one surgical
      technique has better clinical, functional and quality of life over the other, will greatly
      impact the future surgical management of foot drop.
