      patients are refractory. For these patients, dietary therapy is an alternative option.
      However, current dietary therapies present issues with compliance, palatability, adverse
      events, and providing necessary nutrients for brain growth and development during childhood.
      A dietary option that can improve tolerability, increase compliance, and reduce or eliminate
      adverse effects, while also optimizing nutrient intake, is critical for the advancement of
      dietary therapy options in epilepsy.

      Glutamate is found in the diet as a flavor enhancer; and is also an important
      neurotransmitter in the body which mediates seizure activity. Dietary sources of free
      glutamate are common and include numerous food additives (including many hidden sources) and
      some items which naturally contain higher amounts of glutamate. The low glutamate diet
      reduces the consumption of free glutamate, while optimizing dietary micronutrient and
      antioxidant intake, which can protect against the negative effects caused by high glutamate
      concentrations in the brain. Additionally, the low glutamate diet is balanced, nutritious and
      palatable, with no side effects.

      The study is investigating if following the low glutamate diet for 1 month can improve
      seizure frequency, severity, and duration; cognitive functioning; and/or quality of life, in
      children with epilepsy. Participation in the study will be done virtually and over a 2- or 3-
      month study period, depending on group randomization. All participants will have the
      opportunity to undergo dietary training and follow the diet.
