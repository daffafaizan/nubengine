      intra-operatively using a lung protective ventilation strategy (small tidal volumes {Vts} at
      6ml/kg Ideal Body Weight {IBW}). In a randomized, crossover trial Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure (CPAP) to the non ventilated lung or a Recruitment Maneuver (RM) followed by the
      application of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) (acronym RM-PEEP) to the ventilated
      lung will be applied and blood oxygenation (PaO2) measured by arterial blood gas sampling to
      determine which intervention has the most beneficial effect on PaO2 (CPAP or RM-PEEP).

      CPAP will be applied at a pressure of 5cmH2O by a CPAP breathing circuit (designed for the
      purpose and commonly used in anesthetic practice). The PEEP will be applied at a pressure of
      5cmH20 by the operating room (OR) anesthetic machine. The RM will involve a valsalva
      maneuver, held for 5 seconds at a pressure of 25cmH20, again performed using the OR
      anesthetic machine.

      Null hypothesis: Compared to CPAP, RM-PEEP does not significantly increase PaO2 or reduce the
      incidence of hypoxia (oxygen blood saturation less than or equal to 90%), when employing a
      lung protective ventilation strategy.

      This study is based on our previous research (citation 12, Badner et al) in which we compared
      CPAP to PEEP alone (omitting the recruitment maneuver). Here it was noted that CPAP to the
      non ventilated lung improved oxygenation more than PEEP to the ventilated lung (even though
      PEEP is an easier modality to provide), when employing a lung protective ventilation
      strategy.
