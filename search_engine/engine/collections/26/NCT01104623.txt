      voice-analysis system, which uses as input the natural speech of the participants. The
      underlying voice-analysis procedure was developed by J. Langner at Humboldt University of
      Berlin (Langner 2003). It ignores the semantic content of spoken words and extracts prosodic
      and sound features from the speech.

      Aims of the study:

        -  deliver optimized multivariate logistic regression models of prosodic and sound
           properties of speech for ADHD.

        -  observe sensitivity and specificity of the voice-analysis procedure.
