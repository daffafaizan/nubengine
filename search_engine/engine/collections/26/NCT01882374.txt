      normally discarded at birth and can easily be collected and stored. Availability of numerous
      CB banks has resulted in genetically diverse CB units including those from non-Caucasians.
      Once a suitable CB unit is located, confirmatory typing can be quickly performed and a donor
      unit can be shipped to the transplant center. Furthermore, because a CB graft results in a
      lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), one or two antigen-mismatches may be
      acceptable for transplantation. Despite these advantages, CB has a significant drawback: the
      number of hematopoietic stem cells obtained from a unit of CB is significantly lower than
      from a bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest. The number of stem
      cells can be increased by transplanting two cord blood units, however the incidence of GVHD
      increases in patients receiving two CB units compared to patients who receive one unit.
      Another issue in this population is mucositis, as a result of myeloablative conditioning
      given prior to the transplant, which can be debilitating to patients. TXA127 is
      pharmaceutically-formulated angiotensin 1-7, a non-hypertensive derivative of angiotensin II
      (which contains the 8th amino acid conferring receptor binding to blood pressure receptors).
      TXA127 has multilineage effects on hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and in vivo. The
      hematopoietic properties demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies support the
      investigation of TXA127 to reduce the incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and mucositis in this
      patient population.
