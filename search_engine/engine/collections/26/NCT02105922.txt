      interventions as described, and 15 subjects from each of the three groups will be tested
      after 12 weeks of intervention.

      15 subjects are included in each group to account for an expected drop-out rate of 20%, and
      so 12 subjects are expected to complete each intervention. With this N an increase of around
      11% in MRi-evaluated muscle size can be detected with a powerlevel of 80% and an alpha of
      0.05 and use of reported SD.

      Primary outcome is muscle size (MRi), and secondary outcomes are overall body composition
      (DXA), muscle strength, rate of force development, power, 30s chair stand, 400m gait speed,
      grip strength. Tertiary outcomes are habitual activitylevel (accelerometry), blood samples
      (HbA1c, cholesterols, creatinine), blood pressure, weight, BMI, wast- and hip circumference.

      Results are to be compared with NCT01997320 and so a population of 65+ can be compared with a
      population of 83+. Both studies uses the same heavy strength training regimen.
