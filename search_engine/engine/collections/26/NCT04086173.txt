    
      A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial will take place in which both arms will be
      included in an interventional lifestyle changes program at the Clinic for Integral Treatment
      of patients with Diabetes and Obesity. The study group will be treated with probiotics (1 x
      1011 CFU) for 16 weeks and will be compared to a control group who will receive placebo.

      Changes in body composition (weight, BMI, fat percentage, fat mass, lean body mass) and
      insulin resistance indexes (HOMA, insulin sensitivity index and Quicki) will be evaluated in
      patients with obesity receiving probiotics (1 x 1011 CFU) for 16 weeks, and compared to a
      placebo group.

      Changes in metabolic profile (glucose tolerance test, glycosylated haemoglobin, lipid
      profile, leptin and transaminases) in patients with obesity receiving probiotics (1 x 1011
      CFU) for 16 weeks, and compared to a placebo group.

      Changes in microRNAs profile (miR-133 and miR-27 in patients with obesity receiving
      probiotics (1 x 1011 CFU) for 16 weeks, and compared to a placebo group.

      The threshold for basic tastes will be evaluated (salted, bitter, acid, sweet) and will be
      evaluated in those patients receiving probiotics (1 x 1011 CFU) for 16 weeks, and compared to
      the group receiving only placebo.

      Changes in intestinal microbiota behaviour will be evaluated in participants with obesity
      receiving probiotics (1 x 1011 CFU) for 16 weeks, and compared to the group receiving
      placebo.
