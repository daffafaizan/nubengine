      patients with liver cirrhosis to assess liver tissue regeneration, efficacy and safety of
      stem cell therapy and finally to establish an alternative treatment modality to liver
      transplantation.

      Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis (the last stage of the illness) is very difficult that
      leads to high morbidity and mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the most effective
      treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis, However, serious problems are accompanied
      with liver transplantation, donor shortage, long waiting list, high cost, risk of rejection,
      operative complications and complications related to immunosuppressive drugs.

      "stem cells" are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and
      differentiate to a diverse range of specialized cell types and can be differentiated to
      specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. In recent years, advances in stem
      cell biology, have made the prospect of tissue regeneration a potential clinical reality, and
      several studies have shown the great promise that stem cells hold for therapy. mesenchymal
      stem cell based therapy has shown as promising tool in cirrhotic conditions as this type of
      cells have the ability to differentiate to different cell types including hepatocytes A
      series of studies have been performed to assess the application of bone marrow derived
      mesenchymal stem cells to promote liver regeneration and to alleviate cirrhosis. Some
      animal-based studies showed that stem cell transplantation could ameliorate liver fibrosis
      and improve liver functions followed by several clinical trials on human, in patients with
      advanced liver diseases, these studies demonstrated that stem cell transplantation could
      significantly reverse hepatic failure with only limited side effects. However, the
      effectiveness of this therapy in recent clinical trials is still conflicting and need further
      evaluation.
