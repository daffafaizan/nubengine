      objective of procedure success using the Librata endometrial ablation device, as defined as
      device success (completion of treatment cycles according to device specifications) and no
      occurrence of intra-procedural complications.

      The investigators will also assess the secondary objectives of:

        1. Rates of bleeding at months 3, 6 and 12 as measured by menstrual pictogram

        2. Rate of serious adverse device effects through to day 30 post-operatively

        3. Rates of re-intervention for menstrual related bleeding or pain and/or hysterectomy at 6
           and 12 months

        4. Rates of patient satisfaction at 6 and 12 months.
