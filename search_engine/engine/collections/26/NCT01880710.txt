      metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, fibroids, endometriosis,and pelvic pain. Women in need of
      hysterectomy for malignant disease or because of prolapse of the uterus were not included.
      They were followed up by a questionnaire covering all outcome measures as described above.
      Background information was registered in a second questionnaire prior to surgery. All
      gynaecological departments in Denmark were invited to join the trial. 11 departments
      contributed randomized patients to the trial.

      the results up to 1 year after surgery have been published, links can be found in the
      citation list. The results from the 5 year follow up have not yet been published.

      The questionnaire used in this trial consists of the validated SF-36 (Short Form 36) quality
      of life questionnaire as well as a thorough questionnaire regarding the outcome measures
      described elsewhere. The entire questionnaire was validated prior to the beginning of the
      trial.

      A second questionnaire has been added in the 15 year follow up: PFDI-20(Pelvic Floor Distress
      Inventory 20). The investigators included this, as it is more thorough regarding pelvic organ
      prolapse and in particular a "bother" measure than the original questionnaire.

      The 20 min. pad-weighing test has been tested against the 1 hour gold-standard used by the
      ICS (International Continence Society) and has been found to give comparable results.
