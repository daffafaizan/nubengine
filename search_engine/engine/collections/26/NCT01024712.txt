    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy, in terms of overall response, and safety of paclitaxel and
           carboplatin in combination with intermittent gefitinib in patients with advanced
           nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the disease-control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV on day 1, carboplatin IV on day 2, and oral gefitinib
      once daily on days 8-17. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 4 courses, patients with
      complete response or partial response may continue maintenance therapy comprising oral
      gefitinib once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) at baseline,
      during study treatment, and after completion of study treatment for quality-of-life study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years and
      then every 4 months thereafter.
