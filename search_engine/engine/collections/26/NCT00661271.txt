      between the ages of 14 and 22 will be recruited and randomized into either an eight-week
      (with one retreat session) Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course (intervention) or
      an eight-week (with one retreat session) Healthy Topics (HT) course (active control).
      Measures of psychological functioning, coping, and life satisfaction will take place at
      baseline, immediately post-program, and 3-months post program. Medical data, including
      Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) and viral load counts, will also be collected at the three
      data collection time points.
