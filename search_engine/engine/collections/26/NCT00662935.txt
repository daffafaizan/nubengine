      patients with intractable chronic cluster headache (CH). Results in these non-controlled
      studies were encouraging but need to be confirmed in controlled conditions. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in chronic and treatment-resistant CH, in
      randomized placebo-controlled conditions.

      Inclusion criteria are: patients with chronic CH (>3years), with daily attack and non
      response to adequate treatment (verapamil up 960 mg/d, lithium with plasmatic level 0.6-1
      mEq/ ml, and association of both drugs). After induction of local anaesthesia, electrodes are
      implanted stereotactically in the postero-inferior hypothalamus according to the previously
      described coordinates, and connected to a sub-cutaneous generator. In this crossover,
      randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded study, the efficacy of DBS is evaluated using
      comparison of two one-month sequences: one with stimulation "on" and the other with
      stimulation "off" (considered as the placebo sequence). Primary efficacy is defined as â‰¥50%
      decrease of weekly frequency of CH attacks, compared to a prospective run-in pre-implantation
      period. Safety and tolerability are clinically and biologically assessed. After the
      randomized period, long-term efficacy and safety are evaluated after one year of stimulation
      in open conditions.
