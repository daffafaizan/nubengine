      ulcer. The organism is also associated with gastric cancer in epidemiological studies.
      However detailed mechanism of carcinogenesis remains unknown. Histolopathological studies
      indicate that chronic H. pylori infection progresses over decades through stages of chronic
      gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and cancer. Gastric atrophy and
      intestinal metaplasia are considered as precancerous lesions, but whether H. pylori
      eradication improves these lesions and prevents metachronous gastric cancer is controversial.
      And the issue has not been evaluated in gastric cancer patients. However, despite the
      conflicting evidences from two open labelled randomized controlled trials, current guidelines
      from various regions recommend H. pylori eradication treatment in patients who were treated
      for gastric cancer by surgically or endoscopically. Thus, it is important to evaluate whether
      H. pylori eradication can improve known precancerous lesion, i.e. glandular atrophy and
      intestinal metaplasia in gastric cancer patients. Such histological improvement can
      eventually reduce secondary gastric cancer development and provide evidence for current
      guidelines.
