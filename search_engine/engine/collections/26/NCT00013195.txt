      Many elderly primary care patients are at high risk for health complications and functional
      impairment due to low levels of physical activity. Previous trials of counseling of elderly
      patients in primary care clinics have not demonstrated lasting physical activity change and
      have not evaluated fitness changes associated with any increased activity.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective was to determine if nurse telephone counseling could assist 60 to 80
      year old VA primary care patients to establish and maintain a regular walking program.

      Methods:

      In this randomized clinical trial, 60-80 year old patients were referred to a walking program
      by primary care providers. All participants received individualized counseling by the nurse
      and, over the next year, one of three follow-up interventions: 1) 20 calls initiated by the
      nurse; 2) ten calls initiated by the nurse and ten initiated by an automated telephone
      message delivery system; or 3) no follow-up calls. All kept walking diaries and mailed these
      in to a data collector blinded to intervention group. Follow-up research visits were
      scheduled at six and 12 months. Self-reported walking, the primary outcome measure, was
      assessed from the walking diaries and validated by reports of significant others and
      accelerometer data. Improvement in fitness was assessed at 12 months with a standardized six
      minute walking test. Tinetti mobility scores, body mass index, and body girths were also
      assessed. Several quality of life measures were also administered.

      Status:

      Complete.
