      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drugs work in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

      The EGFR gene produces a protein that helps cells divide. Specific changes or a mutation in
      the genetic information causes abnormal cell division and can lead to lung cancer. Patients
      who have NSCLC with an EGFR gene mutation can be treated by drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). They may stop (or "inhibit") the effect of the mutation in the EGFR
      gene.

      Osimertinib alone has been shown to benefit some patients who have received prior treatment
      for their EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      the combination of Osimertinib and Selumetinib as a treatment for any disease, but it has
      been investigated in other clinical trials.

      The main purpose of the study is to look at information on any potential side effects that
      this drug combination may cause and collect data about how your cancer responds to the
      combination of drugs.

      Specific TKIs have been approved by the FDA for first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with
      an EGFR mutation.
