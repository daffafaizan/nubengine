      of gynaecologists. Intervention within the practice consists of a 30 minutes counseling
      session based on Motivational Interviewing, a standardised physician letter focusing on the
      elevated health risks of smoking while using hormonal contraceptives and a stage-matched
      self-help manual. After four weeks, an expert system feedback letter will be sent. In the
      intervention group, no smoking intervention will be given. Follow-up assessments will be
      conducted after 12 months, including saliva cotinine measures.
