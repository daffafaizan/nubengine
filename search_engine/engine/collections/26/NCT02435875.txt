      mortality.It is estimated that one in six people worldwide, or nearly one billion, are
      affected by high blood pressure, and it is estimated that this number will increase to 1.5
      billion by 2025. The World Health Organization also stated that high blood pressure is the
      most attributable cause of cardiovascular death.As the speed of aging is accelerated, the
      amount of perioperative hypertensive patients continue to increase. Perioperative
      hypertension had been shown to be a risk factor for the development of perioperative
      morbidity and mortality.Although it has aroused people's attention, there still lack of
      system evaluation and effective control. Therefore, it's urgent and necessary to assess and
      intervene perioperative situation of hypertensive patients.

      The pathogenesis of hypertension is very complex, while the exact mechanism is still unclear.
      The dysfunction of autonomic activity, marked in particular by sympathetic overactivity and
      reduced parasympathetic activity, has been hypothesized to underlie the development of
      hypertension.Baroreflex control is one of the key mechanisms responsible for the short-term
      control of blood pressure.It acts as a closed loop, negative feedback mechanism, aimed at
      stabilizing blood pressure around a set point value.The impairment of baroreflex sensitivity
      (BRS) is know as the predictive factor of mortality in hypertension. A large of clinical and
      basic research indicated the existence of autonomic dysfunction and impaired BRS in patients
      with essential hypertension.

      However, no study has reported the values of perioperative BRS, especially in hypertensive
      patients . Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the value of BRS for hypertension
      in a surgery cohort, and to explore the functional status of autonomic nervous system, may
      provide reference for clinical treatment.
