      significant improvements in postural instability in Parkinson's disease, whereas previous
      reports of physical interventions have suggested promising results. The investigators want to
      study the effects of our multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment (MIRT) on
      balance disorders in PD.

      PD patients in stage 3 of Hoen & Yahr will undergo clinical and instrumental evaluations at
      the beginning (T0) and at the end (T1) of the MIRT. Berg Balance Scale (BBS) will be
      performed to assess static and dynamic balance abilities. In order to determine some
      variables as index of postural stability, the investigators will use a stabilometric
      platform. With respect to the average centre of gravity the standard deviation (SD) of trunk
      sway will be calculated: total, in antero-posterior (AP) and in medio-lateral (ML) direction.
      The investigators can obtain a statokinesigram, that is the layout of a line connecting the
      successive positions of the center of pressure during the recording, and the area of the
      ellipse containing 90% of the sampled positions of the center of pressure. These measurements
      will be calculated with open eyes (OE), and while the patient was performing a cognitive task
      (open eyes counting [OEC]).
