      Before surgery, all patients were diagnosed by physical examination and testified by color
      Doppler ultrasound. And one trained nurse documented the patients' age, left unilateral or
      bilateral and the grade of varicocele, and the grade of the more serious side was noted when
      handled with bilateral ones. During surgery, the duration of surgery was documented. After
      surgery, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess the introperative pain after
      anesthesia recovery and the amount of postoperative pain one month postoperatively by another
      trained nurse. And the patients whose pain scores > 3 and/or who claimed pain were prescribed
      with ibuprofen sustained-release capsules (China SmithKline Pharmaceutical Company, Tianjing,
      China) (0.3g) (ISRC) every 12h on the surgical day (since 2h postoperatively) and only if
      necessary on the following days (no patient claimed that he had gastrointestinal ulcer
      history or allergic history of relative drug). Parents were told to write down on a provided
      form how many times they gave medicine postoperatively. Patients were followed with visits 1
      month, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, and were encouraged to visit the clinic anytime when
      they had any complaint in this period. The semen analyses were conducted in the 3, 6 and 12
      months in the follow-up. The recurrence or hydrocele formation was testified by color Doppler
      ultrasound (with/without detected by physical examination) by the same doctor who did the
      preoperative examination. And this doctor and two nurses mentioned above were all unaware of
      the patients' groups.
