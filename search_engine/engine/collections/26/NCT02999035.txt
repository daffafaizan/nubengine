      of ocular surface sensitivity in a routine clinical setup. The only commercially available
      Cochet- Bonnet aesthesiometer uses a tactile-mechanical stimulus (the tip of a nylon thread),
      which can cause a microerosion when applied to the corneal surface. Additional disadvantages
      represent poor stimulus reproducibility, a limited stimulus bandwidth and the influence of
      humidity and age on the bending capibility of the nylon thread. For research purposes
      prototypes of non-contact air aesthesiometers (eg by Murphy et al. and Belmonte et al) are
      being used.

      This study aims to correlate ocular surface sensitivity measurements of a newly developed
      prototype, the liquid jet aesthesiometer, with the non-contact air jet aesthesiometer by
      Murphy et al. 1996 and to explore its repeatability of measurement.

      In this repeated measures design 60 subjects participate in corneal sensitivity measurements
      during two appointments with each described aesthesiometer.
