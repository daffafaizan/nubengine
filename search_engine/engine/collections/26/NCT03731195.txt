      Somato-sensory evoked potentials develop over the first 4 months of life.

      The aim of this study is to explore if the investigators can measure the cortical response
      from the scalp of infants using standard non-invasive EEG techniques, due to the activation
      of CT afferents and explore how the cortical response changes in regard to age. Preform a
      longitudinal study on 40 subjects at approximately 4 weeks and 4 months of age. The Gentle
      Touch study will examine the effect of gentle positive stimuli applied to an infant's forearm
      on cortical responses at two time points within the first 4 months of life.
