      limited. Moreover, data on the prevalence of an atopic phenotype within the adult, severe
      asthma population is scarce. Severe asthma management is a complex endeavour and a thorough
      and up to date understanding of the pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient
      population facilitates therapeutic decisions that effectively lead to disease control.

      The purpose of this observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study is to determine the
      prevalence of an eosinophilic phenotype of blood eosinophil count > 300 cells/mm3 among
      severe asthma patients followed at Brazilian sites specialized in the management of severe
      asthma. The prevalence of an atopic phenotype, asthma control, QoL and burden of disease will
      also be studied. It is expected that this study will contribute to the understanding of
      severe asthma in Brazil, ultimately helping to inform therapeutic decisions and addressing
      patients' needs.
