      complications of geriatric surgical patients, which could cause long-term social dysfunction,
      high mortality and increased medical cost. Currently, there is no efficient biomarker for
      POD/POCD, and it also remains largely unknown whether different anesthesia might lead to
      different incidence and severity of POD/POCD. The investigator's previous studies showed that
      thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL-T) measured by optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) was associated with POD/POCD; change of RNFL thickness (RNFL-C) in certain
      period correlated with cognitive deterioration. Thus, the investigators consider that RNFL
      might be a potential biomarker of POD/POCD. In the proposed large-scale longitudinal studies,
      the investigators will clinically validate RNF-LT as pre-operative POD/POCD biomarker, and
      RNFL-C as post-operative biomarker of POD/POCD. Finally, the investigators will compare the
      effects of surgery (total hip/knee replacement) under general anesthesia with sevoflurane,
      propofol and desflurane on the incidence and severity of POD/POCD in patients. Results from
      the proposed studies will likely establish RNFL as a potential POD/POCD biomarker, promote
      the clinical utilization of OCT-RNFL in early screening and outcome prediction of POD/POCD,
      and finally optimize anesthesia care of geriatric surgical patients to avoid or reduce
      POD/POCD incidence. These findings will lead to better postoperative outcomes of geriatric
      patients.
