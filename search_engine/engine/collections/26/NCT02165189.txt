      medical research study), partially randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), and
      open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study to explore the safety and
      efficacy of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir. The study will consist of a screening period
      (Screening and Baseline), followed by randomization. First 33 non-cirrhotic participants will
      be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 into 1 of 3 treatment arms, and up to 12 cirrhotic
      participants will be enrolled and all will be assigned to Arm 3. All participants in
      treatment Arms 1 and 2 will return for treatment visits at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and
      post-treatment follow-up visits on Weeks 16 and 24. All participants in treatment Arm 3 will
      return for treatment visits at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, and post-treatment
      follow-up visits on Weeks 28 and 36. Participants will receive simeprevir plus sofosbuvir and
      RBV for a 12-week treatment period in Arm 1, simeprevir plus sofosbuvir without RBV for a
      12-week treatment period in Arm 2 and simeprevir plus sofosbuvir for a 24-week treatment
      period in Arm 3. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by SVR12. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
