      scan, and a chest x-ray. A PET scan may be done if thought necessary.

      Participants will receive the drug gemcitabine by vein along with radiation therapy on Days
      1, 8, 22, 29, 43, and 50. Radiation treatments will be given 5 days a week for 5 weeks. The
      gemcitabine and radiotherapy will be given on an outpatient basis. Chemotherapy and/or
      radiotherapy may be stopped if side effects become severe.

      About 4 to 6 weeks after the final dose of gemcitabine, surgery will be done to remove the
      tumor or to remove any previous surgical scar and leftover tumor.

      During the combined treatment, participants will be seen weekly by the doctor in charge of
      radiotherapy or by the study nurse. Blood tests will be done every week during treatment. A
      MRI scan and a chest x-ray will be done within 14 days before surgery. A PET scan will be
      done if thought necessary.

      After the surgery is done, participants will return to M. D. Anderson for follow-up visits
      every 4 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly from then
      on. An ultrasound and MRI scan (of the extremity or trunk) will be done 3 months after
      completion of all treatment. Ultrasound scans will be performed at each visit. A MRI scan
      will only be done again at later visits if needed.

      This is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is approved for use by the FDA. Its use
      together with radiation therapy in this study is experimental. About 36 individuals will take
      part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
