    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD4+/CD25+ cells that can be safely
           administered to patients undergoing HLA-identical sibling donor Peripheral Blood
           Progenitor Cell (PBPC) transplantation.

        -  To determine whether CD4+ and CD25+ cells can be safely administered to patients with
           high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing HLA-identical sibling donor PBPC
           transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD),
           chronic GVHD, relapse, and survival after administration of CD4+ and CD25+ regulatory T
           cells in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD4+ and CD25+ donor regulatory T cells followed
      by a phase II study. All patients receive myeloablative preparative therapy and GVHD
      prophylaxis as per University of Minnesota protocol UMN-MT2001-02 or UMN-MT2001-10.

        -  First allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) infusion: Patients receive
           unmobilized, culture-expanded, CD4- and CD25-positive donor regulatory T cells IV over
           15-60 minutes at the assigned dose on day -2.

        -  Second allogeneic PBPC infusion: Patients undergo matched-sibling donor PBPC
           transplantation IV on day 0.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to commencement of preparative therapy and
      then at day 100, 6 months, and 1 year after PBPC transplantation. Samples are analyzed for
      immune reconstitution by immunophenotyping and functional analyses.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
