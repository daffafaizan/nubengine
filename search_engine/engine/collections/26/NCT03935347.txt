      I. To evaluate the efficacy of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes LN-145 (LN-145) in
      combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced transitional cell bladder cancer
      (TCC) using the objective response rate (ORR) and the duration of response (DoR), using the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST version [v] 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of LN-145 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with TCC
      based on the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the safety of LN-145 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with TCC
      based on the adverse event (AE) profile per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
      version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0).
