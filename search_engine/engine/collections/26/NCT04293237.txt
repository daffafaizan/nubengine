      assessments will be performed in the afternoon (after the daily rehabilitation program). The
      patients who will be able to perform the 5TSTS will perform that test first. If those
      patients will bill able to stand up within 30 seconds on each of the five trials, the 30SSTS
      will be performed next; otherwise, the number of times that the patient was able to complete
      the transition to the standing position will be recorded and taken as the 30SSTS result.
      Repetition of the outcome measurements will not serve to simply use the differences as the
      actual outcomes, but will serve to assess floor effect (the percentage of patients attaining
      the minimum possible score) on each occasion, to assess repeatability (intra-class
      correlation between the measurements on two consecutive days), minimal detectable change
      (calculated from the standard error of measurement, which will be estimated from the
      correlation between the measurements at the start and after two weeks) and effect size
      (difference between the mean measurements at the start and after two weeks, divided by the
      standard deviation at the start). In addition, the repeated measurements will be used to
      assess concurrent validity in terms of the correlation between the sit-to-stand tests and the
      walking tests on two occasions (at the start and after two weeks).
