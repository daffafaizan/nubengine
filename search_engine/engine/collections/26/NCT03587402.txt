    
      Pelvic floor muscle training is the most common non-invasive intervention for urinary
      incontinence secondary to radical prostatectomy. Perineal stimulation has a significant
      positive impact on the early recovery of urinary continence after this intervention.

      The perineal stimulation can be applied with surface electrodes or with an intra-cavitary
      probe placed in the anus. The two techniques are commonly used. Each techniques stimulates
      different anatomical points of perineum, and it is a question if both have the same
      effectiveness or, one of the two techniques has greater effect than the other.
