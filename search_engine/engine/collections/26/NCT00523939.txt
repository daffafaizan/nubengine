    
      DepoCyt is a sustained-release formulation of the chemotherapy drug, cytarabine (Ara-C),
      which is used for the treatment of patients with lymphomatous or leukemic meningitis, a
      complication of lymphoma/leukemia that is characterized by the spread of cancer to the
      central nervous system.

      DepoCyt is introduced into the spinal fluid, through a needle inserted into the spinal canal
      or through a reservoir placed under the scalp by a neurosurgeon. DepoCyt will be given every
      two weeks i.e. week 1 and week 3 initially. After the second dose, a lumbar puncture will be
      done to check the spinal fluid for cancer cells. If there has been a good response, DepoCyt
      will be given every 14 days for 6 doses i.e., weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and then every 28
      days for six doses i.e., weeks 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, and 39. Blood tests and lumbar punctures
      will be done throughout the study.
