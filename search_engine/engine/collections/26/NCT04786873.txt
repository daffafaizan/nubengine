      The study will last for about 1 to 4 months, dependent on how close the visits are done. At
      the visits 2, 3, 4 and 5, the patient will get a stimulation test done and blood samples will
      be taken. At those 4 visits, the patient will have either to drink a macimorelin drink, take
      some clonidine tablets or get an arginine infusion. In total, the patient will get 2
      macimorelin, 1 clonidine and 1 arginine test done. The level of growth hormone (GH) will be
      measured 4 times during the clonidine and during the arginine test and 5 times during the
      macimorelin test. After the test, questions on the test tolerability will be captured from
      patients and parents. After the arginine test, a urine dipstick test is to be done by the
      patient at home.
