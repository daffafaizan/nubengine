      prolonged IV rehydration in the emergency department (ED). These children commonly receive a
      single IV bolus of normal saline followed by the administration of a hypotonic solution at a
      maintenance rate.

      The mean time spent in the ED by children receiving IV rehydration is significantly longer
      than the mean time required to treat all other conditions. ED overcrowding has been
      associated with poor outcomes, prolonged pain and suffering, and dissatisfaction. One of the
      solutions proposed in the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on ED overcrowding
      is that hospitals should strive to improve the efficiency of the care provided. One small
      step in this direction may be to improve our management of gastroenteritis and dehydration.
