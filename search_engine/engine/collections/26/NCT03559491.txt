      vein occlusion. The etiological factors of this complication are under investigation, from
      inflammatory cytokines to the breakdown of vascular barrier with increased permeability and
      diffusion of angiogenic factors. Clinical research developed different drugs and therapeutic
      strategies to treat and control macular edema, to evaluate the correct timetable and to reach
      long-term clinical significative results. At now, different experiences have been published
      with available drugs, from steroids to anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor. A debate
      still remains about the correct approach, the correct combination of drugs (if necessary) and
      the correct evaluation of drug effectiveness.

      In our study, we will evaluate extensive functional recovery and its relation to macular
      thickness after steroid injection. Considering that visual acuity reflects only foveal
      function, it may not be sufficient to evaluate the overall function on the macular area. We
      introduce microperimetry study as a valuable and reproducible tool to create a functional
      mapping of the entire macula.
