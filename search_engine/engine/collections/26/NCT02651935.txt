      weaning of these patients, duration of mechanical ventilation can be relatively longer when
      compared with other ICU patients. Automated systems show promising results in shortening the
      weaning time in some patient groups. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      Intellivent-ASV with Quickwean function on the total duration of invasive mechanical
      ventilation as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are success rate and duration of
      weaning, ventilator free days at day 28 and intubation free days at day 28 (including NIV)
      when compared to conventional ventilation with t-piece weaning.
