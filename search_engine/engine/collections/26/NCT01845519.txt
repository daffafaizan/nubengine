      to negatively impact both morbidity and mortality, and is especially pronounced among cancer
      survivors. Self-directed interventions targeting inactivity among breast cancer survivors
      often report clinically insignificant behavior change. More successful behavior change
      interventions have suggested that tailoring and, more recently, the fostering of intrinsic
      motivation, may have improved outcomes. However, no interventions to date have utilized these
      approaches to increase physical activity among sedentary cancer survivors.

      AIM 1: Develop and test intervention (tailored) and comparison group (targeted) messages in a
      sample of sedentary women to determine message acceptability.

      AIM 2: Determine the efficacy of a 12-week tailored intervention to increase the number of
      weekly steps taken among sedentary post-treatment breast cancer survivors compared to a
      12-week, targeted intervention.
