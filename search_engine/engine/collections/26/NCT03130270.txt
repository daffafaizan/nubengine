      radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Cisplatin/Docetaxel/5-Fu) and second-line therapy with
      chemotherapy has been given, patients still locally recurrence and distant metastasis. There
      is no standard treatment recommendation for locally recurrent or metastatic NPC who failed to
      second-line therapy. Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced
      gastric cancer. Several phase III studies of liver cancer, non small cell lung cancer and
      other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxicities and better tolerance. However, the
      clinical application of apatinib in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still lack of evidence-based
      medicine. And this trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in
      locally recurrent or metastatic NPC.
