    
      The study is a sub-study of RELIEF - A Global Registry to Evaluate Long-Term Effectiveness of
      Neurostimulation Therapy for Pain (NCT01719055). The treatment will consist of permanent
      implant of a Precision Spectra™ SCS IPG with either a 32 contact CoverEdge™ Surgical Lead or
      with more than 2 percutaneous leads after a successful trial. Programming features and lead
      options of the Precision Spectra™ SCS System will be evaluated up to 3 months post-IPG
      activation. Following completion of the 3 month visit, subjects will continue to be followed
      for up to 36 months per the study requirements of the RELIEF Registry.
