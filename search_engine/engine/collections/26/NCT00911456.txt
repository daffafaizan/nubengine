      workstation by one of the study radiation therapists. Contouring will be performed using
      previously defined contouring guidelines. Available automatic contouring tools, including the
      'interpolate' contouring function, may be utilized and contouring times will be recorded.

      IGRT Assessment The patient will be set up on the breast board in treatment position. The
      'ultra path' component of the Clarity system, which displays the path of the previous US
      acquired at CT simulation, will be used to guide the acquisition of US2. Although performed
      in the simulator room, the Clarity system will be used in 'treatment mode' thus simulating
      Clarity as it is used for IGRT. The study RT will first acquire the US2 scan. All steps
      following the acquisition of US2 will be performed off-line on the RM workstation without the
      need for further simulator or patient time.
