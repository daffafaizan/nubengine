    
      This is a randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of a behavioral activation intervention
      to smoking cessation and to post-cessation weight gain (BAS+) plus transdermal nicotine (TN)
      compared to standard smoking cessation counseling (SC) plus TN in treatment-seeking smokers.
      After completing an Intake Visit (~week -3), eligible smokers will be randomized (stratified
      by nicotine dependence, BMI and gender) to participate in 8 individual sessions of BAS+ or SC
      over a 10-week treatment period with two sessions prior to the target quit date (weeks -2,
      -1) and six sessions post-target quit date (TQD [week 0] and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8).
      Standard, 8-week; open-label TN will begin on the TQD. Moderators will be assessed
      pre-treatment. Mediating mechanisms will be assessed before, during, and at the end of
      treatment (EOT, week 8). Smoking will be assessed by self-report and biochemically confirmed
      (Carbon Monoxide [CO] < 5) at all in-center visits after quitting, at EOT (week 8), and at
      the 12- and 26-week follow-ups. Weight will be assessed at these same time points. Food
      intake will be measured by three consecutive days of 24-hour food recalls at Baseline [week
      -2] and 4-, 8-, and 12- and 26-weeks post-TQD. Smoking cessation and post-cessation weight
      gain (PCWG) are the primary outcomes and food intake is a secondary outcome at 26-weeks
      post-TQD. Consistent with intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the investigators will measure
      smoking cessation and weight gain in the full sample at the 26-week follow-up, evaluating a
      smoking status by treatment interaction for the PCWG analysis.
