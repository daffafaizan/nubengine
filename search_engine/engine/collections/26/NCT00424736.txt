      injuries in adult patients with multitrauma. Therefore, the management of patients with a
      normal clinical examination after blunt trauma is a subject of controversy. Since 1970s,
      computer tomography (CT) has become the mainstay of evaluating hemodynamically stable trauma
      patients. It's generally accepted that hemodynamically stable patient with abnormal abdominal
      examination results require the use of CT as well as patients with depressed level of
      consciousness. Controversy exists with the awake, clinically evaluable patients with no
      obvious signs of abdominal and chest trauma. In the last years number of studies express CT
      role in evaluation of asymptomatic trauma patient with mechanism of injury supporting
      probability of internal organs injury. Those studies show that in a large number of patients
      the management was changed according to CT results. The authors recommended liberal use of CT
      in trauma patient population. All those studies have been performed in adult trauma patients.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of whole body imaging in pediatric patients
      with suspicious mechanism of injury, which are hemodynamically stable and has no obvious
      signs of chest and abdominal injury. The incidence of injury in these patient population as
      well as changes in treatment based on results of CT will be examined. Methods The prospective
      observational study will be performed in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center. All patients up to 15
      years old with blunt mechanism of multisystem trauma will be eligible for enrollment to the
      study. Only patients whose parents singed the inform consent will be enrolled.Inclusion
      criteria will be based on the mechanism of injury: 1. no visible injury of chest and
      abdomen2. hemodynamically stable3. normal abdominal examination in neurologically intact
      patient or unevaluable abdominal examination in patients with depressed level of
      consciousness. 4. significant mechanism of injury as any of the following a. high speed (more
      than 55km/hr) motor vehicle accident b. fall of greater than 3 meters c. automobile hitting
      pedestrian d. assaulted with depressed level of consciousness All patients will undergo CT of
      the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis as a part of their evaluation. CT scan will be performed
      in Emergency Department short after patient's admission and clinical evaluation. An abnormal
      CT will be defined as exhibiting any traumatic abnormality. Patient treatment plan changes
      will be defined as alteration in management based directly on CT findings.Data regarding
      patient demographics, mechanism of injury, physical examination findings, Glasgow Coma Score
      on emergency department admission, Injury Severity Score, radiologic interpretation of chest
      and pelvic roentgenograms, injuries required operative procedures, laboratory data, CT scan
      findings, and changes in management plan based on CT findings will be recorded.
