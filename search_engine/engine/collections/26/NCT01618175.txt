      in southern Israel.

      Methods: A prospective intervention study examining the safety and health expenditures in
      infants with AB treated first in hospital but then discharged earlier with home oxygen while
      monitored in the community.

      Contribution to the focus areas, and the impact of results on health policy planning: 1)
      Reducing hospitalization days and general financial savings. 2) Ability to implement these
      findings to populations with variable socio-economic backgrounds. 3) Prevention of nosocomial
      infections related morbidity.

      Innovation and uniqueness in the study: test of this hypothesis precisely in our region,
      where populations have different socio-economic backgrounds, will build a model that may be
      suitable for all levels of society.
