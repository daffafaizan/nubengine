      incentives to motivate medication adherence among high-risk HIV positive patients. By
      partnering with the Drexel Partnership Comprehensive Care Clinic at Drexel University, the
      investigators will be able to identify such patients using clinic patient data, use clinic
      and physician communication channels to enroll them, and maintain high levels of ongoing
      participation through the use of incentives. The aim is to improve antiretroviral medication
      adherence among high-risk HIV positive patients by providing patients with a AdhereTech
      device (electronic pill bottle), daily adherence notifications tracked by the Way to Health
      platform, as well as daily lotteries and financial incentives. Upon completion, this study
      will answer questions important to the feasibility of conducting well-powered randomized
      controlled trials to improve adherence among HIV patients within the U.S. who have
      sub-optimal adherence.
