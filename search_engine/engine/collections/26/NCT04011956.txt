      changes in the following-up duration after surgery, so does in the blood pressure and heart
      function. Risk factors associated with complications and prognosis are investigated and
      analyzed. Identification of novel biomarkers is needed to help predicting the prognosis, such
      as the left ventricle anti-remodeling, heart function and blood pressure improvement, as well
      as the exercise tolerance post-operation. The findings of this study will help the
      investigators developping new tests to monitor affected patients and optimize the operation
      as well as the follow-up procedure.
