    
      This study has three cohorts: a prospective cohort of patients with high-risk extracranial
      solid tumor, a prospective cohort of patients with recurrent solid tumors (any histology) in
      second complete remission, and a historical control cohort of patients matched on diagnosis,
      age, metastatic site, and date of diagnosis. The matched historical controls will be obtained
      from the same treating institution as the corresponding case to account for institutional
      differences in treatment and supportive care.

      Primary objective of the study is to improve the 2-year progression-free survival in children
      with high-risk solid tumors who are administered a maintenance regimen with continuous
      sirolimus administered on a backbone of metronomic chemotherapy following the completion of
      "standard" therapy, as compared to high-risk solid tumor patients treated with observation
      alone following completion of "standard" therapy.
