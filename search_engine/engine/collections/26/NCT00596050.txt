      procedural sedation but few to no prospective clinical trials. None have compared etomidate
      to ketamine, currently the most commonly used sedative in the emergency department for
      pediatric procedural sedation. The investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial
      comparing etomidate versus ketamine for procedural sedation for fracture reduction for
      children presenting with extremity fracture requiring sedation for reduction. The
      investigators hypothesize that etomidate in combination with fentanyl will have similar
      reduction of distress and procedural recall as ketamine in combination with midazolam.
