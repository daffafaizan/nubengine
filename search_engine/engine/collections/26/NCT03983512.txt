    
      The PULSTA TPV is a self-expandable valve with flared-ends to adapt to the larger native
      right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and is using a relatively low profile delivery
      catheter from knitted nitinol wire backbone and trileaflets made from treated porcine
      pericardial tissue, and a delivery system, which provides access to the right ventricular
      outflow tract through blood vessels. Consecutive subject data should be collected at
      discharge, 1, 6 months, and 1-5 years post PULSTA TPV implantation.
