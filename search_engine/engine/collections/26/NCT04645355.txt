      plaque psoriasis. Given the potential role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of guttate psoriasis,
      guselkumab may be an effective option to treat the initial manifestation of guttate
      psoriasis. This is a two-arm open-label study to evaluate the clinical and immunogenetic
      responses of patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis to treatment with guselkumab. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess how treatment with guselkumab changes the immune
      milieu of the skin in patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis. The secondary objectives of
      this study are to assess how treatment with guselkumab affects the quality of life and extent
      of skin disease in patients with plaque or guttate psoriasis.
