    
      Knee osteoarthritis is a very common disease with significant functional consequences.
      Surgical treatment is the ultimate treatment with the possibility of replacing only one
      compartment or the 3 joint compartments.

      Consequently, the pre-surgical imaging is essential to ensure that the 3 compartments are not
      compromised when a uni-compartmental prosthesis (PUC) is considered.

      The scintigraphy because of its good diagnostic performance seems to be interesting in this
      indication for the preoperative assessment of knee uni-compartmental prostheses to ensure the
      absence of degenerative lesion of the unoperated compartment.

      This study will evaluate the impact of bone scintigraphy on surgery and the potential
      correlation between scintigraphic and clinical data; study the pronostic impact of bone
      scintigraphy
