      into this open-label pilot study. The study was a 7-week intervention study using open-label
      gabapentin at bedtime with a scheduled dose titration from 100-mg for one week, followed by
      300-mg for 3 weeks, and then 600-mg for 3 weeks. The intervention study followed a 3-week
      screening period to establish a stable baseline for insomnia symptoms and VMS and to
      determine the safety of administering gabapentin in study participants. Tolerability and
      treatment response (insomnia symptoms, nighttime VMS) were assessed systematically at each
      study visit. The dose titration schedule was followed in all participants unless there are
      dose-limiting toxicities.
