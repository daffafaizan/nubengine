      Occasionally, radiation therapy may be utilized in localized recurrent disease with curative
      intent; however, most patients are not candidates for curative therapy secondary to
      disseminated disease, and thus are frequently treated with palliative chemotherapy. Initial
      experiences with chemotherapy in this clinical setting demonstrated cisplatin to be an active
      agent. Subsequent trials using combinations of cisplatin and ifosfamide or paclitaxel
      demonstrated higher response rates compared to cisplatin alone but did not demonstrate an
      improvement in overall survival. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that has been used
      in the management of cervical and ovarian cancer. Several phase II studies have demonstrated
      topotecan to be an active agent in cervical cancer. In an effort to ameliorate toxicity noted
      with 3-5 day dosing regimens of topotecan, investigators have evaluated weekly dosing of
      topotecan. Thus far, the toxicity of weekly topotecan dosing in cervical cancer has not been
      evaluated. In this study, topotecan will be given weekly at escalating dose levels starting
      at 2.0 mb/m2 with standard cisplatin at 50 mg/m2 every 21 days. This study will help to
      determine acceptable dosing for the combination of weekly topotecan and cisplatin in patients
      with persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage cervical cancer which can then be utilized in a
      cohort of patients with cervical cancer in a phase II study.
