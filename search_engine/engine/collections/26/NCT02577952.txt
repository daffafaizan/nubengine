    
      Lipodystrophy is a heterogeneous group of rare and inherited syndromes characterized by the
      complete or partial loss or absence of subcutaneous adipose tissue. People living with
      lipodystrophy lack the fat tissue required for normal metabolic function. To enhance
      knowledge of the underlying biology of these conditions and to institute effective clinical
      treatments, the Lipodystrophy community has developed a mechanism for individuals with any of
      the Lipodystrophy conditions to enroll in a Lipodystrophy registry called Lipodystrophy
      Connect. The objective of such a registry is to create a platform that connects all of the
      Lipodystrophy community, including persons with Lipodystrophy, family members, healthcare
      providers, researchers, drug companies, advocacy groups, federal research organizations, and
      regulators. A patient registry will provide the foundation for a resource to meet the current
      and future needs of the Lipodystrophy community as well as accelerate the rate of research
      and development of therapies that improve the quality of life of those with Lipodystrophy.
      Lipodystrophy Connect is an online survey tool that collects basic demographic information
      and health information from people with any rare form of Lipodystrophy.
