      ESUS diagnostic criteria in a single tertiary care stroke center (University Hospital,
      Athens, Greece). Moreover, baseline characteristics and outcome measures for all AIS patients
      are going to be recorded and further be classified, according to the Trial of Org 10172 in
      Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) and ESUS criteria. Healthy volunteers (colleagues, friends,
      relatives and others) will be included in the control group.

      In participants (patients and controls) the investigators plan to measure: a) perfused
      boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (range 5-25 micrometers), a
      marker inversely related with glycocalyx thickness, b) pulse wave velocity (PWV), central
      systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and augmentation index (AIx), c) LV Global Longitudinal strain
      (GLS), d) LA volume and strain using speckle-tracking strain imaging, e) Malondialdehyde
      (MDA), as an oxidative stress marker.
