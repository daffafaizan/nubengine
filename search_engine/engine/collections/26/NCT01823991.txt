    
      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of administration of the nutritional
      supplement and placebo in this patient population and performing cognitive function testing
      at baseline and post supplementation.

      This is a randomized, double-blind pilot study of COGNUTRIN vs. Placebo.

      Participants have an equal chance (like flipping a coin) of being in either of the study
      groups. Neither the participant nor the study doctor will be able to choose which study group
      the participant is in. Participants will not know and the study doctor will not know which
      study group the participants are in.
