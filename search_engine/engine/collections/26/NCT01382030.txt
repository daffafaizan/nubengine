      patients undergo initial curative resection, distant metastasis is a frequent event resulting
      in 5-year overall survival rates of only 50 - 60%. Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy has
      been applied to achieve pre-operative cytoreduction, assess chemosensitivity and to eliminate
      occult metastasis. The current protocol comprises for cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      ((EIA, etoposide 125 mg/m2 iv days 1 and 4, ifosfamide 1500 mg/m2 iv days 1 - 4, doxorubicin
      50 mg/m2 day 1, pegfilgrastim 6 mg sc day 5), local surgery and radiotherapy as well as
      further 4 cycles of adjuvant EIA. Treatment response is assessed by MRI and CT scans and
      FDG-PET in a subgroup of patients.
