      incorporated into the VA Comprehensive Mental Health Strategic Plan. Patients who cope with
      longer term depressive symptoms may benefit from these interventions.This study examines the
      effectiveness of a feasible, scalable mutual peer-support intervention for VA patients in
      depression treatment and will inform leaders who are considering implementing peer-support
      initiatives.

      In this study, each study participant (a veteran in treatment for depression) was matched
      with another participating veteran and the pairs were randomized to enhanced usual care or to
      the telephone based peer-support intervention (DIAL-UP). All study participants received
      usual care plus written materials outlining depression self-management strategies, behavioral
      activation, and recovery.

      DIAL-UP participants also received: a) a peer-support manual that outlined peer support
      principles and provided peer discussion topics and b) access to a specialized telephone
      platform that permited free calls to their partners, ready access to mental health staff for
      back-up and advice, and recorded tips on depression management. Patients were encouraged to
      call their partners at least once per week during the 6-month intervention period. Patient
      outcomes were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months following enrollment.
