      A large body of data has been collected over the years documenting that on the one hand,
      reduced sodium intake, increased physical activity, weight loss, and moderate alcohol
      ingestion (Comprehensive Intervention) have been associated with a modest reduction of both
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure in with high normal and Stage 1 hypertension. On the
      other hand, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study has shown that a diet
      rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and decreased saturated fat, total fat,
      and cholesterol (DASH intervention) reduced both diastolic and systolic blood pressure in
      similar baseline blood pressure groups.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A multicenter study to determine the BP-lowering effects of two multi-component lifestyle
      intervention programs compared with advice only. Eight hundred and ten men and women were
      randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: (A) advice only; (B) comprehensive
      lifestyle intervention, in which participants received an intensive behavioral intervention
      program to facilitate achieving current lifestyle recommendations for BP control (reduced
      salt intake, increased physical activity, reduced alcohol intake, and weight control or
      weight loss if needed); and (C) comprehensive lifestyle intervention plus the DASH diet, in
      which participants received a behavioral intervention program to promote the DASH dietary
      pattern in addition to the same lifestyle recommendations for BP control. Participants were
      followed for 18 months. The primary outcome variable was systolic blood pressure measured at
      six and 18 months after randomization. Other variables included diastolic blood pressure,
      dietary adherence, physical activity, and onset of hypertension over the 18 months of
      follow-up.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
