    
      This study primarily aims at comparing the sensitivity and specificity of overnight 5HIAA
      value, 24-hour 5HIAA value and plasma 5HIAA value, in patients with small-intestine
      neuroendocrine tumors. Secondary objectives include the correlation of 5HIAA values with
      chromogranin A, carcinoid syndrome and tumor burden and the evaluation of the compliance to
      the diet and its correlation with 5HIAA values.

      The study group will include patients with proven neuroendocrine tumors of various stages and
      functioning syndrome profile. A control group will be constituted with subjects having
      irritable bowel syndrome, in which a neuroendocrine tumor is ruled out. After providing
      informed consent, patients fitting with inclusion criteria will be included in the study.
      Patients will have to follow a specific diet, and interrupt/avoid certain medication, during
      the 2 days before and the 2 days during the sampling period. Whole urine samples will be
      collected during 2 consecutive days, in 4 parts (day1, night 1, day 2, night 2). Blood
      samples will be collected at the morning of days 2 and 3. Observance with diet and drug
      restriction will be evaluated at the morning of day 3.
