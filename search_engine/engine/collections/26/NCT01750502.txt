      several cell types,including monocytes/macrophages, vascular smooth muscle and
      cardiomyocytes, and is released on stimulation from pre-formed storage pools. A foreign study
      reported that MIF had demonstrated to offer protection from I/R-injury by activating
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibiting c-Jun Nterminal kinase
      (JNK)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In addition, animal experiments showed that MIF
      was reduced in aged heart compared with young heart. Coronary heart disease is a chronic
      ischemic disease, in which MIF may play as a protective factor during the whole procedure.

      We observed individuals who will be taking coronary angiography during the hospitalization.
      Individuals will be assigned to coronary-artery-disease group, which included acute coronary
      syndromes and stable ischemic heart disease, or non-coronary-artery-disease group, according
      to coronary angiography. All participants will be extracted 3ml blood sample 5 minutes before
      coronary angiography. Coronary-artery-disease group will be taken another two blood samples,
      5 minutes after the opening of the balloon and 5 minutes after the stents have been
      implanted, respectively.
