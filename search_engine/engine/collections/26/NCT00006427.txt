      or more after amputation and have a 3 or more month history of pain to a daily dose of
      amitriptyline or a placebo for 6 weeks. Patients will receive a complete functional
      neurological examination by one of the study physicians or nurses masked to their treatment
      assignment. Study participants will also be interviewed by telephone to assess pain, pain
      interference with activities, physical and mental health, and number of health care visits
      for pain, at the beginning and end of the six-week trial and four months later.
