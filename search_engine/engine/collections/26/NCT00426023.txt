    
      Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a severe allergic disease, characterised by chronic
      ocular surface inflammation with seasonal relapses. Active phases of VKC require treatment
      with topical steroids to control inflammation and corneal damage that may lead to impairment
      of visual function and severe ocular discomfort. To date, safe and effective therapies in
      preventing relapses and controlling active phases of VKC are not available. Few controlled
      trials have used topical Cyclosporine A (CsA) for the treatment of VKC. The present
      multicenter, double-masked, randomised, controlled clinical trial will allow to obtain
      further data on the safety and efficacy of topical treatment with Cyclosporine in patients
      affected by VKC. Moreover, this study will evaluate the efficacy of topical CsA in both
      preventing the relapses of VKC and controlling the active phases of the disease. It is
      important to highlight that Cyclosporine eye drops are not currently commercially available
      in Italy and must be custom-made by specialized pharmacies. As VKC mostly affects young
      patients, it influences their daily life and their social interactions. Moreover, the severe
      signs and symptoms of the disease result in frequent ophthalmologic controls, influencing
      school activities of children and working days for their parents with a relevant economic
      cost for the National Health System.

      Comparisons: Efficacy of Cyclosporine A 0.05% eye-drops in preventing VKC relapses compared
      to standard antiallergic (Ketotifen fumarate 0.025% eye-drops) treatment, and efficacy of
      Cyclosporine A 0.1% eye-drops in controlling acute phases compared to antiinflammatory
      (Desametasone 0.15% eye drops) treatments.
