      pregnancy, is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Sleep-disordered breathing
      (SDB) is characterized by breathing pauses during sleep leading to recurrent arousals and
      intermittent hypoxia. The resulting increases in sympathetic drive, cortisol and inflammation
      have been shown to lead to glucose dysregulation. In that SDB is prevalent during pregnancy,
      SDB may represent a novel risk factor for GDM, as suggested by recent observational studies.
      No interventional studies evaluating the effects of SDB treatment on GDM outcomes have yet
      been published.

      General Objective: To perform a pilot study to assess the feasibility of conducting a
      randomized-controlled trial using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to evaluate the
      effects of SDB treatment on maternal-fetal outcomes in GDM.

      Primary Aim of Pilot Study: 1) To assess CPAP adherence in pregnant patients with GDM.
      Secondary Aims: 2) To assess recruitment and retention rates over ~2 months of treatment 3)
      To assess adequacy of nasal dilator strips as the control intervention 4) To measure maternal
      glucose levels to determine sample size calculations for a future large-scale multi-site
      randomized-controlled trial.
