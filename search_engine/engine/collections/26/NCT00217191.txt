      studies showed that Ibuprofen has significantly less side effects than Indomethacin that was
      used for this indication. However, experimental studies and few clinical observations
      suggested that side effects on renal function could occur in very premature infants.

      Purpose of the study:

        1. To evaluate renal function maturation within the first month of life in very premature
           infants.

        2. To determine whether a treatment with Ibuprofen for patent ductus arteriosus would alter
           renal function maturation at short term and up to 28 days of life.

      Population:

      At least 120 infants 27 to 31 weeks gestation will be studied. That number will allow to
      demonstrate a 30% difference in creatinine clearance on day 7 postnatally. Careful recording
      of mother and child history, and associated therapies prone to alter renal function should
      allow to improve the use of this treatment.
