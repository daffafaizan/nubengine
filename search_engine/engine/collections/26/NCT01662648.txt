    
      This is a single arm (one group of participants), multi-center, 6-month study to explore the
      tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone ER in participants with
      schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with an oral antipsychotic medication.
      Antipsychotic medications are drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a
      capacity to ameliorate thought disorders. Unsuccessfully treated means that, despite the
      participant was treated with an adequate dose of an appropriate oral antipsychotic for an
      adequate period of time, previous treatment is considered unsuccessful due to lack of
      efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance and/or other reasons. Throughout
      the study the investigators will adjust the dosage of each participant based on the
      individual needs. In general, the recommended paliperidone ER dose will be 6 milligram once
      daily. Participants can be either in- or outpatients and they may take their study drug with
      or without food. Participants who will complete this 6-month study and would like to continue
      will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase until paliperidone ER is available.
