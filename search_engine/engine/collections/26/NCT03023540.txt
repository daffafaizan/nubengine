      hydrochloride and D-sorbitol. The use of PXT3003 in a multicenter, randomised, placebo
      controlled phase II study (CLN-PXT3003-01) was well-tolerated and safe in patients with CMT1A
      for the three dose-levels investigated (Attarian et al., 2014). The intermediate and high
      dose of PXT3003 demonstrated an improvement of disability in this patient population.

      Subsequently a multicenter, randomised, placebo controlled phase III study (CLN-PXT3003-02)
      to assess the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 in the treatment of patients with CMT1A was
      initiated in December 2015. In March 2017 the first patients completed the 15-month treatment
      with PXT3003 and rolled over into the extension study CLN-PXT3003-03.

      During Period 1 (9 months), patients that were randomised to PXT3003 dose 1 or placebo in the
      primary study (CLN-PXT3003-02) continued in the extension study on PXT3003 dose 1 (5 mL).
      Patients randomised to PXT3003 dose 2 (5 mL) in the primary study (CLN-PXT3003-02) continued
      in the extension study on on PXT3003 dose 2 or PXT3003 twice dose 1 (2x5 mL). During Period
      2, all patients continue on twice dose 1 (2X5mL).
