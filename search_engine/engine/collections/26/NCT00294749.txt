      transrectal biopsy of the prostate.

      The majority of works points to the need of antibiotic prophylaxis previously to transrectal
      prostate biopsy. However, there is a lot of controversy and diversity of therapeutic schemes
      in the literature concerning the ideal drug to be used and the time employed for infectious
      prophylaxis.

      The objective of this randomised study was to assess 2 different schemes of antimicrobial
      prophylaxis, aiming to determine the difference in infective complications with a single dose
      of ciprofloxacin 2 hours before the procedure vs. ciprofloxacin for 3 days
