      independence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) Neurofeedback is a re-education technique that
      improves cerebral plasticity and motor gain in these people during the chronic phase of
      stroke. The visual feedback usually used tends to diminish the subject's attentional
      resources, while the proprioceptive feedbacks appear to be more effective on cortical
      excitability. Vibration feedback inducing movement illusion has been shown to be effective in
      healthy subjects, but has not been tested in people with stroke.
