    
      This is a double-blind, active-controlled study of the safety of IDEA-033 in comparison to
      oral naproxen for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee in
      patients who have completed Study 17-007 or who have discontinued Study 17-007 due to lack of
      efficacy. If a sufficient number of patients do not enroll from Study 17-007, patients with
      osteoarthritis of both knees who were not enrolled in Study 17-007 may be enrolled in this
      study. Patients treated with IDEA-033 in Study 17-007 will receive 100 mg per knee of
      ketoprofen gel twice daily and one placebo capsule twice daily for 52 weeks. Patients treated
      with oral naproxen or placebo in Study 17-007 will receive a 500 mg naproxen
      over-encapsulated tablet twice daily and placebo topical gel twice daily for 52 weeks.
      Patients who did not participate in Study 17-007 will be randomized to receive one of these
      two treatments. The primary outcomes of the study include the incidence and severity of
      adverse events, dermal-irritation scores, and changes in routine clinical laboratory tests
      and vital signs obtained at each visit.

      Patients assigned to IDEA-033 in Study 17-007 will topically apply 100 mg per knee of
      ketoprofen gel twice daily and take one oral placebo capsule twice daily for 52 weeks.
      Patients assigned to oral naproxen or placebo in Study 17-007 will take one 500 mg naproxen
      over-encapsulated tablet orally twice daily and apply placebo topical gel twice daily for 52
      weeks. Patients who did not participate in Study 17-007 will be randomized to receive one of
      these two treatments.
