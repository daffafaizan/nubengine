      use for a long time. Gemcitabine is a treatment that is an effective therapy currently
      available to patients with this type and stage of breast cancer. Frequently, in cancer
      therapy, combinations of drugs prove more effective as treatment than the same drugs used
      alone. The combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin has not been tested in patients with
      triple negative breast cancer. It is hoped that the addition of oxaliplatin may cause your
      tumor to stop growing or possible your tumor may shrink. This assessment will be basd on
      measuring changes in the size of your tumor.
