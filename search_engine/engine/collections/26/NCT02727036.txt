      oil on blood pressure has been observed in postmenopausal women. More than 1 in 3 female
      adults have some form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is affected by blood pressure.

      Pumpkin seed is a good source of phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens are compounds found in plants
      and are comparable to human estrogen, capable of producing estrogenic effects. Studies in
      post menopausal women have demonstrated that pumpkin seed oil, at a dose of 2g per day for 12
      weeks can decrease blood pressure and reduce menopausal symptoms.
