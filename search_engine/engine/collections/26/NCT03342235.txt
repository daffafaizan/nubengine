      treatment of anisometropic amblyopia in children who have failed conventional treatment. The
      primary analysis will be a treatment group comparison of the change in BCVA in the amblyopic
      eye at the 8-month primary outcome visit. For participants wearing a contact lens, the BCVA
      will be the visual acuity tested in the contact lens rather than in spectacles (or trial
      frames).
