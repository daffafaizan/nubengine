        -  Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer
           treated with irofulven.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or static disease after 4
      courses in the absence of clinical benefit.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9
      months.
