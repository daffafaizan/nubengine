    
      Specific Aims The purpose of the study is to perform a randomized controlled trial of women
      with PCOS, comparing the effectiveness of lifestyle management alone, and in combination with
      acupuncture or metformin treatment on whole body glucose homeostasis, with the ultimate goal
      to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.

      Primary aim

      1. To determine the clinical effectiveness of 4 months of 1) electroacupuncture + lifestyle
      management and 2) metformin + lifestyle management, compared to 3) lifestyle management only,
      for improvement of insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR, by the insulin response to
      glucose assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUCinsulin) during the oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT), and by glucose regulation (assessed by analyzing Hba1c levels).

      Secondary aims

        1. To evaluate changes in secondary metabolic measures, including fasting insulin,
           c-peptide, glucose, and adipokines, calculation of HOMA-B (i.e. the Islet Î²-cell
           function) and the c-peptide index, assessment of the adipokines and lipid profile, body
           size and proportions and body fat distribution.

        2. To determine changes in genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles related
           to insulin sensitivity in fat, muscle and endometrial tissue biopsies, and biomarkers in
           whole blood.

        3. To evaluate endocrine measures including menstrual pattern and ovulation frequency,
           circulating hormones (sex steroids, AMH, gonadotropins), and excretion of metabolites of
           sex steroids in urine.

        4. To determine changes in women's HRQoL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, dieting and
           eating patterns, and negative side-effects.

        5. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatments.
