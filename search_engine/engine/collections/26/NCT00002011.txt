      hours prior to each photopheresis session. The photopheresis instrument will separate the
      patient's white blood cells and some plasma from other blood components and return the
      majority of blood components to the patient. The separated white blood cells and plasma will
      be exposed to UVA (Ultraviolet A) light while outside the body. The UVA light photoactivates
      the 8-MOP drug which is now located in the DNA of the collected cells. After this exposure,
      the patients photoactivated white blood cells will be returned to the patient by venous
      access.
