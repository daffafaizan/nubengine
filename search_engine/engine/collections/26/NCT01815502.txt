      mortality rates in patients with single-ventricle heart disease (SV). However, SV patients
      still suffer from lower quality of life, decreased exercise capacity, worse
      neurodevelopmental outcomes and many other morbidities. While patients with SV circulation
      only make a small portion of all congenital heart diseases, 2-4 %, they require a great deal
      of resource utilization.

      Standard medical treatments for adult heart failure have not had the same success in the SV
      population. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have recently become a frequently used
      medication class in patients with SV heart disease to treat pulmonary hypertension, heart
      failure, as well as "Fontan" failure (i.e., plastic bronchitis and protein-losing
      enteropathy). While there have been findings of improved measures of exercise capacity and
      some reports of improved symptoms of heart failure, the physiologic mechanisms behind these
      findings are not completely understood. There have been reports, indicating that the
      phosphodiesterase five inhibitors improve ventricular function in biventricular circulation
      patients and animal models. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of acute PDE5
      inhibition on ventricular function in SV patients after the final palliative surgery, the
      Fontan procedure.
