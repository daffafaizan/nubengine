      construct and print 3D models of perianal fistula, however the clinical utility of these
      models in the outpatient setting and their impact on patient knowledge of disease have not
      yet been assessed. This study is aimed at understanding how the use of 3D printed models can
      influence patient understanding of disease and support them in making decisions regarding
      treatment.

      Participants attending routine outpatient appointments will have their fistula explained to
      them using either a standard explanation, or a 3D printed model of a fistula. They will
      complete a short series of questionnaires and their answers will be analysed to determine if
      there is any benefit of using 3D models in a clinical consultation.
