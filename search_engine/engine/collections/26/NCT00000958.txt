      existing viral strains can be suppressed and the asymptomatic period early in the infectious
      process can be prolonged. One potential way to do this is to boost HIV antigen-specific CD4
      responses, which may in turn increase the effectiveness of CD8 killing of HIV infected cells.

      Eight patients are entered in the pilot portion of the study, thirty patients are entered on
      Part A and fifteen patients are entered on Part B. In the pilot study, patients receive 30
      mcg Env 2-3 vaccine plus 0 - 10 mcg MTP-PE/MF59 adjuvant. Patients on Part A receive one of
      the following: MF59 emulsion only; 100 mcg MTP-PE/MF59 only; 30 mcg Env 2-3 with MF59
      emulsion only; or 30 mcg Env 2-3 vaccine with 100 mcg MTP-PE/MF59. Patients on Part B receive
      either 100 mcg MTP-PE/MF59 only or 30 mcg Env 2-3 vaccine plus 100 mcg MTP-PE/MF59. Treatment
      is administered on days 0, 28, and 112, and patients are followed for up to 10 months. Per
      amendment, patients may receive two additional doses of 30 mcg Env 2-3 or placebo in
      MTP-PE/MF59 at 7 and 10 months (Parts A and B) or 9 and 12 months (Pilot study) after their
      initial inoculation.
