      (PD-1) antibodies have shown high anti-tumor efficacy for patients with unresectable or
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). In this single-center cohort study, we are aiming
      to:

        1. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness in real-world patients, especially for Chinese
           patients most of whom were with hepatitis B virus infection.

        2. To predict clinical effectiveness with clinicopathological features, such as lab
           examinations (at baseline and dynamic changes), radiological features (radiomics study
           at the baseline);

        3. To predict clinical effectiveness with histologic features, such as PD-L1 expression,
           ctDNA, and peripheral immune cell subtypes.
