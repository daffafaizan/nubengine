      symptom onset. Alfimeprase acts to degrade fibrin directly and is inactivated locally by
      circulating alpha-2 macroglobulin. This study will determine whether treatment with
      alfimeprase facilitates rapid restoration of arterial blood flow with avoidance of
      symptomatic hemorrhagic conversion in subjects with AIS within 3 to 9 hours of symptom onset.
