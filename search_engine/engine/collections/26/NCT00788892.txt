      Phase IIB trial. Study enrollment duration is expected to be approximately 12-18 months. On
      entry, patients are randomized to receive either CPX-351 or standard induction treatment with
      cytarabine and daunorubicin("7 and 3" regimen).

      Patients are stratified to balance the likelihood of obtaining a CR and the duration of CR
      between the two arms.
