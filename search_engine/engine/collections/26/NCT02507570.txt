    
      This is an open label study designed to examine the effects of Enzalutamide with concurrent
      administration of Radium Ra 223 dichloride in castrate resistant (hormone-refractory)
      prostate cancer subjects with symptomatic bone metastasis, in both the pre- and post-
      chemotherapy setting.

      Radium Ra 223 dichloride is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this
      indication. Enzalutamide is US Food and Drug Administration approved for this indication.

      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled to obtain 30 evaluable subjects. All subjects will
      receive Radium Ra 223 dichloride every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses over 24 weeks and
      concurrent Enzalutamide for a minimum duration of 24 weeks. The sponsor will provide
      Enzalutamide after the End of Treatment visit until the last Long Term Follow Up visit has
      been completed. Subjects will continue to receive Enzalutamide as long as a positive response
      to therapy is demonstrated. Enzalutamide may be discontinued at any time per physician
      discretion.

      Subjects will be evaluated 30 days after the last dose of Radium Ra 223 dichloride. Including
      screening, the total duration of the study is 32 weeks plus every 3 month follow up visits
      while subjects are receiving Enzalutamide.
