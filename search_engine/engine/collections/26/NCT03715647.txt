      / postpartum women who developed complications of their clinical condition, needing support
      by invasive mechanical ventilation, development of sepsis with pulmonary repercussion,
      Specific Pregnancy Disease ( SDP), HELLP syndrome or ARDS were evaluated and monitored with
      Electrical Impedance Tomography for conduction of ventilatory therapy. In order to obtain the
      images and quantification of the regional ventilatory distribution, two tapes with 16
      electrodes were connected by means of an adhesive tape, one for each band, around the thorax
      and aligned in a plane corresponding to a cross section with emission of an electric current
      imperceptible and harmless to the patient, generating, according to the pulmonary dynamics, a
      variation of electrical impedance, consequently a gradient of electrical resistivity. A flow
      sensor positioned between the endotracheal tube and the "Y" of the ventilator circuit,
      responsible for capturing ventilatory mechanic information, and a reference cable positioned
      by an electrocardiographic monitoring electrode, in the abdominal region or in the region
      from the shoulders. The data were sent simultaneously to a system (computer) with specific
      softwear in order to measure and quantify the regional distribution of pulmonary ventilation
      and perfusion, as well as its correlation in patients under mechanical ventilation. All
      experimental values were presented as mean Â± standard deviation (SD). The study was of the
      experimental type, and the descriptive statistic was used to characterize the sample.
      Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0. The P value <0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. The results were placed in spreadsheets and graphs created with
      GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA).
