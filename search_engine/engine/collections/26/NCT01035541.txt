      that AKI is associated with different complications: higher mortality, renal replacement
      therapy and prolonged hospital stay resulting in higher health care costs.

      Until now just a few studies are published on prevention or therapy of AKI after major
      surgery. Most of these investigations are underpowered or show just marginal benefit. There
      are no studies published investigating the impact of goal-directed hemodynamic management on
      renal outcome following non-cardiac major surgery, even though hemodynamic stability seems to
      be of paramount importance for the kidneys.

      Aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a goal directed hemodynamic management on
      renal outcome after major non-cardiac surgery.

      Therefore patients will be randomized in one of two groups, the PiCCO group with goal
      directed hemodynamic management and the Control group, where PICCO data will be collected but
      will not influence hemodynamic management. In both groups the monitoring with transpulmonary
      thermodilution will be continued in the intensive care unit until 72 hours after surgery.
