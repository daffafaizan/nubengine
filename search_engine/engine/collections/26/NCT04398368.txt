      I. To determine the efficacy of a single intraoperative intravesical instillation of
      gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) at time of radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for
      clinically localized upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) in preventing intravesical
      recurrence of urothelial cancer (UC) at one year.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to recurrence for entire duration of follow-up. II. To assess the
      qualitative and quantitative toxicities.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To stratify intravesical UC recurrence free survival by tumor grade, neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, tumor stage, ureteral tumor location, and history of bladder cancer.

      II. To assess incidence and time to development of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravesically for at least 1 hour at the time of
      RNU.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24
      months.
