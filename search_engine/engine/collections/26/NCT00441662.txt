    
      BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy. Plaque
      radiation (brachytherapy) has emerged as the most common treatment in the current management
      of uveal melanoma, but is complicated by visual loss in close to 70% of patients at 10 years
      follow-up. Strategies for the prevention and early treatment of radiation retinopathy (and
      radiation maculopathy in particular) need to be developed to improve visual outcome following
      eye-conserving treatment of uveal melanoma. Triamcinolone, a long acting locally-administered
      corticosteroid, is of established benefit in macular oedema from other causes.

      PURPOSE: This study will evaluate the efficacy of sub-Tenon triamcinolone in the prevention
      of radiation maculopathy in patients undergoing plaque radiotherapy for uveal melanoma.

      DESIGN: A prospective randomised control study.

      STUDY POPULATION: 170 patients undergoing plaque radiation treatment for uveal melanoma.

      SETTING: Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, USA.

      INTERVENTION: Triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg in 1 cc) injected into the sub-Tenon space using
      sterile technique at the time of plaque radiotherapy and 4 and 8 months later.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, optical coherence tomographic (OCT) analysis of macular
      architecture and foveal thickness, at 4, 8, and 12 months following brachytherapy.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Pre-existing macular disease (e.g. age-related macular degeneration,
      diabetic maculopathy, vascular occlusion, macular hole); prior retinal detachment; media
      opacities precluding accurate OCT imaging; history of intraocular pressure elevation related
      to corticosteroid treatment -'steroid responder'; history of glaucoma.
