      after limb trauma. More than one third of the CRPS will continue to chronic disease including
      loss of function in one limb. Some reports implicate an autoimmune pathogenesis of CRPS.
      Especially the finding of autoantibodies against peripheral neurons and successful treatment
      in single cases provide evidence for a possible successful treatment of CRPS with intravenous
      immunoglobulins (IvIg). Therefore IvIg may be an important anti-inflammatory treatment to
      prevent severe chronification of CRPS. Since IvIg is mainly effective in B-cell-mediated
      autoimmune diseases, autoantibodies against autonomic neurons and the concentration of B-cell
      activating factors BAFF and APRIL will be measured in the course of the study.
