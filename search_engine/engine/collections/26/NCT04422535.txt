    
      Coronavirus infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-2 is characterized by a
      broad clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract
      disease and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many
      patients hospitalized with pneumonia. In addition, the infection can have a direct impact on
      cardiovascular disease including the development of arrhythmias, although the exact incidence
      is not known. Treatments administered for COVID-19 infection have the potential to produce
      adverse cardiovascular effects including prolongation of the QT interval and development of
      arrhythmias.

      Relevant clinical data that may affect the QT interval and specifically the medication the
      patient has received will be recorded. The specific treatment administered for COVID-19 will
      be recorded as the concomitant medication of the critical patient that may have an impact on
      the QT interval. Analytical data will also be collected on plasma levels of ions such as
      potassium, calcium and magnesium, blood gases, renal and hepatic function parameters and
      cardiac markers.
