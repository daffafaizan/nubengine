      in offering a full range of FP methods in the immediate post-pregnancy period in both the
      public and private sectors.

      Jhpiego will implement the study in two counties in Kenya; Meru and Kilifi, and two districts
      in Indonesia; Brebes and Batang.

      This study will employ a quasi-experimental design with an intervention and control group.
      Prior to study start-up, the the intervention group will receive a Jhpiego-designed package
      of interventions designed to advance post-pregnancy FP in both the public and private
      sectors. These interventions draw on WHO's Programming Strategies for Postpartum Family
      Planning, as well as Jhpiego's experience and assessments. After the study is completed, the
      control groups will receive the same intervention. For the study, a mixed method approach
      will be used; both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected through Client
      Quantitative Interviews, Client In-Depth interviews, Focus Group Discussions, Key Informant
      Interviews, and Facility Assessments.
