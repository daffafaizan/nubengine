      people, it is estimated that 77.8% of older adults suffer from it. Delivery of hearing aids
      to older adults with bilateral hearing loss is included in the Garantías Explícitas en Salud
      (GES) Guidelines of Chile. However, there are reports of adherence to the use of hearing aids
      of only to 40%. The GES guideline establishes the conducting of programs in audiological
      rehabilitation counseling, but there is no evidence that this is being developed in Chile.

      Objective: The objective of this project is to measure the effectiveness of a tele-educative
      intervention to improve adherence to the use of hearing aids.

      Material and Methods: A randomized controlled trial was performed. Demographic and
      audiometric variables were recorded. The active branch consists of the implementation of an
      educational program called Active Communication Education, consisting of 4 sessions with a
      trained rehabilitator. Participants will be also monitored by telephone headset use by
      personnel trained for three months. The control arm will consist of the usual care received
      by these patients. All participants will be assessed at home at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
      randomization. The primary outcome will assess adherence to the use of hearing aids.
      Secondarily related quality of life was assessed with hearing loss.

      Analysis Plan: Data will be analyzed mediantes bivariate tests, student t for normally
      distributed continuous variables, and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. A model of
      multilevel mixed effects will be drawn considering the repeated measurements of outcomes
      assessed. For all analysis is considered an alpha=5%.
