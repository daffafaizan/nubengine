           dosage (RP2D) of IMO-2055 given concomitantly with FOLFIRI and cetuximab is found the
           selected cohort will be expanded by an additional 6 to 9 patients (to a total of 12
           patients) for confirmation of the RP2D and combination treatment regimen.

        -  Part 2: A final cohort of 12 patients (Cohort 6) will be enrolled simultaneously to
           explore tolerability and pharmacodynamics in patients treated with the RP2D of IMO-2055
           in combination with FOLFIRI with cetuximab.
