      microdissection needle (CMN) (Stryker-Leibinger, Freiburg, Germany) and optimicro™
      microdissection needles. Colorado® microdissection needle (CMN) combine the advantages of
      scalpel and electrosurgery. CMN® was introduced into clinical practice in 1997, with a wide
      array of applications in the field of Ophthalmology, Neurosurgery, and others.

      The primary feature of the Colorado® microdissection needle is the ultra-sharp tungsten tip
      that delivers the wave-form from the electrosurgery generator to a very small spot. This
      allows the use of extremely low wattages, resulting in less tissue necrosis, precision
      cutting and cautery, and less post-operative pain. The instrument tip is a delicately
      machined, insulated tungsten diathermy needle that is compatible with any standard cautery
      hand piece. Tungsten, with its extremely high melting point (>3400°C) provides a heat
      resistant tip that maintains sharpness compared to stainless steel tips that dull rapidly.
