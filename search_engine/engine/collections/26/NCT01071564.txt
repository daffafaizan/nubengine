    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of continuous daily administration of 150 mg/day
      of GDC0449 (vismodegib) in combination with escalating doses of RO4929097
      (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) administered on a repeated
      schedule of days 1-3, 8-10 every 21 days (for a total of 6 days of RO4929097 administration
      per 21 day cycle) in patients with advanced breast cancer.

      II. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and identify the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for this administration schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenetics (PG) of GDC0449 and RO4929097,
      each alone and in combination.

      II. To attempt to evaluate select pharmacodynamic (PD) stem cell differentiation biomarkers
      in the hedgehog and notch signaling pathways (e.g. GLI family zinc finger [Gli]1/2/3, patched
      [Ptch] 1/2, hairy and enhancer of split 1, [Drosophila] [Hes1], huntingtin interacting
      protein 1 [Hip1], hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif 1 [Hey1], Notch4, Jagged1,
      numb homolog [Drosophila] [numb], BMI1 polycomb ring finger oncogene [Bmi-1], cluster of
      differentiation [CD]44/CD24, aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH] proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
      kinase [Src] family kinases) and the percentage of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) in serial
      breast tumor biopsies before and after GDC0449 or RO4929097 alone and after 1 cycle of
      treatment with the combination of GDC0449 and RO4929097.

      III. To determine tumor response in patients with measurable disease as assessed by the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

      IV. To perform molecular profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC populations before and after
      GDC0449 or RO4929097 alone and after 1 cycle of treatment with the combination of GDC0449 and
      RO4929097 at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097.

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) on
      day 1 or days -2, -1, and 1 of course 1 and days 1-3 and 8-10 of course 2 and all subsequent
      courses. Patients also receive vismodegib PO once daily (QD) beginning day 8 of course 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
