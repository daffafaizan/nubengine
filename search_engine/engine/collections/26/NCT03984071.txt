      elevation myocardial infarction. In-hospital adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was defined
      as: cardiac arrest, cardiac rupture, malignant arrhythmia, and cardiac death. All the
      patients were divided into 3 groups according to the patient's estimated glomerular
      filtration rate(eGFR) (eGFR≥90ml/min/1.73m2; 90ml/min/1.73m2>eGFR≥60ml/min/1.73m2;
      eGFR<60ml/min /1.73m2). COX regression analysis and K-M survival curves are used to calculate
      the correlation between eGFR and in-hospital MACE.
