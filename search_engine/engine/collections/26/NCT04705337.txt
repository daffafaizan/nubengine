    
      It is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 350 subjects will be
      included (in 12 or more medical centers) with severe HF, ejection fraction ≤35%, in New York
      Heart Association class III or IV. The other inclusion criteria concern: hospitalization for
      the HF decompensation in the last 3 months and a reduced six-minute walk test <350m or
      elevated NTproBNP ≥1000 pg / mL. To the European Society of Cardiology-guided, individually
      optimized medical therapy (OMT) the investigational product (IP) will be added. The subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of the study group: 175 to the levosimendan arm and 175 to
      the placebo arm. The intervention studied in LEIA-HF trial is the administration of
      levosimendan as a continuous iv. infusion, every 4 weeks for 48 weeks (12 infusions in
      total). All study participants will also continue OMT. In the second phase of the study,
      after completing the levosimendan / placebo infusions, another 6 visits are planned, still
      double-blind, every 4 weeks, to assess the safety of treatment discontinuation (with optional
      return to the infusions by the Investigator when additional criteria for HF decompensation
      are met).

      The efficacy of the treatment will be assessed after 52 weeks, 4 weeks after the last
      levosimendan / placebo administration.
