    
      Fifty-two final year students of Kocaeli University Medical School will participate to the
      study. The participants will complete the one-hour training lecture on the use of the
      Macintosh laryngoscope (ML) and the endotracheal tube introducer (ETI) that will be
      instructed by an emergency medicine specialist. The information section will be followed by a
      chance of practice each endotracheal intubation method once by using the ML with and without
      the ETI on the manikin.

      Mechanical compression device will be used to perform chest compressions. The manikin will be
      placed on an ambulance stretcher in a supine position. Airway interventions will be performed
      in a sitting position on a seat that will be adjusted to the same height with the ambulance
      seat. The airway kit will be placed beside the head of the manikin.

      Each participant will perform 2 airway interventions. Participants will be allowed for
      maximum 2 attempts for each method. Each procedure will be recorded to the video camera. The
      participants will be aware of the video camera. Following the interventions each participant
      will be asked to grade the difficulty of the both methods on a 5-point Likert scale defined
      as 1: very easy, 2: easy, 3: moderate, 4: difficult and 5: very difficult. The participants
      will be asked for whether they have prior clinical experience or not with ML or/and ML with
      ETI use.
