      the adult population. Persistent hypertension increases the risk of developing coronary heart
      disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure. Hypertension is a
      common diagnosis in primary health care and the societal costs of examination and treatment
      of hypertension and its consequences are considerable.

      The YHIP-study (The Impact of Yoga on Blood Pressure and Quality of Life in Patients With
      Hypertension), that investigated yoga as additional treatment for hypertension on primary
      care patients, showed that a short yoga program practiced daily at home had a blood pressure
      lowering effect as well as a positive effect on self-rated quality of life compared to
      control.

      Other previous studies have demonstrated positive effects of yoga on blood pressure, quality
      of life, subjective well-being and stress. However, these studies are relatively few and we
      need to further investigate the possibility of using yoga as a treatment in primary health
      care.

      If the yoga intervention shows to be effective, yoga exercises may be useful as a
      supplementary BP therapy in addition to medical treatment when prescribed by primary care
      physicians. It is to be hoped that patients will also experience a higher quality of life and
      less stress if they perform yoga on a regular basis.
