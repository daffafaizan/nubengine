    
      Design:

      Adaptive trial with two stages and interim analysis

        -  Stage 1: four arms; three dose groups and placebo. n=30/arm. (n=120)

        -  Interim analysis based on 120 subjects, with continued recruitment, adding 11 subjects
           to Stage 1 safety population (n=131): to evaluate safety and select dose for stage 2

        -  Stage 2: one dose group and placebo. N=85/arm. (n=170) Total n in the study: 301.

      Primary objectives

        -  To investigate the effect of recAP on renal function (measured creatinine clearance
           D1-D7 period, incidence and duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT) over 28 days,
           eGFR at D60 and D90) and related clinical parameters (ICU stay, Hospital stay,
           Mechanical ventilation over 28 days, SOFA and SAPS2 scores 28 days) in patients with
           SA-AKI.

        -  To determine effective therapeutic dose(s) of recAP.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of recAP in patients with SA AKI. (assessed
           by independent Data Monitoring Board, adverse events over 90 days study period,
           laboratory values, ECG, physical examniations, vital signs, Anti Drug Antibodies)

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of recAP in a subset of patients (part
           1, n=120) with SA AKI. (Population PK; AUC D1-7, Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, terminal T1/2)

        -  To investigate the immunogenic potential of recAP in patients with SA AKI. (anti-drug
           antibodies at D14, D28, D60 and D90)

        -  To investigate the effect on quality of life (using the EuroQol, EQ-5D) following study
           inclusion, at ICU discharge, and Day 90.

      Other objectives

      â€¢ To evaluate whether specific patient groups can be identified that benefit most from recAP
      treatment or patient groups that are non-responders
