      males sex, is often associated with insomnia. The presence of both sleep disorders generates
      a vicious circle that exacerbates the clinical picture, makes difficult to accept and adhere
      to CPAP therapy and increase cardiovascular risk. CBT-I is considered the best treatment for
      insomnia and recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of CBT-I also when insomnia is
      associated with OSA. After six month of treatment we will test the efficacy of web-based
      CBT-I in patients with OSA and insomnia in comparison to one session of psycho education on
      sleep, OSA, insomnia, the interaction among them and the influence on CPAP adherence.
