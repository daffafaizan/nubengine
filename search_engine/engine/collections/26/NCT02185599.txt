      disease yield, number of biopsies and treatment decisions. Study subjects will receive

      Prospective data will be collected at colposcopy examinations performed using the DySIS
      digital colposcope on consecutive patients that have been referred for colposcopy after a
      positive screening test. Retrospective data on colposcopy examinations performed using a
      standard colposcope will be collected from patient medical records, to capture standard
      practice to-date as a control for comparisons. The retrospective data will be collected from
      consecutive examinations performed by the providers participating in the prospective arm and
      for the preceding year.
