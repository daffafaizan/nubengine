      increasingly common for patients to take these potent acid suppressants on a long-term and
      continuous basis for erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and protection against
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related gastropathy. PPI therapy leads to elevated serum
      gastrin levels and may impair the absorption of calcium and food-bound vitamin B12.
      PPI-induced hypergastrinemia has a direct trophic effect on the parathyroid glands, leading
      to parathyroid hyperplasia, increased parathyroid hormone secretion and bone loss.
      Furthermore, both calcium malabsorption and vitamin B12 deficiency are associated with
      reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased osteoporotic fracture risk. Consistent with
      these data, recent studies revealed a positive association between PPI therapy and the risk
      of osteoporotic fractures. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) can provide a
      three-dimensional structural analysis of trabecular and cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD) and
      dimensions. These data are imperative for a valid assessment of the effect of chronic PPI
      therapy on bone strength. The investigators hypothesize that PPI therapy leads to decreased
      cortical and trabecular vBMD, cortical dimensions and bone strength.
