    
      POISE-2 is a multicentre, international, blinded, 2x2 factorial randomized controlled trial
      of acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA) and clonidine. The primary objective is to determine the
      impact of clonidine versus placebo and ASA versus placebo on the 30-day risk of all-cause
      mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with, or at risk of, atherosclerotic
      disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgery. Patients in the POISE-2 trial will be randomly
      assigned to one of four groups: ASA and Clonidine together, ASA and Clonidine placebo, ASA
      placebo and Clonidine, or a ASA placebo and Clonidine placebo. Research personnel will follow
      patients at 30 days post-randomization and 1 year post-randomization.
