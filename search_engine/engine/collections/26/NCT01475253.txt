    
      The study is conducted in 2 parts - a randomized, blinded part in which patients are randomly
      assigned to one of 3 possible arms (LiRIS® - contains lidocaine), LiRIS Placebo (LiRIS with
      inactive substance) or Sham(Insertion procedure only with neither LiRIS nor LiRIS Placebo),
      followed by an open extension part in which all patients are assigned to receive LiRIS® (with
      lidocaine). In part 1 of the study, treatment is managed in a double-blind manner for LiRIS®
      and LiRIS Placebo arms; and in a single-blind manner for the Sham arm (e.g.,the study doctor
      will know the treatment assignment for patients assigned to Sham).

      All patients who complete part 1 of the study have the option to enter the extension.
