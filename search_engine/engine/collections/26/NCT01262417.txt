      membrane.

      During and after the 2nd surgical procedure

        -  To evaluate abdominal and peri-hepatic adhesion (at the site of the 1st surgery), with

        -  To evaluate intestinal adhesion (in the small intestine), with quantitative description.

        -  To evaluate immediate complications (during surgery), early complications (during
           post-surgery hospitalization) and late complications (in the month following the
           intervention) in relation with operating procedure.

        -  To evaluate post-operative rehabilitation

        -  To assess tumour evolution in patients over a period of 3 years after the 2nd surgery.
