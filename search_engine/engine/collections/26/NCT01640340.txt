      I. The goal of this study is to evaluate the overall complete response rate (CR, no emesis
      and no use of rescue medication from 0 to 120 hours after chemotherapy) of two different
      antiemetic regimens (palonosetron + aprepitant + dexamethasone and ondansetron + aprepitant +
      dexamethasone) for patients undergoing the first cycle of highly emetogenic chemotherapy
      (HEC).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride intravenously (IV) 30 minutes prior to
      chemotherapy on day 1, aprepitant orally (PO) 60 minutes prior to chemotherapy on days 1-3,
      and dexamethasone PO 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy on days 1-4.

      ARM II: Patients receive ondansetron PO 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy on day 1 and
      aprepitant and dexamethasone as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 7 days.
