    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial
      intended for subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI) that are unsuitable for
      revascularization. The investigational treatment utilizes autologous concentrated bone marrow
      aspirate (cBMA) at the point of care. The bone marrow aspirate is obtained from the subject's
      hip, concentrated with a bone marrow concentration device, and delivered intramuscularly to
      the affected limb. Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to
      receive either the investigational treatment (cBMA) or a placebo control (sham treatment).
