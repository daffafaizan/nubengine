    
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, 3-period, crossover study of acalabrutinib
      suspension administered via NG tube in healthy subjects to evaluate the relative
      bioavailability and proton-pump inhibitor (rabeprazole) effect.

      The study is divided in 3 periods.

      Period 1 of the study is designed to investigate the effect of proton-pump inhibitor on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of acalabrutinib suspension. Period 2 and 3 of the study are designed
      to investigate the bioavailability of acalabrutinib suspension relative to an oral capsule
      formulation.
