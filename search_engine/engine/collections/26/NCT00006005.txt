        -  Determine the impact on survival and the antitumor effects of thalidomide in patients
           with sarcomas or carcinosarcoma (mixed mesodermal tumors) of gynecologic origin.

        -  Determine the safety and side effect profiles of the target dose of this treatment
           regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the antiangiogenic and immunologic effects of this treatment regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
