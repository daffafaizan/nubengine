    
      Primary objectives

      This Phase 3 study is conducted to evaluate lanifibranor in adults with NASH and liver
      fibrosis stage 2 or 3 and consists of 2 parts - Part 1 and Part 2, with the following primary
      objectives:

      Part 1 To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on NASH resolution and
      improvement of fibrosis assessed by liver histology.

      Part 2 To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on delaying NASH disease
      progression measured by a composite endpoint that includes progression to cirrhosis,
      liver-related clinical outcome events, or all-cause death.

      Secondary objectives

      Key secondary objectives of Part 1:

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on NASH resolution and no
           worsening of fibrosis

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on improvement of fibrosis with
           no worsening of NASH

      Other secondary objectives of both Part 1 and Part 2:

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on other key histological
           features of NASH

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on NASH resolution and
           improvement of fibrosis in diabetic patients

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on liver function tests

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on glycaemic parameters

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on lipid parameters

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on liver stiffness

        -  To assess the effect of lanifibranor compared to placebo on health-related quality of
           life

        -  To assess the long-term safety (up to 7 years) of lanifibranor

        -  To assess population PK modeling of lanifibranor using sparse sampling scheme
