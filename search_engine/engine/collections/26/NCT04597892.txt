      administration is indicated to assess whether a patient is at risk of contrast-induced acute
      kidney injury (AKI). For patients with reduced eGFR intravenous hydration can be offered
      before the scan to reduce the risk of AKI. If no recent eGFR measurement is available,
      contrast procedures could be cancelled and rescheduled while a creatinine test is processed
      in the laboratory. Using POC creatinine tests before contrast-enhanced procedures could
      minimise the risk of kidney injury, and may reduce the number of cancelled scans. The
      question is whether POC creatinine assay is accurate and beneficial in this setting compared
      to the standard laboratory assay.

      The i-STAT Alinity POC creatinine device is one of three devices which calculate estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) recommended in clinical practice guidelines to assess
      kidney function to guide decisions on the use of intravascular iodinated contrast in adults.
      In the study, i-STAT Alinity POC measurements of creatinine will be performed using already
      available blood samples of patients with estimated eGFR<30 ml/min/1.73m2 and mean difference
      between eGFR and serum creatinine measurements using POC and standard laboratory assays will
      be calculated. Results will be used to evaluate the agreement between of POC and laboratory
      assays on risk stratification (i.e., the percentage of patients with eGFR<30 according to
      both laboratory and POC assays) and post-contrast acute kidney injury (AKI; i.e., the
      percentage of patients with post-contrast acute kidney injury according to both laboratory
      and POC assays). Finally, the number of elective procedures which are delayed (including
      delayed planning) or cancelled because a serum creatinine assay is required and unavailable
      will be prospectively evaluated for Maastricht UMC+ in this study.
