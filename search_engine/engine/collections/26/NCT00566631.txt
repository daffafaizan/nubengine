    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm (getting
      one dose of medicine), multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study to evaluate
      tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexible daily doses of paliperidone ER in participants
      with acute schizophrenia. All participants will be given paliperidone ER once daily at a dose
      of 3, 6, 9, or 12 milligram (mg) tablets orally depending on Investigator's discretion, based
      on participant's clinical response and tolerability towards paliperidone ER. The duration of
      the core phase of the treatment will be 6 weeks and the participants who will complete this
      phase, respond well and would like to continue, will be eligible to be enrolled in an
      extension phase, which is no longer than 12 months. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by
      treatment response evaluated through total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
