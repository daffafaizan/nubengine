      assigned to one of two conditions (1) Naltrexone + Placebo; (2) Naltrexone + Memantine 20 mg
      bid. Long-acting, injectable form of naltrexone (Vivitrol) will be administered once per
      month (the total of three injections) while memantine or placebo will be taken daily. In
      addition, patients will receive twice weekly psychosocial intervention that will include
      motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention. The goal of
      psychosocial intervention is to improve compliance with medication and maintain abstinence. A
      double-blind trial will last twelve weeks with assessments at baseline and at each
      appointment three times per week. After the completion of a double-blind study (experimental
      phase), participants will continue open label treatment with Vivitrol and therapy for
      additional three months (study extension phase). Repeated assessments will also be completed
      one, two, and three months following the end of double-blind treatment. For the experimental
      phase of the study, the primary aim is to test the efficacy of memantine in reducing early
      attrition and improving outcome in opioid-dependent individuals maintained on naltrexone and
      primary outcome measures will be retention in treatment by the end of the study and heroin
      abstinence.
