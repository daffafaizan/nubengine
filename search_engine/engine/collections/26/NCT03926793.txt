      secondary objective for this trial is to evaluate the PK parameters of GB002. Exploratory
      objectives are to evaluate the PD readouts, change in WHO Group I functional class, and
      change in quality of life associated with GB002 treatment.

      In this Phase 1B study, two dose levels of GB002 will be tested in adult participants with
      PAH. Four participants in cohort 1 will be randomized to receive up to two daily doses of
      either active drug or placebo, with 3 subjects receiving GB002 and 1 subject receiving
      placebo. An additional 4 participants (3 active and 1 placebo) may be added to cohort 1 at
      the discretion of the Data Review Committee (DRC). The dose and dosing interval (i.e., once
      daily or twice daily) for the second cohort will be determined by review of the safety,
      tolerability, and drug levels in the blood from cohort 1. Cohort 2 participants will also be
      randomized such that 6 subjects receive GB002 and 2 subjects receive placebo.

      Eligible subjects who have completed the 2 week treatment period have the option to
      participate in a 24 week open label extension.
