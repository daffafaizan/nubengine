    
      This is a Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled evaluation of
      the analgesic efficacy and safety of WafermineTM alone and in combination with low-dose
      oxycodone in adult subjects who experience post-operative pain after undergoing primary
      unilateral bunionectomy. The study will randomise sufficient subjects to have 72 completed
      subjects at 1 site.

      Study subjects will receive multiple doses of study medication over a 14 hour period and will
      be asked to complete pain and relief assessments as well as tolerability questionnaires over
      a 24 hour period.
