      (slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) without change
      and were assigned to two groups. The first group (G1) received daily four mussel oil capsules
      (containing 800mg mussel oil and 800mg corn oil) for first two months and two mussel oil
      capsules per day thereafter. The second group (G2) received corn oil capsules (400mg corn oil
      per capsule) according to the same regimen. All patients were asked to keep a 7-day food
      diary before intervention and during wk 12. Dietary energy and nutrient intake of each
      subject during the preexperimental and study period were assessed from the dietary records by
      using "Diet Analysis" software (Cao Aihong, Taiyuan, China). All the enrolled patients
      visited Zhejiang Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital in the morning following an overnight fast at
      baseline and 3-month intervals, and underwent anthropometric measurements including height,
      body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, heart rate and blood pressure. Then
      clinical evaluations were performed during face-to-face interview by a professional attending
      doctor and ten milliliter of peripheral venous blood was drawn. Serum and erythrocyte samples
      were also promptly processed and frozen at -80â„ƒ until analysis.
