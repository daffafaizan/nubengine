      will be randomly put in the SMART plus routine care (RC) group and 40 to RC group only. At
      baseline and 3-month follow-ups, all subjects will complete questionnaires including Mobile
      App Rating Scale SMART feasibility and engagement. 1:1 in-depth interviews will be conducted
      at the two time points to cross-validate the findings obtained from the questionnaires. The
      questionnaires and in-depth interviews for APS subjects for the RC group seek to explore
      their preference and likelihood to use SMART given the opportunity. Examine Cognitive
      Function Change. In order to prepare for future large scale randomized clinical trials, the
      investigator will examine the effectiveness of SMART in improving working memory and
      attention of APS subjects. At baseline and 3-month follow-ups, all subjects will complete
      MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) subtests measuring working memory (Spatial Span)
      and attention (Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs). A between and within group
      design allows examining change of outcome variables over time and group differences. Enhance
      mHealth research capacity of SMHC at individual and organization levels.
