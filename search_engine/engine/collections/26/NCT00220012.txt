      The folate depletion study requires an 8-week run-in period. During this run-in period, all
      participants will eat an average folate diet with no high folate containing foods. There are
      two screening visits during this period where initial blood-work is done and participants
      undergo nutritional consultation. Following the 8-week run-in period, subjects in the folate
      depletion arm will be hospitalized for approximately 3 months at the Rockefeller University
      Hospital. You may leave the hospital during the day, but are required to return each evening.
      During this entire time, subjects are given a low folate diet. During the last month of the
      study, folate supplements are given to replace folate in the body. A follow-up visit is
      required approximately 1 month after the study period. Blood will be drawn every two weeks.
      Four sigmoidoscopies will be taken at approximately monthly intervals. A male is required to
      use an effective form of birth control throughout his participation in the study and for two
      months after the study ends.

      The folate supplementation study requires an 8-week run-in period. During this run-in period,
      all participants will eat an average folate diet with no high folate containing foods. There
      are two screening visits during this period where initial blood-work is done and participants
      undergo nutritional consultation. Following the 8-week run-in period, subjects in the folate
      supplementation arm will be given a folate supplement for 8 weeks. During this entire time,
      subjects will continue to eat an average folate diet with no high folate containing foods.
      Blood samples and colorectal mucosa samples obtained during a sigmoidoscopy will be taken 3
      times at 4 week intervals.
