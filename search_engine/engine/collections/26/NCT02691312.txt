      T1D for one year or more. Pediatric participants will be recruited at the Florida Diabetes
      Camps, the Children With Diabetes Friends for Life Orlando Conference, and the University of
      Florida Pediatric Endocrinology Clinics. The participants will be tested for diabetic
      retinopathy using a Digital Retinography System (DRS)
      (http://www.centervue.com/producta556.html?id=637). The DRS is a portable non-mydriatic
      fundus camera in which the participants places their chins on the chin-rest and the device
      takes a digital image of their eyes for evaluation by an ophthalmologist remotely. These
      photographs will be examined by an ophthalmologist (specializing in retinal disease) to
      assess for evidence of diabetic retinopathy.

      As part of their informed consent, all participants will be asked as part of their informed
      consent to allow study staff to contact their local ophthalmologist for their eye exam
      results following a positive or inconclusive portable retinal screening. Participants or
      their guardians will also be asked to fill out a study questionnaire during the screening
      visit. When available, the study subjects' medical record will be accessed to identify their
      BMI, time since T1D diagnosis, previous hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels over the last 12 months
      (or longer if available), insulin regimen, Tanner staging, serum lipids, urine
      microalbumin:creatinine, presence or absence of hypertension, and previous diagnoses of
      diabetic retinopathy, microalbuminuria, hyperlipidemia or hypertension.
