      restoring cardiovascular function. Corticosteroids and activated protein C have been both
      proposed for vascular tone improvement. While external cooling is largely used in ICU febrile
      patients, benefits and risks of fever treatment during sepsis have been rarely studied.
      Surveys show that external cooling is usual care applied by nurses themselves without medical
      order.

      The control of thermal balance might decrease cardiac output and oxygen consumption, and
      reduce serum lactate concentration. However some animal studies have suggested that fever
      might be essential for host defence. This trial compares two strategies of fever management
      on vasopressor dependence in septic shock patients. In the treatment group, external cooling
      is applied to normalize the body temperature between 36°5 C and 37°C, while control patients
      receive any fever treatment. The goal for mean arterial pressure is the same in the two
      groups and vasopressor withdrawal is determined by similar algorithm.
