      HCG, Day 24, Day 28, and/or Day 35.Aliquots of sera will be tested by commercial ELISA kits
      for concentrations of immune modulators suggestive to be predictive of IVF outcome, such as
      cytokines (interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon), neurotrophins (BDNF),
      protease inhibitors (HE4) and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP). The results
      will be correlated with IVF outcomes.
