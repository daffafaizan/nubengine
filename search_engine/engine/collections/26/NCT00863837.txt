      Group 1: Somatostatin 250μg slow bolus IV infusion followed by 250μg per hour (6mg/ 24 hours)
      or Terlipressin 2mg bolus was instituted on enrollment followed by 1mg per 6 hours for 5
      days. The use of either somatostatin or glypressin was at the discretion of doctors in
      charge. Group 2: Pantoloc 20 mg intravenously per day was instituted on enrollment and

      Definition of initial hemostasis:

      Initial hemostasis was defined as achieving a 24h bleeding-free period within the first 48h
      after treatment together with stable vital signs based on Baveno consensus criteria.

      Very early rebleeding was defined as: UGI bleeding occurred after initial hemostasis and
      within 5 days after enrollment. UGI bleeding was proven to be from esophageal varices.

      Treatment failure is defined as failure to control acute bleeding episodes or very early
      rebleeding.
