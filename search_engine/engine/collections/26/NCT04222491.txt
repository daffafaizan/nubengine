      participants with peanut allergy and their caregivers undergoing food oral immunotherapy
      (OIT) for peanut allergy. Food oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a treatment for individuals with a
      food allergy to reduce the body's allergic response to the food allergen, resulting in fewer
      symptoms. The treatment is also called desensitization. An individual becomes desensitized to
      the food allergen by ingesting small amounts of the food that are slowly increased. Over
      time, this helps the body's immune system become used to the food so that it no longer causes
      an allergic reaction. By desensitizing to peanut, it may lower the risk of life-threatening
      allergic reactions and cause a decreased sensitivity to peanut. The investigators
      specifically want to learn more about the effects of food OIT on quality of life and other
      outcomes important to participants with peanut allergy and their caregivers and to ultimately
      develop tests to predict who may respond favorably to food OIT.
