    
      The study will assess the safety and tolerability of technetium-99m-labeled
      ethylenedicysteine-deoxyglucose (99mTc-EC-DG).

      An outcome will be to develop an imaging protocol for a multicenter trial that will measure
      the specific imaging parameters required for determination of sensitivity and specificity of
      99mTc-EC-DG in a cardiovascular single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study
      compared to an exercise/regadenoson 99mTc- Sestamibi (MIBI) study for detection of the
      presence and, when available, severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) as documented by
      coronary angiography when available.

      This study will be a single-center, prospective, open-label study of up to 6 patients with
      positive findings from a MIBI (99mTc-sestamibi) exercise/regadenoson study within 30 days for
      evaluation of CAD. Patients who meet study eligibility criteria will undergo a 99mTc-EC-DG
      rest study and a 99mTc-EC-DG exercise/regadenoson study. When possible, patients enrolled
      will have clinical plans for a coronary angiography study to confirm presence and severity of
      CAD.

      This study will enroll up to 6 patients with a reversible perfusion defect indicative of CAD
      on a MIBI exercise/regadenoson study. These patients will undergo a 99mTc-EC-DG rest study
      and an exercise/regadenoson study.
