    
      The purpose of this study has three specific aims: (1) to determine the relationship between
      peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) results and clinicopathologic parameters of pancreatic
      cancers, (2) to identify the predictive value of PWC and postoperative drainage cytology on
      the peritoneal recurrence or outcomes, (3) to dissect the molecular mechanism of peritoneal
      recurrence, especially on the PWC-inducing peritoneal seeding process.
