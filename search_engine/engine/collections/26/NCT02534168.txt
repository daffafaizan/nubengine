      analysis when the intravenous catheter is sited. A member of the research team will manually
      transport an appropriately-labeled blood collection tube to the Department of Anesthesiology
      Perioperative Genomics Laboratory for storage and further preparation for genetic analysis.
      The samples will be stored until the investigators have enough to process. The results will
      be stored in a secure database. The surgical procedure, anesthesia technique, intraoperative
      analgesia treatment and initial postoperative analgesia treatment will be standardized.Upon
      arrival in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit(PACU), the child will be connected to standard
      monitors as per standard of care. Pain scores will be recorded on a scale of 0-10 (FLACC,
      Face, legs,activity, cry, consolability scale) scale. A member of the research team will
      apply the skin conductance (SC) monitor on the child's hand or foot.This will be used to
      measure SC values that will be saved on a laptop computer and the SC data will be analyzed
      off-line.
