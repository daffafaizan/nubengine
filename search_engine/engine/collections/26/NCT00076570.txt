    
      This protocol facilitates the development of methods for determining whether transplant
      recipients have developed immune hyporesponsiveness or tolerance towards their allograft.
      These methods will involve the study of peripheral blood or biopsy tissue obtained at regular
      intervals from patients receiving kidney or combined kidney-pancreas allografts at the NIH
      Clinical Center. In addition, patients that have previously received a kidney or combined
      kidney-pancreas allograft will be evaluated using assays requiring peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells and/or biopsies. Assays developed under this protocol will be used in
      subsequent protocols to assess the effects of immune modulating treatment regimens and may
      eventually be used to direct clinical care or guide the withdrawal of immunosuppressive
      agents. However, patients enrolled in this protocol will not have any change in treatment
      based solely on the assays developed without being enrolled in an additional study.
