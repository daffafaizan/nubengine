      questionnaire to identify possible contraindications for manual therapy treatment techniques
      and exclude individuals if necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of eight groups
      (three variables, each with two conditions including: therapist gender match/mismatch, lab
      coat worn/not worn, detailed explanation/colloquial conversation about the technique) and
      participate in neurodynamic testing for the upper quarter via the Upper Limb Provocation
      Test. Subjects who are determined to be positive for one or more extremities will receive a
      sham thoracic spine manipulation technique. After application of the technique, previously
      positive limbs will be retested. Individuals who respond favorably to the sham technique upon
      reassessment will participate in an exit interview with open-ended questions in attempt to
      gain more insight into the factors which may have influenced their neurodynamic mobility
      improvement.
