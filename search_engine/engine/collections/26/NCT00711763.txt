      cyclic basis for 3 days. The patients will then be crossed over to receive the other way of
      administration over the following 3 days, thus each patient will serve as his or her own
      control. Continuous TPN will be administered over 24 hours for 3 days, while the cyclic TPN
      will be given for 18 hours then followed by a Dextrose only solution at the same
      concentration and rate as the TPN for 6 hours. Trophic feeds up to 20 ml/kg/day will be
      allowed throughout the study period at the discretion of the attending neonatologist.
