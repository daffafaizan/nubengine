    
      Open label, phase III, randomised, multicentre study comparing early transplantation
      procedure with transplantation carried out to the same protocol but delayed by one year. The
      status of patients undergoing early HSCT will be evaluated after one year and compared to
      those about to undergo delayed HSCT

      Patients will be randomised to:

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell mobilisation followed, within 4 weeks, by high dose
           immunoablation and autologous stem cell transplantation

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell mobilisation followed, after 59 weeks, by high dose
           immunoablation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

      All patients will be mobilised prior to randomisation. Those receiving early transplantation
      will be compared over the first year with those whose transplant has been delayed.
