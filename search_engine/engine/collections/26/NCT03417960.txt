      novel TMS treatment protocol to treat depression in women with post-partum depression. It is
      known that TMS can effectively treat depression. The FDA approved protocol lasts 6 weeks and
      is not feasible for many women with post-partum depression. The investigators are
      investigating a 3 day treatment for depression which may be more acceptable for this
      population. The investigators further hope to characterize the ant-depressant effect of this
      protocol in order to design a larger trial.
