    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the immune response to cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) elicited
      by vaccination with CDX-1401 (anti-DEC205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein vaccine) plus
      polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose
      (poly-ICLC) is substantially increased by prior expansion in the number of circulating
      dendritic cells (DC) by therapy with CDX-301 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand [Flt3L])
      (recombinant flt3 ligand).

      II. To determine whether the proportion of responders to NY-ESO-1 is > 50% when T cell
      responses are elicited by vaccination with CDX-1401 plus poly-ICLC in combination with
      CDX-301 (Flt3L) 75 mcg/kg/day administered prior to vaccination for 5 days in both of the
      first two vaccine cycles; and for 5 days in the first vaccine cycle only.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on immune responses to other ongoing and
      nascent antitumor response antigens associated with melanoma (e.g., PRAME, MAGE-A3, p53, and
      gp100) as well as memory viral responses (influenza A) and chronic viral responses
      (cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]).

      II. To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on the frequency and phenotypic character of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets including DCs, monocyte populations, T
      cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

      III. To assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of the vaccine regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive recombinant flt3 ligand subcutaneously (SC) on days -7 to -1, 1-3,
      and 22-28 of course 1 and on days 1-3 of course 2 only; DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein
      CDX-1401 SC or intradermally (ID) on day 1; and poly-ICLC SC on days 1 and 2. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC as in Arm I.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive recombinant flt3 ligand SC on days -7 to -3 and 22-26 of course 1
      only and DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC as in Arm I. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM IV: Patients receive recombinant flt3 ligand SC on days -7 to -3 of course 1 only, and
      DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then
      annually thereafter.
