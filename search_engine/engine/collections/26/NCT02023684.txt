      comfort and early mobilisation as well as enable adequate respiratory effort.

      Early ambulation is thought to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis and
      respiratory complications. In contrast, early inadequate postoperative pain management can
      lead to hypoxemia, hypercarbia and atelectasis. However, the use of opioids for pain control
      is limited in bariatric surgery due to sedative effect which might worsen obstructive sleep
      apnoea (OSA), a common comorbidity amongst morbidly obese patients and opioid-sparing
      techniques might help avoid respiratory complications.

      Methods of regional analgesic are limited and might be challenging in the obese patient and
      although techniques such continuous epidural analgesia is possible it is not the common
      practise. The use of patient-controlled i.v. analgesia of opioids is limited owed to
      increased risk for hypoxemia and other practises such as routine local anaesthetic port site
      wound infiltration and systemic non-steroidal drugs are warranted.

      The benefit of intra-peritoneal irrigation with local anaesthetic for abdominal pain relief
      after laparoscopic procedures was established in few studies. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effect its' effect on postoperative pain relief and breathing parameters in
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.By pain score
