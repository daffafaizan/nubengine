      plastic stents. When compared to plastic stents, randomized trials have shown longer patency
      and fewer stent-related complications for CSEMS. The investigators hypothesize that placement
      of CSEMS would be a better treatment option for preoperative biliary decompression in
      patients with pancreatic cancer as there will be better drainage of the obstructed biliary
      system with fewer adverse events.
