      depression. Mean age, duration of HD, hemoglobin levels, serum ferritin levels, serum iron
      levels, TSAT, TIBC, serum albumin levels, CRP and energy consumption (kcal/week) were
      included in the model as multivariate variables. Backward stepwise logistic regression (ROC)
      analysis was performed.
