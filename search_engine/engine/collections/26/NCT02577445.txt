      developed a battery-powered implantable device that treats central sleep apnea. The device is
      used with a lead that delivers the stimulation therapy which causes the patient to breathe
      with a regular rhythm and an optional lead that senses breathing. This combination is called
      the remedē® system.

      The aim of this study is

        1. to collect data in order to get a better understanding of the characteristics and/or
           symptoms related to central sleep apnea

        2. to collect safety information of all patients diagnosed with central sleep apnea

        3. to obtain additional short and lang term information on the safety and performance of
           the remedē® system, including an evaluation if there's an impact on the quality of life
           of patients treated with the the remedē® system in daily practice.

      The information obtained from this study may provide better insight on the symptoms related
      to central sleep apnea, risk factors related to central sleep apnea therapy and use of the
      remedē® system which may help to treat other patients with potential sleep disordered
      breathing more appropriately.

      Approximately 300 patients (to be) implanted with the remedē® system will participate in this
      study at approximately 40 sites in Europe. For this purpose the investigators aim to screen
      approximately 1500 patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Also patients diagnosed with
      central sleep apnea, but not receiving the device will be followed through phone calls for 2
      years.
