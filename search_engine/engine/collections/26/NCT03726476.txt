      post-operative pain have contributed to the problem. This study seeks to explore the effects
      of changing pre-operative education & increasing patient input regarding post-operative
      receipt of opioids. The study will explore the effects that change in pre-operative education
      may have on post-operative opioid consumption juxtaposed upon return to physical activity
      using a randomized trial design. Women undergoing pelvic floor reconstructive surgery will be
      randomized to either (i) standard pre-operative education (ii) modified, patient-centered
      pre-operative education. The investigators will monitor both post-operative opioid
      consumption and return to physical activity. The investigators hypothesize that investigation
      of patient's post-operative pain experiences and their inclusion in the educational and the
      shared decision-making process will likely decrease post-operative narcotic use without
      affecting return to function. Our long-term goal is to develop a pragmatic and balanced
      approach to address pain concerns, decreasing the medical community's contribution to the
      opioid epidemic.
