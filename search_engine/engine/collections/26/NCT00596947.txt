      for more than 30 years. There are many side effects of corticosteroids including significant
      bone disease, diabetes (elevated blood sugar levels), fluid retention and hypertension (high
      blood pressure), psychosis, peptic ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia (elevated lipid levels such
      as cholesterol and triglycerides), obesity (overweight), acne, and susceptibility to
      infections. It is hoped that the new generation of potent immunosuppressive medications (such
      as Prograf and CellCept) will permit avoidance or withdrawal of corticosteroids for the
      majority of patients to avoid both short- and long-term complications of corticosteroid use
      in kidney transplant recipients.
