      vitamin A status in Ghanaian children who receive food supplements known as Sprinkles. The
      study assessed the vitamin A status and body pool size in children using a test known as the
      modified relative dose response test (MRDR) tests and stable 13C2 retinol as a tracer, among
      those who receive Sprinkles with or without vitamin A through home fortification of
      complementary foods.
