      cell transplantation (HCT) used for the treatment of cancers in some patients. GvHD can
      result from a lack of compatibility between the donor and recipient. Research suggests
      another primary cause of GvHD comes from cytokines, or a substance produced by cells of the
      immune system that affect the immune response in both positive and negative ways. Infliximab
      is an antibody that directly targets the cytokine associated with GvHD. This study is
      building upon previous research to assess infliximab's ability to prevent GvHD after HCT.

      Purpose: This study is evaluating the efficacy of infliximab in reducing the incidence of
      GvHD after HCT. The safety of this approach, along with changes to specific cytokines from
      this treatment, will also be measured.

      Treatment: Patients in this study will receive infliximab through intravenous infusion.
      Infliximab will be administered in six doses, including one day before chemotherapy or
      radiotherapy, after the stem cell infusion, and then on days 7, 14, 28 and 42. Standard
      post-transplant treatments of cyclosporine (Neoral) and methotrexate (Methotrexate) will also
      be given through intravenous infusion. Cyclosporine will be given on day 1, and the
      subsequent schedule will be determined on an individual basis. Methotrexate will be
      administered on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. Several tests and exams will be given throughout the
      study to closely monitor patients.
