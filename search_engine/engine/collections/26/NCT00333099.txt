      status, anti-infectious and anti-tumoral defenses and the response to the treatment (surgery,
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy). Treatment of these 2 types of cancer is often chemoradiotherapy
      which frequently induces mucositis. Mucositis enhances nutritional risk and could impose a
      modification or an interruption of the treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate if
      enteral immunonutrition of head and neck or esophageal cancer patients, using an arginine,
      omega 3 fatty acid, nucleotides-enhanced diet [Impact(R), Novartis] versus a standard enteral
      nutrition (control, Novartis), could improve clinical outcomes (mucositis frequency,
      treatment tolerance), nutritional and immune status, and life quality parameters.
