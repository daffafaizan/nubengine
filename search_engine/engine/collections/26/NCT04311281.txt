    
      The investigators will enroll approximately 180 participants with mild cognitive impairment
      (90 with suspected Alzheimer's Disease and 90 with suspected Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy
      with a history of head trauma).

      Participants will come to UCLA for 4 visits and will be called twice. The study duration is 2
      years.

      Participants will first complete an over the phone screening to assess their eligibility. If
      they pass the phone screen, then they will be invited to complete an in-person screen and
      will sign the informed consent form. They will then undergo a neurological evaluation, blood
      draw, and neuropsychological testing.

      Within a month of the screening visit, participants will complete the imaging visit.
      Participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, if eligible, and a PET
      scan with FDDNP. For participants who are unable to undergo an MRI due to contraindications,
      they will complete a CT scan.

      Participants will be monitored for possible adverse events following the procedures and will
      be called 24 hours later and 2 weeks later to assess for any potential adverse events.

      At the one and two-year follow-up visits, participants' medical history will be reviewed. At
      this time, they will also complete a neuropsychiatric evaluation, blood draw and
      neuropsychological testing.

      Prediction of clinical and cognitive decline from [F-18] FDDNP PET scan readers (blinded to
      clinical evaluations) and clinicians (blinded to [F-18]FDDNP PET scan results) will be
      compared with actual clinical outcomes determined at one and two-year follow-up visits.
