      I. To determine if Nplate (romiplostim) is capable of increasing platelet counts to > 50 x
      10^9/L for greater than 2 weeks in myeloma patients with chemotherapy induced
      thrombocytopenia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of romiplostim in this patient population by standard Common
      Toxicity Criteria (CTC).

      II. To determine any increase in thrombosis or marrow fibrosis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive romiplostim subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for up to 6 weeks. Patients
      achieving a platelet count > 50 x 10^9 then receive romiplostim once weekly during 1 course
      of chemotherapy and may continue for as long as benefit is seen.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
