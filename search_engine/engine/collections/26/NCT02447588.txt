      due to the limited range in which the capacitated sperm survive the female genital tract and
      oocytes can be fertilized after ovulation. For intrauterine insemination, the fraction of
      motile sperm is injected directly into the uterine cavity and later migrate into abdominal
      cavity, where they remain a few hours after insemination; meanwhile, fertilizable oocytes are
      only between 12-16 hours after ovulation. In the cycles in which follicular growth is
      monitored, a spontaneous LH surge before ovulation induction with HCG is a possibility;
      indeed, in stimulated cycles LH is not usually determined so clinicians are not able to know
      if there has been or not ovulation. Ovulation usually occurs 24 hours after the LH surge;
      therefore, an insemination performed 36 hours after ovulation induction may be too late in
      cases of premature ovulation.

      The influence of progesterone levels in stimulated cycles of intrauterine insemination is an
      aspect little studied; however, this information can be useful when synchronizing the time of
      insemination with the implantation window.

      The day of ovulation induction, the investigators will determine progesterone levels. If
      progesterone> 1 ng / ml the patient be randomized in one of the following groups:

        -  Group 1 (intrauterine insemination with sperm donor IAD at 36 hours post-hCG). Cases
           where the IAD is scheduled at 36 hours post-administration of hCG.

        -  Group 2 (IAD at 24 hours post-hCG). Cases where the IAD is scheduled at 24 hours
           post-administration of hCG.
