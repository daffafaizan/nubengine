      Skull x-rays are a useful tool in the evaluation of paediatric patients with a history of
      minor head trauma. However, there exists ongoing controversy regarding the ideal number of
      views that should be obtained in a skull series. This study aims to determine if there is a
      significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy of skull x-rays in the diagnosis of
      fracture in paediatric minor head trauma patients when a 2-film series as opposed to a 4-film
      series is provided to participating pediatric emergency physicians.

      This will be a prospective, crossover experimental study evaluating the equivalency in
      sensitivity and specificity of a 2-film series versus a 4-film series in the diagnosis of
      skull fracture associated with minor head injuries in children.

      The study will involve 10 pediatric emergency physicians who will evaluate two modules of 100
      series of radiography.

      In order to do so, he or she will be given two work modules. Each module will contain the
      randomized and anonymous x-rays of the same 50 cases and 50 controls mounted on power point
      slides. Among the 50 cases, the evaluation sequence will be randomized such that 25 cases
      will be evaluated with the 2-film series in the first module and the 4-film series in the
      second module while the other 25 cases will evaluated in the reverse order. The same
      procedure will be used for randomizing the evaluation sequence of the 50 controls.

      The primary outcomes will be the overall sensitivity and specificity of pediatric emergency
      medicine physicians for the detection of skull fractures using two evaluation methods: one in
      which they are presented with a skull series that has 2 views and another in which they are
      presented with a standard 4-view series.
