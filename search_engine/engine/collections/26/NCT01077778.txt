      contraindication to thoracic CT angiography, there is a need for an alternative diagnostic
      procedure. MRI has not been fully evaluated in this field; moreover, recent technological
      advances make it necessary to re-evaluate its performance for PE diagnosis.

      Design Prospective monocentric study

        -  Patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism will undergo thoracic
           magnetic resonance imaging if inclusion criteria are fulfilled.

        -  A non-inclusion register will be establish for patients fulfilling the inclusion
           criteria , not included because MRI was not available (off-hours presentation , another
           patients already included in the protocol on the same day )

      Estimated enrolment : 280 (based on a 25% prevalence of PE in our institution and an expected
      80% sensitivity of MRI) Study start date: June 2007 Estimated study completion date: 17
      months later (40 to 50 presentations for PE suspicion each month, 20 inclusions expected per
      month)

      Magnetic Resonance imaging: performed on a 1.5 Tesla unit with 3 different sequences

        -  Unenhanced Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) sequences

        -  Perfusion imaging following Gadolinium injection at a rate of 5 c/s and a dose of
           0.1mmol/kg

        -  Magnetic resonance angiography following an injection of 0.1mmol/kg of gadolinium at
           3ml/s MRI studies will be interpreted secondarily by 2 independent radiologists, blinded
           to CTA results and clinical probability.

      Two different readings will be performed, one global reading and one reading of each sequence
      separately, displayed in a random order (access base)

      Objectives

        -  to evaluate MRI performance for PE diagnosis globally

        -  to evaluate the diagnostic value for each sequence (especially the negative predictive
           value of a normal perfusion sequence)

        -  to evaluate inter-observer agreement

      MRI and CTA have to be performed within 24 hours
