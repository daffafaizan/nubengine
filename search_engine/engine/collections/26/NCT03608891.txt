    
      The study will be conducted on two groups:

      Intervention group: patient specific three-dimensional titanium plates CBCT or CT scan will
      be performed for the patient, the dicom files will be imported into a surgical planning
      software , plates will then be designed virtually and sent for three-dimensional (3D)
      printing.

      Control group: Conventional miniplates:

      In this group two miniplates of titanium Mini-System 2.0 mm will be used. The plate has
      profile height 1.0 mm whereas the screw length varies according to the site of the plate.
      According to Champy osteosynthesis lines for fixation of the posterior mandibular fracture
      ,the first plate will be placed at the inferior border from the buccal side, using bicortical
      screws engaging the buccal and lingual cortices to achieve rigid fixation, while the second
      plate will be placed at about 5mm superior to the inferior plate in the subapical region,
      using monocortical screws engaging only the buccal cortex to avoid injuring the teeth roots.
