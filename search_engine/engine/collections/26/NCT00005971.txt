        -  Assess the efficacy of flavopiridol in patients with previously untreated metastatic
           malignant melanoma.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Assess the time to progression, early progression rate, and response duration in these
           patients when treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 21 days
      for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, and then every 3 months until disease progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
