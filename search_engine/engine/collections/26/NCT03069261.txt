      fluorescence. It allows the surgeon a tool for intraoperatively assessment of tissue
      perfusion of the autologous flap, providing a basis for trimming of hypo perfused areas. The
      study evaluates the effect of inclusion of this technique by examine postoperative outcomes
      retrospectively. This is done by differentiation between major and minor complications to
      evaluate the greatest gains of the intervention.
