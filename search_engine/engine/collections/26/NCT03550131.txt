      Aim 1. Test the translation and enhancement of intervention designed to increase physical
      activities of older adult care receivers (CRs) with AD/RD and their CGs. Aim 2. Evaluate the
      short- and long-term effect of the standard and personalized intervention on primary
      (physical activity and functioning; perceived stress for CGs; independence/residential status
      (institutionalization) for CRs) and secondary outcomes (HRQOL; depressive symptomatology;
      behavioral disturbances for CRs). Aim 3. Test the moderating roles of CR-CG characteristics,
      including type of CR-CG relationship, sex, and severity of CR AD/RD, on the treatment effect
      of the standard and personalized intervention.
