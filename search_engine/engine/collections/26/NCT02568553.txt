    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when given in combination
      with blinatumomab in the proposed regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity anti-tumor response (complete response [CR] and
      partial response [PR] as per International workshop lymphoma response criteria).

      II. To investigate the immune response to blinatumomab alone and in combination with
      lenalidomide.

      III. To document the infection rate with a 96-hour bag change schedule for blinatumomab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-56 and
      lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 29-49 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving response including stable disease receive blinatumomab IV
      continuously on days 1-7 and lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receiving response including stable disease after completion of
      Consolidation receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
