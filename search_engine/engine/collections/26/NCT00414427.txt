      pathologic hallmark is destruction of hyaline cartilage. It is now realized that OA results
      from a complex interplay of multiple factors, including local inflammatory processes.
      Evidence suggests that synovitis which is the usual presenting sign of inflammatory arthritis
      is also frequently present in OA.

      The presence of inflammation in knee OA may explain why intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid
      injections have been shown to result in clinically and statistically significant reduction in
      osteoarthritic knee pain. Randomized controlled trials have shown that treated patients were
      less likely to have continuing pain and had significantly lower scores on a visual analogue
      scale (VAS) for pain. However, studies have failed to determine clinical predictors of
      response to IA steroid injection, including traditional indices of inflammation (heat, fluid,
      stiffness). One possibility is that local corticosteroids do no act to relieve pain by
      reducing synovitis. These putative mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Perhaps a more
      plausible explanation is that current methods of assessing local inflammation in OA are
      inadequate.

      Recent studies involving ultrasonography (US) demonstrate that US is a valid and reproducible
      tool for the detection of synovitis in the knee. It has been shown to be more sensitive than
      clinical examination and is relatively inexpensive and noninvasive.
