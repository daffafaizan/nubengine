      improve bone mineral density (BMD) in children with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
      After we stratify participants on the basis of whether they are taking glucocorticoids for
      treatment of inflammatory disease or for immunosuppression following organ transplant, we
      will randomize them to receive daily calcium and vitamin D in addition to 30 mg/kg (1 mg/kg
      for weight less then 30 kg) of pamidronate in normal saline every 3 months or daily calcium
      and vitamin D only for 24 months, followed by a 12-month followup period off of therapy. We
      will measure endpoints at 24 months. The primary endpoint is lumbar spine BMD determined by
      DEXA. Secondary endpoints will include volumetric BMD of the spine, proximal femur BMD and
      volumetric BMD, total body bone mineral content (BMC), fracture incidence, bone turnover
      markers, and growth and skeletal changes. The study radiologist will be blinded to treatment
      group.
