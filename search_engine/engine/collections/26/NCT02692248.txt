      lymphoma (DLBCL) makes it more difficult to salvage relapsed or refractory patients. In
      addition, patients with advanced age or significant comorbidities, who are consequently not
      candidates for high-dose consolidative therapy, have a very poor prognosis. Prospective
      studies investigating new salvage regimens are essential.

      The combination of rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GEMOX) is an effective salvage
      regimen for patients with relapsing or refractory DLBCL, with a favourable toxicity profile
      for unfit and/or elderly patients. Ibrutinib, an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is
      a potent killer of ABC DLBCL cell lines in vitro and in xenografts.

      It is expected that the combination of ibrutinib with R-GEMOX-Dexa could be effective and
      well tolerated. Thus, it is proposed an open-label, non-randomized, multicentre, phase II
      trial, to investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib with rituximab,
      gemcitabine, oxaliplatine and dexamethasone followed by ibrutinib maintenance as salvage
      therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory non-GCB DLBCL non-candidates to stem cell
      transplant.
