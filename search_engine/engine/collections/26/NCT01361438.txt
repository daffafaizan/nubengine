      years, ≤60 years). Induction treatment will consist of 12 weeks of Dasatinib oral
      administration (140 mg QD). Patients will initiate treatment with steroids 7 days prior to
      starting Dasatinib and will continue up to day 31. Patients will continue treatment with
      Dasatinib up to day 84, except for disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal
      from study.

      Thereafter:

        -  patients in hematological and molecular CR will receive a post-remissional treatment
           consisting of Dasatinib alone for a 6 months period

        -  patients in hematological CR with persistence of molecular disease will be allografted
           or, if not eligible or a donor is not available, treated with 2 cycles of a
           Clofarabine-Cyclophosphamide schedule.

      After allograft:

        -  MRD negative patients (i.e. in CHR and PCR negative) will receive a 6 months Dasatinib
           maintenance treatment;

        -  MRD positive patients (i.e. in CHR and PCR positive) will receive Dasatinib as
           maintenance treatment until relapse or progression.

      Patients not transplanted and treated with Clofarabine/Cyclophosphamide will also receive
      Dasatinib as maintenance treatment until relapse or progression.
