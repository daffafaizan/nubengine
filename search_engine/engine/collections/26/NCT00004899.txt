        -  Determine the overall survival and disease free survival of patients with acute
           myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome treated with busulfan and etoposide
           followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation and filgrastim (G-CSF).

        -  Assess the toxicities of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Assess the hematologic effects and toxicities of G-CSF given in this setting to these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether G-CSF stimulates leukemic relapse in these patients.

        -  Determine whether G-CSF has an affect on platelet recovery in this setting in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to first, second, or third remission. Patients
      undergo bone marrow collection.

      Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours for 16 doses on days -5, -4, -3, and -2.
      Patients receive etoposide IV over 4 hours on days -4, -3, and -2. Bone marrow is reinfused
      36-48 hours after the last dose of etoposide. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV daily
      beginning 2-4 hours after bone marrow reinfusion until hematopoietic recovery.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
