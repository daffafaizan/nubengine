      patients with a putative immunogenic subtype will be included within the phase 2 INSPIRE
      trial. As treatment we will be utilizing a combinatory regimen of nivolumab 3mg/kg and
      ipilimumab 1mg/kg for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 480mg flat dose for up to one year. All
      participants will additionally undergo an on-trial metastatic tissue biopsy. Translational
      research will study immunological correlates and in-depth genomic/transcriptomic and
      multispectral immunohistochemical analyses of immune infiltrate.
