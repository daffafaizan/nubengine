      States. Teen drivers who have committed a traffic violation are at an even greater risk for
      MVCs than their counterparts. While parent-focused interventions are an effective strategy to
      improve teen driving safety, most of these interventions target teen drivers are implemented
      as universal interventions (for teens of all risk profiles). Evidence on the effectiveness of
      these evidence-based interventions when translated and implemented among high-risk teen
      drivers such as those with a traffic citation is lacking.

      The current project is significant because it will translate the STS program to the needs of
      high-risk teen drivers who have committed a traffic violation and their parents. This study
      is innovative because it partners with the local court system, and utilizes novel and
      cutting-edge in-vehicle technology. The findings of the current study will have a significant
      impact on juvenile traffic court's practices and policies aimed to improve teen driving
      safety by reducing MVC-related crashes, injuries, and deaths.
