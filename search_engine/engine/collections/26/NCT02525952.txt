      hepatocellular carcinoma.However,the selection criteria of hepatectomy for patients with
      multiple HCCs remains controversial.Researches have suggested that part of the patients with
      multiple HCCs can also benefit from hepatectomy.But,expanding the selection criteria for
      hepatectomy will increase tumor recurrence rates and reduce the therapeutic effect, more
      stringent selection criteria will also make part of the patients who should take hepatectomy
      lose the operation chance. This is a difficult problem in the research of this field.The
      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system recommends that stage A (number ≤ 3, largest
      diameter ≤ 3 cm) were suitable for liver resection.However, increasing reports on good
      outcome after hepatectomy for patients with multiple HCCs have been published.Studies on
      clonal origin suggest that hepatectomy is a better treatment for multiple HCCs from
      multicentric origin (MO) than that from intrahepatic metastasis (IM) and the 5-year overall
      survival rates is 24% to 58%.The investigators established a scoring system(NDR score; N,
      tumor number; D, total tumor diameter; R, ratio of largest/smallest diameter) based on
      preoperative data which can accurately predict postoperative long-term survival of patients
      with multiple HCCs.The formula is as follows: 1×N（N: >3=1; ≤3= 0）+ 2×D（D: >8cm = 1; ≤8cm= 0）+
      1×R（R: >6 = 1; ≤6= 0）.The investigators first propose a selection criteria of hepatectomy for
      patients with multiple HCCs based on this scoring system. Patients with a NDR score 0-2 are
      recommended for hepatectomy and can benefit from the surgery,and because of the unsatisfied
      outcome,patients with a NDR score more than 2 are not recommended for hepatectomy.The
      stringent selection criteria should be expanded so that more patients can benefit from
      hepatectomy,and the less stringent criteria should be limited to ensure curative
      effect.So,the investigators' NDR scoring system was more accurate in selecting patients with
      multiple HCCs for hepatectomy and this article was published on Ann Surg
      Oncol（2015，22:826）.In order to further confirm the rationality of this selection criteria,the
      investigators would like to propose a prospective randomized controlled study.
