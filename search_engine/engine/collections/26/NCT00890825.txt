    
      The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy in terms of overall survival
      (OS) of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone, in second-line
      patients with KRAS mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Amendment 4 of the
      CSP altered the primary objective and outcome variable from progression-free survival (PFS)
      to OS, and the secondary outcome variable changed from OS to PFS.

      The secondary objectives of the study were:

        -  To further assess the efficacy of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel, compared with
           docetaxel alone, in second-line patients with KRAS mutation-positive locally advanced or
           metastatic NSCLC

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability profile of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel

        -  To investigate the use of plasma and serum as a potential source of circulating free
           tumour DNA (cfDNA) for the analysis of KRAS mutation status

        -  To investigate the PK of AZD6244 and N-desmethyl AZD6244 and any other known metabolites
           when AZD6244 is administered in combination with docetaxel.

      The exploratory objectives of the study were:

        -  To assess the prevalence, severity and change over time of advanced NSCLC cancer
           specific symptoms in patients receiving AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel and
           docetaxel alone

        -  To explore potential biomarkers in residual tumour, plasma and/or serum taken for KRAS
           mutational analysis which may influence development of NSCLC (and associated clinical
           characteristics) and/or response (optional)

        -  To investigate the relationship between AZD6244 and/or N-desmethyl AZD6244 and any other
           known metabolite plasma concentrations or exposure and clinical outcomes, efficacy, AEs,
           and/or safety parameters if deemed appropriate

        -  To collect and store deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), derived from a blood sample, for
           future exploratory research into genes that may influence response, eg, distribution,
           safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AZD6244 and/or agents used in combination and/or
           as comparators (optional).
