      with abnormal immune responses to food antigens. Classical IgE mediated anaphylactic food
      allergy is characterized by immediate hypersensitivity, and has a prevalence of approximately
      6% and 3% in children and adults, respectively. In contrast, eosinophil associated
      gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis (EG), are food allergy associated disorders characterized by eosinophilic
      inflammation of the gut, typically without anaphylaxis. Progress in the treatment and
      management of these food allergies requires further understanding of the immunological
      pathogenesis of these disorders. A subset of peripheral blood food allergen specific
      interleukin (IL) -5 producing T cells that are present in EGID but not peanut allergic
      subjects has recently been characterized. The primary objective of this study is to determine
      if similar IL-5 producing T cells are present in the gut of EGID subjects. To this end, both
      EGID and healthy non-allergic subjects will be enrolled and gastrointestinal biopsies will be
      obtained for intracellular cytokine staining, RT-PCR and ELISA.

      Additionally, this protocol will supply blood and leukapheresis samples for exploratory
      studies on immunologic mechanisms underlying anaphylactic food allergy and EGIDs. A total of
      up to 400 subjects recruited from outside physician referrals and support groups, as well as
      from those in existing National Institutes of Health (NIH) protocols will be enrolled in this
      Clinical Center study.
