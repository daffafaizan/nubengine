      I. To prospectively characterize the symptom burden and assess the health-related quality of
      life of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) in active treatment for colorectal cancer in
      comparison to older patients to identify differences that contribute to the development of
      appropriately timed, age appropriate interventions.

      II. To characterize the symptom burden and assess the health-related quality of life of AYAs
      who have completed curative therapy and are in surveillance for colorectal cancer compared to
      older patients to identify differences that contribute to the development of appropriately
      timed, age-appropriate interventions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Using a prospective and cross-sectional design, characterize physical function, body
      composition, and biomarkers of comorbid conditions among AYAs with colorectal cancer (CRC) on
      active therapy and after completion of therapy in survivorship to identify targets for and
      timing of interventions.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess across Aims differences by cancer site (colon versus [vs.] rectal) by sex, and
      by race/ethnicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients on active treatment complete questionnaires and undergo collection of blood samples
      and physical function assessments at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months. Survivors in
      surveillance complete questionnaires and undergo collection of blood sample and physical
      function assessment at baseline.
