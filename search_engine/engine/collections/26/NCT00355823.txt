      healthy male and female subjects 18-30 years of age. A standard superficial, dermal wound 0.5
      mm long will be inflicted using the Ascensia Microlet Vaculance by Bayer Health Care with a
      21 gauge lancet on its deepest setting. This setting will penetrate the epidermis and stop
      within the dermis. We will first determine variability within the same individual by
      measuring the electric field near two wounds close to each other on the volar forearm. We
      will then determine the variability between different body regions by comparing the wound
      field near a lancet wound in the volar forearm and one in the leg. If hair is present it will
      be removed by shaving the wound site prior to wounding. By collecting these data from 10
      males and 10 females in both age groups we can determine if there is a gender or age
      dependence to the field strength. Finally we will determine the lateral electric field near
      lancet wounds in diabetics and near chronic skin wounds. If these fields are smaller than
      fields found near acute wounds, it would provide a rationale for future studies imposing
      electric fields to enhance wound healing.
