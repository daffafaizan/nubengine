        -  Determine the diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating the
           contralateral breast of women with a recent unilateral diagnosis of breast cancer and a
           negative contralateral mammogram and clinical breast exam.

        -  Determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value for both call backs
           for additional imaging and biopsy recommendations, and receiver operating characteristic
           curves of MRI in evaluating these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of the following patient-related factors: age (50 years old and
           over vs less than 50 years old), breast parenchymal density (fatty vs non fatty breast),
           and tumor histology (invasive lobular vs invasive ductal, invasive vs in situ) on the
           performance of MRI (cancer yield, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gadopentetate dimeglumine IV and then undergo magnetic resonance imaging of
      the contralateral breast.

      Patients are followed at 12-18 and 24-30 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
