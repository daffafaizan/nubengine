      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cN1 breast cancer patients. In brief, pathologically proven
      positive axillary lymph node will be clip-marked before the initiation of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NACT) and continuously monitored through out the course of chemotherapy with
      ultrasound. After the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a wire will be placed to
      localize the clip-marked node before surgery. During surgery, a standard sentinel lymph node
      biopsy will be performed as well as the removal of the wire localized node. Axillary lymph
      node dissection (ALND) will be performed in all participants. Accuracy of SLNB alone and in
      combination with the removal of wire-localized-clip-marked nodes will be analyzed. Axillary
      ultrasound and CT scan will be performed before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for all
      patients enrolled. By assessing clinical-pathological and imaging data acquired from this
      trial, the investigator look forward to developing a model to accurately predict lymph node
      pCR (AUC >0.85) so as to safely avoid axillary lymph node dissection in cN1 breast cancer
      patients.
