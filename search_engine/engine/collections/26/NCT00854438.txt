      levels of serum anticholinergic activity in vivo that might cause impaired cognitive and
      functional functions in elderly. Pathophysiological changes in Alzheimer's dementia makes
      these patients particularly vulnerable for anticholinergic cognitive impairments. The
      PRADA-study is the first interventional study evaluating the clinical effects of reducing
      drug-induced anticholinergic load in patients with dementia. This is also the first
      interventional study in the Nordic countries evaluating the clinical effects of clinical
      pharmacy.
