      knee system using a cobalt chrome tibial tray and moderately cross-linked polyethylene insert
      at 5-Years. The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate additional
      clinical outcomes to provide further information on the performance of the P.F.C. fixed
      bearing knee system using a moderately cross-linked polyethylene insert and cobalt chrome
      tibial tray. These outcomes will include Radiographic assessment, American Knee Society
      Score, Oxford Knee Score and SF-12.
