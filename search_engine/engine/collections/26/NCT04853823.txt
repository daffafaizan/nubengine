    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to assess
      the safety, tolerability and dermal reactogenicity in subjects shown to be sensitive to
      urushiol of PDC-APB by intramuscular (IM) injection compared to placebo. In this study, it is
      anticipated that up to 4 dose levels (5.0 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg PDC-APB) will be
      studied in sequential cohorts. Each cohort will enroll 8 subjects, 6 subjects randomized to
      active treatment and 2 randomized to placebo, in a double-blind manner.

      Safety will be assessed in each cohort before starting treatment at the next higher dose
      level. If the study treatment is tolerated and there are no findings that necessitate
      stopping the study, the next cohort will be treated at the next higher dose level, in the
      same manner. This process will continue until the highest intended dose is reached, or side
      effects that limit further dose escalation are observed.
