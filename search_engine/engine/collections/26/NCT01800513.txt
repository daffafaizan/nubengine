      undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) is frequent. Unfortunately, few treatments exist
      except for the use of a gestational carrier. There have been a number of recent clinical
      studies demonstrating that local injury to the endometrium results in improved clinical
      pregnancy outcomes for patients with a history of implantation failure. However, not all
      studies have shown a beneficial effect, and those demonstrating benefit have been limited by
      small sample sizes, and considerable heterogeneity in the procedures and populations
      evaluated. A recent meta-analysis synthesized the available data concluded that a large,
      prospective, well-designed randomized trial is desperately needed to definitively assess this
      new possible treatment. If these preliminary findings from previous trials are confirmed,
      this practice could be applied in the clinical setting to help patients suffering from
      repeated implantation failures.
