    
      Treatment schedule for 9 cycles of induction:

      Phase I:

      In the phase I portion of the study, the following dose levels of carfilzomib will be studied
      with fixed doses of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide to define the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD):

      Level-1:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 36
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 36 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Level 0:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 45
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 45 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Level +1:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 56
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 56 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Level +2:

        1. Carfilzomib given 20 mg/m2 IV once daily on days 1-2 of Cycle 1 only followed by 36
           mg/m2 on days 8-9, 15-16, of Cycle 1, then for all subsequent doses 70 mg/m2 IV once
           daily on days 1-2, 8-9, 15-16.

        2. Cyclophosphamide given orally at the dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15

        3. Dexamethasone given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 20 mg on days
           1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23

      Patient will be observed at the end of the second cycle of therapy for the assessment of side
      effects and observation of DLTs. Dose escalation will proceed as follows:

        -  3 patients will be entered at dose level 0

        -  If 0/3 patients experience DLT, dose escalation will continue

        -  If 1/3 patients experience DLT, 3 additional patients will be added to this cohort (max
           6)

        -  If no further patients experience DLT (1/6) dose escalation will continue

        -  If 2/6 patients experience DLT, the MTD will have been exceeded and the MTD will be the
           previous dose at which <2/6 experienced DLT

        -  If 2/3 patients experience a DLT at any given dose, the MTD will have been exceeded and
           the MTD will be the preceding dose at which < 2/6 (or 1/3) patients experienced a DLT.

      Phase II:

      The dose used to treat patients in the phase II will be the MTD defined in the phase I of the
      study.

      Treatment schedule for maintenance until progression or intolerance:

      Carfilzomib at the MTD defined by phase I study IV once daily on days 1-2, 15-16.
