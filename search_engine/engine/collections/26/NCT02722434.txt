    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of scrambler therapy (MC5-A scrambler therapy) compared to TENS
      therapy for pain and/or tingling related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
      (CIPN).

      II. Evaluate the tolerability of scrambler therapy and compare it to TENS therapy, in this
      population.

      III. Evaluate whether scrambler therapy, compared to TENS therapy, can decrease the use of
      pain medication for CIPN.

      IV. Explore whether messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression before and after
      scrambler therapy shows similar findings to what Starkweather et al observed.

      V. Utilizing high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to define alterations in functional
      differences (using resting state blood-oxygen-level dependent [BOLD] measures to measure
      differences in functional connectivity) in treated with the scrambler device in the setting
      of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy pain.

      VI. Explore whether scrambler therapy will alter sensation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo MC5-A scrambler therapy over 30 minutes for 10 consecutive weekdays.

      ARM II: Patients undergo TENS therapy over 30 minutes daily for 14 days.

      Patients in both Arms, may crossover to the opposite Arm for an additional 2 weeks of
      treatment if they elect.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 8 weeks.
