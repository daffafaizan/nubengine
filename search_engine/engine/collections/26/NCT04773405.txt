      it is feasible to accurately identify majority of the main components of the brachial plexus
      above the clavicle, including the three trunks. Since majority of the innervation to the
      upper extremity, including the shoulder, arises from the three trunks (superior, middle and
      inferior) of the brachial plexus, so targeted injections of the individual trunks of the
      brachial plexus under ultrasound guidance will produce surgical anaesthesia of the entire
      upper extremity (C5-T1). Principal Investigator refers to this novel technique "selective
      trunk block" (SeTB) and the preliminary experience with SeTB for surgical anaesthesia of the
      entire upper extremity has been very encouraging. Currently there are no data describing an
      optimal dose or volume of local anaesthetic for SeTB. The aim of this study is to identify
      the minimum dosage of 1:1 mixture of 'levobupivacaine' and "lignocaine with epinephrine"
      required to produce effective surgical anaesthesia in at least 90% of patients presented for
      upper limb surgery.
