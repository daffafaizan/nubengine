    
      In elderly adults,

        1. Spatio temporal characteristics, muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are
           measured by motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA, USA),
           surface electromyography (sEMG) (Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and F-Scan Mobile
           system (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA) during 10m walking test.

        2. Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface
           electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during five times sit-to-stand test.

        3. Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface
           electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during stair climbing.

        4. Cortical activation is measured by functional Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS)
           (NIRScout, NIRx, Germany) during treadmill gait.

      In stroke patients,

        1. Muscle activation and foot pressure distribution are measured by surface
           electromyography (sEMG) and F-Scan Mobile system during five times sit-to-stand test.

        2. Cortical activation is measured by functional Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS)
           (NIRScout, NIRx, Germany) during treadmill gait.
