      enrolled. Subjects will be randomized for assignment into two treatment conditions:
      twenty-one (21) subjects will use direct observation of another person's foot movements while
      twenty-one (21) will use mental visualization of foot movements (which will serve as the
      control group). Subjects in each group will be further be randomized for assignment into six
      treatment groups: direct observation or mental visualization of right lower extremity
      movements alone, direct observation or mental visualization of left lower extremity movements
      alone, or direct observation or mental visualization of simultaneous bilateral lower
      extremity movements. Subjects will use their assigned therapy for 20 minutes daily. The
      subjects for this study will be recruited from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC)
      Amputee clinic. Up to sixty (50) subjects will be recruited and screened according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria since we expect that some may not qualify or drop-out sooner
      than the scheduled 4-month completion time.
