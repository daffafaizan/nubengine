      behavior of Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) sufferers, with the detection of magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS), the assessment of Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT),
      Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and Go/No-go task, hopefully that this research could
      provide basis for the further study as well as the establishment of comprehensive assessment
      and treatment protocol of IAD.
