      counts for swelling (SJC) and tenderness (TJC) and assess their disease activity on a Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS). A 28 joint count and VAS will then be assessed by a nurse and by a
      rheumatologist. Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Disease Activity Severity 28 - C
      Reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) will be calculated from each data set.

      The same rheumatologist will examine all patients and two nurses will each randomly assess
      half the total enrolled patients. The nurse will be blinded to the patient's joint count and
      VAS, and similarly, the rheumatologist will be blinded to both the patient and nurse's
      assessments. The setting includes 2 nurses with different educational background: one
      technician and one bachelor.

      The training provided to the nurses in this study allows them to master the basis of the
      physical exam, joint count and history of the rheumatoid patient as well as to learn the
      pertinent laboratory parameters. It is a 14-hour course in which the patient is examined
      through observation, palpation, assessment of mobility and stability and specific movement.
      Diagnostic tools such as the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Health Assessment
      Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ), CDAI and DAS-28 are included in the patient evaluation.

      Each enrolled patient will receive a 5-minute training in joint assessment by the nurse. The
      use of the mannequin for joint assessment of swelling and tenderness will be reviewed.
      Objective signs of disease such as swelling, redness and heat will be explained as well as
      the difference between inflammation and bony swelling, the latter being indicative of
      osteoarthritis.
