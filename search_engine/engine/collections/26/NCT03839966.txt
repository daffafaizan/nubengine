      will reduce levels of loneliness compared to a control treatment. Participants will be
      randomized into an active treatment condition or a control treatment that involves a healthy
      living and relaxation protocol. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the IBM
      condition will have lower levels of negative interpretation bias and loneliness than those in
      the healthy habits condition at post treatment and follow up. The investigators further
      hypothesize that the effects of IBM on loneliness will be accounted for by changes in
      interpretation bias.
