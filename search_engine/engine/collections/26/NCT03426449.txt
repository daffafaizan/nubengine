      with posterolateral internal sphincterotomy at 5 o'clock in regards healing time,
      postoperative recurrence and complications, particularly fecal incontinence. We hypothesized
      that performing internal sphincterotomy in a point midway between the standard lateral
      position and the posterior midline position would confer better healing and relief of
      symptoms with less incidence of fecal incontinence while avoiding the development of keyhole
      deformity.
