      receive PBT2 250 mg with or without food in the first dosing period, followed by a 7 day
      washout period before receiving the opposite fed/fasted condition to that allocated in the
      first dosing period. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected during each dosing period,
      along with safety monitoring assessments.
