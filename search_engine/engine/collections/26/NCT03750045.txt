      The virtual environment is formed by four phases, each one having three spheres that are
      supposed to be inserted, one by one, into a hole located on the scenario floor. Each phase
      presents a level of difficulty, from pushing the object to performing the grip movement. By
      the end of each phase, a log file is generated with the time spent on it.
