    
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of a technique called
      High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREMÂ®), for
      hypertension. HIRREM uses scalp sensors to monitor brain electrical activity, and computer
      software algorithms translate selected brain frequencies into audible tones in real time.
      Those tones are reflected back to participants via ear buds in as little as four to eight
      milliseconds, providing the brain an opportunity for self-adjustment of its electrical
      pattern.

      This study will compare acoustic stimulation linked to brainwave activity (HIRREM, along with
      continued current care, HCC), with continued current clinical care alone (CCC). Both groups
      will continue their other current care throughout, including non-pharmacological, and
      lifestyle modification therapies.
