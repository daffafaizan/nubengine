      and perimembranous outlet) ventricular septal defect (VSD) remains unclear.

      From 1987 to 2002, 411 patients with complete follow-up after repair of outlet VSD
      constituted the study population. Study end point was aortic valve replacement or mortality.

      Aortic valve replacement was performed in seventeen patients (4.1%), in whom logistic
      regression showed only the severity of preoperative AR and age at VSD repair as the
      predictors. After excluding the eleven patients with endocarditis from analysis, there were
      377 patients with none to mild AR (Group I) and 23 with moderate to severe AR (Group II)
      preoperatively. Total follow-up was 2,230 person-years. After VSD repair, the 5- and 10-year
      freedom from aortic valve replacement in Group I was 100%, and in Group II 50.2%. In Group
      II, ten patients received aortic valve replacement and 8 underwent valvuloplasty with VSD
      repair. One patient needed valve replacement four years later. Age at VSD repair was the
      predictor for aortic valve replacement. In Group I, AR progressed in four patients (1.2%, two
      juxta-arterial and two perimembranous outlet) 3.5 to 7.9 years later and was associated with
      aortic valvar or subvalvar anomalies. The event-free curves in three outlet types VSD showed
      no differences.

      Although AR progressed rarely (probably not in muscular outlet type) in repaired outlet types
      VSD with none to mild preoperative AR, in the presence of aortic valvar or subvalvar
      anomalies, early surgical repair of the VSD is still warranted.
