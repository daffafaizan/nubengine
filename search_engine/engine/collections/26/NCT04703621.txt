      platelet count.

      B-cell depletion with rituximab in ITP induces the differentiation of short-lived auto-immune
      plasma cells into pathogenic long-lived plasma cells in the spleen that was not present
      before treatment. It has been reported that refractory ITP is related to the presence of
      long-lived plasma cells, which are resistant to steroids and immunosuppressants, including
      rituximab.

      These findings lead to the hypothesis that therapy directed against plasma cells may help
      overcome treatment resistance. At least in a proportion of patients, treatment resistance is
      caused by CD20 negative long-lived plasma cells.

      This study aims to investigate the efficacy, the optimal number of treatments, and safety of
      anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent in ITP patients who
      fail to respond to at least one previous second-line therapy, including rituximab and/ or TPO
      agonist.
