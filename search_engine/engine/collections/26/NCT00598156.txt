      according to the investigators choice. In addition to chemotherapy, Avastin (bevacizumab)
      will be given during the treatment period. After the chemotherapy is finished (after 18
      weeks), maintenance therapy will be given and the patients will be randomized to treatment
      with either with Avastin alone or Avastin in combination with Tarceva (erlotinib). Patients
      with progressive disease, or patients suitable to curative resection of metastases will be
      taken out of study.
