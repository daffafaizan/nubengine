      patients undergoing mechanical ventilatory support. Among them, we can mention the reduction
      in tidal volume, the reduction in driving pressure, the PEEP setting, and the respiratory
      rate reduction. All of these strategies are aimed at preventing ventilator-induced lung
      injury. Few clinical studies have evaluated the effects of protective mechanical ventilation
      strategies on dead-space. This study was designed to evaluate dead space and alveolar
      ventilation with a sequence of protective ventilatory strategies, keeping PEEP levels
      constant. The ventilatory strategy was developed to reduce tidal volume, set an
      end-inspiratory pause, and reduce the frequencies of lung tissue impact.

      Baseline:

      All the patients kept the variables under study constant for 60 minutes. Each of the
      participants was studied for a period of 150 minutes. PEEP programming was set with
      transpulmonary end-expiratory pressures to maintain between 0 and 5 cmH2O and was remained
      constant throughout the study.

      Protocol design:

      Baseline: Vt 7 ml/kg/PBW Phase I: Vt 6 ml/kg/PBW. Phase II: Vt 5 ml/kg/PBW. Phase III:
      end-inspiratory pause prolongation until achieving I:E ratio equal to 1, maintaining a
      constant Vt level (5 ml/kg/PBW) Phase IV: Respiratory rate reduction by 20% of basal
      conditions, maintaining constant VT level (5 ml/kg/PBW).

      After 30 minutes of continuous monitoring, minute ventilation, mechanical power, variables
      obtained by volumetric capnography, and arterial blood gases were recorded in each study
      phase.

      This study will be performed in the Intensive Care Unit of a University Hospital.
