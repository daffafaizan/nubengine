      13-week crossover trial. Participants will follow a 2-week run-in control period consuming
      their habitual diets. Participants will then be randomized to consume 20 g of milk fat daily
      in the form of either a reconstituted milk polar lipid (MPL)-rich dairy beverage (MPL;
      providing 5.3 g MPL daily) or a control dairy beverage (CTL; providing 0.3 g MPL daily), each
      for 4- weeks, separated by a 3-week washout period. Participants will be instructed to
      consume intervention treatment/control beverages at breakfast (50 g) and dinner (50 g) and
      reconstitute the powders in water immediately prior to consumption. With the exception of the
      intervention beverages, participants will be asked to maintain their normal diet and exercise
      habits throughout the study. Venous blood will be collected after a 12-hour overnight fast
      into EDTA-coated (glucose analysis) and serum (lipid analyses) collection tubes. Passive
      drool and stool samples will be collected at the end of the run-in period (baseline) and
      intervention periods (treatment and control). Participants will be asked to complete a 5-day
      dietary record, food preference/liking/sedentary behavior surveys, and 7-day physical
      activity diary at the beginning and end of intervention periods.
