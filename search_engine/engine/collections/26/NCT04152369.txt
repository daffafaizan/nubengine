      admission for endourological procedure or ESWL were subjected to body temperature measurement
      and laboratory tests: smear from the anus towards the presence of alarm pathogens,
      urinalysis, control urine culture, blood count, CRP (C-reactive protein), procalcitonin
      (PCT). After confirming the occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the patients were
      randomized to two groups - a one-day and three-day period lasting perioperative antibiotic
      prophylaxis. In both groups on the following day after the procedure (24 hours after the
      procedure) and after 7 days after the procedure, laboratory tests and body temperature
      measurements were performed.
