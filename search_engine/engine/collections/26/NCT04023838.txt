      tortuosity of the clavicle artery. However, clinical validation of the snuffbox approach was
      not completed compared with the conventional radial approach. Especially, there is no
      clinical data on the comparison of the radiation dose in both approaches. To date, there have
      been some studies on the radiation dose between the left and right radial artery and femoral
      artery puncture site, but no studies have been conducted on the left snuffbox approach.

      The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation doses of the two interventional
      radiologists by randomly assigning coronary angiography to the left snuffbox approach and
      right conventional radial approach.
