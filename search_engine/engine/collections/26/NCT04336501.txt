      refractory recurrent acute b-lymphoblastic leukemia (b-all), the overall survival rate of 3
      years after transplantation was about 10%. The overall survival rate at 3 years was about 70
      percent. In the early stage, the investigators established the monitoring method of leukemia
      micro-residual disease, effectively screened out the high-risk group of recurrence, combined
      with the new relapse treatment method, successfully implemented the stratification and even
      personalized dry prediction of leukemia recurrence for the first time in the world, and
      reduced the recurrence rate of the high-risk group by 30%. However, the therapeutic targeting
      is not strong, and up to 30% of patients will develop graft versus host disease, which
      seriously affects the survival of patients. The use of CAR repair T cells (CAR T) to target
      CD19 in the treatment of refractory recurrent b-all was effective, and the use of CAR T in
      the treatment of recurrent b-all after transplantation did not increase the risk of GVHD.
      This clinical study mainly discussed the safety and efficacy of donor targeted cd19-t cells
      after allo-hsct in the treatment of acute b-lymphocytic leukemia with minimal residual
      disease. It is expected that the recurrence rate will be reduced while the incidence of acute
      GVHD after transplantation will not be increase
