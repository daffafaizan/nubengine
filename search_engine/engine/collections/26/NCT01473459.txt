      Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome who are candidates for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). These
      protocols carry less risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome which these women may
      experience.The patients in the IVM group will not be exposeD to gonadotropin treatment for
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. In the antagonist group we will use GnRH agonist to
      induce ovulation which may reduce the risk for ovarian hyperstimulation.
