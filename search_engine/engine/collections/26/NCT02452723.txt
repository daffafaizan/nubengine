      (hpNSC). ISC-hpNSC will be injected intracerebrally to the striatum and substantia nigra of
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      The study will enroll 4 patients for cell injection at each of three different doses. A total
      of 12 patients with moderate to severe PD will be treated. Each patient receives a single
      dose. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the cell transplantation.
