    
      This is a randomized cross over study. A convenience sample of staff and resident physicians
      and physician assistants from the San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) Department of
      Emergency Medicine will be used to assess NIPPV mask seal during CPAP administration with and
      without nasal cannula. Volunteers will be solicited via Grand Rounds and staff meetings at
      San Antonio Military Medical Center. Subjects will undergo permuted block randomization by
      random number generator to the order of intervention, mask alone or mask with nasal cannula
      at 15L/min of oxygen. An emergency medicine trained physician will place equipment and
      operate the ventilator. After placement of the NIPPV mask and prior to each study
      intervention period, appropriate adjustments to enhance mask seal will be made as would
      happen in a therapeutic setting and the volunteer will be allowed up to two minutes to
      acclimate to continuous noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Mask leak will be measured
      by the ventilator unit and will be recorded after 60 seconds of spontaneous restful
      ventilation.
