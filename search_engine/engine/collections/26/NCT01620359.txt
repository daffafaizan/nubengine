      positive diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with a scheduled surgical resection will be
      enrolled into the trial. Eligible participants will be evaluated and treated with ExAblate
      breast ablation prior to their planned definitive surgical treatment. After the 10 to 21 days
      post ExAblate therapy, study participants will have another contrast-enhanced MR imaging
      examination. Their planned tumor excision will then be completed no later than 14 days from
      the contrast-enhanced, post ExAblate procedure MR imaging examination. Additionally, the end
      points of the study will be compared against the CORE Pathology Lab results.
