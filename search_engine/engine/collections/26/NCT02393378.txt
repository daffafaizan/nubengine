      severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      namilumab in participants diagnosed with RA within 6 months and insufficiently controlled by
      methotrexate (MTX) alone.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 patients, who will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio
      to the following open label treatment groups:

        -  Namilumab 150 mg + MTX + folic acid

        -  Adalimumab 40 mg + MTX + folic acid

      Imaging techniques, including Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI),
      will be used to measure changes in the dominant hand and the wrist.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is a maximum of 42 weeks, including follow-up period. Participants will make 16 visits
      to the site and will be followed up by telephone twice after end of treatment.

      A strategic decision was made to stop the study on 18 December 2015 in order to fully
      understand the data from the psoriasis study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02129777) and
      wait for the results of the formal proof of concept study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
      (NCT02379091) in participants with rheumatoid arthritis.
