    
      Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), is a small-sized vessel necrotizing vasculitis associated
      with anti-neutrophils cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). Treatment of ANCA associated vasculitis
      (AAV) was previously based on glucocorticoids (GC) and cyclophosphamide. It has been
      demonstrated in two prospective randomized trials that rituximab is as effective as
      cyclophosphamide in the induction treatment of GPA and severe MPA. In addition, it was shown
      in GPA and MPA that rituximab is superior to azathioprine as maintenance therapy.

      Patients with MPA without poor prognosis factor (Five factor score (FFS)=0) have not been
      included in the previous studies and GC alone is considered as the reference treatment in
      these patients. However, as much as 50% of these patients experience relapses after a 24
      months follow-up and only 40% of patients have a long lasting remission.

      In the group of patients with MPA without any poor prognosis factor (FFS=0), an additional
      treatment with rituximab might decrease the relapse rate from 40% to 15% after an 18 months'
      follow-up. The efficacy and safety of this proposal must be tested.
