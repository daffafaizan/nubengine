    
      This is a Phase 1/2a, dose escalation, consecutive-cohort, open-label studytrial of BI-1206
      in combination with rituximab in subjects with indolent relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.
      The studytrial will consist of 2 main parts: Phase 1 (with dose escalation cohorts using a
      3+3 dose-escalation design and selection of the RP2D), and Phase 2a (the escalationexpansion
      cohort at the RP2D). Subjects in each phase will receive 1 cycle (4 doses) of induction
      therapy with BI-1206 in combination with rituximab. Subjects who show clinical benefit
      (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) at Week 6 will
      continue onto maintenance therapy and receive BI-1206 and rituximab once every 8 weeks
      (relative to previous maintenance dose) for up to 6 maintenance cycles, or up to 1 year from
      first dose of BI-1206 (whichever occurs first).
