      patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility within 28 days of the start of the study drugs. In
      addition to standard tests and procedures, research tumor tissue (archival or fresh biopsy)
      will be collected for collection for pharmacodynamics. Participants will also be asked if
      they agree to optional biopsies at 6 cycles if their cancer is responding and at disease
      progression.

      Eligible participants will then receive the study drugs in 21 day cycles. Selinexor will be
      given by mouth and doxorubicin will be given by vein, once a week, for 6 cycles.

      Participants will be restaged every 2 cycles. If participants respond to treatment after 6
      cycles, they may be able to continue the selinexor alone as a maintenance treatment until
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      While receiving the study drug, many of the screening tests will be repeated. Additional
      tests and procedures include blood sample collection for pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics.

      When participants stop the study drug permanently for any reason, an end of treatment visit,
      28-day follow-up, and long term follow up every 90 days will occur.
