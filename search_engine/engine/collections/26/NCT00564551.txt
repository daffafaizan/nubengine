      type 2 diabetes. We know that individuals who are overweight or obese, and have impaired
      glucose tolerance or insulin resistance, have a good chance of developing type 2 diabetes.
      Research tells us that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be decreased by losing
      weight and making dietary changes. A promising area of study involves using low-fat milk
      products and calcium to prevent and/or control obesity and diabetes. This study is important
      because it will determine if including low-fat milk products in weight reducing diets can
      enhance weight loss, improve fat loss and decrease levels of blood glucose and insulin in
      individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes not treated with medication.
      This information is directly applicable to treating diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes
      and heart disease.
