      Suspension vs. the FDA-approved drug Ciprodex (ciprofloxacin 0.3%, dexamethasone 0.1%) Otic
      Suspension (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) in the treatment of acute otitis externa. Acute otitis
      externa is a common inflammatory condition of the external auditory canal often associated
      with infection, allergy and dermatitis. The active ingredient in our novel dexamethasone
      suspension is identical in concentration and route of administration to the steroid component
      of the approved drug Ciprodex, which is currently the most widely-prescribed
      dexamethasone-containing agent in the treatment of acute otitis externa. We will enroll 60
      patients (30 each in two separate treatment groups) in this trial. All patients electing to
      participate in this study will receive either FST-201 or Ciprodex. FST-201 and Ciprodex will
      be masked and provided free of charge to all study participants. Patients will be followed
      for at least 15 days or until their ear inflammation is either resolved or determined to need
      additional interventions. The study will be conducted with attention to all relevant GCP,
      ICH, FDA, HIPPA and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.
