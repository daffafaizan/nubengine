      study was conducted in two parts. A total of 36 subjects was planned to be enrolled in Part A
      and 36 subjects in Part B. Part A was performed according to a double blind, randomized,
      placebo controlled design and included three sequential dose groups of repeat doses. Each
      group enrolled 12 subjects on ITF2984 or placebo (ratio 9 active: 3 placebo) and received
      ITF2984 s.c. or placebo twice daily for 14 days. For all three groups the last dose was
      planned to be the first dose on Day 14.

      The study started with the Group 1 2000mcg s.c. b.i.d., Group 2 received 3000mcg b.i.d. after
      an interim review of the safety and PK data of the 2000mcg dose level. Group 3 received
      100mcg s.c. to gather data to complete the PK/PD profile of ITF2984. Subjects were screened
      up to 28 days before dosing with ITF2984/placebo that took place on Days 1-14.

      For all Groups, on day -1 and day 13 subjects received the exogenous tests administration
      (GHRH, Arginin and TRH) 30 minutes after the first morning administration of ITF2984/placebo.

      Part B was open label, and planned for six sequential dose groups of 6 subjects each. In each
      group subjects received ITF2984 continuous subcutaneous infusion for 7 consecutive days. The
      dose was escalated, from the starting dose of 900 mcg, by a maximum of three fold or more
      cautiously, if deemed necessary. The decision to test higher dose levels was based on review
      of safety and PK data from the previous dose level(s). After a 28 day screening period,
      subjects were admitted to the clinical unit on the evening of day -2. ITF2984 continuous
      infusion planned from day 1 to day 8 in the morning. On day -1 (the day prior to the start of
      infusion) subjects received the exogenous/challenge test administrations (GH-RH+Arginina and
      TRH). On day 7 the challenge tests were repeated.
