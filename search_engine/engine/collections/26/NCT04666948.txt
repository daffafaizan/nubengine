      minimum and maximum target blood target levels differ little from each other. Too low
      concentrations will reduce the effect of the antibiotic; higher concentrations may result in
      serious side effects, including renal toxicity. Vancomycin dosing tailored to the critically
      ill child is challenging.

      Currently, the starting dose of vancomycin is calculated on a milligram per kilogram basis,
      which is the same for all patients. The dose is then adjusted based on a measured vancomycin
      blood concentration (if too high or too low). Despite this measurement, quickly achieving
      target concentrations remains a major challenge.

      This multicenter, individual randomized study investigates the added value of a user-friendly
      computer program for calculating the vancomycin dose in critically ill children, compared to
      the current standard-of-care. Specifically, the investigators will study whether the use of
      this computer program leads to a shorter time to reach target concentrations, a reduction in
      the number and severity of side effects on the kidney, a reduction in patient burden, and a
      reduction in time to cure and duration of hospitalization.
