      of both substance use disorder (SUD; abuse or dependence on alcohol, illegal drugs, or
      prescription drugs; 70%) and depressive disorder (DD; major depressive disorder and dysthymic
      disorder; 20-27%). DDs tend to worsen the course of SUDs for incarcerated women by increasing
      their risk for suicide attempts, contributing to the persistence of substance abuse, and
      reducing the likelihood of a successful transition to an independent, sober life in the
      community. Recent evidence indicates that DDs are common in persons with SUDs, often do not
      remit with SUD treatment, and should be treated. Despite growing recognition that
      co-occurring disorders, such as DDs, among substance abusing incarcerated women present an
      important public health concern, integrated treatments for SUD-DD have not been
      well-developed for or systematically tested in this population. Group Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy (IPT-G) has been shown to be efficacious in treating DD in other populations
      and may be especially pertinent to the needs of incarcerated women with SUD-DD because
      interpersonal difficulties not only affect severity of depression, but are also strong
      predictors of drinking to cope, SUD relapse, and prison recidivism in women.

      This study tests the hypotheses that as adjuncts to prison SUD treatment, IPT-G, relative to
      psychoeducation on co-occurring disorders, will produce at least moderate effect sizes for:

        -  Reduction in the risk and severity of substance use relapse after release from prison

        -  Recovery from depressive disorder and reduction in depressive symptoms

        -  Improvement in social support and interpersonal functioning

        -  Reduction in the severity of legal problems during the 3 month follow-up period
