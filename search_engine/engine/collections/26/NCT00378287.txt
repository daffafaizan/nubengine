      including vital signs, laboratory findings, negative test for active H. pylori infection, and
      a negative pregnancy test if applicable) and subsequent enrolment, patients will have a
      baseline 24-hour intragastric pH recording. Patients will receive either oral rabeprazole
      20mg or intravenous pantoprazole 40mg daily for 3 consecutive days. For blinding purposes,
      patients will also receive either a placebo oral tablet or placebo intravenous solution
      ("double-dummy" design). A 24-hour intragastric pH recording will be completed on Day 1 and
      Day 3 of the drug administration period. This will be followed by a 14-day washout period
      before the second 3-day drug administration period during which the patient will receive the
      crossover drug regimen, and will again have 24-hour intragastric pH recordings completed on
      the first and third days of this second drug administration period.Thirty-seven patients with
      a negative test for active H. pylori infection test will be randomised into the study. The
      primary hypothesis is that oral rabeprazole produces equivalent acid suppression to
      intravenous pantoprazole as indicated by the time during which intragastric pH is greater
      than 4 on Day 1 of drug administration. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      the 2 treatment groups and will first receive either oral rabeprazole 20mg plus placebo
      intravenous solution or intravenous pantoprazole 40mg plus a placebo oral tablet daily for 3
      consecutive days. After a 14-day washout, patients will receive the crossover drug regimen.
