    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the change in urinary prostaglandin E metabolite (PGE-M) level after
           paclitaxel treatment in patients with a variety of solid tumor malignancies.

        -  To determine whether a change in PGE-M level correlates with paclitaxel dose.

        -  To determine whether the change in urinary PGE-M level correlates with patient reporting
           of pain, as measured by a visual analog scale and the Brief Pain Inventory short form
           (BPI-SF).

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether leukotriene levels are affected by paclitaxel treatment.

      OUTLINE: At baseline (prior to the first dose of paclitaxel), patients complete a
      questionnaire about their baseline pain symptoms (including the Brief Pain Inventory short
      form and the visual analog scale); cigarette smoking status and second-hand smoke exposure;
      and routine use of any pain medications (including NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors, and
      opioid analgesics), corticosteroids, or leukotriene antagonists (montelukast or zafirlukast).
      Patients also complete questionnaires about their pain daily on days 2-7 after paclitaxel
      administration.

      Urine samples are collected at baseline for urinary prostaglandin E metabolite (PGE-M),
      urinary leukotriene E_4 (LTE_4), and urinary cotinine levels and on day 4 for urinary PGE-M
      and LTE_4 levels.
