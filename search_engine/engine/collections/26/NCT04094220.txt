      study are with Schizas's stenosis grades C. Patients in one group received transpsoas lateral
      lumbar interbody fusion. Patients in the other group received transpsoas lateral lumbar
      interbody fusion plus posterior decompression. Patients will be followed for one year.
      Clinical outcomes of the two groups will be compared. And radiographic predictors of failed
      indirect decompression via LLIF will be analyzed.
