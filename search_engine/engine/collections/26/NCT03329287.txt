      treatment (including the therapist's manual and patient self-help manual) for the patients of
      generalized anxiety disorder and depression, known as Simplified Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (SCBT). SCBT is the main psychological intervention of this study. The aim of this study is
      to verify its efficacy and applicability using a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled
      and single-blind design, and to optimize the treatment program. The investigators hypothesize
      that SCBT is effective in patients with depression or anxiety, and the manual is
      easily-operated for the therapists.
