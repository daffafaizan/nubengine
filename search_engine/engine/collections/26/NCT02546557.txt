      procedure. In total 40.000 CABGÂ´s have been performed yearly in Germany in 2012 and 2013
      which presents 60% of all cardiac surgical interventions. Coronary artery bypass grafting is
      performed for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) to improve quality of life and to
      reduce cardiac-related mortality. CAD is the most leading cause of mortality in the Western
      world as well as in developing countries and it is the most common cause of heart failure.
      CABG was introduced in the 1960s. CABG operation has become the most studied intervention in
      the history of surgery. It is highly effective in the treatment of severe angina and it
      delays unfavorable events such as death, myocardial infarction and recurrence of angina in
      comparison to other treatment forms. There is a general agreement that already in the early
      postoperative period CABG surgery improves the disease in patients with symptomatic left main
      coronary artery stenosis or stenosis of the three main coronary vessels.
