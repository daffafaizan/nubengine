      United States, but re-tear remains a common long-term complication. This can lead to pain,
      decreased shoulder function, and the need for corrective surgery. Mesenchymal stem cells have
      been shown to improve healing rates in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, primarily due to
      their retained ability to differentiate into several different adult cell lines, such as
      tenocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. MSCs further enhance the healing process by
      releasing growth factors into the local environment to promote tissue regeneration.

      While MSC augmentation of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has led to higher rates of healing
      and improved tendon integrity, there remains a paucity of data surrounding clinical
      improvement after the procedure. Outcomes such as post-operative strength, range of motion,
      and shoulder function have yet to be compared with standard rotator cuff repair. The
      incidence of post-operative persistent structural defects in the tendon after MSC
      augmentation must also be further elucidated.
