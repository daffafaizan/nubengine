      incarcerated in juvenile detention centers) have deficits in emotion regulation, including
      empathy skills, and are at risk for a host of poor outcomes including repeat offenses,
      internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), externalizing symptoms (e.g., lying,
      truancy, fighting). Many of these problems stem from a lack of secure attachment to parents
      and peers. There is a need for novel and innovative programs to help these teens develop more
      secure attachments and better empathy skills to prevent poor outcomes. One type of
      intervention is animal-assisted interventions such as dog training programs. These programs
      appear to build empathy skills in at-risk youth, which may translate into better peer
      relations, less psychological distress, and less recidivism. The goal of this study is to
      test an existing animal-assisted intervention program that is already being used in juvenile
      detention centers to determine whether it is efficacious in improving adjudicated
      adolescents' empathy skills and psychological symptoms through building a secure attachment
      to the training dog.
