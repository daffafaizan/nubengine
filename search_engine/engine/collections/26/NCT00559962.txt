      lower doses of AEGR-733 can result in significant reductions in LDL-C and TGs while providing
      fewer gastrointestinal adverse events and less hepatic fat accumulation than seen in studies
      with higher doses. The potential for atorvastatin, ezetimibe or the PPAR-alpha agonist
      (fenofibrate) to ameliorate any hepatic fat accumulation will also be investigated. The
      twelve week dosing schedule allows us to demonstrate the longer term effects of lower doses
      of MTP-I on hepatic fat accumulation.
