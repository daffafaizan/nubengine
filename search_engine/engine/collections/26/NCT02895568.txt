      falciparum-infected individuals at the time of malaria diagnosis to measure the prevalence of
      known and candidate molecular markers of resistance to artemisinin and non-artemisinin ACT
      partner drugs. A maximum of 200 participants will be enrolled at each participating site per
      year. Study duration is 2 years. Therefore total participant is up to 400.

      Prospective participants will have blood collected for dried blood spot (DBS) study sample
      after providing informed consent. Individuals with confirmed P. falciparum infection will
      have DBS samples included for molecular analyses for known and candidate molecular markers of
      antimalarial drug resistance.
