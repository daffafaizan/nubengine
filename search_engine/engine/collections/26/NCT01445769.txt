      reducing anemia and thrombocytopenia. Subjects began dosing at 10 mg bid and had the
      opportunity for dose increases based on assessments of efficacy and overall hematologic
      status in a defined prior dosing interval. Dose increases were restricted to those patients
      who did not meet criteria for or have a dose hold over the prior 6 weeks, had a platelet
      count ≥100 x 10^9/L at week 12 or ≥150 x 10^9/L at week 18, and had a self-reported Patient's
      Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score of 3 (minimally improved) to 7 (very much worse) OR
      the subject's palpable spleen length below the costal margin had been reduced by less than
      40% at that visit relative to Baseline. Dose increases were elective and not required.
      Subjects were permitted a dose increase of 5 mg BID to 15 mg BID at Week 12 and to a maximum
      of 20 mg BID at Week 18. There were also protocol-required dose decreases for
      thrombocytopenia (platelets <100 x 10^9/L) or protocol-defined anemia (decline in hemoglobin
      of at least 2 g/dL to a level < 8 g/dL, development of transfusion dependence, or a 50%
      increase in transfusion requirements for transfusion dependent subjects).This approach
      assumed that beginning at a low dose for initial therapy might have a positive impact on the
      rate of the initial hemoglobin decline and the nadir by decreasing the level of JAK-mediated
      inhibition of hematopoiesis. Specific dose modifications were described to minimize
      excursions of hemoglobin levels into the Grade 3 or Grade 4 range.
