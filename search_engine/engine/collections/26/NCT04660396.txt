      diseases. High 30-day readmission and mortality rates have persisted despite advances in
      care. Clinical guidelines suggest blood volume assessment and clinical management to
      euvolemia or normal blood volume, but standard methods of blood volume diagnosis have been
      shown to be unreliable. FDA-cleared Blood volume analysis (BVA) has been used to quantify
      otherwise undiagnosed blood volume derangements in heart failure and other indications. Also,
      care guided by BVA has been demonstrated to improve inpatient heart failure readmission and
      mortality. A similar analysis has not previously been performed immediately following
      hospital discharge, though this period is understood to be challenging due to high
      variability of patient status, physiology, and compliance.

      This is a prospective, single-center, observational open-label study. The primary objective
      is to quantify changes to plasma volume and red blood cell volume over a 12 week period
      post-discharge.
