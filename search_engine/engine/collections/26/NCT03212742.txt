      improve care management of GBM patients. Attempts to achieve cure by increasing radiation
      dose result in unacceptable neurotoxicity. As for radiosensitizers, they can exacerbate
      normal tissue damage.

      Since GBM represent a rapidly dividing cell population within the nonreplicating normal
      brain, the therapeutic ratio may be enhanced by specific radiosensitization of proliferating
      cells. Resistance to apoptosis is a paramount issue in the treatment of HGG. Targeting PARP
      by the inhibitors like olaparib can reduce proliferation and lowers the apoptotic threshold
      of HGG (effect showed in vivo and in vitro).

      In this context, we propose a phase I-IIa trail to investigate the toxicity and efficacy of
      olaparib and TMZ concomitantly with radiotherapy in first line treatment of unresectable high
      risk HGG.

      Correlation between treatment response and tumor profiling will allow us to identify
      biomarkers that can be useful in treatment improvement and/or present a prognostic value.
      Then, the transfer of this approach will be evaluated in terms of compatibility with the
      requirements of diagnostic.
