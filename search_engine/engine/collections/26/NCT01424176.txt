      (6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazolediamine dihydrochloride monohydrate) is a
      synthetic amino-benzothiazole. Data from multiple in vitro and in vivo assays have suggested
      that dexpramipexole is neuroprotective. It is being investigated for the treatment ALS.

      As dexpramipexole is principally eliminated from the body by the kidneys a single oral dose
      of dexpramipexole will be administered to subjects with various stages of renal impariment
      comprising the following categories: mild, moderate, severe and ESRD subjects. Healthy
      volunteers will be matched to each catergory of renal impaired subjects.
