      research interviews for appropriate couples. The couple will meet with the program
      interviewer for approximately 2 hours. After the BL interview, couples will be scheduled to
      attend therapy sessions. Couples will complete brief within treatment self-report
      assessments. Couples will complete a post treatment follow up interview four months after
      session 1.
