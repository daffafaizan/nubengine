    
      All patients will be subjected to the following:

        -  Written informed consent.

        -  Detailed history and clinical evaluation.

      The treated areas will be photographed (in standardized settings of light and position) and
      measured in order to allow comparison and assessment of striae improvement following
      treatment.

      Patients will be allocated according to randomization into one of 3 arms:

      Arm A will be treated by fractional CO2 laser. Arm B will be treated by low level light
      therapy (LLLT). Arm C will be treated with a combination of fractional CO2 laser and LLLT.

      Digital photographs will be taken for each patient, at the baseline and 1 and 3 months after
      last session and the width of the widest striae in each patient will be measured at the same
      time. Patients will be assessed before and after treatment by one unblinded and 2 blinded
      investigators to measure the clinical improvement on a 4-point scale by comparing the
      photographs. The criteria for evaluation using a quartile grading scale will be as follows;
      0=no improvement, 1=mild improvement (<25%), 2=moderate improvement (26% - 50%), 3=good
      improvement (51% -75%), 4=excellent improvement (>76%).

      In addition, a patient satisfaction score will be rated using the following scale; 0=not
      satisfied, 1=slightly satisfied, 2= satisfied, 3=very satisfied, 4=extremely satisfied as
      well as patients' satisfaction questionnaire (Yang and Lee; 2011).
