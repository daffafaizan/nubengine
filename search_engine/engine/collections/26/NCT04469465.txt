    
      This is a multiple-region, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple-dose, study
      in participants with PNH who have clinically evident EVH on a C5 inhibitor (eculizumab or
      ravulizumab).

      Participants will be randomized to receive danicopan or placebo, in a 2:1 ratio for 12 weeks
      (Treatment Period 1) in addition to their C5 inhibitor (eculizumab or ravulizumab) therapy.
      At Week 12, participants randomized to receive placebo will be switched to danicopan in
      addition to their C5 inhibitor for an additional 12 weeks (Treatment Period 2) and
      participants randomized to danicopan will continue on danicopan for an additional 12 weeks,
      while remaining on their ongoing C5 inhibitor therapy.

      At the end of the 2 treatment periods (Week 24), participants may enter a 1-year Long-Term
      Extension (LTE) Period and continue to receive danicopan in addition to their C5 inhibitor
      therapy.
