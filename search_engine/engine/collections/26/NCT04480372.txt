      regimens is a standard of care for several solid tumors, such as advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC. It is also used in an off-label setting for pre-treated MPM or na√Øve MPM in
      combination with platin-chemotherapy.

      Atezolizumab is approved in the United States, European Union and in Switzerland for the
      treatment of NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) patients.

      A significant number of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) are not cured with available treatments and will eventually relapse.
      After relapse treatment options are limited. Preclinical in vitro studies have demonstrated a
      synergism of immunotherapy with PD(L)1-targeting monoclonal antibodies and gemcitabine
      administered in different tumors models and ongoing clinical studies showed encouraging
      results. This may represent a safe and effective therapy for patients who relapsed or did not
      respond to standard therapies.

      Patients will be treated with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle,
      (every 3 weeks) and with atezolizumab (1200 mg i.v. on day 1 of each cycle, (every 3 weeks).
      The trial treatments will be continued for max. 2 years or until discontinuation criteria are
      met. The follow-up phase will last up to 5 years from treatment start.

      The main objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy of chemotherapy (gemcitabine)
      combined with immunotherapy (atezolizumab) in patients with progressive NSCLC and MPM.
