    
      S. aureus is a leading cause of bloodstream, skin, soft tissue, and lower respiratory tract
      infections worldwide. The frequencies of both nosocomial and community-acquired S. aureus
      infections have increased steadily over the years and the treatment of these infections has
      become more challenging due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains (e.g.
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).

      S. aureus has several virulence factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection.
      Amongst them, alpha-toxin that is involved in the pathogenesis of pneumonia, as it leads to
      apoptosis and cell lysis, in particular lymphocytes, macrophages, alveolar epithelial cells,
      pulmonary endothelium, and thrombocytes.

      In spite of preventive measures for S. aureus infections and current medical treatment
      (mostly antibiotic therapy, alone or in combination), there is a clear unmet medical need in
      the clinic for additional treatment options. Passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies
      may improve treatment options for severe and life-threatening infections like those caused by
      S. aureus.
