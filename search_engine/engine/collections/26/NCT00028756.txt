      I. Compare the overall and progression-free survival of patients with stage III or IV
      transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder urothelium treated with immediate versus deferred
      adjuvant chemotherapy after radical cystectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, tumor status (pT1-2 vs pT3 vs pT4), and node status (node positive vs
      node negative with 15 or more nodes sampled vs node negative with less than 15 nodes
      sampled). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      ARM I: Beginning within 90 days of radical cystectomy, patients receive a total of 4 courses
      of adjuvant chemotherapy.

      ARM II: Beginning at the time of clinical relapse, patients receive a total of 6 courses of
      adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Patients in both arms receive one of the following chemotherapy regimens to be determined by
      participating center:

      REGIMEN A (Classical M-VAC): Patients receive classical M-VAC comprising methotrexate IV on
      days 1, 15 and 22; vinblastine IV on days 2, 15, and 22; and doxorubicin IV and cisplatin IV
      on day 2. Courses repeat every 28 days.

      REGIMEN B (High-dose M-VAC): Patients receive high-dose M-VAC comprising methotrexate IV on
      day 1 and vinblastine IV, doxorubicin IV, and cisplatin IV on day 2. Patients also receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF subcutaneously once daily on days 4-10. Courses repeat every 14 days.

      REGIMEN C (Gemcitabine and cisplatin): Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15 followed by cisplatin IV on day 1 or 2. Courses repeat every 28 days.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
