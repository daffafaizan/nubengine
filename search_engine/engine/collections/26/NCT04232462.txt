      gastrointestinal diseases.With the rapid increase in the number of endoscopies, the workload
      of endoscopists increases further.The high workload reduces the quality of endoscopy, leading
      to incomplete coverage and incomplete detection of lesions.With the rapid increase in the

      good academic research and practical value for improving the quality of endoscopic diagnosis
      and treatment.The research and development, testing and functional evaluation of artificial
      intelligence devices need to use a large number of endoscopic images, and at the same time,
      the effectiveness and safety of artificial intelligence devices need to be verified in
      different hospitals and environments.Based on this, our research group intends to collect
      endoscopic image data from different hospitals for training and validation of the model.
