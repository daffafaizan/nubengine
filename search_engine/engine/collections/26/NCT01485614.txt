    
      This trial is of approximately 56 weeks in duration, including a screening period of up to 1
      week, a 1-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a 20-week placebo-controlled, double blind
      treatment period [Phase A] and a 34-week double-blind active controlled treatment period
      [Phase B] during which participants randomized to the placebo arm who have not initiated
      glycemic rescue therapy with metformin during Phase A will receive metformin (in a blinded
      manner). A telephone contact will be performed 14 days after the last dose of study
      medication to assess for any serious adverse events (SAEs).

      Participants enrolled in the metformin and placebo/sitagliptin arms prior to implementation
      of Protocol Amendment 05 completed the study on their original treatment assignments.

      EUPASS4468 is a follow-up, non-interventional, observational assessment of safety of
      participants who participated in the MK-0431-083 study for up to 5 years.
