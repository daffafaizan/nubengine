      cancer, but as to the special type of prostate cancer-oligometastatic prostate cancer, except
      for androgen deprivation therapy, whether local treatment can be the part of treatment for
      it? The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether local treatment combined with androgen
      deprivation therapy can extend progression-free survival, as well as overall survival and
      life quality of patients of oligometastatic prostate cancer compared with androgen
      deprivation therapy alone.
