    
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an observational assessment of natural outcomes
      within the DSCP, "Quit at Duke." This is an observational study (n=3000) on patients being
      treated at the DSCP. No interventions are conducted, and data analyzed is collected in the
      course of clinical care at clinic visits to the Duke Smoking Cessation Program (DSCP). Phone
      calls are also conducted to determine response to medications and abstinence status up to 12
      months following a quit attempt. Outcomes of variables including: demographic variables,
      evaluation responses, feasibility data, and abstinence rates will be analyzed using general
      regression models using an ANOVA-based design. Because no intervention is being conducted,
      there are no safety concerns related to the study.
