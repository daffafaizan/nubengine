    
      This is a prospective, multi-centre study recruiting patients with paroxysmal AF indicated
      for AF ablation.

      180 patients will be recruited. Patients are randomised to either GP ablation alone or to
      PVI. All antiarrhythmics are stopped for at least 48 hours prior to their procedures.

      All have general anaesthesia and CARTO system (Biosense Webster, inc.) are used for 3D
      electroanatomical mapping of the left atrium.

      Patients randomised to GP ablation will have high frequency mapping performed within the
      atrial refractory period to identify ectopy or AF triggering GP (ET-GP) sites in the left
      atrium. Patients in this group will only have GP ablation and will not have pulmonary veins
      isolated.

      The primary endpoint is any documented atrial arrhythmia 30 seconds or more after a 3 month
      blanking period. This will be assessed for up to 12 months post-procedure, using 48hr Holter
      monitors at 3, 6, 9 and 12 month intervals.

      Secondary endpoints include mortality, major complications and redo procedures.
