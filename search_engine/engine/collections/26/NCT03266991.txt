    
      Eligible participants will be randomised to receive either daily isoniazid for 6 months with
      monthly visits for pill count, evaluation of adverse events and dispensing of isoniazid for
      the next month, or weekly doses of rifapentine and isoniazid for twelve weeks as direct
      observed therapy where the drugs are administered in the presence of a study nurse or doctor.

      Control bloodsamples (ALAT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, INR, haemoglobin, trombocytes
      and leukocyte differential count) will be taken at baseline and at least once during
      treatment in the rifapentine and isoniazid group and at least twice in the isoniazid-only
      group.

      One year after treatment completion participants will be called in for evaluation for active
      tuberculosis.
