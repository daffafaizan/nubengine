    
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II vaccination and challenge
      study designed to assess the protective efficacy of the ACE 527 vaccine, as well as collect
      expanded safety and immunogenicity data. The study will be carried out in two phases. In the
      initial vaccination phase, up to 72 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either ACE527
      or placebo on an outpatient basis. Vaccine and placebo preparations will be given orally.
      Following vaccination, subjects will be followed as out-patients for safety using diary card
      surveillance, for vaccine shedding by qualitative stool culture (i.e. presence or absence)
      and for the development of local and systemic antibody responses to the ACE527 vaccine
      strains. In the subsequent inpatient challenge phase, up to 56 vaccinated subjects will be
      admitted as inpatients and challenged with the ETEC strain, H10407. The challenge dose will
      be administered orally.After challenge, subjects will be monitored for diarrhea and other
      signs/symptoms of enteric illness by daily medical checks, vital sign determinations, grading
      and weighing of all stools. Monitoring for fecal shedding of the challenge ETEC strain H10407
      will occur daily, after challenge, while in-patient. Local and systemic antibody responses to
      the challenge ETEC strain H10407 will also be assessed. All subjects will be treated with
      Abx.
