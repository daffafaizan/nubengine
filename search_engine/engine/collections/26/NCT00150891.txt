      previously that patients with pretransplant CD4 helper defects and low in-vitro IL-10
      responses demonstrated an extremely low risk of acute rejection and a significantly better 1-
      and 3-year graft function whereas pretransplant Th1 responses were not predictive (Weimer R
      et al. 1996 and 1998). In liver transplant recipients, we found CD4 helper function and
      in-vitro IL-10 responses significantly decreased compared to CsA-treated patients (Zipperle
      et al. 1997). If the same effect will be demonstrated in renal transplant recipients,
      Tacrolimus (Tacr) treatment might result in enhanced graft survival compared to CsA, when CD4
      helper function and in-vitro IL-10 responses of the individual patient are elevated. Other
      studies of our group suggest a beneficial role of enhanced T-suppressor activity and of an
      IL-6 independent B cell/monocyte defect in the maintenance of long-term stable graft
      function, whereas enhanced monokine secretion (TNF-a, GM-CSF, IL-6) was found in chronic
      rejection (Weimer et al. 1990, 1992, 1994, 1998).

      In the current randomized prospective study we will analyze the impact of CsA versus Tacr and
      of MMF versus azathioprine (Aza; 3 treatment groups: CsA/Aza, CsA/MMF and Tacr/Aza; steroid
      and prophylactic ATG treatment according to the Giessen protocol) on immune parameters and
      their predictive value regarding occurrence of acute and chronic rejection. As immune
      parameters we will assess CD4 helper function, in-vitro IL-4 and IL-10 responses of T cells
      and CD4+ T cells, respectively, in allogeneic cocultures of patient T cells with control B
      cells and in PHA-stimulated T cell cultures, T-cell dependent (PWM-stimulated allogeneic
      cocultures) and T-independent (SAC I-stimulated B cell cultures) immunoglobulin-secreting
      cell (ISC) responses, B-cell IL-6 and IL-10 responses and monokine responses (LPS-stimulated
      monocyte cultures) pretransplant, and 4 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years posttransplant.
      Serum cytokines and easily measurable parameters as neopterin, sIL-1RA and sCD30 will be
      assessed at the same time points. The same is true for flow cytometric analysis of cytokine
      receptor, adhesion molecule, costimulator molecule and surface molecule expression,
      respectively, which play an important role in cell-cell interactions and tolerance induction.
      Cytokine promoter gene polymorphisms will be determined to potentially enable pretransplant
      risk estimation. To establish a broadly available and rapid diagnostic method, we will
      compare the data of intracellular cytokine testing with the results of the much more
      difficult and time consuming coculture analyses used in our previous studies.

      With a proposed follow-up of 5 years this prospective randomized study might enable a
      patient-tailored immunosuppressive therapy resulting in better graft function and prolonged
      graft survival by preventing chronic allograft rejection.
