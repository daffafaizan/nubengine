    
      Females older than 18, with normal weight ranges in addition to the presence of cutaneous
      non-infectious cellulite (edematous-fibrosclerotic panniculopathy), were recruited for the
      study and to undergo treatment with the multidisciplinary programme.

      All patients were treated with the specific multidisciplinary programme for cellulite
      (PnKCelulitis®). This programme consists of three phases or processes: the restructuring,
      drainage and toning processes, each of which combines diet, physical exercise and the
      application of an anti-cellulite cream that combines active lipolytic and vasodilator agents
      (Cellulite Gel K-Line®).

      Patient's clinical assessment follow-up was performed by the prescribing doctor for the
      multidisciplinary treatment and was done in four visits: baseline (before starting treatment)
      and at the end of each of the phases (restructuring, drainage and toning). Anthropometric
      data were recorded at each visit and a bioelectric impedance test to assess body composition
      (amount of fat mass and muscle mass). The clinical evaluation of the degree of cellulite was
      made according to the Nürnberger-Muller classification scale.

      Cutaneous ultrasound was performed by an expert dermatologist in the dermatology outpatient
      clinic of the hospital and subsequently assessed blinded. Two skin scans were done for each
      patient, one before starting the treatment and another at the end. The objective data
      collected on each ultrasound were total skin thickness, thickness of the dermis and
      hipodermis, the area of the indentations of the subcutaneous cellular tissue in the dermis
      and changes in the echogenicity of the dermis blinded and independently assessed by two
      researchers, comparing ultrasounds before and after treatment.
