      determined. As a prelude to a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the
      effect on glycemic control, hypoglycemia, and quality of life of using a GW2B versus standard
      care, the DirecNet Study Group conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the
      protocol planned for the RCT and to collect data on changes in HbA1c, frequency of
      hypoglycemia, frequency of skin reactions, and quality of life after using the GW2B for three
      months.

      Fifteen children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes participated in this study. Each
      patient was provided with a personal computer for weekly downloading of the GW2B and for
      completion of questionnaires regarding hypoglycemia and GW2B use. Participants received study
      telephone calls after 1, 2, and 4 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter to review their diabetes
      management. Participants had a follow-up visit at Week 29. The Continuous Glucose Monitoring
      System was inserted at this visit to assess hypoglycemia over three days. A follow-up visit
      was performed at Week 30 to measure HbA1c and administer psychosocial questionnaires.
