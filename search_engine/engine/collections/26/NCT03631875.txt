      sevoflurane at 7% to insert an intravenous canula was first used then decreased to 2%. Normal
      saline or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) were administered in groups P (propofol), PK
      (propofol-ketamine) respectively, 1 min prior to the administration of the induction dose of
      propofol. Propofol 3mg/kg was used for induction in the 2 groups, LM inserted 60 s later and
      insertion conditions assessed. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded immediately after
      propofol bolus, then after LM insertion, at the 3rd ,5th and 10th minutes later. Recovery was
