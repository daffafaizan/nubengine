    
      -  Design: randomized multiple center clinical trial, open label

        -  Arms: intravenous 4.2% Sodium Bicarbonate vs no additional treatment

        -  Inclusion: age of 18 yo or above, critically ill patient with a SOFA score of 4 or
           above, lactatemia of 2mmol/l or above, with pH of 7.20 or below and PaCO2 of 45mmHg or
           below and bicarbonatemia of 20mmol/l or below

        -  Exclusion: single respiratory disorder (PaCO2 > 50 mmHg, Bicarbonatemia equal or higher
           than (PaCO2-40)/10 + 24 ; acute diarrhea, ileostomy or biliary drainage ; stage IV
           kidney failure or chronic dialysis ; tubular acidosis, ketoacidosis, high anion gap
           acids poisoning (PEG, aspirin, methanol) ; PaCO2 equal to 45mmHg or above and
           spontaneous breathing, pregnancy, protected patients, moribund patient (life expectancy
           of 48h or below)

        -  Randomization: website randomization with stratification on age, presence of sepsis at
           inclusion, renal failure

        -  Intervention: experimental arm: intravenous 4.2% Sodium Bicarbonate 125 to 250ml in
           30min up to 1000ml/24h. The target is a plasma pH of 7.30 or above.

        -  An interim statistical analysis is planned when 200 patients will be included
