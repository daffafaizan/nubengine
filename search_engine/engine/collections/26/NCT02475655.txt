      myelofibrosis, a disorder in which bone marrow is replaced by scar (fibrosis) tissue. Many of
      the cytokines affected by myelofibrosis are also affected by HIV. Because of this,
      ruxolitinib may also be a possible treatment for HIV. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in HIV-positive adults who were on ART
      and who were virologically suppressed. Researchers evaluated the effect ruxolitinib had on
      inflammation and immune activation.

      This study enrolled HIV-positive adults who were on select ART regimens and who had viral
      suppression. ART was not provided by the study; participants continued to receive ART from
      their own health care providers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either
      ruxolitinib (Arm A) or no study treatment (Arm B) in 2:1 ratio. Participants in Arm A
      received ruxolitinib twice a day for 5 weeks. All participants attended study visits at entry
      (Day 0) and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 12. These visits included physical examinations,
      clinical assessments, blood collection, adherence assessments, oral swab collection, and
      pregnancy testing for female participants. At Weeks 1 and 4, participants in Arm A took part
      in pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, which involved having blood drawn several times over 6 to 8
      hours.
