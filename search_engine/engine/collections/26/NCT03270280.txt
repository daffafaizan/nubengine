      of the tooth loss in adults. World health Organisation report of 2005 described that the
      global problem persisted with the worldwide oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontal
      disease, tooth loss, oral mucosal lesions and oro-pharyngeal cancer. According to a local
      study the prevalence of periodontitis is found to be more in males of older age group and
      more in rural areas owing to the lack of awareness of importance of oral hygiene.

      Apart from various conventional treatment option for periodontitis a number of herbal
      medicinal intervention have been used for its treatment. Plant extracts and herbs that have
      been used previously used for periodontal therapy include Salvadora persica, Arnica Montana
      and Hamamelis virginiana which have been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against
      periodonto-pathic bacteria. Phytomedicines (Medicines derived from herbal plants) like indian
      gum arabic, aloe vera, nim, carvacrol, garlic, wild coffee and propolis resin have been used
      in dentistry as anti-inflammatory, antibiotics, analgesic and hypnotic agents. Propolis
      resin, guava and triphala have been also been used for the treatment of periodontitis
