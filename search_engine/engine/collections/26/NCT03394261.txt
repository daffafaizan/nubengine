    
      In response to RFA-DA-18-005 (Expanding Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use
      Disorders in the Context of the SAMHSA Opioid STR Grants, R21/R33), this project will develop
      and test a patient decision support tool called Patient Decision Aid for Medication-Assisted
      Treatment (PtDA-MAT) for use in the CA H&SS. The PtDA-MAT is designed to (1) improve patient
      knowledge and involvement and to subsequently improve treatment adherence and outcomes and
      (2) to support clinicians in informing and communicating with their patients with OUD along a
      continuum of care. The project will conduct 1 year of R21 to develop and pilot-test the
      PtDA-MAT to facilitate shared decision making in CA H&SS, followed by 3 years of R33 to
      assess the effectiveness of the PtDA-MAT in a randomized controlled trial.

      The aims of the current study phase (R21) are: Aim 1. Develop a patient decision aid
      (PtDA-MAT) by incorporating best available scientific evidence on MAT as well as feedback
      from patients and clinical providers related to clinical priorities, perceived utility, and
      acceptability; Aim 2. Conduct pilot testing of the PtDA-MAT in an iterative process guided by
      an expert panel and involving key stakeholders (e.g., patients, physicians, policymakers) and
      field-testing.
