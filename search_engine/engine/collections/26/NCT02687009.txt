      to regulated the Wnt signaling pathway in cells at the level of the Frizzled receptor.

      The Wnt pathway is critical for embryogenesis, differentiation of progenitor cells, and
      supports proliferation of neoplastic tissue. In cancer, activation of the Wnt pathway leads
      to increased transcription of genes important for growth, proliferation, differentiation,
      apoptosis, genetic stability, migration, and angiogenesis. The Wnt pathway has particular
      importance in colorectal cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to obtain safety data along with pharmacokinetic data and
      information on the changes in the WNT pathway signalling following niclosamide administration
      in humans. This phase I study will support future studies in patients with more advanced
      cancer and other cancers with dysregulation of the Wnt pathway.
