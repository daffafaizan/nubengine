      of 010 or 001 are mainly treated by crossing stent technique or direct precise positioning
      stent technology. Because of the difficulty of precise stent placement, the displacement of
      cristae across stent implantation is easy to affect the distal vessels of the side branch or
      main branch, and the long-term clinical efficacy is not good, so the standardized
      interventional therapy is still controversial. Recently, a registered study published by
      regatelli et al. Showed that spanning stent technology seems to be superior to precise
      positioning stent technology, but the major adverse cardiac event rate in clinical follow-up
      is high.

      Drug coated balloon (DCB) as a new interventional therapy in recent years, has been gradually
      used in the treatment of primary coronary artery disease in situ. The latest international
      consensus on the treatment of coronary heart disease with DCB indicates that more and more
      clinical studies have shown the safety and effectiveness of DCB in the treatment of coronary
      artery disease (â‰¥ 3.0 mm). However, there are few studies on the interventional therapy of
      DCB in the primary mediana type 010 or 001 left trunk end bifurcation lesions, especially the
      combination of "1-2mm" drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation when necessary.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and short-term clinical efficacy
      of DCB combined with DES implantation in the treatment of primary mediana 010 or 001 left
      main bifurcation lesions, and to explore a new treatment for such lesions.
