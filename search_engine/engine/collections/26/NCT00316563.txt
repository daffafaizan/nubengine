      of advanced cancer patients respond and benefit from appetite stimulants, which may be due in
      part to sensory abnormalities, as a person who is experiencing food aversion due to taste and
      smell changes may be unable to respond to these agents. Of the appetite stimulants available
      for use in clinical practice only Marinol, or THC, has the potential to increase food intake
      by improving appetite as well as by amplifying the taste of food through the brain's reward
      pathway.

      A 22-day, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted. Participants
      will start at 2.5mg of THC or placebo once daily for the first 3 days and then increase to
      2.5mg of THC or placebo twice daily before lunch and supper. Participant's will complete the
      following survey tools pre and post-treatment: Taste and Smell Survey to assess the severity
      and change in chemosensory complaint scores; 3-day dietary record to determine the change in
      caloric intake and shift in food preference by macronutrient analysis; 24-hour urine
      collections to validate the 3-day dietary record; Satiety Labelled Intensity Magnitude scale
      for subjective appetite ratings; Food Preference Checklist to assess objective shifts in
      macronutrient and flavor preferences; Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy
      questionnaire to assess participant's QOL; interview to determine the cause and effects of
      chemosensory alterations; Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale to assess nausea; and Side Effect
      Survey to document the tolerability of the drug (post-treatment only). Participants will
      complete the survey tools with the aid of the researcher. All tools are short and easy to
      complete, which minimizes patient burden.
