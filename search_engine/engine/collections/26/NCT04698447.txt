    
      This is one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The aim of the present study
      is to investigate the role of a natural product, citraVesâ„¢ on several cardiovascular risk
      factors.

      The research hypothesis is to evaluate whether this natural supplement containing
      nanovesicles delivered from Citrus Limon (L.) juice (Navhetec S.R.L., Palermo, Italy) may
      improve different cardio-metabolic parameters in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. All
      subjects will be evaluated at baseline, after 1 month and after 3 and 6 months of
      supplementation with natural product or placebo.
