      added to the conventional treatment for diminishing the pain in patients with cervicalgia of
      benign origin.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pragmatic controlled randomized clinical trial. Patients with diagnosis
      of cervicalgia of benign origin will include. They will be randomly assigned to receive just
      conventional treatment or this plus auto-acupressure.

      The professionals will once receive instruction in the Centres of Health by an experienced
      acupuncture professional that will supervise, in a workshop, the right application of the
      technique, that will consist of the application of manoeuvres of auto-acupressure by the own
      patient during periods of 10 minutes, once in a day during one week. The pain intensity will
      be evaluated by means of a millimetric scale of 10 cm (0 represents the pain absence, 10 the
      maximum imaginable pain, Numerical Scale Rating). The pain will be measured in the inclusion
      and days 1, 3, 7, 30 and 90. The sample size has been calculated to detect a minimum
      difference of 1.5 points (DS 2) in the scale of the pain in day 7, which implies the
      recruitment of, at least, 80 patients by group (if losses don't exceed 20%). Also the
      perception of the quality of life (euroQol-5D) and the functional capacity with the scale of
      Oswestry will be evaluated, at the beginning, and days 3, 7, 30 and 90. The measures in each
      point between the group will be compared control and intervention. The evolution of the
      repeated measures will compare between groups with a generalized estimating equation (GEE)
      model.
