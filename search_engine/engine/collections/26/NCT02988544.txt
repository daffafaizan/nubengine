      before transfer of embryos impact clinical pregnancy rate in single blastocyst embryo
      transfer (SBET) cycle. Women elected for SBET will be randomized on transfer day in two
      arms:the AS group where blastocoelic cavity is artificially reduced by a laser pulse prior to
      transfer and a control group.

      Clinical pregnancy rates will be compared. Secondarily, rate of monozygotic twin pregnancy
      and cell free DNA concentration in culture medium will be evaluated in the two groups.
