    
      To explore the safety and immunobiological effects of 2 cycles of duvalumab combined with
      albumin paclitaxel + cisplatin/carboplatin for patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell
      lung cancer; use whole exome sequencing , GEP gene expression profile detection based on
      NanoString platform and other methods to predict the efficacy of IMFINZI neoadjuvant therapy,
      looking for potential biomarkers; study the impact of neoadjuvant therapy of I drug on the
      tumor microenvironment at multiple levels such as genome, transcriptome, PD-1/PD-L1 protein
      transcription and expression, T cell TCR immune groupthe library and T cell subsets, and
      provide comprehensive exploratory research evidence for finding the biomarker for the
      neoadjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy of lung cancer .
