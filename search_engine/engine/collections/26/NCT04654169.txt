      a person's quality of life by causing severe pain and limitation in the movements of the
      shoulder joint in all directions. Although the underlying etiology is not clear, it may
      develop as a result of primary (idiopathic) or secondary causes such as diabetes mellitus,
      malignancy, thyroid dysfunction, hypoadrenalism, Parkinson's disease, stroke, cardiac and
      pulmonary diseases, or local shoulder problems such as trauma, tendinitis, rupture. Prolonged
      immobilization after injuries is another important risk factor for adhesive capsulitis. It is
      more common in women between the ages of 40-60. Conservative approaches including
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral corticosteroid usage and physiotherapy program
      are the first choice for the treatment. The physiotherapy program consisting range of motion
      (ROM), stretching and strengthening exercises are often painful and prevent the patient's
      full participation. For this reason, interventional procedures such as intra-articular
      corticosteroid injection (IAI) and suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) are preferred to be
      applied before the physiotherapy program.

      The aim of this study is to reveal both short and long-term effects of SSNB and IAI
      combination on pain, shoulder ROM, disability, and quality of life in patients with adhesive
      capsulitis. It is hypothesized that the addition of SSNB to IAI results in greater
      improvements in pain, passive and active shoulder ROMs, disability, and quality of life. The
      primary outcome measure of the study is determined to be the Shoulder Pain and Disability
      Index (SPADI), while the secondary outcome measures to be the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS),
      active and passive ROMs, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36).
