      failure in the intensive care units (ICUs) annually and up to 80% of them develop delirium
      during their ICU stay. Presence of delirium predisposes older adults to immediate in-hospital
      complications including a longer length of ICU and hospital stay, increased risk of
      in-patient mortality and elevated costs of care. In addition, ICU delirium is associated with
      long-term post-discharge complications such as development of cognitive impairment and
      dementia.

      Recent research studies exploring pharmacological strategies to manage ICU delirium have not
      demonstrated efficacy; a limitation also acknowledged in the Society of Critical Care
      Medicine 2018 Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption
      guidelines. Music listening is a non-pharmacological intervention that has shown to decrease
      over-sedation, anxiety and stress in critically ill patients, factors that could predispose
      to ICU delirium. Our team is now proposing to conduct a large randomized clinical trial
      called "Decreasing Delirium through Music (DDM) in Critically Ill Older Adults to evaluate
      the efficacy of a seven-day slow-tempo music intervention on the primary outcome of
      delirium/coma free days among mechanically-ventilated older adults admitted to the ICU.
