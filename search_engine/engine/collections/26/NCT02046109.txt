    
      This study is a single-blind randomized non-inferiority trial using parallel groups.

      Patients recruited into the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.
      Subjects allocated to Group 1 will have their defective restoration completely replaced while
      subjects allocated to Group 2 will have their defective restoration repaired.

      The success of the treatments will be assessed immediately following the intervention
      (baseline) and 12 months later.
