      reports, to give good results when applied for anxiety disorders. In this study 72 patients
      will be randomized to three groups. 24 patients will receive cognitive therapy as a control
      method, 24 patients will receive thought field therapy. The remaining 24 patients will wait
      three months, and then be randomized to either of the two therapies.

      Before inclusion all patients will be diagnosed with M.I.N.I. and SCID II. They will fill out
      self evaluation forms for symptoms and quality of life, before and after treatment, and one
      year after treatment.

      All patients will undergo an interview with ADIS on panic and agoraphobic diagnosis and
      symptoms before starting treatment, and on panic and agoraphobic symptoms immediately after
      and one year after treatment. These interviews will be done by psychologists who are blinded
      for which type of treatment the patients have got.
