      cancers. Approximately 34 million U.S. adults currently smoke cigarettes, but over half of
      all smokers attempt to quit smoking each year. However, only about 6% quit successfully, in
      part, because many smokers make unassisted quit attempts, due to the lack of accessibility of
      cessation programs. Mobile health (mHealth) smoking cessation programs delivered through
      smartphone applications ('apps') can potentially reach a large number of smokers in the U.S.,
      as 81% of U.S. adult smokers own a smartphone. The National Cancer Institute hosts
      Smokefree.gov, a suite of free, publicly available smoking cessation resources. In addition
      to web based and text-messaging resources, Smokefree.gov launched the quitSTART smartphone
      app in 2013, which is a publicly available smoking cessation app.

      Participants in this study will be asked to complete a pre-cessation assessment, then
      download, install, and try to quit smoking using the smoking cessation smartphone
      application, quitSTART. Participants will be asked to use quitSTART for 4 weeks. Participants
      will also be asked to complete online surveys 2 and 4 weeks after the start of the study. To
      understand how people are using quitSTART, the investigators will collect quitSTART usage
      data from all participants (for example, how often someone opens quitSTART during the study
      period and what specific features someone uses).
