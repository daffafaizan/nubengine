      of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The study
      is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of venlafaxine (a serotonin and
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, also known as Effexor). Venlafaxine has been well
      established in the treatment of MDD in healthy individuals and is a recommended depression
      treatment agent for persons with TBI. By using a rigorous scientific methodology, this study
      will be an important first step in advancing the treatment of depression in this population
      beyond general impressions to proven treatments.
