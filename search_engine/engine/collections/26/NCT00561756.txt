      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramuscular DNA vaccination with a plasmid
           DNA vector expressing the mouse extracellular domain of CD20, namely pINGmminiCD20.
           Doses of pING-mminiCD20 will be escalated by group to determine the optimal biological
           dose.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate antibody and T-cell responses to CD20 after vaccination.

        -  To observe patients for evidence of any antitumor response generated after vaccination.

      OUTLINE: The entire immunization schedule comprises five injections administered every three
      weeks (for a total of approximately four and one half months). After the second injection,
      blood will be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses. After the fifth and
      final injection, blood will again be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses.
