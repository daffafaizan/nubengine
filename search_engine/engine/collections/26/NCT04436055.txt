      of 18 and 40 years. Urine samples for qualitative drug and cotinine testing will be collected
      from mother-father dyads, as well as quantitative THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and THCCOOH
      (11-nor-9-carboxy-THC) assay. A semen sample will be collected from biological fathers.
      Relevant birth outcome data including both infant and maternal measures will be extracted
      from the electronic health record (EHR). Infant developmental assessments will be completed
      at approximately 6 months of age.
