      functional symptoms. Placebo response rates in clinical trials are high. Several non-invasive
      biomarkers are currently available for assessing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) disease
      activity including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin.
      Although these markers hold some promise, their performance is less than ideal. What is
      needed is a simple, non-invasive, biologic measure of Crohn's disease.

      Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and is expressed in
      epithelial inflammatory conditions and some cancers. We have developed an assay to quantify
      the major urinary metabolite of PGE2, PGE-M. PGE-M has been previously shown to be elevated
      in the urine of patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia relative to controls.
