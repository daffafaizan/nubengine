      (cadaver) tissue. Both treatments have well-documented shortcomings (i.e., autologous tissue
      exposes patients to increased morbidity and allograft tissue use is limited by global
      availability and quality).

      There are currently no effective artificial materials or xenograft tissue substitutes widely
      available. The purpose of this multicenter clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the Z-Lig in Subjects who require reconstruction of primary ruptured anterior
      cruciate ligaments and compare those results to allograft.
