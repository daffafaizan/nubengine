      procedures, along with the recovery process. Although 5-year survival in lung cancer has
      increased to 60%, there is a general prejudice that lung cancer has a poor prognosis. A
      preliminary diagnosis of a such condition has consequently a negative effect on the mood and
      sleep patterns of the patients, starting already from the beginning of the diagnostic
      procedures. In our study, we want to evaluate the occurrence of sleep disorders, anxiety,
      depressive mood and functional outcomes before and 3 months after the surgical intervention.
      This would also help us to better identify the patients in need for professional support for
      sleep disorders as well as psychiatric conditions, and thus, a better management of patients
      with lung cancer.
