    
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      dose of AVM0703 in patients with moderate, severe or immediately life-threatening ARDS due to
      COVID-19 or Influenza (A or B) infection.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 2)
      evaluate potential clinical findings following a single dose of AVM0703.

      The exploratory objective of the study is to assess potential biomarkers indicative of
      natural killer T (NKT) cell activity and biomarkers predictive of response to AVM0703 in
      peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage.

      The results of the Phase 1 study will guide the design of the Phase 2 study.
