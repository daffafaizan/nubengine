    
      This a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of HIV-related Neurological
      Disorders in the countries of the Asia-Pacific Region. Researchers will visit each country
      site for a period of 2-3 weeks and work with local investigators. Outpatients will be
      evaluated once-only for the presence of HIV-related symptomatic peripheral neuropathy and
      HIV-related Neurocognitive Impairment. Inpatients at the sites will be evaluated once-only
      for the presence of HIV dementia, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cerebral tuberculosis, cryptococcal
      meningitis, lymphoma, PML and CMV encephalitis.

      The Primary outcomes are:

        1. To determine the prevalence of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment and ADC at the
           APNAC-10 sites

        2. To determine the prevalence of symptomatic peripheral sensory neuropathy at the APNAC-10
           sites

        3. To determine the prevalence of central nervous system opportunistic infections and
           tumours at the APNAC-10 sites

      The secondary outcomes are:

      To determine the degree of cognitive impairment in patients presenting with HIV-related
      cognitive impairment at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To determine the CD4 cell counts, HIV viral loads HIV viral loads and prior AIDS
           defining illnesses (ADIs) of patients presenting with HIV-related neurocognitive
           impairment and ADC at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To compare the prevalence of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment and ADC at the
           APNAC-10 sites to the published pre-HAART prevalence of these conditions in developed
           countries

        -  To compare the prevalence of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment and ADC between the
           APNAC-10 sites

        -  To describe the severity of symptoms of patients presenting with symptomatic peripheral
           sensory neuropathy at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To determine the CD4 cell counts, HIV viral loads HIV viral loads and prior ADIs of
           patients presenting with symptomatic peripheral sensory neuropathy at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To determine what proportion of symptomatic peripheral sensory neuropathy may be
           ascribed to HIV alone, to the use of nucleoside analogues

        -  To compare the prevalence of symptomatic peripheral sensory neuropathy at the APNAC-10
           sites to the published pre-HAART prevalence of these conditions in developed countries

        -  To compare the prevalence of symptomatic peripheral sensory neuropathy between the
           APNAC-10 sites

        -  To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic peripheral neuropathy

        -  To describe the presenting symptoms and signs of patients presenting with CNS OIs and
           tumours at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To describe the neuroradiological findings of patients presenting with CNS OIs and
           tumours at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To determine the serological, culture and other diagnostic test results of patients
           presenting with CNS OIs and tumours at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To determine the CD4 cell counts, HIV viral loads and prior ADIs of patients presenting
           with CNS OIs and tumours at the APNAC-10 sites

        -  To compare the prevalence of CNS OIs and tumours at the APNAC-10 sites to the published
           pre-HAART prevalence of these conditions in developed countries

        -  To compare the prevalence of CNS OIs and tumours between the APNAC-10 sites
