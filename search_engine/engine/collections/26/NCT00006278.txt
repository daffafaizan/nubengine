      growth of the adrenal cortex. Normal or elevated ACTH levels can amplify this stimulus,
      leading to hypercortisolism and growth of the adrenal gland, a clinical condition recognized
      as Cushing's syndrome. However, some patients with hypercortisolism of Cushing's syndrome
      have suppressed rather than normal or high levels of ACTH. This pilot study seeks to better
      understand the apparently autonomous nature of hypercortisolism in two benign causes of
      Cushing's syndrome, adrenal adenomas and massive macronodular adrenal disease (MMAD).

      Patients with low levels of ACTH and Cushing's syndrome will undergo routine tests to confirm
      that they have hypercortisolism, low ACTH, and adenoma or MMAD on CT scans. They will fill
      out a questionnaire about quality of life. They will also undergo 3-7 days of research
      testing with a variety of agents to investigate whether these agents increase cortisol.
      Following this, patients will be scheduled for adrenalectomy at the NIH. This is the standard
      treatment for these conditions. The abnormal tissue obtained at surgery will be used for
      laboratory studies to evaluate whether the same or other agents may be the cause of excess
      cortisol production.

      After surgery, patients will be discharged to the care of their local health care provider,
      but will continue to fill out questionnaires on the quality of life for two years.
