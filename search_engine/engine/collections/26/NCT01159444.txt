    
      Observational study of patients under home positive pressure mechanical ventilation, in a
      stable condition.

      Data recorded by ventilator software is downloaded by specialized nurses during elective home
      visits, as well as spirometry, results of recent pulse oximetry, ventilator settings,
      diagnosis, and basic anthropometric data.

      Items recorded by ventilator software are: tidal volume, total ventilation, apnea and
      hypopnea index, leaks, percentage of inspiratory cycles triggered by ventilator, spontaneous
      and back-up respiratory rates.

      Results are reported by diagnostic group. Statistical analysis (univariate and multivariate)
      aims to determine which variables are related to unintentional leaks, and whether ventilator
      settings differ significantly between diagnostic groups.
