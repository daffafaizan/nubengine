      allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) as a supplementary
      intervention in combination with standard COPD medication treatments in patients with
      moderate-to-severe COPD based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
      (GOLD) 2019 and Vietnam Ministry of Health's guidelines. This matched case-control phase I/II
      trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between June
      2020 and December 2021. In this study, 40 patients will be enrolled and assigned into two
      age-, gender- and COPD condition-matched groups, including a UC-MSC group and a control
      group. Both groups will receive standard COPD medication treatment based on the GOLD 2019
      guidelines and the Vietnam Ministry of Health protocol. The UC-MSC group will receive two
      doses of thawed UC-MSC product with an intervention interval of 3 months. The primary outcome
      measures will include the incidence of prespecified administrationassociated adverse events
      (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The efficacy will be evaluated based on the absolute
      changes in the number of admissions, arterial blood gas analysis, lung function and lung
      fibrosis via CT scan and chest X-ray. The clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline
      and 3, 6, and 12 months post
