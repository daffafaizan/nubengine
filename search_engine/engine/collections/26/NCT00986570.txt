      several organic systems. This process is expressed through multiple symptoms and signs, the
      wrinkles and flaccidity being the most common and visible ones.

      In both developed and emerging countries, the interest in skin ageing is, to a greater
      extent, the result of the progressive increase in the absolute number and the proportion of
      people experiencing the ageing process in the last century. The psychosocial, as well as the
      physiological effects of the skin ageing raised a huge demand for a better understanding of
      this process and, in particular, of the effective interventions.

      The use of the botulinum toxin type-A (BTX/A) for aesthetic indication emerged as a result of
      the clinical observation of those patients treated for facial different dystonia and who
      presented additional improvement of their expression lines.

      The expression lines are most easily noted on the upper third of the face, where surgical
      treatments are fully invasive and show lesser noticeable results. The upper third of the face
      was targeted for BTX/A treatment and reported in several scientific literature articles as
      well succeeded.
