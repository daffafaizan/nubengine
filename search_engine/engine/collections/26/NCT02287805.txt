      family pattern. The different forms of the disease will have different repercussions on
      intra-family relationships.

      The quality of the announcement done by the doctor influences the way how the subjects
      (parents and patients themselves) appropriate and incorporate it at short, medium and long
      term.

      This research will contribute to the knowledge of this rare disease by different scientific
      communities: social sciences, medicine and neuropsychology. The originality of this research
      lies in interdisciplinary teams involved and the cross looks between professional and
      associative fields.

      To better understand the impact of congenital malformations and specifically those related to
      craniosynostosis, the experiences of children and their families at short, medium and long
      term, the research will take place in the center of reference "Dysostoses craniofacial",
      Pediatric Neurosurgery Service at the Necker Hospital in Paris.

      Prior to fieldwork, a thorough literature search will be conducted on issues related to our
      subject: the announcement, psychological, identity, family and social impacts, as well as the
      specifics of the disease and its manifestations.

      The fieldwork will be included in a longitudinal approach which will be located at the
      intersection of quantitative and qualitative methods.
