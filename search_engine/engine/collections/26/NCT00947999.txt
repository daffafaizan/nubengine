      (EEG), a device that measures the electrical activity in the brain through electrodes put on
      the scalp. There is no risk of electrical shock. Research staff will put a cap on the
      subject's head that has electrodes that will measure your brain activity. In addition to the
      electrodes in the cap, two electrode clips will be put on your ears. EEG activity will be
      collected for 20 minutes: subjects will have their eyes open for ten minutes, and then eyes
      closed for ten minutes.

      Before the assessment, subjects will be asked how much pain they are currently in. Once the
      20-minute assessment has ended, the research staff member will again ask subjects how much
      pain they are currently in, and how much pain they had during the EEG assessment. Subjects
      with SCI-related pain on a daily basis may also be contacted in the future to see if they
      want to participate in the second phase of this study that will involve learning to directly
      change their brain activity.
