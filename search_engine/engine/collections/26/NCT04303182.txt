      single site total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair /LESS TEP/ and traditional total
      extraperitoneal hernia repair with 3 ports /TEP/.

      Inguinal hernia is one of the most common surgical diseases. Laparoscopic hernia repairs
      include two types, TEP and TAPP. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was associated with less
      post operative pain, a shorter recovery period and better cosmetic results. Efforts are
      continuing to further reduce the port related morbidities and improve the cosmetic outcomes
      of laparoscopic surgery, including reduction of the size and number of ports. This has led to
      the evolution of a novel surgical approach now collectively known as laparoendoscopic
      single-site surgery.

      200 patients will undergo TEP inguinal hernia repair. They will be randomized in two groups
      by sealed envelope method.

      Group A: Standard TEP with 3 ports (10mm. and 2 ports of 5mm.). In case of difficulty in
      Standard 3 port TEP inguinal hernia repair, the procedure will be converted to TAPP.

      Group B: LESS TEP with single skin incision 2-3cm. In case of difficulty in LESS TEP inguinal
      hernia repair, the procedure will be converted to standard 3 port repair or TAPP.

      Patient will be informed at consenting that 3 wound plasters will be applied to their abdomen
      regardless of whether they are in the single port or 3- ports group so that they would not
      know which group they have been randomized to. The blind will only be lifted after pain score
      and area of pain has been recorded before discharge.
