      This study will objectively measure brace wear-rate in patients with clubfoot that have
      already been prescribed a foot ankle orthosis. The use of a monitoring device will be able to
      give objective data on actual patient compliance with brace wear. It is hypothesized that
      objective compliance data will allow physicians to better assess the patient's therapy
      progress and outcome, troubleshoot problems or issues associated with barriers to brace wear,
      and better educate families confronted with having a child with clubfoot. Long term goals
      will then attempt to determine whether certain brace designs can increase wear time thus
      decreasing the rate of clubfoot recurrence.
