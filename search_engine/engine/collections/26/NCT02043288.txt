      diagnosis. Gemcitabine (GEM) is the standard treatment for advanced and metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. According to preclinical data and few early phase studies, a combined use of
      gemcitabine and cisplatin (CDDP) showed synergistic efficacy against pancreatic cancer.
      NC-6004, a novel micellar cisplatin formulation, retains the activity but avoids the renal
      toxicity and neurotoxicity caused by the high peak Cmax concentrations of cisplatin. This
      trial is designed to evaluate the impact of the addition of NC-6004 to gemcitabine in the
      treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that NC-6004 plus gemcitabine combination is superior to
      gemcitabine alone in terms of overall survival in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
      cancer patients
