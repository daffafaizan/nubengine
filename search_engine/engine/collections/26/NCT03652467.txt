      an important transition metal for organisms and the liver plays a major role in its storage.
      However, in pathologic conditions, it will lead to hepatocyte injury through the free
      radicals generated by excess iron. In addition, excess iron accumulation in the liver
      increases toxic free iron, which is closely associated with hepatic inflammation, as well as
      the development and progression of HCC. Reduction of iron is likely an important therapeutic
      targets for treating HCC. Iron reduction therapy has been efficacious in both in animal HCC
      models and results of clinical studies also suggest potential efficacy for HCC. DFO chelates
      iron by forming a stable complex that prevents the iron from entering into further chemical
      reactions. The investigators assume that DFO, combined with TACE, may provide additional
      efficacy in patients with unresectable HCC.
