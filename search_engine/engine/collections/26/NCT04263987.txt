    
      This is a single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing
      MOLEP to HOLEP. Inclusion criteria included all symptomatic BPH patients desiring enucleation
      with prostate sizes > 80ccs based on cross-sectional imaging. Patients are randomized in a
      1:1 fashion and the study ispowered to evaluate for a difference in hematocrit change
      postoperatively (i.e. alpha=0.05, for a 50% difference in groups, N=21 per group). All
      surgeries will be performed with a 550 Î¼m fiber. At the start of each case, a laser
      technician would be notified of randomization via envelope and randomize the settings to
      either Moses or traditional mode. The surgeons and patients were blinded to which mode was
      used. All surgeries will be performed using a two lobe technique and laser settings between
      2J and 20-40Hz. Further recorded endpoints include reduction in International Prostate
      Symptom Score (IPSS), improvement in uroflow parameters, and complications postoperatively at
      6 weeks.
