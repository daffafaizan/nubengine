      at Boston Children Hospital to decrease variations in clinical practice in critical asthma
      therapies for children. However the effects of the Critical Asthma SCAMP on the clinical
      outcomes in children with critical asthma are unknown. This study will assess the
      effectiveness of the SCAMP by comparing retrospective data from medical records in children
      with critical asthma to prospective clinical PPSQ SCAMP outcome data obtained during the QA
      process of the SCAMP. The primary aim is to determine whether a Critical Asthma SCAMP can
      improve clinical outcome. There are three specific pathways in the Critical Asthma SCAMP. The
      primary outcome measure is the length of intensive care length of stay (defined as time to
      every 2 hr intermittent albuterol nebulization) for all three pathways. The secondary aim is
      to validate a clinical asthma score to direct critical asthma therapies. To achieve this goal
      we will determine the relationships of the driver(s) of the SCAMP which includes Boston
      Children Hospital (BCH) Asthma Severity Score [HASS] and non-invasive measures of pCO2 to
      standard measures of severity of asthma (blood gases and peak flow measurements).
