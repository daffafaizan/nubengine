    
      Participants will complete 4 different snack patterns. Each pattern will include 3
      nonconsecutive weekdays (i.e., Monday/Wednesday/Friday; Tuesday/Thursday/Monday, etc.). The
      snack patterns will be performed at home/work.

      The first pattern will simply be a measurement of typical snack habits. For each of the 3
      days, the participant will enter all foods and beverages consumed using the online program,
      Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24).

      For the other 3 patterns, different snack packouts will be provided to the participant for 3
      nonconsecutive weekdays/pattern. The only difference between the packouts is the type of
      foods provided. The packouts contain commercially available foods commonly eaten by people
      who snack. Following lunch, the participant will be permitted to eat as much or as little as
      he/she chooses from the packout until going to bed. Beverages will not be provided and the
      participant could drink whatever he/she typically consumes.

      For all patterns, the participant will be provided with a standardized breakfast, lunch, and
      dinner to consume at home/work for each of the 3 days/pattern.
