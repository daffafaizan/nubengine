        1. Better knowledge of factors relates to inappropriate use of secondary cardiovascular
           prevention drugs and lack of adherence to treatment will help to design new strategies
           for improving patients' management.

        2. A Fixed Dose Combination (FDC, polypill) including three components with a well
           demonstrated efficacy will improve secondary prevention in coronary patients by
           decreasing inappropriate prescribing and by reducing complexity of treatment and lack of
           adherence.

             -  Phase 1 is a descriptive, non-interventional study. Its aim is to provide a
                comprehensive analysis of potential factors precluding adequate secondary
                prevention, including Health system characteristics, drugs affordability and
                availability, as well as patients' characteristics. Differences between the two
                studied regions (Europe and South America) will be analyzed.

             -  Phase 2 is an interventional, randomized trial with prospective economic
                evaluation. It will be organised as a two-arm, randomised, parallel, multinational
                study. Patients completing the Phase 1, and fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria
                (see below), will be included in Phase 2. Patients will be randomized to receive a
                FDC of ramipril, simvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid or the three medications
                separately.
