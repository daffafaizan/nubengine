      single-dose crossover bioequivalence study under fasting conditions. The total duration of
      the study, screening through study exit, was approximately 8 weeks with at least a 14-day
      washout period between doses. At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site
      at least 36 hours prior to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1
      dosing. Blood sample collections were obtained within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and
      after dose administration at 0.167, 0.25, 0.333, 0.417, 0.5, 0.583, 0.667, 0.833, 1, 1.25,
      1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours. A total
      of 30 blood samples were collected per study period for a total of 60 samples or 180 mL total
      volume.
