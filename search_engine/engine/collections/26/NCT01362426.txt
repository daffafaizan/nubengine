    
      This study involves the establishment of PEARL, an Australian Quality Use of Medicine
      clinical registry designed to collect clinical and social data on up to 300 patients with
      schizophrenia for a 12-month period after initiating treatment with intramuscular (IM)
      injections of paliperidone palmitate as part of their routine clinical care. Continuous
      feedback of clinical outcomes will be via regular reports to all registry sites. Enrollment
      in PEARL should be considered only after the clinical decision to prescribe IM paliperidone
      palmitate has already been made because the treating physician has determined that this
      treatment is the best option for the patient. Observational Study - No investigational drug
      administered
