    
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, triple blind placebo-control with parallel groups.
      Patients diagnosed with mild to moderate AD will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a
      blinded fashion to receive study drug APH-1105. Groups will receive either 0.5 µg (15 active,
      5 placebo), 1.0 µg (15 active, 5 placebo), or 2.0 µg (15 active, 5 placebo). A full
      assessment will be made of all relevant tolerability and safety data.

      Patients will be administered the study drug outside of the clinic setting by a study partner
      twice a week. The initial dose of APH-1105 will take place in a clinic setting for the
      purpose of collecting initial Pharmacokinetic data.

      The total duration for patient participation will be approximately 18 weeks which includes 1
      week for screening, 12 weeks of treatment and followup 4 weeks post final dose. Study visits
      will occur during screening, baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 for a total of 7 visits.
      Week 16 represents the followup visit after the final dose of study medication.

      Cognitive assessments will be performed at screening, and will repeat at weeks 4, 12 and 16.
      Behavioral Functioning and Quality of Life measures will be done at weeks 2,4,8,12 and 16.

      Blood samples will collected though out the study for Pharmacokinetic analyses.
