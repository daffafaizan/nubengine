      former inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by irreversible competitive inhibition of
      Î²-lactamase. The antimicrobial effect of cefotaxime can be enhanced by the two combined. The
      compound specifically aims to the mechanism of bacterial resistance, extending the life of
      Piperacillin in the treatment-resistant pathogen infections.
