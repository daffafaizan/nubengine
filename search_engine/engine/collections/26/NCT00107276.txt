        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed) in women
           with stage IV breast cancer treated with oral cyclophosphamide and oral capecitabine.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-14 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at weeks 7, 13, 19, and 25.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
