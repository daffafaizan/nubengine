      remains in dispute. Some randomized control trials published in recent years (including
      ASTRAL and CORAL trials) showed the lack of additional benefit for renal artery
      revascularization compared with sole medical therapy. However,these randomized control trials
      presented a number of limitations including low numbers of patients and non-stringent
      inclusion criteria. Given clinical medical practice entering the era of big data, the
      large-sample real-word studies would be more objective to answer some pending issues of
      randomized controlled trial.Therefore,a multicenter prospective registry planned to recruit
      more than 5 000 patients with renal artery stenosis was carried out. This primary purpose of
      this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of renal artery revascularization in the
      real world. The secondary purpose was to investigate the etiologic distribution of renal
      artery stenosis and optimize the indications for renal artery revascularization.
