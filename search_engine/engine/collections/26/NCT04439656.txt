      a caregiver. EEG is the best method that we have to detect seizures- but it is uncomfortable
      for long term use outside of the hospital. The goal of this study is to develop a comfortable
      system that uses a wearable eye-tracker similar to eyeglasses to assist people with epilepsy
      in counting and measuring the severity of seizures. People participating in this study will
      have a routine EEG performed while an eye tracker measures eye movements. After the EEG is
      complete the researchers will compare the eye movements to the EEG to develop a software
      program that can detect seizures from eye movements.
