      accomplish prior to discharge from hospital. Feeding is a complex task for the premature
      infant to accomplish and it often takes many weeks for the infant to learn how to feed.
      Therefore, tube feeding is required for the infant to ingest adequate nutrition during the
      transition from gavage feeding to oral feeding. Both intermittent oral gavage tube placement
      and indwelling nasogastric tube placement are acceptable methods for feeding preterm infants.
      However, it is not known which tube feeding method will support an expedited transition to
      oral feeding. The choice of using one method over the other is currently based on the
      individual health care provider's opinion or historical institutional practices and
      insufficient evidence is available to guide tube feeding practices.
