      response to weekly paclitaxel plus estramustine in patients with metastatic hormone
      refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the effect on quality of life of this regimen in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Patients receive oral
      estramustine the day before, the day of, and the day after paclitaxel administration each
      week. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease
      progression. A quality of life questionnaire is completed before treatment and 2 months after
      treatment initiation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17 patients will be accrued for this study.
