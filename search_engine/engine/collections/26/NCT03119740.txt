      complications after appendectomy is about 9% [9]. The predictive value of CRP as an indicator
      of postoperative complications has been addressed in a small number of studies. The aim of
      the present retrospective analysis was to determine whether postoperative CRP levels are a
      reliable predictor of postoperative complications.

      Methods: This retrospective single-center cohort study comprised 744 patients who had
      undergone open or laparoscopic appendectomy for clinically suspected appendicitis between 1
      January 2011 and 31 December 2015 at the department of general and visceral surgery, Kepler
      University Hospital in Linz, Austria. Demographic data, the surgical technique, postoperative
      complications, histopathological findings, postoperative white blood counts, and C-reactive
      protein levels were evaluated.
