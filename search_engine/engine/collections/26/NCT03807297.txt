      Radical Mastectomy

      Objective:

        -  Feasibility of TIVA in Modified Radical Mastectomy

        -  Cost - effectiveness of TIVA Vs Inhalational anesthesia

        -  Effectiveness of TIVA as compared to Inhalational Anaesthesia by comparing
           intraoperative hemodynamic parameters and recovery profile.

      Study design: It will be a prospective randomized controlled interventional type of study.

      Sample size: Total 100 patients will be recruited for two groups i.e. 50 each in -TIVA (T)
      and Inhalational (I) group. Groups will be allocated as per chit system to remove the bias.

      In group T: (TIVA): Inj. Dexmedetomidine will be started at induction @1mcg/kg over 10 min
      followed by 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr along with propofol @ 75mcg/kg/min (25-100 mcg/kg/min) for
      maintenance of anaesthesia.

      In group I: (inhalational): both nitrous oxide (in ratio of 50:50 with oxygen) and
      sevoflurane will be started at induction.

      In both groups drugs and gases (respective to groups) will be titrated to maintain a
      bispectral index value between 40-60. Anaesthetic drugs will be stopped at last skin suture.
      Soon after reversal- recovery profile, modified Aldrete score will be recorded along with
      time taken to first eye opening and attainment of BIS value of >90. At the end of case amount
      of each agents consumed will be recorded - i.e. nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, propofol,
      dexmedetomodine- for cost analysis.
