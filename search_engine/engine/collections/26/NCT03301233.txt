      further induces the production of progesterone receptors. As a result, infertile patients who
      demonstrated thin endometrium, were offered estradiol (E2) remedies, in an attempt to improve
      endometrial proliferation. Most of the studies regarding E2 treatment in patients with thin
      endometrium dealt with frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles. Moreover, while there are
      several routes and duration of administration of E2, including per Os, transdermal,
      Intramuscular and vaginal, no compelling advantage for one protocol for endometrial
      preparation over another, with regard to pregnancy rates, has been established.

      Sildenafil acts as a type 5-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor hence augments the
      vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide by preventing the degradation of cGMP. Nitric oxide (NO)
      relaxes vascular smooth muscle through a cGMP-mediated pathway and NO synthase isoforms have
      been identified in the uterus. A decade ago, Sher and Fisch studied the effect of vaginal
      sildenafil on the endometrial thickness of infertile patients with poor endometrial
      development, who underwent IVF treatment. They have demonstrated improved uterine artery
      blood flow and endometrial growth, with higher implantation and ongoing pregnancy rates
      following vaginal sildenafil administration.
