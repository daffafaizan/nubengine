      improve PrEP uptake and adherence among PWID through the following three phases:

        -  Phase 1 will identify the modifiable determinants of PrEP uptake and adherence among
           HIV-uninfected PWID using in-depth qualitative interviews with PWID and key informants
           (KIs). Qualitative interviews will explore perceived acceptability and identify barriers
           and facilitators to PrEP uptake and adherence among ~30 HIV-uninfected PWID and explore
           perspectives on optimal PrEP delivery methods with ~15 KIs (e.g., PrEP physicians,
           community-based organization staff members with experience working with PWID).

        -  Phase 2 will involve identifying intervention targets and adapting existing intervention
           strategies to improve PrEP uptake and adherence among PWID. This will involve reviewing
           the literature to identify and select components of existing, evidence-based medication
           adherence interventions to adapt for the unique determinants of PrEP uptake and
           adherence among PWID. Investigators will then develop and iteratively refine and
           finalize an intervention manual by conducting an open-pilot of the intervention in a
           community-based setting. Refinements will be based on feedback from qualitative
           exit-interviews with the interventionist and ~10 PWID.

        -  Phase 3 will involve pilot testing the resulting PrEP uptake and adherence intervention
           in a selected community-based setting to obtain preliminary data on PrEP uptake and
           adherence outcomes (primary outcomes) and intervention feasibility and acceptability
           (secondary outcomes). Investigators will use a pilot RCT design with a mixed methods
           process evaluation in which 50 HIV-uninfected PWID will be randomized to the PrEP
           intervention or a control condition (SEP standard of care; n=25 per arm). Investigators
           will assess changes in PrEP outcomes (primary outcomes of uptake and adherence) and key
           implementation measures (e.g., secondary outcomes of acceptability, feasibility,
           adoption by the interventionist).
