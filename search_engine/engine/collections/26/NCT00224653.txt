      protocol by an ethic committee. Anesthesia is standardized and all patients are intubated.
      Precise protocols are used to perform pressure and volume controlled ventilation in order to
      regulate End-Tidal CO2 between 33 and 35 mmHg. Primary goal is comparison of plateau
      pressures observed in the 2 ventilation modes after 45 minutes of pneumoperitoneum. Secondary
      goals are : comparison of PaO2 and PaCO2 after 45 minutes of pneumoperitoneum and after 2
      hours spent in post-anesthesia care unit ; comparison of total respiratory resistances and
      peak flow generated between the 2 modes.
