    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative reduction of Propionibacterium
      acnes (P. acnes) in-vivo following once daily topical administration of BPX-01 Minocycline 1%
      Topical Gel or BPX-01 Vehicle control Gel.

      A secondary objective is to assess the tolerance of the treatment regimen versus a vehicle
      control. Safety laboratory data (chemistry and hematology) and plasma levels of minocycline
      are also of significant interest to the sponsor.

      This is a single center, randomized, double blind, two-cell, vehicle controlled P. acnes
      study. All subjects will be randomized 2:1 to 1% BPX-01 or vehicle control to be applied as a
      topical gel once daily for four (4) weeks.

      This is a six (6) week study with a four (4) week treatment period and a two (2) week post
      treatment follow up visit. The clinical endpoint is in-vivo quantification of P.acnes. The
      safety/tolerance endpoints are; observer reported: erythema, scaling-peeling, edema, and
      subject reported: tightness, burning-stinging, and itching. Plasma levels of minocycline and
      basic hematology and chemistry laboratory values will be collected.
