      delivery in critical care and anesthetic management. Although promising, further high-quality
      studies examining the effects of using HFNO during procedural sedation are required to inform
      decision-making regarding implementation of this new technology into practice. The 2018
      guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiology stated that there is insufficient
      evidence regarding which methods of supplemental oxygen administration (e.g., nasal cannula,
      face mask, or specialized devices such as HFNO) are more effective. This trial will address
      this limitation in the evidence base specifically in regard to the efficacy of using HFNO
      during conscious sedation in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory.
