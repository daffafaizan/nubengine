      outcomes of subjects enrolled in the PREMOD2 umbilical cord milking (UCM) vs. delayed cord
      clamping (DCC) trial, using standardized neurologic and developmental assessments at 22-26
      months corrected age (CA). The corrected age may be extended out to 42 months CA due to
      Covid-19 pandemic for undetermined period of time.
