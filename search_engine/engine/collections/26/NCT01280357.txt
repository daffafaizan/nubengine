      the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) and Uterine Activity (UA) output data obtained by the Monica AN24
      monitor during the first and second stages of labor to those generated by existing
      FDA-approved devices.Patients were enrolled at the facility but the patient details were
      removed from the results in order that the data could be randomized for the statistical
      analysis.
