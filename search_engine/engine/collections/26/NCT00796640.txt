    
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 5-way crossover Phase 1 study in non-smoking
      healthy men and women, aged between 18 and 55 years. The study consists of a screening
      period; a 5-way crossover, open-label treatment phase with 14 days washout between
      treatments; and end-of-study evaluations upon completion or at early withdrawal. Eligible
      volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment sequences. Each volunteer will
      receive the following treatments in random order: (A) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1,
      as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, under fasting conditions; (B) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1,
      as capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast); (C) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2
      as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, under fasting conditions; (D) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2 as
      1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast); (E) immediate release (IR) paliperidone
      oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1-mg/mL solution, under fasting conditions. Alternative
      paliperidone ER formulations are being developed with the aim to increase bioavailability and
      reduce variability, without compromising the favorable effect on orthostatic hypotension as
      seen with ER OROS paliperidone. Therefore, in this study, the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamic properties, as well as the effect of food, of 2 alternative paliperidone ER
      pellet formulations will be investigated. Safety and tolerability will be monitored
      throughout the study.. Single doses of paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1, as 1 capsule of
      2.5 mg, fasted; paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1, as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food
      (high-fat breakfast); paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2 as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, fasted;
      paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2 as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast);
      IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1-mg/mL solution, fasted.
