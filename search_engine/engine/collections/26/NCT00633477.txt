      as stroke and acute myocardial infarction, each with less than a 20% risk of death in the
      first 30 days. Sepsis is a clinical condition caused by the innate inflammatory host response
      to systemic infection that can result in organ failure and potentially death. Under certain
      circumstances, many components of the innate immune response that are normally involved with
      host defense can cause cell and tissue damage and subsequently multiple organ failure, the
      clinical hallmark of severe sepsis.

      The host response to infection is characterized by the synthesis and release of
      proinflammatory cytokines. Cytokines are released by signals transmitted from the surface of
      inflammatory cells, after binding of pathogen-associated molecules to cell surface pattern
      recognition receptors known as toll-like receptors.

      TAK-242 (resatorvid) is a toll-like receptor 4 inhibitor under clinical development for the
      treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Study participation is anticipated to be about 28
      days, with an additional 9 month follow-up period.
