        -  Evaluate the clinical performance of the Siemens POC HS cTn-I test system for the
           diagnosis and rule out of AMI in patients presenting to the emergency department in whom
           serial cTnI measurements are obtained on clinical indication.

        -  Correlate the blood and plasma outcomes on the Siemens POC HS cTn-I test system as
           function of the corresponding hematocrit (Hct) values.

      Hypothesis: The Siemens POC HS cTn-I Test System will offer an excellent diagnostic
      performance for acute myocardial injury and acute myocardial infarction, as well as expedite
      the risk stratification of patients for early discharge from the emergency department.
