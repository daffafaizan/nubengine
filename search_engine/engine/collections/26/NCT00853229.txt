      itching of the external genitourinary tract that often results in painful intercourse.
      Vulvodynia rarely results in severe morbidity or mortality; rather it causes symptoms of the
      lower genital, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts that can impact a woman's daily
      activities and negatively affect her quality of life.

      Despite the fact that chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons for
      visits to a gynecology clinic, epidemiologic studies of the incidence and prevalence of these
      conditions are rare and available population-based studies are limited. Approximately 16% of
      women will experience chronic vulvar pain at some point in their lifetime; with 5%
      experiencing this condition before age 25.

      Treatment approaches include behavioral changes, medical management, and surgery,
      specifically vulvar vestibulectomy. Prior to considering surgical intervention, all medical
      treatment options should be exhausted. Although vulvodynia is quite prevalent and can be a
      debilitating disease, there are few studies that critically evaluate the medical management
      of vulvodynia. Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant that has proven efficacy in the treatment of
      diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia. Anecdotal data and one case
      report provide hope that this medication may also be effective in the treatment of
      vulvodynia.
