      ameliorating the signs and symptoms of spondyloarthritis associated with CD. Although AS
      patients with IBD were recruited in phase III trials of anti-TNF therapy and shown to respond
      to treatment, this has not been established in a cohort of patients with exclusive
      enteropathic spondyloarthritis. Evaluation of such a cohort will address several important
      issues:

        -  Firstly, it will answer the question of whether or not patients with enteropathic
           spondyloarthritis respond to treatment with adalimumab.

        -  Secondly, since patients with IBD represent a cohort at high risk of developing
           spondyloarthritis, this approach will allow the study of the efficacy of adalimumab in
           patients with pre-radiographic inflammatory back pain as determined by clinical,
           laboratory, and radiological outcomes. In particular, the use of MRI as an outcome
           measure will be explored. In addition, this will allow the further evaluation of
           diagnostic criteria for pre-radiographic AS.

        -  Thirdly, the efficacy of adalimumab in treating IBD associated with SpA has not been
           previously determined. It has been assumed that the response should be the same as that
           observed in idiopathic disease. However, it is important to note that the bowel disease
           related to spondyloarthritis has different genetic associations from idiopathic disease
           and may have a different underlying pathophysiology. Several biomarkers have been shown
           to reflect response to anti-TNF therapies in spondyloarthritis e.g. MMP3 and VEGF.
           However, other surrogates of disease, such as bowel permeability, have yet to be
           examined.
