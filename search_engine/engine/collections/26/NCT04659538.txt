    
      This is a prospective, multi center, single arm, FIH safety and feasibility study enrolling
      up to 20 patients. Patients undergoing clinically indicated TAVR who comply with the study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled to have embolic protection with the CAPTISÂ®
      Device during the TAVR procedure.

      Screening activities will include initial screening by the site, analysis of patient CT scan
      by the sponsor and core-lab, and review of the clinical and imaging data by an eligibility
      committee to confirm that all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Final eligibility for
      study enrollment is then determined by the investigator in the cardiac catheterization
      laboratory.

      Enrolled patients will undergo safety assessment during the procedure, post-procedure, and at
      30 days post-procedure; Feasibility evaluation will be assessed during procedure.
