      dramatic anti-tumor activity recently demonstrated among RMG pts treated w humanized
      anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, when combined w irinotecan. 63 percent
      radiographic response rate was observed following treatment w regimen every other wk, &
      median progression-free survival was 23wks. Similar enhancement of chemo activity by
      VEGF-directed therapy w bev has been previously demonstrated for colorectal & lung cancer
      pts. SU011248 is being evaluated in current regimen because it may exert more potent
      anti-angiogenic effect than bev among MG pts due to its ability to inhibit PDGFR-mediated
      pericyte stabilization in tumor neovasculature.

      Current proposed ph I study is designed to determine MTD & DLT of SU011248 when combo w
      irinotecan for pts w RMG. Both SU01148 & irinotecan are known to be metabolized by CYP3A4
      cytochrome system. Current study will limit enrollment to pts who are not on CYP3A4-enzyme
      inducing anti-epileptic drugs.
