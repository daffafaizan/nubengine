      enrolled in the CHA MindWell mental wellness monitoring and telephone coaching program with a
      low-impact control condition of CHA MindWell alone. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for
      Resilience (MBCT-R), and iCBT, are online versions of evidence-based treatments for
      depression. MBCT-R integrates training in mindfulness with elements of CBT with a focus on
      the psychosocial stressors associated with COVID-19 that increase risk for depression. It is
      based on the 8-week MBCT program which has well-established efficacy for symptoms of
      depression, anxiety and stress, and for preventing relapse in recurrent depression. The iCBT
      arm will use MoodGym, which is a 6-week web-based asynchronous cognitive-behavioral therapy
      educational curriculum for depression and anxiety. The two programs will be compared with CHA
      MindWell alone, which is weekly monitoring with CAT-MH plus telephone support and referral to
      treatment as needed. Primary outcomes are levels of depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes
      include alcohol and drug use, healthcare utilization. Online oral fluid toxicology testing,
      daily diaries for stress-related affect reactivity, salivary inflammatory markers, salivary
      testing for COVID-19, and completion of computerized adaptive mental health interviews
      (CAT-MH) represent several innovative data collection modalities in this study.
