      model in healthy volunteers. Each participant will undergo a battery if psychometric then
      psychophysics tests, presented sequentially. However, most of the main study tests
      (knismesis) will be admistered in a random order (crossover). The primary endpoint is to
      characterise, in the healthy human, the physical determinants of the cutaneous stimulation
      inducing knismesis: length of the pathway, speed, direction, intensity, continuity break of
      the contact, hairiness, body site, or distraction by other cutaneous stimuli. The secondary
      endpoint is to study the relationship between the individual sensitivity to spatial summation
      (knismesis) and other individual sensitivities or profiles.
