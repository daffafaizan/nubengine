      develop a medication to treat nicotine dependence. In a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial, 40 nicotine-dependent participants ages 18-65 will receive
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) over a 10- week
      period, with half receiving D-cycloserine (DCS) pretreatment and half receiving placebo.
      Participants will receive either 250 mg DCS or placebo prior to weekly CBT sessions in
      addition to NRT over a 10-week treatment period. The investigators also aim to determine the
      effects of DCS on performance on neuropsychological tests. A 10-week treatment period will be
      followed by follow-up assessments including neuropsychological tests at 1 and 3 months
      post-treatment. Primary outcomes will include smoking as measured by carbon monoxide levels
      and self-report measurements.
