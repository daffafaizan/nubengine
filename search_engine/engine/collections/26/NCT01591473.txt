      well as the developing world. Even with existing vaccines, annual influenza epidemics
      typically results in 20-50 million cases, resulting in 30,000-40,000 deaths in the U.S.
      alone. A possible pandemic could have even more devastating consequences. Current vaccines
      have a number of disadvantages including slow and expensive manufacturing, and a relative
      lack of efficacy in elderly, children and immune-compromised populations. These disadvantages
      would be multiplied during a pandemic. Use of Ampligen® as an adjuvant combined with FluMist®
      has a number of potential advantages as compared to traditional inactivated vaccines: it is
      simpler to administer (intranasally), generation of a broader immunity at the natural site of
      entry of the influenza virus as well as systemic immunity (and hence should be more
      efficacious than traditional vaccines) and may stimulate cross-protection against
      pre-pandemic H5N1 and/or H7N9 avian influenza strains. As FluMist®, due to its intranasal
      administration, imitates the natural entry of the influenza virus, it will generate local
      'first-line' immunity as well as the traditional systemic immunity; therefore, at least
      theoretically provide greater protection than injectable vaccines.
