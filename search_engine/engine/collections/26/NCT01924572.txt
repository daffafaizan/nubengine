      blood volume after varying cord clamping protocols when the infants are placed skin-to-skin
      on the maternal abdomen. The study assessed compliance of the providers with the different
      protocols. Placental transfusion (PT) has been shown to increase infant body iron stores at 6
      months of age without increasing adverse outcomes. However, the optimal protocol to achieve
      adequate placental transfusion is not known. The practice of cord clamping at birth is not
      uniform among obstetrical providers because adequate evidence to support early or late cord
      clamping has been lacking.

      Women were eligible to enroll in the study if they had no pregnancy complications, did not
      smoke, planned to breastfeed, and planned to deliver vaginally between 37 and 416/7 weeks.
      Women were enrolled prenatally on the labor and delivery unit. At birth, women were assigned
      to one of four cord clamping/milking groups. A cohort of infants with immediate cord clamping
      serves as reference group. Infants had blood samples drawn with the routine newborn screening
      blood samples done at 36 to 48 hours. Information on infant health and feeding was completed
      through an in-hospital visit to the mother and by home visit at two weeks of age. The primary
      outcome measures were placental residual blood volume and compliance with the various
      assigned cord clamping protocols. It was expected that infants with delayed cord clamping or
      cord milking would have less placental residual blood volume and that most providers would
      comply with the various random assignments.
