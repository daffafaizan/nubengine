      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which may explain the increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease. In addition to increased PTH levels, vitamin D has been shown to
      inhibit the RAAS. However, a possible physiologic interaction needs further investigation.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate changes in the RAAS in otherwise healthy
      postmenopausal women with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency when
      p-PTH is normalized.

      Furthermore, we will evaluate whether an angiotensin 2 receptor blocker can lower PTH in
      patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
