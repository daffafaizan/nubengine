    
      Objectives:

      The aim of this study is the characterization of patients with bronchiolitis obliterans in
      terms of lung function, bronchial hyperreactivity and the degree of the systemic and
      bronchial inflammation.

      Sputum and serum samples are analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) (qRT-PCR) and by cytometric bead assay (CBA). Components of the innate immune system
      (mannose-binding protein, TLR recognition proteins and surfactant proteins) are genetically
      determined from sputum or blood respectively. In the conduct of this study the investigators
      will retrospectively and systematically evaluate the available high-resolution computed
      tomography (HRCT) studies of affected patients

      Methods and Work Programme:

      This study consists of two study visits (V1 and V2)

      V1:

        -  Measurement of nitric oxide in expired air (eNO)

        -  Measurement of carbon monoxide in the exhaled air (eCO)

        -  Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

        -  Blood test: blood count, CRP, RAST, serum inflammatory mediators, genetic markers of the
           non-specific pulmonary defense system

        -  Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations

      V2:

      â€¢ Unspecific bronchial provocation test with methacholine (PD20 FEV1 methacholine)

      Study population:

      Children and young people (6 - 25 years of age). Both the patients and the healthy subjects
      are recruited from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Allergy and Pulmonology.
