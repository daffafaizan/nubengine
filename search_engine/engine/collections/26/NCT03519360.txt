    
      Within four weeks of consent, subjects will have an Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR)
      (Medtronic LINQ) device implanted. Subjects will be given a transmitter/charger and a Patient
      Care Assistant which they will be required to keep for the duration of their participation in
      the study. ILR tracings will be uploaded automatically and reviewed by the study team for the
      occurrence of clinically significant arrhythmia.

      Following ILR implantation, subjects will alternate between weekly periods in which the
      ultrafiltration rate can be unlimited or in which the ultrafiltration rate is limited to
      â‰¤10mL/kg/hour.
