    
      The study is a single arm, open label, pilot study of safety and immune efficacy of peptide
      vaccination with poly-ICLC in patients with stage IB-IIIA resected breast cancer.
      Participants will be patients who have completed their last dose/treatment of any single
      treatment or combination of adjuvant surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or trastuzumab therapy
      between 45 days and 6 months (180 days) prior to enrollment.

      Each vaccination will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 36, 57, and 78. All participants will
      receive 9 class I MHC-restricted synthetic peptides (restricted by HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31)
      and a class II MHC-restricted tetanus helper peptide mixed with 1mg poly-ICLC and
      administered in sterile water. The vaccine will be administered intramuscular (IM) (1 ml) and
      intradermally (ID) (1 ml) at vaccination sites in the arm and leg. (Each vaccine given IM and
      ID at one site; site to alternate between arm site opposite the breast cancer and an anterior
      thigh site.) Participants will be screened for HLA type and must be HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31
      (80% of the Virginia population in prior studies1).

      Annual follow-up for progression and survival for 3 years after study withdrawal/completion.
