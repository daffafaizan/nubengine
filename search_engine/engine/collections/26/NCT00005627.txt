        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly docetaxel when combined with carboplatin
           and estramustine in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel.

      Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      day 2 of weeks 1-3. Patients also receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2 of week 1 only.
      Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
