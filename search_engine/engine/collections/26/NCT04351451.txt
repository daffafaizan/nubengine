      and vitamin D level all checked. Postoperatively corrected serum calcium, magnesium and
      phosphate level are checked. The serum calcium less than 2.12mmol/l is corrected with oral or
      IV calcium infusion plus vitamin D depending on the severity of symptoms. Any serum magnesium
      less than 0.75mmol/l is corrected with infusion magnesium sulfate. Calcium and magnesium
      level monitored and corrected according to the result.
