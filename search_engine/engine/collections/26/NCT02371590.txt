      The primary endpoint is to determine safety and tolerability of the regimen and determine
      complete response (CR) to therapy. The secondary endpoints will assess the impact of
      treatment on progression free and overall survival

      Eligible patients will receive obinutuzumab for 6 x 28 day cycles. Patients will also receive
      lenalidomide orally once daily on days 8-28 of each 28 day cycles. The starting dose for all
