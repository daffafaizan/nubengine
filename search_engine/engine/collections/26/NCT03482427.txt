    
      Created by the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health, the Healthy Heart Score is a
      previously validated online risk calculator that determines the 20-year Cardiovascular
      Disease ) risk based on 9 modifiable lifestyle factors including; smoking habits, body mass
      index, physical activity, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetables intake, cereal fiber,
      nuts, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meat, and processed meats consumption.

      In this pilot study, the investigators will assess the clinical utility and feasibility of
      the Healthy Heart Score in the primary clinical care setting for the primordial prevention of
      cardiovascular disease. The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to test our
      intervention compared to usual care. The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical
      trial to test the lifestyle intervention based on the Healthy Heart Score compared to usual
      care. The aim is to include 100 participants (50 in each group). Each participant will
      complete 2 visits (initial and a follow up visit after 12 weeks).
