      I. To identify participant-level factors affecting recruitment of potentially eligible
      participants in AIDS Malignancy Clinical Trials Consortium (AMC) studies at core and
      affiliated sites.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the socio-demographic characteristics for participation and non-participation
      in AMC clinical trials among all approached volunteers across AMC sites.

      II. To characterize socio-demographic characteristics with motivation and decision making
      among those who consented to participate in an AMC trial.

      III. To identify the perceived barriers associated with clinical trial participation among
      those who did not consent to participate in an AMC clinical trial.

      IV. To better understand how potential study volunteers learn about AMC clinical trials and
      by what means are they referred to a particular study.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete the Improving Participation in AMC Clinical Trials (IMPACTS) survey
      comprising questions about socio-demographic information and clinical trial participation.
