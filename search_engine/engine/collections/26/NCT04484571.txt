      essential clinical objectives in the early rehabilitation from stroke and other neurological
      disorders, to prevent the progression of neuromuscular pathology and enable proactive
      physiotherapy towards functional recovery. However, the current clinical evaluation and
      treatment of this stiffness (and underlying muscle spasticity) are severely limited by their
      dependence on subjective evaluation and manual limb mobilization, thus rendering the
      evaluation imprecise and the treatment insufficiently tailored to the specific pathologies
      and residual capabilities of individual patients. To address these needs, the proposed
      clinical trial will employ the NEUROExos Elbow Module (NEEM), an active robotic exoskeleton,
      for the passive mobilization and active training of elbow flexion and extension in stroke
      patients with motor impairments (hemiparesis and/or spasticity) of the right arm. The study
      protocol provide a functional rehabilitation program, with both clinical and robotically
      instrumented assessments to be conducted at baseline and post-treatment.
