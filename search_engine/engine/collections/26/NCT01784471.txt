      attributable to diabetes or peripheral vascular disease will be screened and enrolled.
      Subjects meeting inclusion criteria will sign informed consent. They will undergo a full
      examination including blood pressure measurement, heart rate and ECG.

      A self evaluation questionnaire relating to foot and sleep disorder symptoms will be
      completed.

      A baseline screening ICG will be performed to measure total peripheral resistance CO (Cardiac
      Output) and SV (Stroke Volume).

      ABI will be performed. The investigational product will be used for 30 minutes and ICG will
      be repeated.

      Each subject will be provided with a size appropriate pair of Magic Foot™ to use at home.

      Magic Foot™ will be used for thirty minutes daily for 30 days. This will be done at rest in
      the evening prior to bedtime. A diary to report compliance will be provided to the subjects.
      The subject will provide the completed diary to the site staff at day 14 and day 30. Subjects
      will be reassessed at Day 14. Self evaluation questionnaire will be completed. Subjects will
      continue with daily use of Magic Foot™. Subject will be reassessed at day 30. ICG, ABI (Ankle
      Bracial Index) and a final self assessment questionnaire will be repeated at day 30.

      At the end of the study the Magic Foot™ will remain with the subjects. In consultation with
      the treating physician a decision will be made whether to continue with treatment or not.
