    
      Mepolizumab (SB-240563) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks human interleukin 5
      (IL-5) from binding to its receptor. Mepolizumab is currently under development for severe
      refractory asthma and a Phase IIB dose-ranging study using the IV route of administration is
      currently on-going. This study will be a multi-center, randomized, open-label,
      parallel-group, repeat dose study conducted in approximately 65 subjects with established
      asthma and elevated blood eosinophil levels. Dosing will occur on three occasions, every four
      weeks [Day 1, Day 28 (+/- 3 days) and Day 56 (+/- 3 days)]. Blood samples for safety,
      pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity analysis, as well safety and
      tolerability assessments will be collected/assessed throughout the study. Each subject will
      participate in the study for up to approximately 22 weeks, including screening, dosing and
      follow-up.
