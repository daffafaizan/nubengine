      intervention for obese middle-aged African American and Latino men and to explore how the
      genetically predicted BMI relates to outcomes. Using strategies previously employed by the PI
      to develop individually-tailored materials for African American men, the proposed study is
      designed to develop person-specific materials for Latino men (Specific Aim 1). Investigators
      also will pilot a behavioral weight loss intervention for 35-64 year old African American men
      in Nashville and Latino men in Miami (Specific Aims 2-3), and explore how the phenotypic
      expression of obesity shapes and is affected by behavioral and physiological changes
      (Specific Aim 4). The proposed intervention includes (a) person-specific goals/ messages (via
      web and text), (b) self-monitoring (via wearable device and text), (c) small group training
      and education (including social support) and (d) educational and community-based information
      and resources (via web and text).
