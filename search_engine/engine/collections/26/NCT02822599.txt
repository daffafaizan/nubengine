      (RiaSTAP) will decrease blood loss and the need for component blood therapy in neonates and
      infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. RiaSTAP will be administered after termination of
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) at a dose of 70 mg/kg, in a prospective, randomized, controlled
      study. We hypothesize that the administration of RiaSTAP in this manner will reduce
      peri-operative bleeding and transfusion requirements.
