      rituximab within the past 2 years with baseline immunoglobulin levels and vaccine responses
      to polysaccharide (pneumococcus, meningococcus) and peptide (tetanus, diphtheria) antigens.
      Patients with impaired vaccine responses may benefit most from immunoglobulin prophylaxis and
      will be proactively started on 20% subcutaneous replacement therapy. This study is novel in
      that it will stratify patients according to their humoral response to polysaccharide and
      peptide vaccines, and will proactively initiate therapy with the new 20% subcutaneous
      immunoglobulin in those with impaired humoral response rather than starting it after
      infections occur. This will potentially lead to decreased infections and improved quality of
      life.
