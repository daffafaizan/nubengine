      Science University and Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette.

      Subjects will be approached only after deciding to get an intrauterine. When the participants
      return for intrauterine device placement, at 90 minutes prior to the procedure half will
      receive misoprostol and half will receive placebo. The subjects will be asked to rate their
      level of pain at specific points during the insertion. Providers will be asked to mark
      whether or not additional dilation was required as well as their perceived ease of
      intrauterine device placement.
