      developed to clarify the clinical relevance of questionable and positive patch samples, by
      imitating everyday use of a skin product.

      The skin products will consist of ordinary sunscreens with and without aluminium, with colour
      code red and blue, respectively (masked for both investigator and participants). At the
      beginning of the trial, the study participants will be given the two creams. On the lower
      back of the children, two areas each 10 cm2 are marked with red and blue, respectively. In
      each area, sunscreen corresponding to the generally recommended amounts must be applied twice
      a day.

      The children should be seen on day 0 for interviews and objective examination. They must then
      be seen again on day 7 and day 14. On day 14 of the ROAT, a patch test is made to validate
      the results of the ROAT study. The study is scheduled to last for a maximum of 21 days with
      4-5 consultations per child. If there is a skin reaction in connection with the ROAT study
      before the 14 days have elapsed, the study will end and a patch test will be performed.
