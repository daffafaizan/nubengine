      musculoskeletal disorders and recent reports showed being beneficial for peripheral
      neuropathy in animal studies. Our previous research shown single injection with PRP was
      superior to D5W for CTS. However there is no study investigating the effect of PRP for UNE
      now. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of perineural PRP injection
      for UNE.
