      individualization of (neo)-adjuvant decision-making in early breast cancer (EBC) in a
      subtype-specific manner. The first WSG ADAPT umbrella trial (NCT01779206) aimed to establish
      early predictive molecular surrogate markers for response after a short 3-week induction
      treatment.

      The goals of the WSG ADAPT trial program - early response assessment and subtype-specific
      therapy tailoring to those patients who are most likely to benefit - have contributed to the
      very positive national and international feedback to the ADAPT concept as a whole.

      The aim of this ADAPTcycle phase-III-trial is to investigate whether the intermediate-risk
      patient group identified during the screening phase derives additional benefit from treatment
      with ribociclib in combination with ET compared to chemotherapy (followed by adjuvant ET).
