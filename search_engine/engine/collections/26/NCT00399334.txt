      treatment options in non-compliant patients discharged from acute inpatient settings are
      often leading to recidivism and frequent re-hospitalization. The objective of this
      epidemiologic survey is to evaluate epidemiological characteristics of relapse and
      readmission in acute psychiatric units. If long-term treatment in schizophrenia begins in
      acute hospitalization the use of the new long-acting injectable antipsychotics after an acute
      psychotic episode as a standard maintenance medication could prevent relapse and
      readmissions. This is a pharmaco-epidemiological study, which collects structured safety data
      and it is carried out in Spain. All data collected will be cross-sectional or retrospective
      and will include the following: demographic data, diagnosis, psychiatric history and
      co-morbidities, hospitalization record (previous 3 years), treatment record and physician's
      opinion on patient's treatment compliance. The primary objectives are to evaluate
      epidemiological characteristics of patients that experience relapse and need an admission in
      psychiatric acute units across Spain, to determine the most important risk factors which
      predicts the number of hospital re-admissions and to identify the impact of the clinical
      profile of patients with schizophrenia, and schizoaffective/schizophreniform disorders who
      suffer relapses. The second objective is to describe the clinical decisions made by
      psychiatrist regarding therapeutic approach according to the previous characteristics of the
      patient. as prescribed
