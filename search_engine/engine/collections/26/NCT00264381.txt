    
      Superficial thrombophlebitis is a common problem and is thought to affect up to 20% of
      patients with varicose veins. In the absence of treatment, STP may cause its greatest
      morbidity with extension of thrombus into the deep venous system and resultant risk of
      pulmonary embolism.

      Current standard therapy for STP consists of local heat, elevation of the extremity, and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. However, no study to date has adequately
      evaluated the effectiveness of this therapy despite persistence and recurrence of symptoms of
      STP in many patients.

      The purpose of this study is to document the outcome of patients with objectively documented
      STP who are treated with NSAID therapy (standard care) verses those treated with
      low-molecular weight heparin (dalteparin sodium) according to a pre-defined treatment
      regimen.

      All patients with documented upper or lower STP will be screened. Each will have a complete
      baseline and risk factor assessment.

      All patients will be randomized in one of two treatment groups:

      (a) Experimental group who will receive Fragmin (dalteparin)fixed dose subcutaneously daily
      for 7 days or (b) Control group who will receive ibuprofen 800mg given orally three times
      daily for 7 days. All patients will receive study drug for a period of 1-2 weeks with
      reassessment of STP by ultrasound.

      All patients will participate for a period of 3 months with follow up visits at 7-9, and
      14-16 day, and 1,3 months.
