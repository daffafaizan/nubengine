    
      The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial to compare two methods to guide
      application of clinical interventions after planned extubation: SMT versus IPI based clinical
      management among adult patients admitted in the ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation for
      ≥24 hours. Each mechanically ventilated subject within the inclusion criteria and with a
      physician order for extubation will be randomized to either the SMT or IPI based clinical
      management group. Once the extubation order is placed by the medical team, the patient will
      be randomized to IPI monitoring group or standard medical management group. Patients
      randomized to IPI group will be placed on IPI monitoring after extubation.Respiratory
      Therapist (RT) will extubate and connects the patient to EtCO2 cannula (Medtronic,
      Minneapolis, MN) and will turn on IPI monitoring on the Philips monitor. Any subject with
      decrease in IPI by 1 within 1 hour of extubation or IPI ≤ 4 after 1 hour of extubation will
      be assessed by RT and will receive standard medical therapy based on respiratory department
      protocols. IPI monitoring will be continued for up to 72 hours after extubation. Patients
      randomized to control group will receive standard medical therapy based on the respiratory
      department protocols. All patients will be clinically monitored for 72 hours after extubation
      to assess the extubation outcome. Patients that require reintubation will be reintubated
      based on the medical team decision and will be discontinued from the study. Patients that do
      not require reintubation after 72 hours will successfully complete the study.
