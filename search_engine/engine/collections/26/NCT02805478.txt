      prevalences of conventional cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical arterial or cardiac
      dysfunction are explored. The study aims at identifying sex differences in presence and
      clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and presence of subclinical cardiovascular organ
      damage. The influence of physical fitness on these factors will also be assessed. All
      participants undergo extensive cardiovascular risk factor assessment including oral glucose
      tolerance test and ambulatory blood pressure recording. Subclinical cardiovascular
      dysfunction is assessed by carotid and femoral vascular ultrasound, echocardiography and
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity using applanation tonometry. Physical fitness is assessed
      from peak oxygen uptake during maximal exercise testing on a treadmill.
