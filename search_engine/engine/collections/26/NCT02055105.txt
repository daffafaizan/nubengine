      pediatric patients and help in establishing pilot data for additional studies in the future.
      The testing will include blood samples, urine samples and buccal swabs from patients who meet
      eligibility at 5 time points to analyze biomarkers. Study participants will receive standard
      of care with antimicrobials and any additional appropriate cardiovascular or respiratory
      support per the clinical team. The samples will collected and stored at -80 until analysis
      can be performed. In addition to, during the course of the hospitalization, the enrolled
      patient will have data collected to calculate severity scores, including updated Pediatric
      Risk of Mortality (PRISM III) scores and simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring
      System(TISS-28) scores. All patient information will be de-identified. A standard procedure
      manual will be developed detailing the methods for data collection and entry. Data will be
      recorded in a de-identified manner on a Microsoft Excel database on a secure institutional
      server by the institutional staff. Data will then be analyzed to determine correlation of
      biomarkers to morbidity and mortality for these patients.
