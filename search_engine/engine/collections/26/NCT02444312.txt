      allocation ratio will be employed. This study will compare the effect of a brief benefit
      finding writing intervention with a control condition among caregivers. Caregivers currently
      caring for people with mental and physical disabilities will be randomised into a two-week,
      a) a benefit writing group or b) a control writing group. Caregivers will complete
      self-report measures relating to their care-recipient and themselves (e.g., illness type, and
      sociodemographics) and psychometric measures of benefit finding (primary outcome),
      psychological distress and quality of life(secondary outcomes). These will be assessed via
      online software at baseline, immediate post-test and at 3 month follow-up. Additionally,
      expectations and fidelity indices will be assessed and qualitative commentary on
      participation experiences gathered.
