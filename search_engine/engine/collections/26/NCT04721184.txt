      mioesteaosis has been well reported to be an independent predictors of mortality, toxicity,
      and complications in cancer patients with different locations and treatments. However, there
      are currently no data on impact of body composition and the oncological outcomes in SCCHN
      patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) due to recurrence or metastasic
      disease.
