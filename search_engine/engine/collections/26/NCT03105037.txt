      (CTM) in a high proportion of women. Female front of neck anatomy is less distinct compared
      to males with reduced angulation of the laryngeal cartilages making it harder to distinguish
      the relevant landmarks. In obese patients, overlying subcutaneous tissue compounds this
      problem and several studies have demonstrated poor success identifying the CTM by palpation
      in this population. Supraglottic airway device (SAD) insertion precedes emergency front of
      neck access attempts in the stepwise progression from failed intubation to cricothyroidotomy.
      The nature and clinical implication of SAD insertion on cricothyroidotomy remain unstudied.

      Sixty four patients will undergo front of neck airway assessment by volunteer clinicians with
      and without a SAD in situ (control and SAD assessments, within-subjects design). The patients
      are fasting women presenting for routine gynaecological surgery. Eight anaesthetists, at
      different levels of training, will perform eight individual CTM assessments with and without
      the SAD in situ.

      Ultrasound images will be captured in the sagittal plane immediately before and after
      supraglottic airway insertion. Images are then downloaded, anonymised and randomised for
      blinded digital analysis.
