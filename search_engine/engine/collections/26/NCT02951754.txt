    
      Methylphenidate (MPH) is the most prescribed psychostimulant for children and adults with
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have
      shown that MPH is safe and efficacious in attenuating the core symptoms of ADHD, promoting
      overall clinical improvement. However, many patients still do not show an appropriate
      clinical response to the MPH treatment and there is considerable interindividual variability
      regarding the dose required, tolerability and response rates to MPH. Therefore, it is
      essential to address the clinical and genetic predictors of MPH treatment outcomes in ADHD.
