      I. Determine the pharmacodynamic change using functional imaging (3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]
      fluorothymidine [FLT]-positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT] scans) in
      patients with unresectable or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma or other advanced
      solid malignancies treated with two different schedules of sunitinib malate.

      II. Evaluate the objective response in patients treated with this drug.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure the change in plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and plasma
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1-alpha levels as a potential mechanism for vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) failure and rapid
      tumor growth following VEGFR TKI withdrawal in these patients.

      II. Correlate pharmacokinetics of this drug with response, unexpected toxicity, VEGF levels,
      HIF1-alpha levels, and FLT-PET/CT scan changes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 different treatment schedules of sunitinib malate.

      SCHEDULE A: Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) in weeks 1-4.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      SCHEDULE B: Patients receive sunitinib malate PO QD in weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5. Treatment
      repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
