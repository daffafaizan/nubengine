    
      Setting: 21-bed general ICU, emergency room of the Emergency department (ED), Fondazione
      Policlinico Universitario "Agostino Gemelli" IRCCS, Rome, Italy..

      Patients: adult hypoxemic non-hypercapnic patients admitted to the emergency department or
      the ICU with de novo acute respiratory failure will be assessed for the enrolment.

      Each eligible patient, in the absence of exclusion criteria, will receive 15 minutes of
      heated and humidified 60% oxygen at a rate of 50 l/min via a non-rebreathing face mask. An
      ABG will be then collected and PaO2/FiO2 ratio computed: given the high flows used, actual
      FiO2 will be approximated to the set one.

      Nonhypercapnic patients with a PaO2/FiO2≤200 mmHg will be enrolled. In the absence of
      exclusion criteria and if all other inclusion in criteria are met, patients showing
      PaO2/FiO2≤300 and >200 mmHg will be treated according to the clinical practice eventually
      reassessed for the presence of oxygenation criterion subsequently.

      Enrolled patients will receive all the interventions (helmet CPAP, PSV and high-flow nasal
      cannula) in a randomized, cross-over fashion, for 40 minutes each.

      At the end of the study, the patient will receive the treatment that will be shown as more
      appropriate for the patient, according to the attending physician, who will be informed about
      the results of the study on the individual patient.
