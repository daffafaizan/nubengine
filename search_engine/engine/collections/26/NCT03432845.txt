      include (but are not limited to) the following: 1) mechanical manipulation of the stomach and
      bowel, 2) post-surgical inflammation of the tissue just operated on, 3) vagal stimulation of
      the viscera, 4) the administration of volatile anesthetics, 5) the administration of
      narcotics, 6) the underlying propensity of patient's for post-operative nausea and vomiting,
      based on prior history, gender, and other factors and 7) the administration of a cholinergic
      medication for muscle relaxant reversal. From previous work, it is known that alternate
      techniques are available to mitigate factors two through four, and patient screening has been
      available to help us determine the likelihood of patients becoming nauseous or vomiting
      postoperatively (factor #5). However, until the advent of sugammadex, there has been no
      alternative to factor 6. The use of sugammadex as a reversal agent could dramatically lower
      the incidence of PONV, while simultaneously providing an excellent level of reversal of
      neuromuscular blockade. There have been no published studies that have described laparoscopic
      gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy or duodenal switch procedures where complete prevention of
      PONV has been the result. A secondary objective will be the comparison of pulmonary function
      before and after surgery between the same two groups. In patients having gastric bypass
      surgery, not only does PONV aggressively aggravate the tissues which were just surgically
      manipulated, it also increases the likelihood of decreased ventilatory response, placing
      patients at risk for aspiration, atelectasis, pneumonia and respiratory failure.
