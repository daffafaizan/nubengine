    
      Cross-sectional study (2 groups : Turner syndrome, isolated growth hormone deficiency), not
      randomized, controlled, associating several specialized centers in endocrine diseases.

      The pediatric endocrinologist of the participating centers will contact parents of each
      patient or voluntary child/adolescent in order to inform them of the study.

      The visit of inclusion will take place in the participant center during a routine monitoring
      visit.

      The first visit (V1) will take place immediately after the visit of inclusion in order to
      avoid a specific displacement for the needs for the study. The second visit (V2) will take
      place in participant's home. Each visit (V1 and V2) will last half-day. The period between V1
      and V2 will be three months maximum.

      The visits V1 and V2 will be carried out by neuropsychologists of the Laboratoire de
      Psychologie des Pays de la Loire (LPPL - EA 4638).
