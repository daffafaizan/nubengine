    
      In this randomized controlled trial PIBDNet (pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases network)
      aims to compare the following treatment strategy by dividing patients into two risk groups
      for aggressive disease evolution: the effectiveness of Methotrexate versus Azathioprine / 6
      mercaptopurine for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease in children who are at low
      risk for aggressive disease and the effectiveness of Methotrexate versus adalimumab in the
      high risk group. PIBDNet hypothesizes that Methotrexate is superior to Azathioprine / 6
      mercaptopurine for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease in the low risk strata and
      adalimumab is superior to Methotrexate in the high risk strata. In addition, the ancillary
      study is planned to analyse of Adalimumab treated patients from inclusion (TOP-Down) versus
      patients switched to Adalimumab due to failure of immunomodulator therapy (STEP-Up).
