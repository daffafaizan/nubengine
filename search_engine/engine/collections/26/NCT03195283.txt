      surgical (Gynecology, Urology, Orthopedics) wards. Patients were offered TMS (July 2015 - May
      2016; n=326) or FfC meal service (after stepwise introduction per ward from January 2016 -
      December 2016; n=311). Primary outcome was the mean percentage of protein and energy intake
      relative to requirements, between patients receiving TMS and those receiving FfC, on the
      first and fourth day of full oral intake. Patient satisfaction comprised rating of the
      experienced quality of the food and the meal service and by means of a validated
      questionnaire.
