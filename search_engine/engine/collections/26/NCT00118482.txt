      problems with employment and driving, and have well-documented reduced quality of life. There
      are no therapies that have withstood the test of adequately conducted and credible randomized
      clinical trials.

      There is ample evidence of the importance of blood volume in the pathophysiology of vasovagal
      syncope. Fludrocortisone acetate is a corticosteroid with a mild enhancement of
      glucocorticoid activity and a marked increase in mineralocorticoid activity. It has no
      appreciable glucocorticoid effect at doses between 0.05 to 0.2 mg, which are the commonly
      used clinical doses for various disorders requiring mineralocorticoid adrenal replacement.
      The acute actions of fludrocortisone acetate are sodium and water retention, at the expense
      of urinary potassium excretion. Blood volume expansion with either dietary salt
      supplementation or fludrocortisone is often recommended by clinicians for the treatment of
      vasovagal syncope despite a paucity of good evidence for their efficacy. Four clinical
      studies suggest its utility in the prevention of syncope. Fludrocortisone might decrease the
      incidence of vasovagal syncope, but the quality of the evidence supporting its use is poor.
      There are no randomized, placebo-controlled trials of fludrocortisone for the prevention of
      vasovagal syncope. In this 5-year study the investigators will test the hypothesis that
      fludrocortisone prevents recurrences of vasovagal syncope.
