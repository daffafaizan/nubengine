    
      This is a bicentric, phase 2, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of maraviroc associated with standard treatment in hospitalized patients with
      pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), to prevent disease progression to severe Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

      Patients will be randomized to receive maraviroc (300 mg BID for 14 days) plus standard
      treatment, or standard treatment alone.

      200 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 in this study.
