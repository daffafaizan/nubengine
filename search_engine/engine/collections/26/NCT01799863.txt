      conjunctivitis using preservative free ketorolac trometamol 0.45% associated with
      carboxymethylcellulose compared with isolated use of preservative-free artificial tears. A
      randomized double-masked study will include 60 patients divided into two groups: Group 1:
      using a formulation of ketorolac tromethamine 0.45% associated with carboxymethylcellulose
      (Acular CMC®, Allergan, Irvine, USA) and Group 0: using artificial tears (Optive UD®,
      Allergan, Irvine, USA), both drugs without preservatives.
