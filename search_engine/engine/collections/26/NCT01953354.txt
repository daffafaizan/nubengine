      to be caused from an abnormal immune response to the normal bacteria that live in the gut
      (intestines and colon). This response acts as an "attack" on the healthy tissue of the bowel
      by a person's own immune cells which leads to disease.

      It is well known that autoimmune diseases such as IBD, asthma, diabetes, and multiple
      sclerosis are more common in industrialized, well-developed countries with better sanitation
      and hygiene, as in the United States. These "cleaner" environments reduce exposure to germs
      and parasites naturally found in the environment. This reduced exposure may trigger responses
      in the body that make people more prone to diseases such as UC. People in non-industrialized
      countries and the tropics, where parasites are common, rarely develop these diseases. This
      observation has led researchers to want to better understand the relationship between the
      lack of natural bacteria in the gut and the onset of autoimmune diseases like as UC.
