      serious adverse events in infants up to one year after birth. The lack of adequate human
      fetal safety data for Nplate® makes the NPER an important component of the pharmacovigilance
      program on the safety of this drug. With respect to fetal outcome, it is important to
      evaluate the spectrum of outcomes that may be relevant to a medication exposure during
      pregnancy, and these include both easily recognizable defects that are visible at birth, as
      well as more subtle or delayed defects that may not be readily identifiable without special
      expertise and observation beyond the newborn period.
