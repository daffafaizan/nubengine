      pathophysiology of obesity remain poorly understood. While studies in animals have yielded
      many insights, it has become clear that human obesity differs in important ways from that in
      rodents. Bariatric surgery offers better outcomes, but in the highest grades of obesity
      (BMI>50) remains a high risk undertaking with >5% operative mortality being reported when
      commonly performed bariatric surgical approaches are employed. By contrast, laparoscopic
      two-stage approach has resulted in excellent weight loss, minimal morbidity, and <1%
      mortality.

      Availability of blood samples and biopsies of omental and subcutaneous fat from each of the
      paired bariatric procedures in this protocol will provide a unique opportunity to study key
      issues in human obesity. This study tests the broad hypothesis that there are significant and
      as yet unrecognized differences between the pathobiology of obesity in man and rodents, the
      identification of which may lead to new therapeutic targets. Accordingly, to facilitate
      comparisons with aspects of obesity we have already investigated in animal models, we will 1.
      seek fat depot specific differences in Long Chain Fatty Acid (LCFA) disposition, macrophage
      infiltration and adipokine production in obesity and after surgery-induced weight loss in
      man, and correlate them with the presence/severity of the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn)Í¾ and
      2., quantify the relative significance and response to weight loss of different mechanisms
      contributing to hepatic steatosis and the elevated triglycerides (TG) and reduced
      High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) typical of obesity and MetSyn.
