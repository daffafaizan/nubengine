      education intervention studies have been conducted in a representative population in the
      country. The Skills for Change Program was a one-year, community-based, cluster randomized
      study involving Emirati adults with type 2 diabetes. We implemented a behavioral lifestyle
      intervention to improve glycemic control, food choices, and physical activity levels and to
      decrease sedentarity. The project was culturally adapted to Emirati adults with type 2
      diabetes and was driven by theoretical principles of behavior change and education to enhance
      intervention effectiveness.
