    
      This is a multi-center, prospective study in which subjects will receive a Freedom SCS System
      and to receive stimulation at a frequency between 5 Hz to 1500 Hz . Enrollment will continue
      until 49 subjects have been implanted.

      Subjects will have chronic back or back and leg pain refractory to standard medical treatment
      associated with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS). Subjects will be followed for a 6-month
      period after a maximum one-month trial period. At the end of 6 months follow-up, all subjects
      will assess the outcomes of their appointed therapy and continue with long-term use of the
      system.

      Stimulators will be placed at the following sites to target the painful area:

      â€¢ Epidural Space midline covering vertebrae levels T8 through T11 (one stimulator placed at
      the top of T8 and the second stimulator placed at the middle of T9). Paresthesia mapping will
      be utilised to determine the optimal location for stimulation of the painful area.
