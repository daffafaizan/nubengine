      drops compared with topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops in patients with
      ocular GVHD. 40 patients with ocular GVHD who meet the inclusion criteria of the study as
      determined by a screening visit will be divided into two equal groups. In addition to their
      current medication, one group will receive the topical tacrolimus 0.05% drops and the other
      group will receive the topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops. The
      participants will then have two follow-up visits at the week 5 and week 10 markers after
      their screening visit.

      To evaluate the purpose of the study as well as the patient's safety, the following
      procedures will be performed at each visit: a comprehensive eye examination, tear break-up
      time (TBUT), Schirmer's test, intraocular pressure (IOP), fundoscopy and grading scores of
      lid margin and corneal fluorescein staining. The following questionnaires will be
      administered at each visit: Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Symptom Assessment in Dry
      Eye (SANDE). Impression cytology specimens will be taken only at the screening visit and at
      the week 10 visit.
