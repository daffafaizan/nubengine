    
      This study is a quantitative, randomized experimental design study to determine the impact of
      unrestricted low fat, low residue oral intake during labor on the indicated outcome variables
      and patient satisfaction. The comparison group will continue standard care of being allowed a
      clear liquid during active labor (â‰¥6cm dilation), while the experimental group would be
      allowed to self-regulate oral intake with a low fat, low residue diet during active labor.
