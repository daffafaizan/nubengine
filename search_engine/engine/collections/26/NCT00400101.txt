      already proven its suitability for subunit vaccine design. The aim of the study was to proof
      the concept that virosomes can also be used to elicit high titers of antibodies against
      synthetic peptides. The specific objective was to demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity
      of two virosome-formulated P. falciparum protein derived synthetic peptide antigens given in
      two different doses alone or in combination.

      Methodology The design was a single blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose-escalating
      study involving 46 healthy Caucasian volunteers aged 18-45 years. Five groups of 8 subjects
      received virosomal formulations containing 10 ug or 50 ug of AMA 49-CPE, an apical membrane
      antigen-1 (AMA-1) derived synthetic phospatidylethanolamine (PE)-peptide conjugate or 10 ug
      or 50 ug of UK39, a circumsporozoite protein (CSP) derived synthetic PE-peptide conjugate or
      50 ug of both antigens each. A control group of 6 subjects received unmodified virosomes.
      Virosomal formulations of the antigens (designated PEV301 and PEV302 for the AMA-1 and the
      CSP virosomal vaccine, respectively) or unmodified virosomes were injected i. m. on days 0,
      60 and 180.
