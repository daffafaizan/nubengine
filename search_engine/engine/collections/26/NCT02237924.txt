      unified standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria,
      exclusion criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. Six medical centers
      participated in this study and 120 patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced
      low-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. These patients were stratified according to
      clinical stage and participating center, and were randomly divided into two groups: IMRT
      combined with Endostar group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, Endostar 7.5mg / m2, 2 cycles of intravenous
      infusion, and 2 cycles of maintenance therapy after radiotherapy) and IMRT combined with
      concurrent chemotherapy group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, DDP 100mg / m2, intravenous infusion over 2
      hours , for 2-3 cycles). After treatment, follow-up was performed every 3 months. The
      treatment toxicity, local control rate, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival,
      progression-free survival were observed and assessed.
