      DMMO. According to Maestro criteria, pre-operative planning is carried out by both clinical
      and radiological assessment. Patient demographic data, AOFAS scores, 17-Foot Functional
      Index, Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire, SF-36, VAS, and complications are recorded.
      Maestro parameters, relative morphotypes, and bone callus formation are assessed. Statistical
      analysis is carried out (p < 0.05).
