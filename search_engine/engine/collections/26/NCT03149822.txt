    
      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the efficacy based on objective response rate [ORR = complete response (CR)
           + partial response (PR)] of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib when administered in
           combination in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma..

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
           recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination.

        -  To assess other measures of anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab and
           cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
