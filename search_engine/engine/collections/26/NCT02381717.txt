      trial comparing the efficacy of Ultrasound Guided Femoral Nerve Blockade (USFNB) versus the
      standard of care pain management by parenteral injection of opioid pain medication of
      patients presenting with hip fracture at the BIDMC ED. We hypothesize that USNFB approach
      will be non-inferior in achieving pain control (efficacy) and superior in the total dose of
      opioids (lower amount) as compared to the standard protocol. The enrolled population will be
      randomized 1:1 using a simple balanced randomization scheme.

      Participants will be surveyed six times 6 times on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)* on their pain
      intensity reduction over 4 hours.

      Physicians performing the block will be surveyed promptly following the procedure regarding
      difficulty performing the block and its efficacy.

      Specific Aim #1: The investigators hypothesize that in patients presenting to the ED with hip
      fracture, USFNB will demonstrate equal efficacy in pain relief with fewer side effects when
      compared to conventional parenteral opioid therapy. The investigators evaluate this
      hypothesis by monitoring Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) in patients receiving either USGFNB or
      opioid therapy over the first 4 hours of observation. The side effects will be noted during
      the same interval of time.

      Specific Aim #2: The investigators hypothesize that in patients presenting to the ED with hip
      fracture, USFNB will reduce the amount of narcotic used to control pain. The investigators
      will evaluate this by studying narcotic use over the first 4 hours of evaluation.
