      experimental design and population characteristics reproduce those of the RIEHO cohort
      (Coordinator P Aegerter), which aims to identify individual and environmental risk factors
      for unscheduled hospitalization of the elderly and included 973 people over 80 years of age
      with a 2-year follow-up, closed in early 2017. Indeed, the workforce mobilized in the Rieho-C
      study is undersized to measure an association between air quality and a major health impact
      (hospitalization or death), this objective can only be achieved by adding Rieho-C data to
      those of Rieho.
