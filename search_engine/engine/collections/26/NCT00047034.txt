      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7389 administered as an IV bolus over
      1-2 minutes weekly for 3 weeks.

      II. To describe the toxicities of E7389. III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of E7389. IV.
      To determine the in vivo anti-mitotic activity of E7389 by cell cycle analysis and
      immunohistochemistry in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive E7389 IV over 1-2 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of E7389 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients
      experiences dose-limiting toxicity.
