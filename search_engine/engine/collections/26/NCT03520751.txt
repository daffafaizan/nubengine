    
      This clinical trial is an open-label, one-time injection study in which scAAV1.tMCK.NTF3 will
      be administered by intramuscular injections into the medial and lateral heads of
      gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and rectus femoris muscles in both legs in CMT1A subjects
      with PMP22 gene duplication. Three CMT1A patients, 18 to 35 years of age will be enrolled
      into one cohort in this trial. These adult subjects will be enrolled at an effective dose
      (8.87e11 vg/kg) based on a qPCR titer using linearized standards, equivalent to 4.00x1012
      vg/kg based on a qPCR titer using supercoiled standards) distributed bilaterally between both
      limbs in Cohort 1. Post-gene transfer monitoring will include follow up visits on days 7, 14,
      30, 60, 90, 120, and months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 following gene transfer. Safety is the
      primary endpoint for this clinical gene transfer trial. Stopping criteria are based on
      development of unacceptable toxicity defined as the occurrence of any one Grade III or
      higher, unanticipated, treatment-related toxicity. The secondary endpoint is efficacy defined
      as halting of the decline in functional and sensory abilities measured by the CMT Pediatric
      Scale (CMTPedS) at 2 years post gene transfer. The CMTPedS is an 11-item scale comprised of
      the Functional Dexterity Test, Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), hand grip, foot plantar flexion,
      foot dorsiflexion, pinprick sensation, vibration sensation, the Bruininks Oseretsky Test-
      Balance assessment, gait assessment, long jump, and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Exploratory
      outcome measures will include 10 meter run/walk timed test (10M), 100 meter timed test
      (100M), peroneal and ulnar CMAP amplitude and sensory and motor conduction velocities, a
      revised sensory testing to increase sensitivity for pinprick, touch-test and vibration
      assessments, visual analogue scales for pain and fatigue, Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) as
      Quality of Life measure, and circulating NT-3 levels.
