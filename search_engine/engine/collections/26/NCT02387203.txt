      standard H. Pylori eradication antibiotic therapy can suppress carcinogenesis and improve the
      long-term outcomes of patients with PMP. The first course of antibiotics (PrevPac) will be
      administered before cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC and the second course afterwards. The
      historical control group will consist of all PMP patients from Mercy Medical Center's Tumor
      Registry who did not receive perioperative antibiotic treatment. Long-term statistical
      outcomes will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard ratio
      to compare pertinent variable. 80 subjects to be enrolled over 2 years, with a 5 year
      follow-up period.
