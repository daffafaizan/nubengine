      health-promoting nutrients, antioxidants and phytochemicals. Like most other fruits, raisins
      are devoid of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, and low in sodium; these features, combined
      with their high potassium content, high fiber, and low glycemic index make them potentially
      preferable to other foods in their effects upon glycemic control and cardiovascular risk
      factors.
