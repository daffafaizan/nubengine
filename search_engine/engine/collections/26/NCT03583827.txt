      recovering from motor sequelae. A number of approaches have been proposed to promote motor
      learning, including virtual reality, which simulates a real world environment and is based on
      the assumption that skills acquired in a virtual world will be transferred to the real world.
      Virtual reality induces use-dependent plastic changes in response to stimulation of higher
      motor areas, recruiting the memory system containing stored motor programs. As such, these
      interactive interventions of virtual reality are based on the idea that stimulating the
      action processing system activates the cortical areas involved in movement execution.

      These game characteristics allow activation of the mirror neuron system during the execution
      or observation of actions. Recent evidence suggests an important role for this neuron system
      in the improvement or motor recovery of patients. In this respect, observing an action in
      association with physical training may enhance the effects of motor training on the recovery
      of patients with stroke.
