      (a and b) cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh A compensated cirrhosis) with advanced,
      un-resectable HCC who are eligible for TACE. This pilot study will have one arm which will be
      compared to historical controls. All patients participating in the study will receive
      Grazoprevir/Elbasvir treatment according to established guidelines together with regular TACE
      treatments. The historical controls will refer to patients who received regular TACE
      treatments alone (standard of HCC care). Follow up will be for up to 24 months from TACE
      initiation.
