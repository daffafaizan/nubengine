      thrombolysis to guarantee that the neurotrophic components are able to reach the endangered
      brain areas efficiently. An early start of treatment should guarantee rescue of most of the
      neurons reducing the overall damage.The study follows the design of pure thrombolytic trials
      to investigate, if the early neuroprotective treatment with Cerebrolysin is able to improve
      the overall outcome of patients at the day 90 evaluation visit. Due to the initial findings
      special emphasis will be also put on analysing the speed of recovery.
