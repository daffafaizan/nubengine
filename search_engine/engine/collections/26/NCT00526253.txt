      isolated and expanded in culture in a closed system. When a sufficient number of cells are
      estimated they are taken from culture, packaged in a suspension and sent to the patient's
      interventionalist. The interventionalist uses an injection catheter via femoral artery to
      inject the myoblasts directly into the myocardium.
