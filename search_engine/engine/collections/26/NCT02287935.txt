    
      Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus is common in young men and may recur overtime after surgery.

      It was investigated whether there is a factor that can aid determination of the preferred
      technique by comparing the early Limberg flap and Karydakis procedure techniques for the
      treatment of recurrent pilonidal sinus.
