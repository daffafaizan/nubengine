      polyclonal radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Growth hormone is
      measured at baseline and 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a 100 g glucose drink. Serum glucose
      is measured at baseline and at 2 hours post dextrose administration by the glucose hexokinase
      method.

      Clinical scores are determined for headache, perspiration, fatigue, joint pain, and acne.

      Exams and tests may be repeated every 6 months for 2 years.
