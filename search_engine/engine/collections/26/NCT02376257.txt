      the treatment of depression (i.e., outside the extinction learning where DCS has been shown
      to have success). Specifically, the study investigates the role of DCS in enhancing
      declarative memory in depressed individuals, as evaluated by standardized tests and the
      retention of cognitive therapy session material. Investigators will also study an active
      comparison agent, modafinil, which appears to offer cognitive enhancing effects among both
      sleep-deprived and non-sleep-deprived individuals, but also appears to have drug-state (e.g.,
      mood and side) effects that are not characteristic of DCS augmentation. Therefore,
      drug-context effects may affect memory retention over time. Hence, the study will evaluate
      memory enhancement effects both during the period of drug action as well as one week later
      when no drug is taken. Overall, investigators will examine cognitive function and memory
      performance over 4 study sessions in 96 men and women with major depression, who, in a
      double-blind fashion, will be randomly assigned to either: (1) 250mg DCS, (2) 100mg
      modafinil, or (3) placebo administered on Study Weeks 2 and 3. The memory tests include both
      items unique to a given study week and memory tasks that are repeated over time that allow
      assessment of memory and retention effects across one-week periods.
