    
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening cardiovascular emergency with a
      high mortality rate.Approximately 1% of all hospitalized patients and 10% of all in-hospital
      mortalities are PE related. Adding to this, acute PE is linked to comparatively high (â‰¥13%)
      short-term mortalities that occur either in hospital or within 30 days.

      Some studies have demonstrated that PE may indicate increased 1-year mortality rates up to
      25%,,. Therefore, PE is considered a potentially fatal disease, although patients who escape
      a PE-related death are still endangered by hematologic mishaps, especially recurrence of VTE
      and/or PE, or on the contrary, serious hemorrhage5.

      Risk stratification of patients with acute PE is mandatory for determining the appropriate
      therapeutic management approach. Risk classification of PE can discriminate low-risk
      patients, who can be medicated as outpatients, from others at high risk, in whom a profit
      from intensive care unit admission or even in-hospital thrombolytic therapy is expected.
