      compare the rate of alveolar fluid clearance, a marker of alveolar edema fluid resorption, in
      2 groups of patients with ARDS and suffering from hypovolemia: those treated with albumin and
      those treated with crystalloid (fluid challenge of 7 mL/kg over 15 minutes, that can be
      repeated 3 times if hypovolemia persists).

      The evolution of respiratory and hemodynamic parameters, as measured by transpulmonary
      thermodilution (extra-vascular lung water, pulmonary vascular permeability index, cardiac
      output, global enddiastolic volume), plasma osmolality, plasma oncotic pressure and plasma
      levels of brain natriuretic peptid (BNP) will be studied one hour and 3 hours after after
      fluid resuscitation in the two groups. In order to evaluate alveolar epithelial dysfunction
      in patients receiving either albumin or crystalloid, plasma and alveolar levels of sRAGE (the
      soluble form of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) will be measured by ELISA.
      Lung aeration and fluid-induced derecruitment will be evaluated with an electrical impedance
      tomograph (PulmoVista®500, Dräger).
