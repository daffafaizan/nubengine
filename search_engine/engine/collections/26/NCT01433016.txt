      consists of the BreathID device and a test kit containing a nasal cannula, a calibration gas
      container and a non-radioactive isotope ¹³C- Octanoate solution, and measures and computes
      the ratio between ¹³CO2 and 12CO2 in the patient's exhaled breath.

      This study's aim is to provide data on this novel system to dynamically and accurately assess
      liver function at the bed side. It is hoped that the system will provide prognostic
      information faster than is achieved at present with traditional methods. It is hypothesized
      that in the future the OBT may have an impact on decision making and clinical practice in
      this group of HCC patients, allowing a greater chance for proper management and hence
      survival.
