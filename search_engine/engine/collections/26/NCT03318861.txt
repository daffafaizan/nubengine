      criteria are met. Tests required to determine eligibility include disease assessments, a
      physical exam, ECG and echocardiogram of the heart, brain MRI, and blood draws. Eligible
      participants have white blood cells collected by leukapheresis. These cells are genetically
      modified to make the experimental treatment KITE-585. Participants receive conditioning
      chemotherapy prior to the KITE-585 infusion. After the KITE-585 infusion, participants will
      be followed for side effects and effect of KITE-585 on their myeloma. Study procedures may be
      performed while hospitalized and/or in the outpatient setting.
