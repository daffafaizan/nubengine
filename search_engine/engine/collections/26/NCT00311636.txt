      Primary

        -  Evaluate the incidence of chemotherapy-induced early menopause in premenopausal women
           undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy in combination with vs without triptorelin for
           previously resected stage I-III breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy and triptorelin vs adjuvant chemotherapy
           alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (adjuvant chemotherapy alone): Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy alone.

        -  Arm II (adjuvant chemotherapy and triptorelin): Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy
           and triptorelin intramuscularly 1 week before and then every 4 weeks for the duration of
           chemotherapy. The last dose of triptorelin is given before the last course of
           chemotherapy.

      Patients with hormone-sensitive tumors who resume ovarian function after stopping
      chemotherapy and triptorelin restart triptorelin until ovarian function is suppressed for 2
      years.

      Patients undergo menopausal status assessment, using follicle-stimulating hormone,
      luteinizing hormone, and estradiol as biochemical markers, at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months after the last course of chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients will be accrued for this study.
