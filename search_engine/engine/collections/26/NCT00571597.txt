      fibrillation will be followed prospectively. At 6 to 9 months, 1 and two years post surgery
      follow-up subjects will receive a trans-telephonic monitor to wear for approximately 1 month,
      and will submit transmissions on a daily basis. Episodes of atrial fibrillation will be
      documented during this time. The overall efficacy of the procedure will be assessed based on
      the freedom from atrial fibrillation at the time of transtelephonic monitoring.
