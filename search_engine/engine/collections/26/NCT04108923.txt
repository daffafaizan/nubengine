      makes meticulous hemostasis an important prerequisite in thyroid surgery for successful
      outcome. The mainstay for achieving hemostasis in thyroidectomy is tying and / or clipping of
      blood vessels. New technologies have been introduced , among them the vessel sealing device (
      ligasure ) which seals vessels by fusing the inner layers of the vessel wall with minimal
      levels of thermal dispersion burning and tissue friction thereby reducing incidence of
      accidental burns . This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using
      ligasure compared with conventional vessel ligation in open thyroid surgery
