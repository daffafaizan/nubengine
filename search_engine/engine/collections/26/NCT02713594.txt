      incentives can increase treatment participation and boost outcomes when they are tied to
      participation in evidence based treatments. However, most of this research has been done in
      laboratory settings and in relatively small clinical trials. This study is designed to test
      the hypotheses that incentives can increase both participation in smoking cessation treatment
      and resulting cessation rates, when they are offered to Wisconsin BadgerCare Plus (Medicaid)
      smokers as part of their health care. If successful, this treatment approach could be used
      more broadly to reduce the considerable financial and personal costs associated with
      smoking-related disease.

      In this study, Medicaid-eligible smokers were recruited from primary care clinics and from
      callers to the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) with randomization a Control condition and
      an Incentive condition. All participants were offered five cessation calls from the WTQL and
      participants were encouraged by WTQL coaches to obtain cessation medication from their
      primary care providers. All participants received payment for completing a baseline
      assessment ($40) and a 6-month smoking test ($40). Only Incentive condition participants
      received additional compensation for taking counseling calls ($30 per completed call) and for
      biochemically-verified abstinence at the 6-month visit ($40).
