      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), parallel-group, placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect) study. The study consists of Screening Phase (maximum of 42 days prior to Week
      0), Treatment Phase (Week 0-12) and Follow-up Phase (up to Week 16). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive JNJ-38518168 (3 milligram [mg] or 30 mg or 60 mg) or placebo
      once daily. The initial group of the participants will be randomized to either JNJ-38518168
      30 mg or placebo. The dose assignments for the subsequent participants will depend on the
      results of up to 2 interim analyses. Efficacy will be primarily assessed by percentage of
      participants who achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at Week 12.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
