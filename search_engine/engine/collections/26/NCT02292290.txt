      and those in the intervention groups will either receive Liraglutide in addition to metformin
      or those on dual therapy will switch from their sulphonylurea/pioglitazone to Liraglutide and
      continue with metformin. Informed consent and baseline data will be collected 4-8 weeks prior
      to the start of Ramadan. This will allow time for a run in period for the titration of
      Liraglutide prior to the fasting period. Ramadan is followed by Eid-al-Fitr a 3-day Islamic
      holiday that marks the end of this holy month. Tradition includes amongst early morning
      prayers/celebration through feasting. Therefore, participants will be invited to attend the
      first follow-up after this event (between weeks 2 - 4) and then at 12 weeks post Ramadan.
      Randomisation will not be revealed until after the baseline data have been collected.
