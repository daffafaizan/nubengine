      and were proposed to have osteostimulative properties by causing osteoblast differentiation
      in vivo and in vitro as shown by an increase in matrix formation. The aim of the present
      study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of 1% ALN and 1.2% ATV gel as a local drug
      delivery system in adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) for the treatment of intrabony
      defects in patients with chronic periodontitis.

      Methods: A total of 90 intrabony defects were treated with either1%ALN, 1.2% ATV or placebo
      gel. Clinical parameters (plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, probing depth [PD],
      and clinical attachment level [CAL]) were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months.
      Radiographic parameters intrabony defect depth (IBD) and defect depth reduction (DDR%) was
      calculated on standardized radiographs by using image analysis software at 6 and 9 months.
