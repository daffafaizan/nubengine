      average, half of all HIV-positive persons suffer pain. Chronic pain can lead to heavy alcohol
      use among HIV-positive persons, which may in turn be a barrier to treatment/control of HIV
      and contribute to spread of HIV. Thus there is an urgent need to address pain among persons
      with HIV. It is timely and relevant to conduct research on gabapentin, as it has emerged as
      one of the most commonly prescribed non-opioid medications for pain despite the fact that
      gabapentin is only FDA approved for "post-herpetic neuralgia" and the literature to support
      its use for generalized chronic pain is limited. And yet, gabapentin has demonstrated
      benefits for treatment of alcohol use disorder, and therefore, like naltrexone, it could have
      a specific role for treating patients with chronic pain and unhealthy alcohol use. This study
      is a 3-arm pilot, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of low-dose naltrexone
      and gabapentin vs. placebo among HIV-positive persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain
      to provide estimates of their effects on 1) pain (both self-reported and experimental/cold
      pressor test; 2) inflammation (i.e., levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and
      TNF-α); and 3) measures of HIV control (CD4 count and viral load).
