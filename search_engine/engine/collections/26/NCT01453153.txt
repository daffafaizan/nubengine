    
      PEGPH20 is a PEGylated version of human recombinant PH20 hyaluronidase that, in preclinical
      studies, has been shown to remove HA from the extracellular matrix surrounding tumor cells by
      depolymerizing this substrate. 87% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) overexpress HA.
      PDA tumor tissue may be especially sensitive to the HA-degradation properties of PEGPH20 and
      thus more responsive to the cytotoxic effects of a given dose of gemcitabine. Modifying the
      extracellular environment to increase the penetration and efficacy of anti-cancer agents
      represents a novel approach to treating pancreatic cancer and may provide important
      therapeutic outcomes in patients with Stage IV Previously Untreated Pancreatic Cancer.

      This Phase 1B/2 study will assess safety, tolerability, treatment effect, and various PK/PD
      endpoints.
