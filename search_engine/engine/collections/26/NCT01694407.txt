      Primary:

        -  To assess genital safety after a single use (consisting of one tablet in half of
           participants and one tablet followed by a second tablet two hours later in the other
           half) and during and after two weeks of daily tablet use

        -  To assess systemic safety after two weeks of daily tablet use

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TFV and FTC after a single use (as defined above)
           and during and after two weeks of daily tablet use

      Secondary:

        -  To estimate the time needed for tablet disintegration and the time needed for full
           tablet disappearance

        -  To assess acceptability of the tablet

        -  To assess indicators of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of TFV and FTC in vitro using
           biological samples (fluids) from study participants obtained before use, after a single
           (use as define above), and after two weeks of daily tablet use

      Exploratory:

      â€¢To assess exploratory indicators of the PD of TFV and FTC in vitro using biological samples
      (tissues) from study participants obtained before use, after a single use (as defined above),
      and after two weeks of daily tablet use
