      glucose control of rE-4 as compared to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients
      will be randomized into one of two rE-4 treatment arms or to placebo treatment and will
      continue with their required existing diabetes medications (metformin, a sulfonylurea or
      metformin and a sulfonylurea combination) throughout the study.
