      rapid and highly effective antidepressant treatment option. Ketamine modulates various
      neurotransmitter systems, though the mechanisms responsible for its antidepressant effects
      remain unkownn. However, the serotonin transporter (SERT) presents a target of high interest
      due to the SERT's fundamental role in depression's pathophysiology as well as in
      antidepressant response. The study at hand is the first to investigate ketamine's SERT
      binding in humans, by utilizing the highly selective SERT radioligand [11C]DASB and positron
      emission tomography. Further, investigation of severely depressed patients provides the
      unique opportunity to establish the relationship between ketamine's SERT binding and its
      antidepressant efficacy.
