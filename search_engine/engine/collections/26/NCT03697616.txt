      (GBR), there are many techniques for ridge augmentation involves the use of bone grafting
      materials, barrier membranes, possibly some tenting/fixation screws. For successful GBR,
      stability of bone graft, space maintenance, angiogenesis, and tension free primary suture are
      essential. Space maintenance with particulate bone graft should be provided during healing
      period. However particulate bone graft is easily migrated when grafted on the large
      horizontal bone defect. To reconstruct large bony defect or for the 3-dimensional ridge
      augmentation, bone tack on the collagen membrane or titanium mesh is required to contain
      particulate bone graft during healing but these procedures are surgically time consuming and
      technique sensitive.

      Sticky bone is biologically solidified bone graft which is entrapped in fibrin network.
      Sticky bone graft doesn't scatter because particulate bone powders are strongly
      interconnected each other by fibrin network.
