    
      This Phase 2b study will evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an RSV vaccine
      when given together with Tdap in approximately 710 healthy nonpregnant women 18 through 49
      years of age.

      The participants will be equally split into 5 treatment groups: One of a possible two dose
      levels of RSV vaccine (the higher dose level will be formulated with an aluminum hydroxide
      adjuvant) with either the Tdap or Placebo, or a Tdap and placebo combination.

      This study will evaluate non-inferiority of the Tdap when co-administered with RSV vaccine
      candidate and vice-versa by measuring participants' immune response through appropriate
      antibody and component levels 1 month after vaccination.
