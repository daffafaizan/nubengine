      convulsions despite receiving injection lorazepam intravenously at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (max 4
      mg) at a rate maximum upto 2 mg/min or intravenous diazepam at a dose of 0.2 - 0.3 mg/Kg
      (maximum 10 mg) slowly or intravenous midazolam at a dose of 0.15 - 0.2 mg/kg(max 5 mg). In
      case of children with difficult intravenous access buccal/nasal midazolam 0.2 - 0.3 mg/kg
      (maximum 5 mg) per rectal diazepam 0.5 mg/kg (maximum 10 mg) or intramuscular midazolam 0.2
      mg/kg (maximum 5 mg). If seizure continued at 5 minutes, a repeat dose of benzodiazepine was
      given with same dose. At 10 minutes, if the seizure activity still remains intravenous
      phenytoin was given at a dose of 20mg/kg(maximum- 1000mg) at a rate of 1mg/kg/minute or
      intravenous fosphenytoin at 20mg PE/kg (if available) at a rate of 3mg PE/kg/minute.

      Patients having seizure activity despite administration of above medications were considered
      to have RSE. Out of thousands of patients seen in outdoor and emergency ward, 80 patients
      were diagnosed to have RSE and met the inclusion criteria. After counselling the
      parents/guardians about the medications and obtaining a written informed consent they were
      randomized to into two groups : sodium valproate(V) and levetiracetam group(L), using a
      computer generated randomization chart. Forty patients in group V received intravenous
      valproic acid in dose of 20 mg/kg as loading dose at a rate of 40 mg/min after dilution with
      normal saline followed by maintenance dose of 10mg/kg/dose 8 hourly. In group L patients
      received intravenous levetiracetam as loading dose of 30 mg/kg at a rate of 50 mg/min
      followed by 20mg/kg/dose 12 hourly.
