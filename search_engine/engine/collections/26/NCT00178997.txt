      a large shielded room that measures magnetic activity of the intestines. Subjects will be
      asked to lie underneath and get recordings of the electrical activity of their intestines.
      They will also be asked to have a CT scan done. From these two procedures, the mathematical
      and computer models will be developed to determine the difference between normal bowels and
      those that do not have adequate blood supply.
