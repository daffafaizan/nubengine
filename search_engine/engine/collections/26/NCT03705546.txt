      perioperative management. Despite multidisciplinary treatment, Surgery is the primary
      treatment option for cure in NSCLC. The patients with lung cancer who underwent surgery have
      limitation of pulmonary function and high risk of co-morbidities. Perioperative physical
      activity has been shown to reduce symptoms and prevent complications, improve long term
      quality of life after surgery. But validated exercise regimen has not been established for
      lung cancer patients. Therefore, Evidence-based guideline focusing on lung cancer after
      surgery is needed.
