      The CoMatryx Surgical Collagen powder provides a physiologically favorable environment to
      promote healing at the wound site. When administered, the powder conforms to the wound site
      and forms a gelatinous occlusive barrier. Along with providing 19 amino acids directly to the
      wound site it also occludes live nerve endings reducing pain. Treating the wound with the
      CoMatryx Surgical Collagen powder provides the non-hydrolyzed collagen wound surface
      promoting autolytic debridement. The powder is effective in all phases of wound healing and
      can be delivered with antibiotics in areas where there may be a cavity. This product has FDA
      510(k) clearance for surgical wounds, full thickness wounds, traumatic wounds and skin tears.
