      hyperoxaluria. Subjects visited the research center three times for outpatient visits
      (Screening, Test Day 3, Day 4).

      Subjects were instructed to follow a low-oxalate diet, consuming only study-specified food
      choices that had low or no oxalate and controlled calcium content Days 1 through 4 (Baseline
      Period through the Day 4 clinic visit) and, on Test Day 3, consumed an oxalate-rich test
      meal.

      Subjects performed three 24-hour urine collections during Screening, Baseline Day 2, and Test
      Day 3. Test Day 3 included the oxalate-rich test meal and the subject collected a 24-hour
      urine separated into 4 urine collection intervals. (Pre-test meal, post-test meal to 4 hours,
      4-6 hours post test meal and remaining time to complete 24 hours).
