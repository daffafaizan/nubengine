      insomnia or sleeplessness when compared to not listening to any music, self-report data from
      large surveys was collected both at baseline, and during the interventions at day 17 (after
      the first music condition), and at day 31 (after the second music condition. Participants
      also completed daily diaries which was comprised of 6 questions that assessed their music
      adherence, sleep quality, and music likeability. These were completed daily from baseline
      through to the end of the study.

      Objective data was also collected during baseline period of 1-week, throughout both of the
      interventions (10 nights each for a total of 20 nights) and the washout period (4 nights)
      using the EMFIT tracker. This device relies on ballistocardiography, was used to objectively
      assess nighttime sleep in the natural environment. This sleep tracker is automatic,
      autonomous, and is installed under the mattress.
