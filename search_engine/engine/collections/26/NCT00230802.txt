    
      Our aim is to compare the safety and efficacy of 2 different empiric levothyroxine dose
      adjustment recommendations to be made at the first confirmation of pregnancy in women with a
      history of hypothyroidism. Subjects will be women with a prior diagnosis of hypothyroidism
      who are taking thyroid hormone replacement and who are less than 8 weeks pregnant. Upon
      confirmation of pregnancy, subjects will be randomized to increase their weekly thyroid
      hormone dose by either 2 or 3 tablets (28 or 42%). Thyroid function will be evaluated every
      two weeks in the first 20 weeks and then again at week 30 and post-partum. Primary endpoints
      will be the proportion of women in each group who remain euthyroid throughout the first
      trimester and throughout pregnancy
