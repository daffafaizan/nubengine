      be invited to participate in the study. Consenting patients will undergo a detailed screening
      examination, after which suitability to progress to randomisation to the study will be
      confirmed.

      Suitable screened patients will attend for scheduled surgery of vein removal as normal - this
      is termed "Day 0" At the time of wound closure, IMP will be administered via intra-dermal
      injection to each of the incisional groin wounds, and exit wounds.

      Each patient will serve as their own control with one leg being administered active IMP (at
      either a 5, 50, 200 or 500ng/100 ul)of dose solution, whilst the other leg is administered
      placebo solution. The study is double-blinded, so neither the Investigator nor patient will
      know which leg wounds receive which treatment.

      Further to Day 0, the patients are requested to attend for a further 5 follow up visits (Week
      6, Month 3, Month 5, Month 7 & Month 12), where photographs of the scars will be taken,
      together with spectrophotometry readings to measure colour of the scar. At each visit, the
      Investigator and patient will rate their opinion of the scar, by global assessment scale &
      VAS, together with patient completed questionnaires.
