    
      Approximately 400 Veterans with PTSD will be recruited from nine CBOCs in VISN 16 and 22.
      Veterans screening positive for PTSD and those already in active treatment will be recruited.
      Patients actively engaged in specialty PTSD treatment at the parent VAMC will be excluded.
      Patients will be the unit of randomization. A dedicated nurse telephone care manager will
      educate/activate patients, identify treatment preferences, overcome treatment barriers,
      monitor symptoms, side-effects and adherence, identify psychiatric comorbidities, and
      encourage patient self-management. Tele-pharmacists will provide medication management by
      phone. Tele-psychologists will provide Cognitive Processing Therapy (without exposure) via
      interactive video. Tele-psychiatrists will supervise the off-site care team as well as
      conduct consultations and provide medication management via interactive video. Telephone
      interviews will be administered at baseline, six and twelve months by blinded research
      assistants. Process of care measures will include: 1) whether the veteran received a
      documented treatment concordant with VA/DoD PTSD Treatment Guidelines, 2) self-reported
      adherence to treatment, and 3) satisfaction with care as measured by Experience of Care and
      Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey. Clinical outcomes will include: 1) PTSD severity as measured
      by the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), 2) depression severity as measured by the PHQ9,
      3) quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, 4) health status as measured by the SF12V
      and 5) quality of life as measured by the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale. Activity based
      costing methods will be used to measure intervention cost data.
