      children who have not received needed immunizations up to date. The proposed study builds on
      the success of a previous trial and incorporates data from providers and patients to further
      improve the intervention. In this study the investigators aim to increase the effectiveness,
      cost effectiveness, and acceptability to practices and families of population-based R/R by
      introducing a strong private-public collaboration and maximizing health information
      technologies that allow practices to interface with Colorado's Immunization Services System
      (CIIS). Two real-world approaches will be compared: one approach will provide primary care
      practices the tools to conduct recall and educational interventions. In the other approach,
      population-based centralized recall by the state immunization registry will be conducted in
      collaboration with practices. Determining which of these methods is most effective in
      reaching the most children and comparing the cost of each will provide data critical in
      guiding future national efforts to assure that children entering school are fully vaccinated.
      Because the trial will be conducted at the level of both urban and rural counties throughout
      the state and will include all types of providers, the investigators expect our findings to
      be nationally generalizable.
