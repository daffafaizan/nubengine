      I. To determine radiographic progression free survival with 4 cycles of docetaxel with
      carboplatin followed by maintenance rucaparib camsylate (rucaparib) in the treatment of
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with homologous recombination
      DNA repair deficiency.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to induction docetaxel and
      carboplatin.

      II. To assess PSA response to switch maintenance with rucaparib. III. To assess PSA response
      duration to docetaxel and carboplatin followed by switch maintenance with rucaparib.

      IV. To assess time to PSA progression with induction docetaxel and carboplatin followed by
      maintenance with rucaparib.

      V. To assess response of measurable disease.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive rucaparib camsylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
