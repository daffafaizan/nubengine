      dramatically increased over the past 40 years. As a result, approximately 40% of Americans
      attest to being on a diet, with most of these efforts being unsuccessful. Most weight loss
      diets rely on self-control and reflective thinking (e.g., making conscious food choices
      multiple times per day), despite the fact that responses to appetitive foods often occur
      through implicit (unconscious) processes. The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial
      for weight loss that targets these implicit processes through the use of a computerized,
      food-specific, go/no-go task. This task has previously resulted in reduced food consumption
      in laboratory settings, and small but significant weight loss in two brief intervention
      studies. The purpose of this study is to replicate one prior study and to compare different
      doses of the intervention. Participants will be assigned to one of three groups: high
      intensity, low intensity, or active control, and will be assessed on a number of variables
      pre- and post-intervention. Changes in body weight, food evaluation, frequency of
      self-reported food consumption, and eating disinhibition scores will be evaluated. It is
      hypothesized that individuals receiving the food-specific go/no-go training (high intensity
      and low intensity groups) will experience greater weight loss, decreased disinhibition with
      food, and reduced snacking of the targeted foods than those in the active control group. It
      is also hypothesized that the high intensity intervention will be more effective than the low
      intensity intervention across these variables. Moderators (e.g., dietary restraint,
      disinhibition) will also be explored throughout this study, along with the mechanism of
      devaluation of specific foods.
