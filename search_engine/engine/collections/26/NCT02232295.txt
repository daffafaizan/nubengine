      of different brain regions in a graded manner. GMI is a three stage treatment programme
      comprising of Left Right discrimination training, Explicit Motor imagery and Mirror therapy.

      In this Study, GMI approach is applied on the patients with Stroke to enhance their Upper
      limb motor functions and Quality of life.

      Conventional treatment:

      Patients of group A and group B had received conventional treatment for 6 weeks. Conventional
      treatment consists of Task oriented upper extremity functional exercises. Components of Task
      oriented training include weight bearing, supportive reactions, and reaching, grasping,
      holding and release activities. It was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour
      duration.

      Graded Motor Imagery:

      Patients of group A had received GMI programme with conventional treatment for 6 weeks. It is
      a three stage process, was performed five days a week for six weeks of one hour duration. It
      comprises of:

        -  Left Right discrimination training (Implicit Motor Imagery) - 2 weeks

        -  Explicit Motor Imagery (Imagined movements) - 2 weeks

        -  Mirror Therapy - 2 weeks
