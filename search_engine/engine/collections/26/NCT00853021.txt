    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effect of the combination of bevacizumab and aldesleukin on
           progression-free survival of patients with good- or intermediate-risk metastatic clear
           cell renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the objective response rate in patients receiving this regimen.

        -  To determine the time to progression in patients receiving this regimen.

        -  To evaluate immunomodulatory effects of this regimen in patients

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days -14, 1, 15, 29, and 42
      and aldesleukin subcutaneously on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Courses
      repeat every 8 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving complete response after completion of study therapy may receive
      1 additional course of therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
