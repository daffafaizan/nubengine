      17 weeks per participant, including Screening phase (up to 4 weeks prior to first probe
      cocktail administration). Participants will have 4 in-patient periods on Day 1, 8, 15 and 36
      (3 periods consisting of 3 days and 2 nights each and 1 consisting of 2 days and 1 night)
      followed by follow up period (up to Day 92). All Participants will receive a single 200 mg
      subcutaneous (SC) injection (2*100 mg) of guselkumab on Day 8 and probe cocktail on Days 1,
      15 and 36. Blood samples will be collected for the evaluation of pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
