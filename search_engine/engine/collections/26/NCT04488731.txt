      diseases (CVDs), including hyperhomocysteinemia and hyperlipidemia. Frequent coffee
      consumption has beneficial effects in reducing the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2,
      obesity, liver disease, CVDs, some types of cancer, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's
      disease. Controversies concerning coffee consumption benefits and risks in regards for CVDs
      were mentioned in many studies. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are necessary vitamins in
      homocysteine metabolism which is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Leptin, is a hormone
      linked to obesity and it could be related to atherosclerosis.

      The combined effect of coffee consumption and body weight on the levels of leptin, folic aid,
      and vitamin B12 is not well studied. In our study, we will study the effect of coffee
      consumption in males with different body mass indices to see the effect of several important
      parameters such as leptin, Folic acid, and vitamin B12.
