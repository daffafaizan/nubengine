      gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and menorrhagia. Thus, an effort to establish optimal
      treatment regimens for these indications, through a period of prospective evaluation, is the
      primary focus of this research. Other goals include a retrospective study of the effect of
      prophylaxis on bleeding frequency, and a retrospective natural history study of GI bleeding
      in VWD.
