      I. To determine the efficacy of the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib as >= 2nd line
      of treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with BRAF V600E mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine in patients treated with the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib as >=
      2nd line of treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with BRAF V600E
      mutation:

      Ia. The median progression-free survival. Ib. The median overall survival. Ic. Duration of
      response. Id. Time to response. Ie. The safety and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-25. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.
