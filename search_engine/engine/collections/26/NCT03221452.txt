      rate of cognitive decline after diabetes is diagnosed. In turn, the presence of cognitive
      dysfunction can make diabetes self-management more difficult. Few interventions have
      attempted to focus on cognitive function in the context of diabetes and none, to date have
      tested an intervention to improve cognition in order to improve diabetes self-management.
      Therefore the aims of this project are: (1) to refine an existing cognitive rehabilitation
      intervention and tailor it for persons with T2DM by using current literature and interview
      data from 10 participants with T2DM and (2) to conduct a feasibility study of the adapted
      intervention with 20 participants with T2DM. The intervention consists of 8 weekly group
      educational sessions to teach compensatory cognitive strategies. Additionally, participants
      will use a web-based, game-like program to build on the didactic information and practice
      activities to improve cognitive health. The project will provide baseline data for further
      research on diabetes self-management in the context of cognitive dysfunction.
