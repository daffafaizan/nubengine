      surgical application of vancomycin powder in Austria is limited as there is no powder with
      marketing authorization for intraoperative, intrawound usage. Previous reports widely
      document the application of vancomycin powder for solution for infusion. The powder is not
      soluted, but instead directly spread throughout the wound surface. Limited data is available
      for spinal fusion surgery, mostly retrospective studies. Results were promising, but the low
      evidence level does not allow for a conclusion regarding routine usage. Additional
      randomized, controlled trials are necessary to further investigate this matter.

      This trial aims to investigate Vancomycin powder "Xellia" 1000mg, which has a Marketing
      authorization, in an off-label usage (intrawound, intraoperatively) in spinal fusion surgery.
      The investigational medicinal product will be used unmodified.
