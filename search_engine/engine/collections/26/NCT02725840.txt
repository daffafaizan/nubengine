      subjects with breast cancer with radiation treatment to the affected breast and chest wall.
      The investigators are studying women receiving one of 2 types of radiation, either
      conventional X-rays (IMRT) or protons at the University of Florida Health Proton Therapy
      Institute (UFHPTI). These subjects typically would not receive follow-up chest CTs as per
      standard of care. All subjects will have received a pre-treatment chest CT scan as part of
      the treatment planning process. The investigators will enroll 30 subjects in the X-ray
      treatment group and 25 subjects in the proton group.

      The investigative team has recently solved the technical challenges of extracting and
      characterizing lung vascular anatomy from clinical CT images of the chest and used these
      tools to characterize acute and chronic changes to pulmonary vascular structure in breast
      cancer patients receiving radiation to the chest wall for treatment of their cancer.

      In Aim 1 of this study the investigators will compare lung vascular damage in women treated
      with conventional radiation with those treated at the UFHPTI. In Aim 2 they will use blood
      samples of the subjects of Aim 1 to investigate the differential role of inflammatory
      cytokines in the initiation and progression of pulmonary vascular radiation response in
      conventional versus proton radiation exposures. Aim 3 compares vascular damage with clinical
      pulmonary function assessment using spirometry and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide
      (DLCO). Aim 4 ties together Aims 1-3 by employing and extending existing mathematical models
      of radiobiological response to improve and solidify the scientific understanding of the
      biological mechanisms of radiation response.
