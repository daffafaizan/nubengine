      product types (i.e. an extruded snack versus a biscuit) influences glycemic response and
      satiety.

      This project will examine the effect of millet, on glycemic response and satiety. To
      determine the effect of product matrix and processing methods, testing will be done using an
      extruded snack, porridge, a couscous-like product and a biscuit.

      All product servings will provide 50 g of available carbohydrate and will be consumed by
      participants within 10 minutes.
