      interventions which were designed as randomized control trails (RCTs) have been studied and
      shown effectiveness in improving pain and disability. These exercises typically focus on the
      abdominal and back musculature strength. However, many LBP patients did not show any
      improvement in their symptom after they carry out those exercise programs. Some authors
      consider that this type of low back pain may be caused by leg length inequality (LLI) in
      these patients, which resulted from poor gluteal neuromuscular control or muscles' imbalance.

      In consideration of few studies have been done for investigating the effects of gluteal
      muscles control training in LBP. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect
      of additional gluteal muscles control training on improving functional LLI in patients with
      LBP. We hypothesized that gluteal muscle control training would be more effective in
      self-reported pain, and their functional disability would be improve after 6-week training
      program than control training group.
