      refractory acute leukemia or accelerated or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. II.
      Determine the effect of R115777 on farnesylation within leukemia cells. III. Determine any
      clinical response (at least 50% decrease in circulating leukemia cells) to R115777 by these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 for 7-21
      days. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) following 1-4
      courses of treatment may receive up to 4 additional courses. Patients with stable disease may
      receive another 7-21 day course. If CR or PR is then achieved, patients may receive up to 4
      additional courses. Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of R115777 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which between
      17% and 33% of patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
