      index (BMI) is 35 kg/m2 or greater. Trials in these morbidly obese patients confirmed the
      benefits in terms of weight loss and provide evidence that surgery can result in remission of
      diabetes, and as a result lead to improvement in cardiovascular risk factors. Within the
      light of these data, there appear to be a shift towards lower BMI, with many advocating it as
      a reasonable option for diabetics with a lower BMI (<30) who have failed other attempts of
      medical treatment. But this approach is limited because of lack of data on the effects of
      surgical outcomes in this group of patients which is the main rationale for this
      retrospective study.
