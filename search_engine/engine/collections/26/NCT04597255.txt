      aberrometry. We aim to achieve a digital equivalent for wavefront calculation of the
      widespread analog procedure commonly used with conventional wavefront-aberrometers. The
      results will be compared with those from a conventional analog wavefront calculation method.

      In the course of this pilot study, 20 eyes of phakic and 10 eyes of pseudophakic subjects
      with suspected higher order aberrations will be examined using H-OCT.
