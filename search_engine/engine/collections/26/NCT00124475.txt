      yield mostly unsatisfactory results. In addition, chronic hand dermatitis leads to 2-5% of
      all applications for permanent disability pensions in some western countries. In a
      therapeutic dose finding study alitretinoin was clinically effective for patients with
      moderate to severe chronic hand dermatitis refractory to topical treatment.

      Patients with severe refractory CHaD will be allocated either of two active treatments or
      placebo. The primary objective is to demonstrate the response rate based on physicians global
      assessment of the disease.
