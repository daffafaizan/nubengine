      parallel group phase, followed by a long-term safety extension (LTSE) phase up to 5 years.
      Participants from the 12-month DB phase, including those who received placebo, were eligible
      to participate in the open-label LTSE phase. The Month 12 visit from the DB phase served as
      the Day 1 visit of the LTSE phase. After completion of the 12-month DB phase all participants
      were offered the opportunity to enter an open-label LTSE for up to 5 years beginning at 5 mg
      OCA.

      Data for the LTSE phase is reported by the randomized dose group assigned in the DB phase.
