        -  BAX (usual technique) : Axillary brachial plexus block (Axillary block) with a
           long-acting LA (Ropivacaine)

        -  BAX-Asso (experimental technique) : Axillary brachial plexus block (Axillary block) with
           a short-acting local anesthetic (Lidocaine) + Analgesic block at the elbow with a
           long-acting local anesthetic (Ropivacaine) Every block will be performed under
           Ultrasound. BAX will be performed using a multi-injection technique at contact with
           median (nM), radial (nR), ulnar (nU), musculocutaneous (nMC) and medial antebrachial
           cutaneous (nCMAB) nerves. 15-30 mL of LA will be injected.

      Analgesic truncal blocks of the median and radial nerves will be performed at the elbow. 3-7
      mL of LA will be injected.
