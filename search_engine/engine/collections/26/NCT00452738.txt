      experienced more problems post surgery. These problems included reporting of more pain and
      requested more pain medication during hospitalization and home follow up. Consumption of pain
      medication may not be the optimal pain management program. In contrast, numerous human-animal
      interaction studies have shown that animals tend to have a calming effect on people, reduce
      stress, and lesson anxiety. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to examine the
      effect of pre surgery dog visits as compared to a costumed character or parents-only on the
      consumption of pain medication after surgery.
