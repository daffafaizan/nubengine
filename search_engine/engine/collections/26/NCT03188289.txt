      oral surgery. Healing of the wound is initially sought by approximating the edges using a
      suturing technique. Adherence and microbiological accumulation of the suture during the
      period that it remains in the mouth, which can serve as a focus for odontogenic infections.
      The use of oral antiseptics before and after the surgery is an efficient method for microbial
      reduction. The purposes of this project were to evaluate the microbial growth in the suture
      thread on different culture means after the post-surgical application of the gels under
      study, while assessing the intensity of post-surgical pain and the degree of healing of the
      surgical wound.

      Material and methods: It is a randomized and blind clinical trial. 21 patients participated
      (42 wisdom teeth), who consulted the unit for a surgical tooth extraction for at least the
      two lower wisdom teeth. The evaluated bioadhesive gels were: Chlorhexidine gel at 0.2 %
      (Bexident Gel Gingival速), Chlorhexidine gel at 0.2% + Chitosan (Bexident Post速) and
      hyaluronic acid gel (ODDENT速). A neutral water-based gel without any active ingredients was
      also used HISPAGEL 200速 (Acofarma, Madrid, Spain) as the control agent. An assessment of the
      post-surgical healing, the microbiological analysis of the suture thread and the
      post-surgical pain was developed.
