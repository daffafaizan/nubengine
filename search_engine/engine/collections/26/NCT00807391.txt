      lesion of the lung lies between 32 and 57%. Several studies prove an amelioration of success
      rates by addition of cytological methods such as TBNA, TBCA and bronchial brushing.
      Furthermore, for TBNA and TBCA a significantly higher yield was reported in comparison with
      transbronchial forceps biopsy. TBNA and TBCA are routinely used methods, both techniques are
      safe, the instruments used are certificated.
