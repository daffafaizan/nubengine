      in the developed countries. Only recently, calcific aortic valve disease, was proved to
      belong to the family of atherosclerosis. It is associated with higher cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality, the cause of which is not entirely clear. The link to significant
      coronary artery disease, probably, is of highest importance.

      We compare groups of patients with coronary artery disease and calcific stenotic, sclerotic
      or intact aortic valve. The aim is to assess and compare their risk profile to verify our
      hypothesis that, within significant coronary artery disease, calcific aortic valve identifies
      a subgroup of patients with higher cardiovascular risk, assessed by endothelial dysfunction
      and the two year follow-up of cardiovascular events on optimally set treatment.

      Further, we study the possible association of valvular calcification and calcium metabolism
      in patients with normal kidney function.
