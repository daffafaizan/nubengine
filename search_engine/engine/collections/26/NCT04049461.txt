      complication after general surgery. However,according to our retrospective analysis. HOAI was
      more frequently observed in the malignancy group (33/121 cases, 27.3%) than in the non-
      malignancy group. Because of the many biases in the retrospective analysis, the result was
      not widely shared.

      The purpose of this prospective study is to confirm that pancreatic cancer is the cause of
      heterotopic ossification of abdominal incisions. According to postoperative pathology, the
      patients were divided into two groups: pancreatic cancer group and benign diseases group.The
      researchers will observe whether patients develop heterotopic ossification of the abdominal
      incision one year after surgery to conclude.
