      failure, and none have included non-neonatal pediatric patients. Cochrane systematic reviews
      of this evidence concluded that ECMO for neonatal respiratory failure had a survival
      advantage, but there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a survival advantage for ECMO
      used to support respiratory failure in adults. Moreover, these trials were performed prior to
      2009, and since then advances in ECMO technology have enhanced the delivery of ECMO support,
      and new research has changed conventional management of severe acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS)
