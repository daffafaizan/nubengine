      regulate glucose levels in children with type 1 diabetes. There will be up to two 40-hour
      test in outpatient settings, in which we will assess an insulin dosing algorithm. The two
      tests will allow us to compare different tunings in the same patient (this allows easier
      interpretation of the data). For example, if in a specific participant, the dosing algorithm
      reduced insulin delivery at night to avoid low blood glucose levesl but led to a rebound
      increase in glucose levels, then a second visit with a slightly different target range will
      help answer this question. The objective of this clinical trial is to assess the safety of
      our algorithm in children with type 1 diabetes in a free-living study.
