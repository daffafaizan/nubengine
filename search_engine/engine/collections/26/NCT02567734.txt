      of CT-guided percutaneous irreversible electroporation（IRE）in the treatment of patients with
      locally advanced tumors. Investigators will screen eligible patients and examine them by
      imaging tests as well as serological examination before and after the IRE procedures to
      assess the result with the size，blood supply，metabolism of tumors，the change of blood test
      and treatment-related complications. Big bore multislice spiral CT with thickness 5 cm,
      120kilovolt，and 250milliampere，ECG-gated device and anesthesia monitoring equipment were
      selected during these procedures. Imaging (performed by contrast enhanced CT scan) and
      serological follow-up was at postoperative day 3 and 1，3，6，12months. The primary endpoint is
      the effective rate of IRE，and the secondary endpoint is 1-year survival rate and the
      frequency of adverse events. The response of irreversible electroporation ablation will be
      assessed according to the different evaluation criterions based on Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors.
