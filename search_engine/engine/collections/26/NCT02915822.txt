      patients into two groups for surgical correction of Hallux Valgus - Open Scarf/Akin osteotomy
      and Minimally Invasive Chevron/Akin osteotomy. Patients will complete a validated
      questionnaire (Manchester Oxford Foot questionnaire) preoperatively and post operatively at 6
      months and 1 year. Range of motion of the Great Toe Metatarsal Phalangeal Joint will also be
      measured by goniometer. This study will assess the ability to recruit and retain patients and
      thus determine if a study comparing the surgical techniques would be feasible. In addition,
      for data collected statistical differences of the change in patient reported outcomes, range
      of motion between the two groups will be calculated with a significance level of p<0.05. This
      study will assess if a larger study comparing minimally invasive to open Hallux Valgus
      correction would be able to be performed
