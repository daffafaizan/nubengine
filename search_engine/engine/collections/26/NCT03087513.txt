      prevention of intraoperative injury during spine surgery.(Schwartz, Sestokas et al. 2011)
      Patients with cervical myelopathy often present with neurological deficits and recording of
      the motor evoked potentials are often challenging in these patients. In addition, anesthetic
      agents especially muscle relaxants can abolish the motor response making it difficult to know
      when the baseline MEP can be recorded.

      The usual anesthetic practice for patients undergoing posterior cervical spine surgery is to
      administer muscle relaxation to aid intubation at the start of the case . The neuromuscular
      blockade is then allowed to wear off and the neurophysiologist will attempt to record their
      baseline motor evoked potentials during or just prior to surgical exposure.

      The issues with this current technique are;

        1. Patients cannot be monitored for neurological changes during their transfer into the
           prone position

        2. There is likely residual neuromuscular blockade decreasing the amplitude of motor evoked
           potentials.

      Investigators plan to perform a randomized controlled cross-over trial comparing the change
      in MEP amplitudes with administration of sugammadex or placebo. This will be performed on at
      risk patients (e.g. cervical myelopathy) undergoing posterior cervical spine surgery where
      MEPs can be more difficult to attain but of higher utility.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade with
      Sugammadex can increase the amplitude of the motor evoked potentials.
