      treatment program for hazardous drinking, delivered within HIV-clinic outpatient settings,
      that involves oral naltrexone. The central hypothesis is that women participating in the
      treatment program will have decreased rates of hazardous drinking and improved clinical and
      behavioral health outcomes that are associated with hazardous drinking. The investigators
      have formulated this hypotheses based on the existing literature, the preliminary data and
      the clinical experience. The investigators theorize that women who receive an alcohol
      treatment intervention will be less likely to have "at risk" drinking behavior 6-months after
      enrollment, compared to women who received similar assessments but no formal treatment
      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that 4-months after enrollment, women who receive
      an alcohol treatment intervention will have improved adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy,
      improved CD4 cell counts, reduced HIV viral load, and reduced risky sexual behavior, compared
      to women who receive similar assessments but no formal intervention.

      The investigators will recruit 240 women from one site in Miami, Florida. Of those 240 women
      120 will receive naltrexone and the others will receive placebo. Study participants will take
      the medication for 4 months but the investigators will follow them for 7 months. At baseline,
      2 months, 4 months and 7 months, the investigators will administer study questionnaires and
      assess their liver enzymes, CD4 count and viral load. The investigators will also follow them
      up at months 1 and 3 to reinforce the medication intake and to assess for any possible side
      effects.

      New treatment options are available, but their impact on hazardous drinking has not yet been
      evaluated among HIV-infected women, many of whom are poor, minorities, or who have associated
      mental health or substance abuse problems. Delivery of therapeutic interventions must be
      improved in order to reduce hazardous drinking in women with HIV/AIDS. The proposed research
      is significant because the therapy will be offered within HIV clinic settings and will
      potentially improve the health of a population that is significantly undertreated. In
      addition to determining the effectiveness of an alcohol treatment intervention, the
      investigators will also identify key barriers and facilitators associated with adherence to
      pharmacologic treatment for alcohol in women with hazardous drinking. The findings will
      directly affect the type and quality of care for hazardous drinking in this subset of
      HIV-infected individuals and will inform both primary and secondary prevention efforts.
