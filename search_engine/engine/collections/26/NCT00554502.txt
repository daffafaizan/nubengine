      study aims to answer if in patients with IgA nephropathy, the most common type of
      glomerulonephritis an immunosuppressive treatment (with the use of steroids and chemotherapy)
      added to a supportive treatment is more effective than a supportive treatment alone (with the
      use of drugs lowering the blood pressure and the urinary protein loss).
