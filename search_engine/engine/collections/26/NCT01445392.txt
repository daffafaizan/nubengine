      SS1P (dsFv) PE38, is a recombinant immunotoxin targeting the tumor antigen mesothelin that is
      highly expressed in malignant mesothelioma. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SS1 dsFv has
      been established in a phase I study.

      Combination therapy with pemetrexed plus cisplatin is the standard first line therapy for
      malignant mesothelioma, but results in a median overall survival of only 12.1 months.

      Combination of SS1(dsFv)PE38 with pemetrexed plus cisplatin could result in improved outcomes
      for patients with mesothelioma.

      Objectives:

      To determine the MTD of SS1(dsFv)PE38 that can be safely administered in combination with
      pemetrexed plus cisplatin in patients with mesothelioma.

      To characterize the toxicity profile of SS1(dsFv)PE38.

      To study the pharmacokinetics of SS1(dsFv)PE388.

      To observe anti-tumor activity, if any of SS1(dsFv)PE38 in combination with pemetrexed plus
      cisplatin.

      Eligibility:

      Subjects with histologically confirmed epithelial pleural mesothelioma.

      No prior radiotherapy (except palliative localized radiotherapy),systemic chemotherapy or
      biologic therapy for pleural mesothelioma.

      Design:

      This is a phase I dose-escalation study of SS1(dsFv)PE38 in combination with pemetrexed plus
      cisplatin.

      The dose of pemetrexed plus cisplatin will be the standard dose approved for malignant
      mesothelioma. The dose of SS1(dsFv)PE38 will be escalated to find the safe dose in
      combination with pemetrexed plus cisplatin.

      SS1(dsFv)PE38 will be administered concurrently with pemetrexed plus cisplatin in cycles one
      and two, and subjects will receive additional cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin as per
      standard practice.

      Patients will be assessed for response every 6 weeks.

      An additional Single Cycle of SS1(dsFv)PE38 Cohort will involve up to 16 patients who will
      receive SS1(dsFv)PE38 administered for four or five doses during the first cycle concurrently
      with pemetrexed and cisplatin; subjects in this cohort will receive additional

      cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin as per standard practice
