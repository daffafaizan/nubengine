      Although a family history of diabetes is an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes,
      lifestyle factors also play an important role in its cause . However, physicians are poorly
      informed about how their patients' alcohol use affects risk for or management of diabetes.
      Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with lower risk of both cardiovascular
      disease and type 2 diabetes, and is also linked to lower cardiovascular risk among type 2
      diabetics. Potential mechanisms have focused primarily on lipid metabolism, coagulation,
      fibrinolysis, and insulin sensitivity. A recent systematic review of the literature to assess
      the effect of alcohol consumption on risk for and management and complications of diabetes
      mellitus suggests that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk for
      diabetes, whereas heavy alcohol consumption may be associated with an increased risk. Our aim
      is to assess the effect of moderate alcohol intake on glycemic control and cardiovascular
      disease mediators among patients with type 2 diabetes.
