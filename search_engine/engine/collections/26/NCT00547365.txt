        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose of human immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) given
           weekly for the first 3 months and then bi-weekly for 9 additional months in patients
           with cardiac-associated primary light chain-associated (AL) amyloidosis.

        -  Determine the safety, pharmokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy as evidenced by titers of
           serum fibril-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies pre- and post-IGIV infusions.

        -  Demonstrate stable or improved organ function.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive human immune globulin IV (IGIV) once weekly for 3 months and then
      once biweekly for 9 months, for a total of 12 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection to measure serum anti-fibril antibody titers pre-
      and post- IGIV infusion for assessing safety and response to treatment.
