      Plans (SMHP), for those enrolling in health insurance in the ACA marketplace. I Can PIC was
      developed based on SMHP, with input from an advisory board, and incorporating feedback from
      semi-structured qualitative interviews with cancer survivors. The investigators created I Can
      PIC to focus on unique needs of cancer patients and survivors considering health insurance.
      In this study, the investigators will examine the effectiveness of I Can PIC by conducting a
      randomized experiment with 275 participants. The trial will compare the I Can PIC to an
      attention control website developed by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.
      Primary outcomes include knowledge, decision self-efficacy, certainty about plan choice, and
      the match between plan choice and preferences. The investigators will also explore whether
      financial toxicity, cancer type, and time since diagnosis relate to outcomes.
