      parallel-group comparison study in Japanese patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B
      untreated with any nucleic acid analogue and its subsequent open-label study. Efficacy and
      safety will be compared between once-daily dosing of GSK548470 300 mg and once-daily dosing
      of ETV 0.5 mg, and subsequently the efficacy and safety of GSK548470 administered long term
      will be investigated. A total of 165 subjects will be assigned to the GSK548470 group or the
      ETV group at a ratio of 2:1. The subjects will be assigned by stratified randomization in
      terms of HBe antigen and serum HBV-DNA level. The primary purpose is to verify the
      non-inferiority of GSK548470 to ETV using as an index the change amount of HBV-DNA level at
      Week 24 from the baseline level. The secondary purpose is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of GSK548470 300 mg administered once daily for a long term.
