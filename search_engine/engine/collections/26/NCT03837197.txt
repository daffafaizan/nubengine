      increase the risk of graft dysfunction and of poorer outcomes.

      Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) is a recent organ preservation strategy for marginal
      kidney and liver grafts, which allows to redirect anaerobic metabolism to aerobic metabolism
      under hypothermic conditions and to protect grafts from oxidative species-related damage;
      these mechanisms may potentially improve graft function and survival.

      Methods This is an open-label, randomized multicenter clinical trial with the aim of
      comparing HOPE vs. static cold storage (SCS) in ECD kidney and liver transplantation.

      In the study protocol - approved by ethics committee - 220 patients (110 liver recipients and
      110 kidney recipients) will be enrolled. Livers and kidneys assigned to HOPE will be perfused
      by machine perfusion with cold Belzer solution (4°-10°C) and with continuous oxygenation
      (partial pressure of oxygen = 500-600 mmHg). In the control group, livers and kidneys
      undergoing SCS will be steeped in Celsior or University of Wisconsin Belzer solutions and
      stored in ice. Using the same perfusion machine for both liver and kidney grafts, organs will
      be perfused from the start of the back-table procedure until implantation, without increasing
      cold ischemia time (CIT). For each group the investigators will evaluate clinical outcomes,
      graft function tests and histologic findings, as well as perfusate and the number of
      allocated organs.
