      member of the research team, followed by a period of seven days of habitual activity
      monitoring and 3 days of diet recording. Eligible participants will be allocated into study
      groups by way of minimization based on sex, age, BMI, and number of sit-to-stands performed
      in a minute. Participants will undertake two familiarisation sessions with strength, power,
      neural drive, and balance tests at least seven days apart, the first following eligibility
      screening and the second familiarisation session at least five days before the first main
      trial.

      Thereafter, both groups will undertake a main trial the day before commencing 28 days of
      daily 150 g yoghurt supplement with the breakfast meal, with the exercise snacking group (ES)
      also undertaking two bouts of exercise snacking a day. The main trial will include measures
      of leg muscle function and neural drive, standing and single leg balance, and movement
      co-ordination during tasks of everyday ambulation. Participants will wear a physical activity
      monitor and pedometer for the seven days and record diet for three days during the last week
      of the intervention. The day after the intervention period, a follow-up main trial will be
      conducted as per the first main trial, followed by an optional qualitative interview
      regarding participant's experience of the trial.
