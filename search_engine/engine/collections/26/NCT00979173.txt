      the intratumoral and plasma levels of AC480 obtained and its antiproliferative activity.
      After recovery from surgery, all patients will resume AC480 at 300 mg orally BID until
      evidence of disease progression or toxicity (Part II: Maintenance Therapy). Those patients
      will be followed for determination of 6-month progression free survival. Patients will remain
      on treatment for as long as they have clinical benefit from the treatment. There will be no
      limit to the number of cycles of treatment a patient can receive providing they continue to
      benefit from and are not intolerant to AC480 administration.

      The data collected in this study will be summarized in tables listing the mean, standard
      deviation, and number of patients for continuous data, or in tables listing count and
      percentage for categorical data, where appropriate. All patient data will be listed by
      patient or by parameter, all statistical analyses will be performed and all data appendices
      will be created by using the SAS system. Pharmacokinetic analysis will be made to determine
      if AC480 reaches the intracerebral tumor tissue. Comparisons will be made between the data
      obtained from the plasma of the same patients treated on AC480, including determination of
      the tumor-to-plasma ratio. The most common side effects of AC480 are generally mild to
      moderate in severity and include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, cough, elevation of
      the liver enzymes, anemia, and rash.
