      Phase 1 (MOST Preparation Phase) is to allow us to establish and refine procedures at these
      new sites and document aspects of feasibility, including our ability to a) recruit
      participants; b) train yoga teachers to fidelity; c) randomize participants to intervention
      components and correctly administer these components; d) run classes; and e) collect
      follow-up assessments. Enrollment period for this phase will last approximately 4 months.
