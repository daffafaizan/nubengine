    
      The study will include 210 patients with chronic liver diseases. Relevant clinical data such
      as sex, age, weight, height, alcohol intake, medical history and routine lab results will be
      collected.

      The study will include three groups:

        1. Patients with indication for liver biopsy will undergo a routine liver biopsy and also
           routine liver Ultrasonography, Shear wave elastography and Electrical Impedance
           Technology (EIT) (70 patients).

        2. Patients with chronic liver diseases will undergo routine liver Ultrasonography, Shear
           wave elastography and Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) (70 patients).

        3. Patients with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease will undergo routine liver
           Ultrasonography, Shear wave elastography and quantification of liver steatosis using the
           Electrical Impedance Technology (EIT) (70 patients).
