    
      This is a randomized, open-label, five-period, balanced crossover study conducted in
      approximately 40 healthy adult subjects enrolled at one study center in the USA. Subjects
      receive five eltrombopag treatments: tablet fasted, PfOS fasted, PfOS with a high calcium
      meal, PfOS 2 hours prior to a high calcium meal, and PfOS 2 hours after a high calcium meal,
      and each treatment is a single 25 mg dose. There is a 10 to 14 day washout between periods,
      and between the last dose of study drug and the follow-up visit. During each treatment
      period, subjects undergo serial PK sampling over 72 hours for measurement of plasma
      eltrombopag concentrations. Safety is assessed by vital signs, clinical safety laboratory
      assessments, and adverse events reporting.
