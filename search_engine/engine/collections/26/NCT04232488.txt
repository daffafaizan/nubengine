      valuable as the 'classical' radial approach for coronary angiography and interventions. Up to
      now, the success of the procedures has been described in several papers, with no difference
      in the complication rate and characteristics of the coronarography compared to the radial
      approach. It was observed that patients using distal radial access had fewer postoperative
      radial artery occlusions, which is particularly suitable for patients with renal disease (for
      preservation of the radial artery due to the potential formation of AV fistula for dialysis)
      and progressive coronary disease in order to preserve the radial artery for aortocoronary
      bypass formation. It is also potentially less likely to develop compartment syndrome and is
      suitable for patients with reduced forearm mobility. Since wrist immobilization during
      hemostatic compression is not required, the use of a distal radial approach allows for early
      mobilization of patients and a shorter duration of compression itself.

      Aim of the study: To compare the characteristics of coronary angiography / percutaneous
      coronary intervention (duration of procedure, time to obtain the vascular arterial access,
      amount of contrast used, time and amount of radiation, success of procedure) and patency of
      radial arteries 3 months after the intervention using the distal ('snuff box') and proximal
      ('classic') radial approach Purpose of the study: to confirm the efficacy of the distal
      radial approach as equally effective with a lower degree of radial artery occlusion during
      the follow-up period Research Hypothesis: Patients using a coronary angiography /
      percutaneous intervention using a distal radial approach had less occlusion of the radial
      arteries at long-term follow-up, with no significant difference in the features of the
      angiography / intervention itself (duration of procedure, time to obtain the vascular access,
      amount of contrast used , time and amount of radiation, procedure success).

      Study participants: patients undergoing coronary intervention at the Catheterization
      Laboratory of the Clinic for Cardiovascular Diseases at the Clinical Hospital Center "Sestre
      milosrdnice", Zagreb Research Methodology and Material: Standard materials and standard
      methods will be used to perform coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention
      Research Plan: After signing the informed consent, the study will include 250 patients in the
      distal transradial approach group, and 500 patients in the proximal radial approach group
      (control group). The materials, as well as the procedure technique, are standardized; the
      characteristics of the procedure (duration of the procedure, time of obtaining the arterial
      access, amount of contrast used, time and amount of radiation, success of the procedure) will
      be observed and Doppler of the radial artery will be performed on the first following
      operator-specified control (usually after 3 months of the procedure) to determine the patency
      of the artery.
