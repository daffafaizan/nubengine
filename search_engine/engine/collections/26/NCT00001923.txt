      for phantom pain is often disappointing. In amputees, hyperexcitability of the posterior
      parietal cortex area (PPC) contralateral to the side of the amputation has been linked with
      the presence of phantom sensations. PPC is an area overactive in different forms of chronic
      pain too. It is therefore conceivable that downregulation of activity in PPC could improve
      phantom limb pain, a condition poorly responsive to available treatments. We have previously
      demonstrated that low frequency TMS (1 Hz) results in decreased excitability of the
      stimulated cortical regions. We plan to apply low-frequency TMS to PPC cortical areas
      contralateral to the side of the amputated limb. We expect that this intervention will result
      in amelioration of the phantom pain. Stimulation of the PPC area (target intervention) will
      be compared with a control intervention in which TMS is directed slightly away from the head.
