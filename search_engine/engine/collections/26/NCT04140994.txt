    
      Participants will participate in 1 session of neuronavigated (TMS Navigator, Localite,
      Schloss Birlinghoven, D-53757, Sankt Augustin, Germany ) iTBS (patterned form of rTMS)
      coupled with motor learning. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: real
      iTBS over parietal cortex and sham iTBS over the parietal cortex.

      One day before (Day1) and after the motor learning (Day 2), participants will undergo
      high-density 128-channel resting state electroencephalography (EEG) and motor evoked
      potential (MEP) in order to characterize the effects of rTMS on our markers of plasticity.
      Performance on the task will be measure immediately after learning (Day 2) and again 24h
      later (Day 3) in order to test for retention and offline consolidation (time and errors). The
      task will consist in realizing a computerized mirror-drawing task, in which right-left
      movements of the mouse were reversed on the screen.
