      neuromuscular responses to spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) through peak force or thrust
      duration modulations, such an assumption remains to be confirmed. Therefore, the objective of
      the present study was to determine if different SMT force-time profiles where a constant rate
      of force application would be maintained (through the modulation of the peak force and the
      time to peak force) lead to similar neuromechanical responses. Based on the available data
      relative to the effect of SMT biomechanical parameters modulation, it was hypothesized that
      neuromuscular responses would be similar across SMT force-time profiles, while vertebral
      displacements would increase as SMT peak force increases.
