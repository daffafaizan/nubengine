      treatment of amebiasis. Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoon Entamoeba
      histolytica. It affects about ten percent of the world's population, being especially common
      in areas with poor health infrastructure. This is a Phase I open label, multiple dose study
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Auranofin following oral dose administration for 7 days
      to healthy subjects. 15 healthy male and female volunteers age 18-45 years, inclusive
      enrolled in one site. The study duration is 48 weeks and up to 23 weeks of subject
      participation. The primary objective characterizes the pharmacokinetics of gold, given as
      auranofin, during and after 7 days of once daily oral dose administration. The secondary
      objective monitor the safety of Auranofin during and after 7 days of oral administration.
