    
      The purpose of this study is to explore the use of off-label CFTR modulators that may affect
      CFTR function in patients with CFTR mutations that are not currently approved for these
      drugs. Symdeko (Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor), Orkambi (Ivacaftor and Lumacaftor), correctors of CFTR
      misfolding and Kalydeco (Ivacaftor), a potentiator of abnormal CFTR gating, will be explored
      as a treatment for patients with other CF mutations than those currently approved. Patients
      who have a mutation that responds to a CFTR corrector from in vitro study will be given
      Symdeko, or Orkambi, depending on the in vitro response pattern. Patients who have mutation
      response to a potentiator of CFTR function will be given Ivacaftor monotherapy. Patients with
      a mutation equivalent to wild type will be given Ivacaftor. If the patient is 6-12 years old,
      we will only study Orkambi or ivacaftor as symdeko is not yet FDA approved in this patient
      population.
