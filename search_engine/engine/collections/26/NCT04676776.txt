      menses who have not confirmed pregnancy status. Provision of MPPs could expand reproductive
      service options for individuals in a variety of settings. This study will collect data on the
      efficacy, safety, and acceptability of a 3-day missed period pill regimen among individuals
      with missed menses of 1-10 days
