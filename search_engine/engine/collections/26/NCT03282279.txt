      to collect oocyte after ovulation induction in Assisted Reproductive techniques (ART). It is
      a very safe technique with infectious complications of any kind occurring in just 1% (Bennett
      et al.) of all procedures, vaginal bleeding in 0 to 1.3% of the procedures (Ludwig et al.,
      Bodri et al., Aragona et al.) and vascular, gastrointestinal and genitourinary (Grynberg et
      al. and Catanzarite and al.), injuries being extremely rare (Bennett et al.). Case reports
      account also for rarer complications such as ovarian abscess formation (Kelada & Ghan and
      Sharp et al.) pseudoanerysm formation (Bozdag et al. and Jayakrishnan et al.),
      uroretroperitoneum (Fiori et al.).

      The rational of thestudy is to provide the percentages of complication from TVOR of the
      Fertility Center of Humanitas Research Hospital, also considering the development in time of
      technologies and techniques in Assisted Reproduction. Another rational is inquire whether
      there is any risk factor for such complications in order to try to prevent them in future
      procedures. The investigators performed a retrospective observational study including all the
      transvaginal oocyte retrieval procedures performed between 1996 and October 2016.

      The data have been collected from the Humanitas Fertility Center' Department database
      (ART.it). Because of the retrospective nature of this study, a specific informed consent was
      not necessary.
