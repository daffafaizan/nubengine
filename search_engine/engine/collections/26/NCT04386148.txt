      The use of regenerative medicine in colorectal surgery constitutes an entirely new
      therapeutic principle. The aim of this new therapeutic approach is to reduce the anastomotic
      leak rate and minimise morbidity and mortality. The literature identifies the leak rate for
      colorectal operations as 3-39%.

      Methods:

      This is a prospective, multi-centre descriptive study commencing in June 2018. As part of the
      elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery, an autologous fibrin matrix was used as part of
      anastomotic technique in conjunction with activated thrombocytes (Obsidian ASGÂ®). During
      anastomosis, this matrix was applied after resection onto the colorectal tissue surfaces with
      the aim of triggering tissue regeneration and improved wound healing.
