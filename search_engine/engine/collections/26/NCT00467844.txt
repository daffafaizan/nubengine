      responsible for reductions in lean mass.These catabolic changes are accompanied by an
      increase in total energy expenditure, but a decrease in voluntary energy expenditure that
      ultimately results clinically in cachexia and its symptoms of lethargy, fatigue, weakness and
      general malaise (Kotler DP. Cachexia. Ann Intern Med. 2000; 133:622-634).

      The prevalence of cachexia increases from 50 percent at presentation to more than 80 percent
      before death from malignancy. In over 20 percent of cancer patients, cachexia is the cause of
      death (Bruera E. Anorexia, cachexia and nutrition. Br Med J 1997;315:1219-1222). Cancer
      cachexia leads to shorter survival, decreased response rates and increased toxicity to
      chemotherapy, weakness, and an overall decreased quality of life (DeWys et al. Prognostic
      effect of weight loss prior to chemotherapy in cancer patients. Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group. Am J Med. 1980 Oct;69(4):491-7). The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy
      of GTx-024 on total body lean mass. Secondary endpoints include but are not limited to
      assessment of GTx-024 on muscle function, total body weight and total body fat mass.
