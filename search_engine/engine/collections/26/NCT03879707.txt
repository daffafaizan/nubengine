      frequently occur in patients after surgery, and its occurrence is harmful for postoperative
      recovery. Many factors can affect the quality of sleep after a major surgery including
      anesthesia-type, narcotic use and discomfort due to pain or restricted leg movements. Pain
      directly leads to sleep disruption or even deprivation and, in turn, poor-quality sleep
      aggravates pain sensation. There seems to be a vicious circle: pain - poor-quality sleep -
      intensified pain - even poorer-quality sleep.

      Presumably, if a patient suffers from catastrophizing, depression and anxiety , the result of
      TKA will be worse due to poor sleep.
