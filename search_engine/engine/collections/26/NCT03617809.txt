      is challenging. Thus, it is essential to monitor temperature in order to be able to take
      measures to avoid the appearance of hypothermia. Once the temperature has decreased, its
      treatment is difficult since the application of heat to the body surface takes a long time to
      reach the core thermal compartment. Intraoperative warming alone cannot avoid postoperative
      hypothermia. The application of forced-air warming system during the preoperative period has
      been shown to be the most effective measure to prevent hypothermia and maintain
      intraoperative normothermia. However, long time periods of prewarming would not be efficient.
      Thus, the ideal warming time prior to the induction of anesthesia has long been investigated.

      Due to the searching of optimal prewarming time, the conductance of this study is justified.
