      IgE-CMA allergy patients 2. to estimate the potential of recovery from reduced BMD after
      administration of milk during oral immunotherapy.

      3. To determine the efficacy of intervention with other (non-dairy) calcium enriched diets in
      IgE-CMA young adults, utilizing several methods to direct compliance.

      Methods: We will study the bone mineral content (BMC), BMD, serum values of bone turnover
      factor, dietary and lifestyle questionnaires of 150 post pubertal IgE-CMA patients with no
      history of dairy consumption and 150 age and gender matched normal controls. Separately, we
      will compare the above values of these patients to those of former IgE-CMA patients who now
      ingest milk after recovery from allergy. Finally, we will examine the effects of including
      non-dairy dietary sources of calcium in IgE-CMA patients, with different groups receiving
      different degrees of interventional guidance.

      The study will provide insight into the bone health of CMA patients, and provide guidance as
      to effective dietary treatments and its implementation. Furthermore, important nutritional
      data on the best methods for intervention to reduce osteoporosis will likely be learnt, that
      should have far reaching ramifications, not only to this particular population, but to
      osteoporosis patients, at large.
