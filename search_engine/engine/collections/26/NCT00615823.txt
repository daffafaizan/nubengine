      failure. Several research have proved that inflammation may participate in the pathogenesis
      of PAH. As atorvastatin inhibits inflammation and has beneficial effects on blood vessels in
      other types of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, atorvastatin may similarly benefit patients
      with PAH. Experimental data suggest that statins attenuates pulmonary hypertension in animal
      experiments. In addition, non-controlled clinical studies suggest that atorvastatin is
      effective and safe in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive 6 months of daily placebo
      tablets or daily atorvastatin in a double-blind fashion. The study will compare the safety
      and efficacy of placebo and atorvastatin.
