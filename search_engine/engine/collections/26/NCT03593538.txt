      smokers quit. Mood disturbance and cognitive deficits during nicotine withdrawal may be
      important treatment targets given their association with smoking relapse. In addition,
      factors such as HIV-1 infection may exacerbate abstinence effects on mood and cognitive
      deficits and thus should be measured and controlled for. The investigators hypothesize that
      the FDA-approved medication, metformin, will attenuate withdrawal-related mood disturbance
      and cognitive deficits, controlling for HIV status. Using a well-validated abstinence
      challenge paradigm, the investigators propose a placebo-controlled double-blind parallel arm
      study with one between-subjects factor of medication (low dose: 500 mg, high dose: 1500 mg,
      and placebo). Non-treatment seeking smokers (HIV-: n=54; 18 per group) will complete this 23
      day study.
