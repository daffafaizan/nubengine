      (400 mg) over a period of time and compare the blood levels to those with normal hepatic
      function (N=4) to determine if there is delayed metabolism and clearance of proglumide in
      those with hepatic impairment (HI) (N=8). Eligible subjects will provide a baseline blood and
      urine sample prior to ingesting proglumide 400 mg po. Blood will be collected from an
      intravenous catheter after ingestion at the following intervals: 1 hr, 3 hrs, 5 hrs, 7 hrs
      and 24 hr (Â± 4-5 hours). After 3 hrs and 5 hrs subjects will provide a urine sample. Samples
      will be analyzed by Mass Spectometry. Proglumide blood and urine levels in ng/ml will be
      plotted over time and the Cmax (peak plasma concentration), Tmax (time to reach Cmax) and
      T1/2 (elimination half time) calculated for each subject and compared to that of 4 healthy
      controls.
