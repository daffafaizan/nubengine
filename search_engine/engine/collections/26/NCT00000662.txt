      and virologic parameters with administration of AZT.

      This Treatment IND (investigational new drug) is an open label, uncontrolled protocol. AZT is
      ordered and prescribed by the patient's physician. The physician is responsible for obtaining
      informed consent, assuring that the patient meets the eligibility criteria, dispensing the
      medication to the patient, monitoring the patient's condition on treatment, and reporting
      required data to the project coordinating center.
