      physicians to successfully predict the presence of pneumonia in traumatically injured
      patients. Bronchoscopies will be videotaped. The clinician doing the procedure will make
      prediction as to whether the patient, in fact, has pneumonia. In addition, at least one other
      physician will view the videotape and predict whether the patient has pneumonia.

      Once laboratory results are available, the physician predictions will be compared against the
      definitive laboratory determination
