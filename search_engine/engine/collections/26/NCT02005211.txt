    
      This is a Phase I, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single centre study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AZD3293 following
      single and multiple ascending dose administration to healthy subjects. This study consists of
      two parts, ie, single dose part with young healthy subjects (Part 1) and single and multiple
      dose part with elderly healthy subjects (Part 2). The study design allows a gradual
      escalation of dosage levels between sequential cohorts with safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the healthy subjects.
