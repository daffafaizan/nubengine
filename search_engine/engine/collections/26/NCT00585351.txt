      of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) for further care will be invited to participate in a
      research study testing the following: 1) feasibility of beginning a research study while the
      patient is in transit to UIHC, and 2)test efficacy of a low risk medication called,
      Ranitidine, to help lower the chances of developing chemical pneumonitis in patients that
      have had a stroke.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose injection of either Ranitidine
      (50 mg) or placebo (normal saline). Independently of the study injection, the patient will
      continue to receive the usual standard medical care for their stroke. The patient will be
      cared for by a team of doctors in the stroke service. Some of these doctors and nurses are
      investigators for this study and will assess the patient's neurological status to see how
      much the stroke has affected the patient. They will also determine by the patient's symptoms
      and the results of a chest x-ray (if that test becomes necessary due to fever) whether the
      patient has developed chemical pneumonitis They will also administer a questionnaire to the
      patient or their relative prior to discharge about their thoughts on doing clinical studies
      while being transported by the helicopter and to collect any thoughts they may have had about
      improving this process. Completing the questionnaire is voluntary, and the patient is free to
      skip any question that they would prefer to not answer.

      Three months after the patient has had the stroke, they or their relative will be contacted
      by phone to determine the patient's long-term outcome after their stroke. After the follow-up
      telephone conversation the participation in the study will end.
