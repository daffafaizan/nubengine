      I. To estimate the safety and tolerability of the combination of ribociclib and an aromatase
      inhibitor in adults age 70 or older with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the full toxicity profile including all grades. II. To estimate the rate of
      worst grades of myelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia),
      neutropenic fever, gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite,
      vomiting, stomatitis), fatigue, neuropathy, and thromboembolism.

      III. To describe rates of dose reductions, dose holds, and hospitalizations. IV. To estimate
      objective response rate and clinical benefit rate as defined by modified Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (1.1) criteria.

      V. To estimate median progression-free and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of adherence to ribociclib. II. To explore factors other than
      chronologic age that can affect toxicity rates as identified using a cancer-specific
      geriatric assessment.

      III. To describe the results of the Was It Worth It (WIWI) and the results of the Overall
      Treatment Utility (OTU) Questionnaires.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and aromatase
      inhibitor per treating investigator's discretion. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then annually
      thereafter.
