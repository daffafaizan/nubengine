      investigate the modulatory effect of oxytocin on interoception and whether this effect will
      vary as a function of emotional valence. In Experiment 1, subjects will perform a heartbeat
      detection task and the group differences between oxytocin and placebo groups of the
      interoceptive accuracy and neural activity in the core interoceptive network will be
      investigated. In Experiment 2, subjects will be asked to watch emotional faces while perform
      the heartbeat detection task. Investigators will examine whether oxytocin's effects on
      interoception will be varied as a function of different emotional valence.
