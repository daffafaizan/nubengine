    
      This is a single center, pilot randomized pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) of 500 cancer
      patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or recurrent cancers. Patients
      will be randomized to genotyping intervention vs delayed genotyping intervention supportive
      care. Supportive care regimens may include therapies for antiemesis (ondansetron), pain
      management (opiates), GI protection (PPIs), antidepressants (select SSRIs), and antifungal
      prophylaxis (voriconazole), and warfarin depending on their chemotherapy regimen.

      For those randomized to the genotype intervention group, genotype results will be returned in
      the EHR pre-emptively and supportive care will be prescribed based on genotype results. For
      those randomized to the delayed genotype intervention group, supportive care will be
      prescribed based on usual clinical practice. Both groups will be followed for 3 months and
      undergo assessments with the MDASI questionnaire four times (pre-chemotherapy, and 2 weeks, 4
      weeks and 12 weeks post initiation of chemotherapy.

      Records for patients receiving outpatient care at the UF Health Cancer Center clinic at the
      Medical Plaza will be screened based on inclusion / exclusion criteria for participation in
      this study. Those that meet criteria will be offered participation. Participation is expected
      to last approximately 12 weeks and the study will be open for 30-36 months.
