      This study will recruit patients who have received at least six cycles of 5-azacytidine
      without response or whose disease has progressed or relapsed while on 5-azacytidine. The
      first cohort of patients will receive clofarabine 10 mg/m2/day for five days and the second
      cohort of patients 5 mg/m2/day for five days, both every four to six weeks. The investigators
      will determine the frequency of response to the two dosages of nucleoside analog in this
      group of patients. Measurement of responses will include improvement in the peripheral blood
      count, reduction in the blood and platelet transfusion need and eradication of
      cytogenetically abnormal clones.

        -  Primary Objectives

             1. To determine the frequency and duration of peripheral blood responses to IV
                clofarabine in MDS patients who have failed 5-azacytidine

             2. To determine the frequency and duration of bone marrow responses to IV clofarabine,
                including CR + PR

        -  Secondary Objectives

      To determine whether clofarabine exhibits a DNA hypomethylating property
