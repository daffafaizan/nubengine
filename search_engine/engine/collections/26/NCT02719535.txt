    
      Experiment 1: To evaluate changes in corneal biomechanics caused by short-term corneal
      reshaping therapy.

      Subjects will wear a conventional RGP lens in one eye, randomly selected, and an
      orthokeratology lens in the fellow eye, for 30 minutes, 60 minutes and one night,
      respectively. Corneal stiffness and tangent modulus will be measured before and after each
      wearing period.

      Experiment 2: To evaluate changes in and the recovery of corneal biomechanics effected by
      long-term corneal reshaping and to assess whether corneal biomechanics can predict the rate
      of corneal reshaping.

      Subjects will wear orthokeratology lenses for 6 months. Regular follow up visits (1 week, 1
      month, 3 months and 6 months) will be arranged to monitor the changes in corneal stiffness
      and tangent modulus.
