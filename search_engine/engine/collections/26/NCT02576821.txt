      cornu ammonis subfields of the hippocampal formation unrelated to Alzheimer's disease
      pathology. In contrast to HS that affects younger adults with epilepsy, older individuals
      with HS have significant ante-mortem cognitive dysfunction but no epilepsy. Neuropathological
      studies demonstrated three main types of HS associated with aging: (a) HS-Ageing to refer to
      the disease with HS pathology in ageing individuals, observed in more than 10% of subjects
      aged over 85 years; (b) HS observed in the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia
      (bvFTD), HS being more frequent in tau-negative pathology, especially in FTLD-TDP. bvFTD
      patients may manifest severe episodic memory impairment and hippocampal atrophy; (c) HS
      associated with cortical or subcortical cerebral microinfarcts, which are invisible on
      conventional MRI. Cerebral microinfarcts are observed in 33% of elderly over 85 years in
      post-mortem studies.

      HS leads to anterograde amnesia mimicking early Alzheimer's disease (AD) (so called
      HSA-nonAD). Recent studies showed that (a) the deficit of episodic memory as well as the
      level of hippocampal atrophy in bvFTD may be of similar severity to that observed in AD, even
      at initial presentation, leading to misdiagnosis in 22% of cases with post mortem diagnosis;
      (b) amnesia with HS due to microvascular lesion and microinfarcts can also cause impairment
      of episodic memory mimicking AD, without subcortical cognitive profile. Because these
      diseases involve distinct pathophysiological processes, they require different specific care
      and treatment. In consequence, it is very important to improve our knowledge about HS in
      order to identify its mechanism and improve the diagnosis.
