      hardware, pulse sequences and data analysis software to plan radiotherapy treatment and to
      assess tumor response to radiotherapy (only FDA approved hardware are allowed in this study).
      Efforts to develop, modify and evaluate new or existing MR imaging techniques must be a
      continuous practice with the goal of enhancing the use of MRI during radiation therapy. The
      investigators therefore anticipate an ongoing need for such a protocol and believe the
      ability to perform such studies is critical to the translation of new imaging technologies
      from concept to routine clinical use. Under this protocol, modifications to the following
      items may be tested: pulse sequence programs, radiofrequency coils, reconstruction and
      processing software, other MR system hardware and analysis software. A brief description of
      each of these items is described below. The potential risks associated with modifying each of
      these items, and the measures that will be taken to minimize these risks are described in
      subsequent sections.

      Given that performing MRI examinations during radiation therapy is not the current standard
      of care, no changes to radiation treatment plans, radiotherapy delivery or treatment
      recommendations or guidelines will be done based on the findings for any participants entered
      on this protocol.
