    
      The primary aim of this study is

        -  To compare immune responses after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination
           The secondary aims are

        -  To compare the duration and breadth of antibody responses between natural infection and
           vaccination.

        -  To investigate the duration and breadth of B and T cellular responses between natural
           infection and vaccination.

        -  To evaluate the short and long term complications after natural infection and
           vaccination.

        -  To find out if previous infection skews the immune response after vaccination.

        -  To study reinfection after natural infection and vaccination.
