      integration of palliative care in interventional oncology on three outcomes of interest:

      1) caregiver well-being, 2) patient physical and psychosocial outcomes, and 3) health
      services utilization and costs. Palliative care focuses on providing patients with serious
      illnesses and their families with physical, emotional, social, practical, and spiritual
      support. Recent trials examining the integration of palliative care in cancer care have
      individually shown improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life, reduction of
      caregiver burden, and/or health services costs. These studies, however, have not collectively
      analyzed these impacts.Further, a recent study shows that integrating palliative care early
      in lung cancer care has proven beneficial to both patients and caregivers. Given the
      potential of this previous body of research, the proposed study offers a comprehensive
      analysis of the early integration of palliative care on caregiver well-being, patient's
      physical and psychosocial outcomes when living with liver and metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC), and health services utilization. This study thus broadens the scope to additional
      cancer types and degrees of progression.
