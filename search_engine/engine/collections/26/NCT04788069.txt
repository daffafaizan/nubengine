    
      A 3-phase randomised cross-over trial will be applied consisting of 3 intervention periods of
      2 weeks, with a test day performed at the last day of each intervention period. During each
      intervention period, participants will consume a fixed amount of test bread, replacing their
      regular bread, and they will keep food and stool diaries preceding each Test-day. Faecal
      samples will be collected before each Test-day. On the Test-day, participants will perform a
      gastric emptying breath test. Furthermore, blood samples and appetite ratings will be
      collected at regular time points after consumption of the test bread for measurement of
      glucose, insulin, gut peptides, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and blood lipids. Food intake
      will be assessed by offering the subjects a standard lunch to be consumed ad-libitum.
