      multiple disabilities are diagnosed, treated and accompanied for many years in a
      multidisciplinary setting with physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, ergo therapists, speech
      therapists and Support by social workers. MZEBs are considered to have a pilot function in
      the health care system, cooperating with therapists and physicians in the surroundings. This
      concept is established as a new concept in Germany in order to optimise health care for
      patients with disabilities. Thus we want to investigate patient characteristics, diagnoses,
      involved physicians and therapists as well as proposed therapies and disease progress in this
      center.
