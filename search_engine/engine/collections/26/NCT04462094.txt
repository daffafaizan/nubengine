      and metabolic changes in the body. The immune system and the nervous system communicate both
      ways, and it was found that nociception and proinflammatory cytokines play a joint regulatory
      role, i.e., increased production of proinflammatory cytokines can worsen the pain. Major
      surgery can trigger the release of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Î±.

      The acute analgesic effect of ketamine is generally believed to be mediated through the
      blockade of the phencyclidine binding site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor of
      nociceptive neurons. Ketamine can reduce the inflammatory response marked by a decrease in
      CRP levels to surgical trauma and can prevent secondary damage to tissues/organs that were
      not initially affected by surgery by reducing inflammation. This also reduces postoperative
      pain and analgesics.
