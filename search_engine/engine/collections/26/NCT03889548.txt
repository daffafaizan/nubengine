      neural signaling to the limbs in the absence of any mechanical movement of the limb.
      Kinesthetic imagery tasks require an individual to imagine they are maximally contracting a
      target muscle group. Previous investigations have shown mental imagery tasks to increase
      maximal strength of the limb and even attenuate strength loss during periods of
      immobilization. Similarly, corticospinal excitability, which indicates the ease in which the
      cortex can stimulate muscular contraction, has also been shown to increase during mental
      imagery tasks. These adaptations have been attributed to the role of the cortex as a critical
      determinant of strength and the potent cortical stimulus posed by mental imagery.

      Mental imagery and resistance training have both shown to provide a positive impact on muscle
      strength. However, the interplay between a mental imagery task and resistance training
      experience has yet to be fully investigated in terms of their impact on corticospinal
      excitability and inhibition. To our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of resistance
      training experience on corticospinal excitability and inhibition during a mental imagery
      task. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine if resistance trained and untrained
      participants experience differences in corticospinal excitability and inhibition during
      kinesthetic mental imagery.
