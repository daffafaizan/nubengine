        -  Correlate the differences in serum protein profiles with the differences in the number
           of peptide matches in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and in
           healthy volunteers.

        -  Correlate protein levels with the largest difference in peptide matches in sera in these
           participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Participants undergo blood, tissue, and saliva collection for biological studies. Samples are
      analyzed for albumin-bound and non-albumin-bound proteins or IgG via liquid chromatography
      and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS), ELISA, proteomic profiling, and protein expression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients and 50 healthy volunteers will be accrued for this
      study.
