    
      The TEMOkids study is an international open-label, non-randomized, prospective, single-arm
      phase 1 study to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of a single dose of an oral
      suspension of temozolomide (KIMOZO) in the pediatric population aged 1 year and over.

      Patients will be subject to at least one 21 or 28-day treatment cycle involving
      administration of an oral suspension of temozolomide (KIMOZO) for five consecutive days
      followed by 16 or 23-days resting period, with determination of the PK parameters on the
      first treatment day.

      Five (5) additional cycles will be allowed under compassionate use regimen. The compassionate
      use period could be extended at the discretion of the investigator and in agreement with the
      sponsor. Safety and activity data will be collected during the compassionate follow-up
      period.

      The study will be held in multiple sites spread across Europe.
