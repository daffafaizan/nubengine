    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the 2-year rate of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)-4.0
      grade 3 or higher toxicity at 2 years between the two treatment arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the 2-year locoregional failure free survival (LFFS) in patients being treated
      with reirradiation with either stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) versus intensity
      modulated radiation therapy/intensity modulated proton therapy (IMRT/IMPT).

      II. To determine if there is any difference in local control, progression-free survival, and
      overall survival between the two arms.

      III. To compare toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)-4.0 and
      Performance Status Scale-HN (Head and Neck).

      IV. To compare patient reported outcome (PRO) measures of symptoms using MD Anderson Symptom
      Inventory (MDASI), MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy (FACT)-HN, ACT-HN Symptom Index (FACT-HNSI), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain
      Tumor (MDASI-BT), for skull base only, Anterior Skull BASE Questionnaire (ASBQ), for skull
      base only, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS),
      Performance Status Scale For Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN), Work Productivity and
      Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem version (V)2.0 (WPAI:SHP), and
      University of Michigan Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale, Xerostomia and Health
      Questionnaire (European Quality of Life Five Dimension Three Level [EQ-5D-3L]).

      V. Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALY) comparison between IMPT and IMRT. VI. Compare
      cost-benefit economic analysis of treatment. VII. Perform dosimetric analysis and compare
      correlates of critical structures.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess potential differences between patients on study and patients who were considered
      eligible for randomized, were randomized to a treatment arm, but may have dropped out of the
      study for other reasons after being randomized to; or were denied insurance coverage for the
      treatment arm she/he was randomized.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo SBRT every other day for a total of 5 treatments.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo IMRT/IMPT once daily (Monday-Friday) for up to 30-35 treatments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-3 months, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 3-4 months for up to 2 years.
