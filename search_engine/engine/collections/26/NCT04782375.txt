      short-term clinical outcome between stopping and continuing antiviral treatment in chronic
      hepatitis B patients without cirrhosis who are currently HBV DNA (-) and HBeAg (-)
      Approximately 280 subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled and randomized (1:1)
      to Treatment Arm (A) or Treatment Arm (B), as below;

        -  Treatment Arm A: 140 subjects, discontinue antiviral treatment (stop group)

        -  Treatment Arm B: 140 subjects, continue antiviral treatment (continue group) This study
           was designed to randomly assign treatment groups to subjects in order to prevent biases
           that may be intervened, and to increase comparability between the groups. Since
           post-treatment HBsAg titer could affect the clinical outcome in the eligible subjects,
           randomization will be stratified by post-treatment HBsAg titer (â‰¥100 IU/mL or <100
           IU/mL) at screening at a 1:1 ratio by using centralized stratified block randomization.

      Both groups (i.e. Treatment Arm A and B) are scheduled to be followed up to 2 years. Patients
      in the Treatment Arm A (stop group) were retreated with nucleos(t)ide analogues that had been
      prescribed previously if they fulfill one of the following criteria: 1) HBV DNA >2,000 IU/mL,
      2) progression to liver cirrhosis, or 3) development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
