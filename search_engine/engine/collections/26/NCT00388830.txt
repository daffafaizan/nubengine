      determining cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Historically this test has been performed in
      the Radiology suites where the patient was expected to fast for times of six to ten hours.
      Patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) have also been required to wait to have
      their study performed in order to have better visualization of the gallbladder. However, few
      studies have examined whether a fasting time matters in determining gallbladder pathology.
      Furthermore, with the emphasis on through-times in the ED, most EDs cannot afford holding
      their patients in the ED to wait for a test. Finally, with the advent of emergency bedside
      ultrasonography and the greater level of comfort emergency physicians (EP) have in diagnosing
      gallbladder pathology, it is possible to now determine an answer within minutes. We will test
      to see if EPs trained in the use of emergency bedside ultrasound can effectively and
      efficiently determine gallbladder pathology and if fasting has an impact on their ability to
      perform a quality ultrasound.
