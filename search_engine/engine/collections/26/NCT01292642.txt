      develop and refine a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention. Twelve subjects (50%
      female, ages 18-65) who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th
      edition (DSM-IV) criteria for both marijuana and nicotine dependence and seek treatment to
      stop using both marijuana and tobacco will receive individual CBT aimed at treating both
      disorders, as well as Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in the form of a transdermal
      nicotine patch. Subjects will start with a 21-mg nicotine patch for 6 weeks, followed by a
      taper to a 14-mg nicotine patch for 2 weeks and, finally, a 7-mg nicotine patch for 2 weeks.
      Others will start with a 14-mg patch for 8 weeks followed by a 7-mg patch for 2 weeks. All
      participants will receive 10 weeks of 1-hour weekly CBT with an experienced clinician.
      Follow-up visits, scheduled at 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks, will evaluate of the durability of
      treatment effects on drug use and psychosocial outcomes.
