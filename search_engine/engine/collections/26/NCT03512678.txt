      EasyScan Go prototype in various field settings. The performance of the EasyScan Go prototype
      will be assessed by scanning of negative and positive slides with the EasyScan Go and
      comparing the results with expert microscopy. Plasmodium genus- and species-specific PCR will
      also be performed on samples collected at some sites as an additional confirmatory test for
      the detection of malaria parasites and their species if present. Testing by microscopy and
      EasyScan Go will be performed in field clinic settings on Giemsa-stained slides prepared from
      febrile patient blood collected from a finger-prick. Further work will be undertaken at the
      WWARN laboratory in Bangkok for data analyses and for quality assurance.
