      studies have looked at this and have estimated that 30% to 48% of the general population is
      affected at some time in their life with a form of insomnia that goes on for several months,
      and about one third of those are described as severely affected. Daytime symptoms of insomnia
      include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Recent
      epidemiologic research focusing on the quality of life has identified significant
      insomnia-related conditions that relate to work productivity, health care utilization, and
      risk of depression. Insomnia is associated with diminished work output, absenteeism, and
      greater rates of accidents.

      peak plasma concentration levels, compared with placebo and using zopiclone as the reference
