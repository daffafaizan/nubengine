      blind, placebo-controlled, three day doses, crossover study design. In practice each eligible
      patient was randomized by a computer-generated schedule to receive in sequence double-blind
      treatments with placebo or MNT (5 mg). Patients in sequence 1 received MNT, then crossed over
      to matching placebo; vice versa the case was for patients in sequence 2. Placebo and active
      treatments were separated by a 7-10 day wash-out period. Each child was assigned to one out
      of seven groups in order to perform the exercise challenge at different time intervals from
      drug administration which occurred always at 8.00 A.M. On day one the challenge was performed
      in the different groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours after drug administration,
      respectively. Then treatment was continued as a single day dose for three consecutive days
      and a third challenge was then performed at the same time of the day.
