    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of topotecan in patients with recurrent anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma. II. Determine the qualitative and
      quantitative toxicity of topotecan in this patient population on this schedule.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive intravenous topotecan over 30 minutes
      daily for 5 days every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 evaluable patients will be accrued within 2-3 years.
