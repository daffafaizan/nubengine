      stem cell derived MSC-like cell transplantation in women with POI. MSC-like cells were
      injected directly into bilateral ovaries under transvaginal ultrasound. Patients are
      subjected into 3 groups, with low (0.2×107), medium (0.5×107) and high dosage (1.0×107) of
      cells injection for each ovary. The outcomes of patients were followed after the injection
      every 2 weeks. The investigator mainly follow the safety indexes, and the level of sex
      hormone and signs of follicle growth will also be monitored. The growing follicles will be
      stimulated by exogenous hormone, followed by oocyte retrieval and in vitro fertilization
      (IVF).
