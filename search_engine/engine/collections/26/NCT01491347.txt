      withdrawal during a 18 months period. The follow-up at 14, 28 days, 2, 4, 6 months after
      alcohol withdrawal will assess their BDNF serum levels, the levels of carbohydrate deficient
      transferrin (CDT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), urinary ethylglucuronide (EtG), and the
      scores to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Montgomery Asberg depression scale
      (MADRS), the Hamilton'anxiety scale (HAM-A), the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS).
