    
      This study is an open label, randomized controlled cross-over study

      Research objectives:

        1. To study the efficacy of diabetes-specific formula (Nutren Diabetes) in comparison with
           an isocaloric diet in the aspect of postprandial blood glucose and insulin response
           (baseline, 30, 60 and 120 minute).

        2. To study the safety and tolerance of a diabetes-specific formula compared with an
           isocaloric diet in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

      Statistical analysis method

        1. Descriptive statistics: categorical data will be summarized as number and percentage,
           continuous data with normal distribution will be presented as means and standard
           deviations, and continuous data with non-normal distribution will be summarized as
           median, minimum and maximum.

        2. Inferential statistics: Repeated Measure ANOVA from analyzing the difference of means
           from measuring fasting glucose and insulin more than two times.

        3. Inferential statistics: Paired T-Test or Wilcoxon Matched pairs Signed Rank Test derived
           by analyzing the comparison between the means of two dependent groups.

        4. Report of the difference between two categories by the difference of means with 95%
           Confidence Interval

        5. Number of participant (subjects) and criteria for participation 30 participants by
           calculation formula of Frison and Pocock (1992) with STATA program.
