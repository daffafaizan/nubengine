    
      This study aims to study the clonal dynamics and kinetics of response during the ramp-up
      phase of venetoclax in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      Key Eligibility Criteria:

        1. Diagnosis of CLL/SLL (treatment naive or relapsed/refractory)

        2. Must have designated hematologist/oncologist who has agreed to assume care and continue
           venetoclax after the ramp-up phase is complete

        3. Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        4. ECOG 0-2

      Design:

      Patients with CLL/SLL will enroll on the study. Subjects will be treated at the NIH Clinical
      Center for the duration of the ramp-up phase of venetoclax. After the ramp-up phase is
      complete, subjects will be transitioned to the care of their local hematologist/oncologist
      and receive venetoclax monotherapy or in combination with other agent(s) at the discretion of
      the treating oncologist. Subjects will have the option to follow-up at the NIH every 6 months
      (from initiation of venetoclax) and at (suspected) progression.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      -Determine the proportion of subjects with clonal shift during the ramp-up phase of
      venetoclax

      Secondary Objective:

      -Determine response kinetics of venetoclax therapy in the peripheral blood, lymph nodes and
      bone marrow

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  Assess relationship between clonal shifts and minimal residual disease (MRD) status,
           progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)

        -  Assess immunologic changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow during venetoclax
           treatment

        -  Assess circulating-tumor DNA in response to treatment during venetoclax treatment
