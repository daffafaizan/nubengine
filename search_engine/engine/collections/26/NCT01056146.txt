      new child behavior problems, parental distress, and family dysfunction. Recent studies
      provide evidence that online skill building interventions can reduce caregiver distress and
      improve child adjustment following TBI. The investigators hypothesize that the I-InTERACT
      group will exhibit more effective parenting skills as well as better child functioning and
      lower levels of parental distress at follow-up than will the IRC group. The investigators
      overarching goal is to reduce the risk of long-term behavioral problems and disability in
      young children following TBI by equipping parents with increased coping and parenting skills
      in a cost effective fashion. Findings will be disseminated via presentations and
      peer-reviewed publications, a website and newsletter, workshops with advocacy groups, and
      technical assistance to interested parties
