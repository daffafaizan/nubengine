      durvalumab + EP in patient population that is reflective of real-world clinical practice,
      Durvalumab will be concurrently administered with first-line chemotherapy (EP) on an every 3
      week (q3w) schedule for 4 to 6 cycles, and will continue to be administered as monotherapy
      post-chemotherapy on an every 4 week (q4w) schedule until confirmed progressive disease (PD)
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is allowed in patients showing complete or partial
      responses after the durvalumab + EP combination cycles, at the discretion of the investigator
      according to their local clinical practice.
