      tolerability study of single dose levels of citrate buffer delivered through transcleral
      iontophoresis administered via the EyeGateÂ® II Drug Delivery System. The current study will
      also determine the safety and tolerability of the dose ranges of transcleral iontophoresis
      from 2 mA through 7 mA and will determine the safety and tolerability of the application of
      the Eyegate II system on the eye for time ranges of up to 10.5 minutes.
