    
      The specific objectives of the study are as follows:

      Describe incident adverse events (AEs) experienced among patients with advanced RCC who
      received first-line axitinib in combination with immuno-oncology (IO) therapies.

        -  Type and seriousness of AEs (ie, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, palmar plantar
           erythrodysesthesia [hand-foot syndrome]).

        -  Proportion of patients who experienced repeated AEs.

        -  Time from treatment initiation to AE onset, overall and by type and seriousness of AEs.

      Among patients with advanced RCC who developed incident AEs while receiving first line
      axitinib in combination with IO therapies, characterize and describe management strategies
      for AEs, stratified by type and seriousness of AEs.

        -  Proportion of patients who used each of the following management strategies:

        -  No action for axitinib and IO therapy;

        -  No action for axitinib, but treatment modification for IO therapy (ie, treatment
           interruption, treatment discontinuation);

        -  Axitinib dose reduction, but no action for IO therapy;

        -  Axitinib treatment interruption, but no action for IO therapy;

        -  Axitinib treatment discontinuation, but no action for IO therapy;

        -  Axitinib dose reduction, and treatment modification for IO therapy;

        -  Axitinib treatment interruption, and treatment modification for IO therapy;

        -  Axitinib treatment discontinuation, and treatment modification for IO therapy.

        -  Average axitinib dose reduction (absolute and percentage change), where applicable.

        -  Duration of treatment interruption, where applicable.

      Assess the frequency of and time to AE resolution (from AE onset and initiation of management
      strategy, separately) among patients with advanced RCC who developed incident AEs while
      receiving first-line axitinib in combination with IO therapies according to different
      management strategies implemented, stratified further by type and seriousness of AEs, as
      allowed by sample size.

      The above objectives will also be conducted for repeated AEs of the same type
