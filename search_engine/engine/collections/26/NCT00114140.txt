        -  Compare the 3-year survival of patients with high-risk low-grade gliomas treated with
           temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by temozolomide alone with that of patients
           enrolled on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)clinical
           trials EORTC-22844 and EORTC-22845.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the association between progression-free survival and O6-methylguanine-DNA
           methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the association between survival and MGMT methylation status in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the neurocognitive function of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of collecting patient-reported QOL and neurocognitive
           assessments over 3 years.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-42 and undergo radiotherapy once
      daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40, one hour before RT weekdays, in the
      evening weekends. Beginning 28 days after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive
      oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 months, every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 135 patients will be accrued for this study within 44 months.
