      women across Africa and Asia. Finding ways of providing services in a more efficient and
      cost-effective manner, without compromising surgical outcomes and the overall health of the
      patient, is paramount. Shortening the duration of urethral catheterization following fistula
      repair surgery would increase treatment capacity (by freeing available bed space and
      increasing availability of nursing staff), lower costs of services, and potentially lower
      risk of healthcare-associated infections among fistula patients. There is a lack of empirical
      evidence supporting any particular length of time for urethral catheterization following
      fistula repair surgery.

      This facility-based, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test the
      non-inferiority of short-term (7 day) urethral catheterization compared to longer-term (14
      day) urethral catheterization in terms of predicting fistula repair breakdown. The primary
      outcome is fistula repair breakdown three months following fistula repair surgery as assessed
      by a urinary dye test, a routine practice in fistula repair services. t. Secondary outcomes
      will include repair breakdown one week following catheter removal, intermittent
      catheterization due to urinary retention and the occurrence of septic or febrile episodes,
      prolonged hospitalization (defined as a stay at the facility beyond one week following
      initial catheter removal related to an adverse event), catheter blockage, and self-reported
      residual incontinence. This study will be conducted among 507 women with simple fistula
      presenting at 8 study sites for fistula repair surgery over the course of 16-18 months at
      each site.
