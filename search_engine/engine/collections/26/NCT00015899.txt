        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of SCH 66336 in children with
           recurrent or progressive brain tumors.

        -  Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Describe the pharmacokinetics of this drug with and without dexamethasone in these
           patients.

        -  Investigate the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral SCH 66336 twice daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of
      26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of SCH 66336 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which it is predicted that 20% of
      patients may experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6 patients are treated at the
      determined MTD.

      Patients are followed within 30 days of the last administration of the study drug and then
      for up to 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
