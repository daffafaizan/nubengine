      result of changes in brain circuitry. Learning mechanisms give rise to the transition from
      acute to chronic pain and render the pain to become more emotional. The aim of this study is
      to further explore the idea that persistent pain, following an inciting injury, leads to an
      aversive learning signal that reorganizes the brain into a chronic pain state. We hypothesize
      that blocking the emotional/motivational learning response triggered by peripheral nerve
      injury in a critical time window will decrease the probability of transition to chronic pain.
      The primary hypothesis to be tested in the study is that early treatment with
      Carbidopa/Levodopa and Naproxen in individuals with sub-acute back pain (SBP) should decrease
      related reorganization and block transition to chronic back pain (CBP). This will be done
      through a 6 month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-arm, parallel-group
      trial of the pharmacological treatment Carbidopa/Levodopa for individuals (N = 200) with
      sub-acute back pain (SBP). A baseline MRI scan will be used to determine each subject's pain
      type and group assignment. Individuals with recovering sub-acute back pain will be observed
      over 6 months. Individuals with a persisting sub-acute back pain will be randomized to
      receive either 12 weeks of Carbidopa/Levodopa plus naproxen or placebo plus naproxen. The
      main outcome measurements will be the results of MRI scans at the baseline and final visit,
      assessment of back pain by the NRS pain scale, as well as pain assessment through
      self-reported questionnaires.
