      followed by an 8-week evaluation period for efficacy assessments of corrective treatment.
      Subjects who respond to efepoetin alfa (defined as an increase in Hb â‰¥1.0 g/dL versus
      baseline and Hb level within 10 - 12 g/dL range without blood transfusion during the 28 weeks
      after the first dose) will be eligible to continue treatment, and will be randomised to
      receive subcutaneous efepoetin alfa either once every 2W or every 4W for an additional
      24-week extension period to assess long-term safety and maintenance effect. Mircera
      responders will also be allowed to continue the drug during the extension period, receiving
      it every 4 weeks using the dose equal to twice the previous once-every-two-week dose. The
      safety data collected will be part of an ongoing pooled analysis of safety data from the
      efepoetin alfa clinical development program.
