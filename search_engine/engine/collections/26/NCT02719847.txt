      If participant agrees to take part in this study, as a part of participant's
      standard-of-care, participant will have an EBUS-TBNA before SBRT. Participant will have this
      performed as an out-patient procedure while under general anesthetic. Participant will
      receive a separate consent for this that will explain the procedure and the risks.

      The samples collected from the EBUS-TBNA will be tested and compared with the results of
      participant's standard PET/CT scans.

      Follow-Up:

      As a part of participant's standard-of-care, after SBRT participant will have a physical exam
      and chest CT scan to check the status of the disease every 3 months for the first 2 years,
      and then twice a year for the following year. After 3 years, participant will have these
      visits 1 time a year.

      Participant's medical information from these follow-up visits will be collected for this
      study. All the information for the study will be stored in a password-protected system.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participant's active participation in this study will be over after participant's tissue
      samples are collected by EBUS-TBNA. Participant's medical information will continue to be
      collected as long as participant is coming for follow-up visits.

      This is an investigational study. The EBUS-TBNA is performed using FDA-approved and
      commercially available methods. It is investigational to compare the results of EBUS-TBNA and
      PET/CT scans to learn about the accuracy of these ways to find evidence of early stage lung
      cancer.

      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
