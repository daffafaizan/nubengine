    
      This is a single center study of 60 subjects. The investigators will enroll 30 subjects with
      asthma who demonstrate mucus plugging on a screening CT lung scan, 15 subjects with asthma
      without mucus plugging, and 15 healthy controls. The healthy controls and subjects with
      asthma but without mucus plugging with also undergo CT scans to confirm that their lungs
      aren't obstructed by mucus.

      Screening data will be reviewed to determine participant eligibility. Participants who meet
      all inclusion criteria will participate in image-guided bronchoscopy ("virtual navigation
      bronchoscopy" [VNB]) to sample airway biospecimens in mucus plugged and control airways.
      Subjects will participate in up to 5 study visits at the Airway Clinical Research Center.
