      and Stage II hemorrhoids, where significant tissue prolapse is not present. The hemorrhoids
      are treated by bipolar ligation of the superior hemorrhoidal blood supply.

      Each prospective subject will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria at least one
      week prior to treatment. All patients undergoing treatment will review and sign the study
      Informed Consent prior to their procedure.

      One to three internal hemorrhoids will be treated in one therapeutic session. The number will
      be based on the investigator's judgment of which quadrants are symptomatic. Evaluations will
      be recorded for all treated subjects immediately following treatment. Subjects will be
      followed at 1, 3, and 6 months post procedure unless complications are reported between
      scheduled follow-up dates. At each post treatment follow-up, a report will be made of
      pain/discomfort, bleeding, medication use, itching, presence of adverse events or
      complications and need for supplemental treatment. Face-to-face follow-up evaluations will
      include anoscopic evaluation and assessment of hemorrhoid and other relevant symptoms.
