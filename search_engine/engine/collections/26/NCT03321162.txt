      planning protocol C1(double scan technique) or C2 (triple scan technique) in completely
      edentulous patient .

      Both protocols C1(double scan technique) and C2 (triple scan technique) indicated in
      completely edentulous patient and require C.T scan for patient wearing scan appliance .

      In C1(double scan technique) , after CT scan for patient wearing scan appliance , two optical
      scan for the model with and without scan appliance.

      In C2 (triple scan technique) , after CT scan for patient wearing scan appliance , CT scan
      for scan appliance alone .

      Teeth positions in both protocols were identified by radio-opaque scan appliance .

      16 implant placement by surgical guide using double scan protocol versus triple scan protocol
      ( two groups - 8 implants in each group ) to Evaluate angular and linear deviation of virtual
      implants and actual implant position in completely edentulous patients according to scanning
      protocol C1(double scan technique) and C2 (triple scan technique) .
