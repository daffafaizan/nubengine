      Ab) have been found in a variable number of patients with RA, but it is unclear what
      significance these antibodies have on actual vitamin B12 levels. Patients with RA have been
      found to have vitamin B12 deficiency up to near 50% but it is unclear if this deficiency is
      due to anti-GPC Ab.

      Hypothesis: By virtue of the aberrant autoimmune process that occurs in RA, patients with RA
      are more likely to have anti-GPC Ab and more likely than a control arm or participants with
      autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) to have vitamin B12 deficiency.

      Method: 135 patients will be consented; 45 to the RA arm, 45 to an AITD arm, and 45 to a
      control arm. Exclusion criteria will filter patients who would have other reasons for altered
      vitamin B12 absorption, such as inflammatory bowel disease, surgery, or medication use. After
      obtaining consent subjects will be sent to lab a serum anti-GPC Ab test (obtainable in an SLE
      panel), RF, B12/folate (as available for ordering in CHCS), methyl malonic acid, and (for the
      control arm subjects and AITD subjects) an anti-CCP IgG. Patients will also complete a
      one-sided, one page questionnaire asking them about dietary and medication exposures.

      Outcomes: (1) Determine whether evidence of serum vitamin B12 deficiency, as measure by
      either a low vitamin B12 level or elevated methylmalonic acid, will be more common in RA
      patients with anti-GPC Ab. (2) Determine the prevalence of anti-GPC Ab in a group of patients
      with RA as compared to a group of patients with AITD and with no known systemic or organ
      specific autoimmune condition.
