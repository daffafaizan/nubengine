      efficacy of a community outreach strategy for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction
      among individuals at elevated risk for CV events. Randomization was stratified for diagnosis
      of CHD, type 1 or 2 diabetes, sex, and clinical depression, and blocked within our northern,
      rural, and urban recruitment sites. A 2X3 mixed factorial design was utilized: 2 Groups
      (Usual Care, UC/Lifestyle Counselling,LC) X 3 Intervals (Baseline, post-treatment, 6-month
      follow-up). All subjects received personal CVD risk factor feedback and standardized handouts
      on heart healthy lifestyle change. The LC group received 6 weekly 1-hour sessions of
      lifestyle counseling that was provided via teleconference in small groups (4-8 persons).
      Group facilitators were trained in a manualized protocol of motivational interviewing that
      was designed for CVD risk reduction through lifestyle change. Weekly supervision was also
      provided. We hypothesized that the LC group (vs. UC) would significantly increase protective
      health behavior (exercise, diet, smoke-free living) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.
      The secondary hypothesis was that LC would significantly reduce (1) CVD risk factors, (SBP,
      DBP, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol), (2) 10-year absolute risk among subjects without
      CVD, and (3) significantly increase quality of life as measured by symptoms of depression,
      psychological stress, and social support.
