      the first survey will be randomized to either the control group who receive standard care
      from their care team or to complete the 9-week Pillars4Life curriculum. Subjects completing
      the Pillars4Life program will select a course day/time that works for them from those
      offered. Each week the program will send an email approximately 15 minutes before class time
      with a link. Subjects will click the link to go to the "classroom," where they will enter
      their name and phone number. The program will call the number provided and the subject will
      listen to the audio over the phone, while watching the guide and activities in the virtual
      classroom on their computer. Each class will last about an hour.

      All subjects will complete two additional surveys, at approximately 9 weeks and 18 weeks
      after enrolling in the study.
