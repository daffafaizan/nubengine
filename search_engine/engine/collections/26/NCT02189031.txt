      (function/operation) of sensory neural systems in order to develop methods for restoring
      function to injured populations. One of the primary focus areas of the investigators research
      is working to integrate physiologically relevant sensory feedback with prosthetic limbs. To
      this end the investigators employ a variety of approaches that interweave disciplines such as
      electrophysiology, psychophysics, biomedical engineering and cognition. The investigators
      research team is composed of an interconnected and communicative network of clinicians,
      engineers, and scientists. This helps us to provide pathways from basic science discoveries
      that can be used to address clinical needs with transition directly to patient care.
