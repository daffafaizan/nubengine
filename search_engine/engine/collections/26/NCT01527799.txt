      studies have examined the influence of having SCA on such measures of physical function as
      exercise capacity. Moreover, the physiologic basis of poor physical functioning in children
      with SCA is unknown and has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this proposal is to
      use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to gain a comprehensive understanding of exercise
      capacity, as a measure of physical function, in children and young adults with SCA. The
      specific aims of this project are to: 1) Measure peak oxygen consumption (VO2), the reference
      standard for exercise capacity, in children and young adults with SCA classified by primary
      pathophysiologic contributor to their decreased exercise capacity, and 2) Examine the acute
      inflammatory response, measured by an increase in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule
      (sVCAM) activity, in subjects undergoing CPET. These aims will be performed in 60 subjects
      with SCA and 30 matched controls without SCA. In a secondary analysis, we will also study the
      impact of baseline exercise capacity and the inflammatory response to exercise on short and
      long-term disease related morbidity. This study is essential because it will address several
      areas of exercise capacity, including the physiologic contributors to exercise limitation
      that remain fundamental knowledge gaps in SCA.
