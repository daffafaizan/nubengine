      2 phase 2 clinical trials Trial A (carboplatin and chemotherapy individuation based on
      sensitivity marker ), Trial B (carboplatin non-individuation or chemotherapy
      non-individuation ).

      Patients who were treated on Trials B were analyzed as the "standard therapy" group. Patients
      accrued to Trial A were called the "personalized therapy" group. disease free survival (DFS)
      was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
