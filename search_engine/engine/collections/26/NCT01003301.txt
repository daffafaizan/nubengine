    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group design study that
      includes 3.5 months of treatment with omalizumab or placebo and a 3 month follow-up. All
      subjects will be cat allergic.

      Twenty four subjects (1:1 randomization) will undergo a cat allergen nasal challenge prior to
      treatment and another challenge after 2 months of treatment or when their blood basophils
      become hyporesponsive to cat allergen in vitro. A second group of 10 subjects (1:1
      active:placebo), will not undergo nasal challenges. This group will participate in an
      ancillary study in which the effects of omalizumab on gene expression profiles in peripheral
      blood cells will be studied.
