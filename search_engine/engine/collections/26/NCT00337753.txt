      Anonymous meetings at the first visit based on answers to questions. Assignment to counseling
      or Gamblers Anonymous will be randomly selected (i.e. chance) with an equal chance of
      receiving either one. For those assigned to counseling, you will meet with the therapist for
      60 minutes weekly. You will receive 5 sessions of counseling.

      All subjects will be assessed with gambling questionnaires twice during the 5-week period and
      again at 3 and 6 months following the 5-week period.

      For those assigned to Gamblers Anonymous, they will be offered 5 weeks of counseling at the
      end of the 6-month follow-up.
