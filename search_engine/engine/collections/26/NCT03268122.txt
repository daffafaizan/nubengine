    
      CONTACT-PILOT is a single center, pilot, multiple crossover, cluster-randomized trial of
      contact isolation for MRSA and VRE in the Vanderbilt Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in
      order to determine if contact isolation reduces the rate of ICU-acquired infection with MRSA
      and/or VRE. Specifically, the study will randomly assign the entire MICU to one of two
      contact isolation strategies for 2 months, and then switch the entire MICU over to the second
      strategy. The first strategy is the current practice, also referred to as standard contact
      isolation, which is to place all patients with MRSA and/or VRE infection or colonization (or
      a history of either) on contact isolation. The second strategy is targeted contact isolation,
      in which patients with MRSA and/or VRE would only be placed on contact isolation if they have
      an active infection with one (or both) of these organisms with a high risk of transmission,
      such as an open, draining wound or a pneumonia. The study will be divided into four
      alternating 2-month treatment blocks, two for each strategy, with one "run-in" week at the
      start of each treatment block in order to transition between the two treatment strategies,
      for a total study duration of 8 months. The interventions will occur between September 1,
      2017 and April 30, 2018. All adult MICU patients will be enrolled in the study. The primary
      outcome will be the rate of new ICU-acquired MRSA and VRE infections. Data analysis will be
      performed using a pre-specified data analysis plan. This study is being performed as a
      preliminary study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the study plan.
