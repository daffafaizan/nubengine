      placebo-controlled trial comparing CsA+PDN+MPA versus the reference treatment of CsA+PDN
      alone + placebo, in patients with extensive chronic GvHD. Randomization will be stratified
      according to:

        -  Platelet number (low versus high risk)

        -  Source of transplantable cells (marrow versus PBSC versus cord blood)

      Patients not in progression at 6 weeks post randomization (progression defined as primary
      failure) will be evaluated for remission (complete or partial) at 3, 6, 9, & 12 months post
      randomization
