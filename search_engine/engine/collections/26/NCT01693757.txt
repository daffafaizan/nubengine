      controversial. Despite the need for outcome studies comparing bone-patellar tendon-bone
      (BPTB) with semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (STG), few studies have evaluated functional
      outcomes. The objective of the current study was to compare hop performance and jump landing
      strategy in soccer players with higher level sports activities after ACLR using either BPTB
      or STG and controls.
