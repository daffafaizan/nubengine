      imaging. A suitable target artery for IVUS imaging will be determined at baseline as having
      stenosis of up to 50% and meeting all angiographic inclusion criteria. Subjects having met
      all eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of CER 001 (3
      mg/kg) or placebo within 14 days of event presentation. Randomized subjects will then return
      at 7 day intervals for nine additional infusions. A follow up IVUS will be conducted at 14
      days after the last infusion. The total study duration from randomization to follow up IVUS
      for a completed study can range from approximately 9 to 12 weeks.
