      a continuing important clinical diagnostic role in the evaluation and monitoring of patients
      with a wide range of cardiac pathologies, including those embarking on or continuing
      cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic regimes, as well as patients with lung disease.

      The current imaging modalities used for non-invasive imaging of the heart include
      echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography. Echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac
      function is primarily limited to the left ventricle and functional measurements are based on
      volumetric estimates in turn based usually on geometric assumptions. That is, the volume
      calculation is based on a limited number of non orthogonal linear measurements assuming a
      regular (non complex) chamber morphology. This study technique provides no biologic hazard to
      the patient.

      Radionuclide ventriculography does allow for 3D cardiac data acquisition and theoretical
      evaluation of biventricular function. However, the technique does not provide the same degree
      of spatial resolution that echocardiography can provide. Radionuclide ventriculography is a
      commonly accepted diagnostic procedure but does involve use of ionizing radiation.

      Magnetic Resonance imaging techniques (of the heart) allows relatively high resolution cross
      sectional imaging. For example a 512X512 matrix over a 40cm field of view provides in plane
      resolution better that 1mm. No assumptions are made in regard chamber cross sectional area
      and hence volume morphology. The slice thickness is determined in advance and may be in the
      range of 1-10mm. MR data ca be acquired sequentially throughout the cardiac cycle and thus
      provide a time varying 3D map of the cardiac chambers and related structures during the
      cardiac cycle.
