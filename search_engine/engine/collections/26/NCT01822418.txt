      and several antidepressive agents have been successfully applied. The new melatonergic
      antidepressant agomelatine (AGO) appears promising for the treatment of MDEs in schizophrenia
      for several reasons: 1. AGO provides a unique pharmacological profile by combining
      antidepressive potency, sleep regulation and enhancement of frontocortical dopaminergic
      activity by 5-HT-2C-blockade. 2. AGO might exert favourable effects on cognition. 3. While
      pharmacokinetic interactions are generally possible, major influences on antipsychotic
      substances are unlikely due to metabolism by cytochrome isoenzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C9/19. 4.
      AGO is characterized by a favourable range of adverse events (AE) which do not overlap with
      typical antipsychotic AEs such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Thus, the risk of
      additive effects seems to be small. The investigators plan to enroll 27 schizophrenic
      patients into an open, single-armed, prospective clinical trial with agomelatine. As
      predefined primary and secondary endpoints, we are going to investigate whether AGO is able
      to improve MDE severity, sleep quality, general and psychosocial functioning as well as
      cognitive function in schizophrenia without detrimental effects on the psychotic syndrome.
      Moreover, we intend to monitor for pharmacokinetic interactions. The results obtained will
      allow designing future randomized and controlled clinical trials in order to improve the
      range of therapeutic options for affective and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
