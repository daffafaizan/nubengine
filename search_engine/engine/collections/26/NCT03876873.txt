      anesthesia. It allows for adequate oxygenation of the patient to buy enough time for
      intubation, during which the patient is not ventilated. However, in some patients mask
      ventilation may be difficult - older than 55 years, heavier (BMI > 26 kg/m^2), with no teeth,
      having a beard or sleep apnea. Inadequate ventilation, if not corrected, can result in
      decreasing oxygen saturation to dangerous levels - which could lead to devastating
      complications. As a result, the efficacy of mask ventilation is of critical importance to
      patient safety after the induction of anesthesia.

      A recent study proposed that mask ventilation could be improved simply by turning a patient's
      head. The study showed that rotating a patient's head to a 45 degree angle significantly
      improved mask ventilation when compared with the head placed in a neutral position. However,
      this study was done in patients with a BMI lass than 35. As such, the effects of head
      rotation on the efficacy of mask ventilation has not been studied in patients with a BMI of
      35 and greater.

      Obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m^2) affects almost 40% of US adults and is one of the most prevalent
      health concerns in our society. It is a predictor of difficult mask ventilation because it is
      associated with increased upper airway obstruction, decreased airway patency, and decreased
      lung volumes such as functional residual capacity (FRC). If previous findings in regard to
      the effects of 45 degree head rotation on the efficacy of ventilation hold true in the obese
      patient, then this study will show that head rotation could be used as a simple way to
      improve the efficacy of mask ventilation for patients with a BMI of 35 and above.
