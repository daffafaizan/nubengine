      Gynaecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) phase III trial.

      All patients will receive 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Trial drug will be
      administered for up to 18 months from randomisation or until progression, whichever is
      sooner. Patients who have not progressed at 18 months from randomisation can continue Trial
      Drug until progression, if in the opinion of the clinician and the patient there is
      continuing clinical benefit.

      Patients in Arm A (the reference arm) will receive a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen plus
      a daily oral placebo tablet for the duration of the chemotherapy and up to 18 months from
      randomisation or until progression.

      Patients in Arm B (concurrent cediranib arm) will also receive a platinum-based chemotherapy
      regimen plus daily oral cediranib during chemotherapy only, and then an oral daily placebo
      tablet up to 18 months from randomisation or until progression.

      Patients in Arm C (concurrent and maintenance cediranib arm) will also receive a
      platinum-based chemotherapy regimen plus oral cediranib daily during chemotherapy and then
      continued up to 18 months from randomisation or until progression.
