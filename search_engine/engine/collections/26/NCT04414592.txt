      the quality of life and lead to great economic burden to patients and society. In recent
      years, full endoscopic discectomy has been widely used in the treatment of lumbar disc
      herniation due to its advantages of reduced trauma, enhanced recovery and less cost. However,
      the reherniation of the residual nucleus pulposus still exist after nerve root decompression.
      It is urgent to use stem cell and tissue engineering to replace the resection tissue and
      repair the residual nucleus pulposus for disc resealing. To observe the safety and efficacy
      of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) in the treatment of lumbar disc
      degeneration. This clinical trial is aimed to include a single group of 20 patients with
      lumbar disc herniation. Twenty million hUCMSCs will be injected into the lumbar disc of the
      enrolled patients in this non-random, self-controlled and single-dose open study design. The
      patients will be followed up for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the injection to
      evaluate the safety of the patients after grafting hUCMSCs. Additionally, improvement of
      patients' quality of life will be evaluated using the ODI score, VAS score and SF-36 score.
      Lumbar disc signals will be also quantified using MRI to demonstrate hUCMSCs transplantation
      could slow down lumbar disc degeneration.
