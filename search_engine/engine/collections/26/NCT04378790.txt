      cycloplegia based on a cycloplegic refraction performed within 30 days. If still apparently
      eligible, children will be prescribed spectacles and will then return for a spectacle
      baseline visit, where they will wear their new spectacles for the first time for at least 10
      minutes (but no more than 24 hours) and will be tested in those new spectacles to confirm
      final eligibility prior to randomization.

      Participants not found to be eligible in their new spectacles will end study participation.
      Participants eligible for the study will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment
      groups: Sequential (spectacles alone) and then patching if needed (monitored by ODM), or
      Simultaneous (spectacles and patching monitored by ODM).

      After randomization, follow-up visits will occur at 8-week intervals through 56 weeks. At
      each visit on or after the 8-week visit, participants will be classified as either:
      stable/worsening or improving; those stable/worsening are then classified as having either
      resolved or residual amblyopia, provided that the current and most recent previous visit were
      completed at least 6-weeks apart (target 8 weeks) and provided the required test and retest
      VA testing was completed. Participants who are stable/worsening and have residual amblyopia
      in the sequential group will start patching (monitored by ODM) and continue to be followed
      every 8 weeks. Participants in the simultaneous group, or in the sequential group after
      having advanced to patching, who are stable/worsening but have residual amblyopia will be
      released to treatment at investigator discretion.

      All participants continue 8-weekly visits until 56 weeks when Study participation ends.
