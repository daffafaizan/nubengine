    
      This is a randomized clinical intervention study with a cross-over design. The subjects are
      randomly allocated to one of the three experimental groups: 1) the control; 2) ASM group for
      aqueous single-phase mouthrinse; 3) OTM group for oil-water two-phase mouthrinse. The
      experimental mouthrinses all contain sodium fluoride and the ASM and OTM contain additional
      ingredients of bamboo salt, magnolia bark and centella asiatica extracts. For the OTM, 50%
      essential oil is added to create an oil-water two-phase mouthrinse. Subjects are instructed
      to use the prescribed mouthrinse to gargle their mouth for one minute, twice daily for two
      weeks. The completion of each experiment regimen is followed by a 2-week washout period,
      after which the subjects of each group were permutated to the next mouthrinse trial until all
      three groups underwent the three mouthrinse trial regimen.
