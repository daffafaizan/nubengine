      individual into the gastrointestinal tract of the patient. This has been done in the past for
      recurrent colitis secondary to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) using different methods
      such as through nasogastric tube, fecal retention enemas, and by colonoscopy. This method of
      treatment was introduced over 50 years ago with high success rates, although it has not been
      until recent that more case studies have been performed, with continued success rates of
      approximately 90%. Studies have found this therapy to be effective with resolution of
      symptoms in most patients, and have found it to be both cost effective and safe.

      The purpose of this study is to use a standardized published protocol for fecal microbiota
      transplantation performed by colonoscopy and record the success rate and outcomes of FMT
      therapy for patients with recurrent CDI at the UMassMemorial Medical Center. In addition, the
      cost of this therapy will be compared to conventional antibiotic treatment. The reduction in
      hospitalizations will also be monitored compared with historical controls.

      The hypothesis of this study is that FMT therapy will show resolution of infection in most
      patients with recurrent CDI, with an overall reduction in cost to the hospital for recurrent
      admissions for Clostridium difficile colitis as compared to historical controls. Historical
      controls will be defined as patients with recurrent positive Clostridium difficile stool
      samples treated in the traditional fashion with antibiotics.
