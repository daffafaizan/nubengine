    
      Objective of the full randomized trial To compare the effectiveness of a standardized method
      of rotator cuff repair with or without augmentation using porcine small intestine submucosa
      (SIS) in patients with large rotator cuff tears.

      Objectives of the pilot study

        1. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the likely success of SIS.

        2. To formally evaluate our ability to successfully recruit eligible patients into this
           study.

        3. To determine appropriate length of follow up through examination of the pattern of
           incremental improvement and stabilization of quality of life over time following rotator
           cuff repair.

        4. To determine a more accurate estimation of sample size for the full trial using quality
           of life.

        5. To determine the frequency with which surgeons comply with the surgical protocol.

        6. To determine the frequency with which patients and physiotherapists comply with the
           suggested physiotherapy protocol.
