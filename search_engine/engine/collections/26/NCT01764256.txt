      which three dose-levels of vaccine will be tested in adults. Cohorts of 16 individuals (12
      vaccine recipients and 4 placebo recipients) per dose level will receive three intramuscular
      injections four weeks apart. The three dose levels of vaccine to test will be 10 microgram
      (μg), 30 μg and 60 μg.
