      different extubation protocol can impact recovery quality in children in post-anaesthesia
      care unit (PACU). Patients aged 3-7 years were randomized into two equal groups: proactive
      extubation (Group A) and passive extubation. At the end of surgery, sevoflurane was turned
      off and patients all delivered into PACU for recovery. Patient was positioned on his or her
      lateral side. The ventilation was switched to positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode once the
      patients regained spontaneous respiration. After spontaneous breathing turn to regular and
      sufficient（tidal volume >6-8 ml/kg, respiratory rate >10 times per minutes , end tidal carbon
      dioxide concentration >7.19 mmHg）, the trachea tube could be removed. In Group A, patients
      were extubated in a light plane of anesthesia, when they are still asleep or have swallowing
      reflex. In Group B, tracheal extubation was performed when the patient regained
      consciousness, facial grimace, spontaneous eye opening, and purposeful arm movement. After
      extubation, 2 L/min oxygen was administered with Venturi face mask for 10 min in both groups.
      Patients were transported to the ward until they breathed air with a patent airway. The
      extubation time, recovery characteristics and respiratory complication were recorded.
