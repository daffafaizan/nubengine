      the treatments prescribed by general practitioners is usually scarce. The main objective of
      the present research is to assess the efficacy of a structured psychoeducative intervention,
      combined with relaxation, developed to improve the quality of life of patients suffering
      fibromyalgia (FM). The second objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness of this
      multimodal intervention.
