      men also has a profound clinical impact. Men over the age of 75 who sustain hip fractures
      have a higher mortality than women of the same age (30% versus 9%). Hip fractures in men
      account for one-third of all hip fractures. In 1995, male osteoporosis accounted for $2.7
      billion in health care costs -- nearly one-third of the overall cost of osteoporosis.
      Alendronate has been shown to improve bone mass and decrease vertebral fractures in men with
      osteoporosis.

      Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy and the second leading cause of death
      in American men. Almost all men who progress to late stage disease are treated with androgen
      deprivation therapy for life, resulting in a 5-fold increased risk of hip fractures and a
      13-fold increased risk of all osteoporosis fractures. Several studies suggest the merit of
      inducing androgen deprivation much earlier in the course of therapy for prostate cancer. It
      is therefore quite likely that androgen deprivation strategies will be employed with
      increasing frequency in patients with less advanced disease, resulting in longer life
      expectancy but greater bone loss.
