      ruxolitinib in low-risk but symptomatic essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera
      (PV) patients. This research is being done to see if Ruxolitinib is effective in reducing the
      symptoms people with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) are
      experiencing. Ruxolitinib is a type of drug that blocks the specific proteins that may be
      causing the symptoms people with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV are
      experiencing.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,
      including evaluations and follow up visits.

      - Participants will receive Ruxolitinib for approximately 6 months and if benefitting from it
      may continue to receive Ruxolitinib for as long as there is no unacceptable side effects or
      disease progression.

      It is expected that about 60 people will take part in this research study.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Ruxolitinib for polycythemia vera
      (PV) but not for people with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV).

      Incyte, a biopharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding
      for the study, including the study drug.
