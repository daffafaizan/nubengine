      this monitoring is proposed. The development of an immediate-release whole blood test for
      simplified monitoring of estradiol levels will provide considerable comfort in the management
      of patients. These patients are subjected to significant emotional and physical stress and
      the development of this test will reduce the negative consequences that result.
