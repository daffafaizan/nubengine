      Anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade will be managed freely until the end of surgery. Then
      patients will be randomized to receive intravenous sugammadex or neostigmine/atropine as
      follows:

      Sugammadex group:

        -  If Post tetanic count (PTC)=1-15: sugammadex 4 mg/kg

        -  If at least 1 twitch at the Train-of-four stimulation: sugammadex 2 mg/kg

      Neostigmine group:

        -  If PTC=1-15: neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg + atropine 0.02 mg/kg

        -  If at least 1 twitch at the Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation: neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg +
           atropine 0.02 mg/kg
