      gold-standard drug, paroxetine, for the treatment of geriatric depression. We are interested
      in assessing the difference in response to vilazodone (VLZ) compared to paroxetine (PAR). We
      hope to detect difference in response in primary outcomes (depressed mood) and secondary
      outcomes cognition. We are seeking to examine this directly in 80 older adults (60 years of
      age or older) with major depression with anticipated 60 completers. This proposed trial will
      serve as a pilot study to estimate the efficacy and tolerability of the drug in older
      depressed adults, and use this project for dose-finding in this population.
