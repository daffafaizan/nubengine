      dialing from the population of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Random sampling is performed by a
      survey company on the list of mobile phone numbers with designated geography prefixes of St.
      Petersburg. The baseline questionnaire for computer-assisted telephone interview includes
      travel history, medical history, and socio-economic status of the respondents. Sampled
      individuals are then invited to the clinic for blood sampling, their refusal to participate
      is recorded. Collected blood samples are used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies testing.

      complete additional questionnaires in the clinic providing information on medical history,
      history of allergies, chronic disease, smoking, and medication taken regularly. Contact
