      4 weeks to reduce symptoms, disease severity, and recovery time from COVID-19. These 40
      patients will be compared with 40 control patients who will receive regular care. All
      patients will be asked to complete surveys at baseline and after 1, 2, and 4 weeks after
      initiation of treatment. The difference with baseline at each time point will be assessed.
      The surveys will assess COVID-19 symptoms severity.
