      throughout their hospital course (anticipated duration of hospitalization ranging between 4-8
      weeks). If patients are suspected to have infection of pancreatic necrosis, they will be
      consented for enrollment. Patients will be determined by their attending physician to require
      either operative intervention or radiologic guided drainage of pancreatic necrosis and
      infected peripancreatic fluid. At the time of drainage procedure or intervention, one sample
      of peripancreatic fluid will be sent to the hospital's microbiology department for standard
      gram stain and bacterial culture identification and a second sample will be frozen for
      bacterial DNA analysis. Patients will be followed for the duration of their hospitalization
      for in hospital outcomes, mortality and final microbiology culture results. Samples will then
      be processed at six months and one year following sample collection for bacterial DNA deep
      sequencing analysis and will be compared to bacteria identified using standard culture
      technique.
