      Therapy (ERP) can help adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in China following a
      training of professionals and ongoing consultation.The treatment time for each participant is
      approximately 12 weeks. This includes the time between the referral and the beginning of
      treatment, the treatment sessions, and the 1-month follow-up time. Therapy sessions will take
      place twice per week for 15 sessions total and last about 90 minutes each. In addition to the
      therapy sessions, participants will have 3 separate assessments. These assessments will occur
      (1) right after they agree to participate in the study, (2) immediately after ERP ends, and
      (3) 1 month after ERP ends. The assessments will take about 1 Â½ hours each.
