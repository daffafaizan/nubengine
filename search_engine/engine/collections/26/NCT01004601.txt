      every 3 weeks; 60 mg/m2 accumulated dose for each cycle) at our hospital in an effort to
      achieve better tolerability. We therefore performed an exploratory study, by statistical
      analyses, to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of such a low dose docetaxel schedule
      compared to that of pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC who have failed previous chemotherapy.
