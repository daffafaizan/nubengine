      continue in the extension study;

        -  participants receiving teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg were blindly maintained on the same
           dose of teriflunomide.

        -  participants receiving placebo were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to teriflunomide 7 mg or
           14 mg.

      The study period per participant was broken down as follows:

        -  Double-blind treatment: up to a maximum of 288 weeks or until teriflunomide was
           commercially available in the country where participant lived,

        -  Post-washout follow-up: 4 weeks after last treatment intake. No post-washout follow up
           if participant continued on teriflunomide treatment by obtaining its commercial form
           after end of the study.

      The total duration of the extension was 292 weeks (about 6 years) from the first participant
      enrolled or until teriflunomide is commercially available in the country where participant
      lived.
