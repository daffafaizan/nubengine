      program for parents of low-income, African American preschoolers who are currently overweight
      (> 85th BMI %tile). Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention or attention
      control condition. Those in the intervention will receive an intervention that is eight
      sessions in length and carried out in the participant's home. The sessions will target the
      nutrition and physical activity knowledge of parents and their motivation for changing
      parenting related to family eating habits and activity level. Sessions include
      psycho-education and skills building exercises. The attention comparison control condition
      (ACCC) participants will receive one home visit, 7 newsletters and 4 monthly support phone
      calls. The content of this condition also focuses on nutrition and activity knowledge,
      motivation and parenting. Outcomes for the intervention and ACC conditions will be assessed
      at baseline, post-intervention and at a 6-month and 1-year followed up. Child BMI %tile,
      consumption of fruits/vegetables and sugary beverages, and activity level will be analyzed to
      examine intervention effectiveness across time.
