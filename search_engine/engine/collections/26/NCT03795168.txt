      System (TCVS) at reducing the increased nausea and discomfort sometimes associated with
      vestibular physical therapy. The TCVS is a small device attached to an elastic band. It is
      worn around the head and produces vibrations. There is no implant or surgical procedure. The
      FDA has made a pre-determination that this is a low-risk device (a "Class 2 device" in FDA
      terminology).

      The TCVS has previously been tested in healthy volunteers and has been found to safely and
      effectively decrease dizziness and nausea associated with vestibular discomfort. This study
      will expand that research to vestibular disorder patients who are undergoing physical
      therapy. The study compares the outcomes to not wearing a device, or to a control
      (inneffective) device.
