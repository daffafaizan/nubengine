      estimated to be between 2 and 20%. Infection requiring re-operation and muscle flap coverage
      for salvage is estimated to be between 11 and 13%. Retrospective studies have endeavored to
      create risk calculators to better predict patients at high risk of need for muscle flap
      salvage. Fischer et al. suggest that in high-risk patients, prophylactic muscle flaps can
      reduce complications from 70% to 10%, rates of infection from 70% to 3% and wound breakdown
      from 48% to 5%. Cost-savings of around $400,000 per year with the use of prophylactic muscle
      flaps are estimated. Unfortunately, the retrospective nature of the Fischer et al. study,
      lack of standardization of patients receiving prophylactic muscle flaps, and use of the same
      cohort for the risk calculator as for the outcomes analysis all reduce the generalizability
      and reproducibility of these results.

      At the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, muscle coverage is routinely used in
      cases of infection or lymph leak but is not systematically used in prophylactic settings.
      This is because it is generally left to surgeon preference-if they feel like a muscle flap is
      needed (for a variety of non-standardized anatomic/surgical or patient factors) then it is
      performed. Muscle coverage of vascular grafts in and of itself is not an experimental
      procedure and has been performed for decades.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether prophylactic muscle flaps in high-risk
      patients can a) reduce the rates of infection requiring re-operation, and b) reduce the
      significant morbidity associated with other non-operative complications. This will be the
      first prospective, randomized control trial to address this issue.
