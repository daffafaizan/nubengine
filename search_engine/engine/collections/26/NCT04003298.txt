      adult volunteers. There will be two groups with a total of 35 subjects per group. Subjects
      will be randomized using a simple random sample. A computer-generated randomization schedule
      will be prepared by the study statistician. Based on the randomization schedule, patients
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either:

      With 35 subjects per group, the study will have 90% power to detect an average reduction in
      the percent of sites with BOP of 25%.

      The primary outcome will be the reduction in the percentage of sites with bleeding on probing
      (BOP) after 4 weeks.

      Reduction in the percentage of sites with BOP after 2 weeks (+/- 2 days). Reduction in the
      MGI after 2 (+/- 2 days) and 4 weeks. Reduction in RMNPI Pre & post, 2 weeks and 4 weeks (=/-
      2 days)

      Data will include whole mouth, approximal, marginal, facial, and lingual analysis for all
      indices. Intraoral examination will be performed and any adverse events will be reported and
