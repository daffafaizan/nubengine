      carcinoma of the head and neck receiving docetaxel and carboplatin. II. Assess time to
      treatment failure and response rate (unconfirmed and confirmed complete and partial response)
      in this patient population. III. Evaluate the toxicities of this regimen in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour immediately followed by carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, then annually thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months.
