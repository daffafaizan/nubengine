      Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) tool, will be evaluated after using a topical psoriasis
      cream containing at least 3 of the following: corticosteroid, methotrexate, vitamin D3 or
      synthetic analog, retinoid acid, or urea, or a topical shampoo or spray containing a
      corticosteroid and vitamin D3 or synthetic analog. The change in quality of life will be
      assessed during all visits using the Skindex-16 assessment tool. In patients receiving a
      methotrexate-containing formulation, a sub-study will be available as an option, where
      laboratory values (methotrexate levels, complete blood count, liver function tests, etc.)
      will be obtained to confirm that methotrexate absorption is negligible.
