    
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects up to 50% of patients who have diabetes for at
      least 25 years. Up to 26% of all patients with DPN experience neuropathic pain. DPN pain
      contributes to sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety, which together may have an impact on
      a patient's well-being and quality of life.

      There are currently several drugs used to treat painful DPN. For example, LyricaÂ®
      (pregabalin) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      neuropathic pain associated with DPN and is commonly prescribed. The dosage of the
      FDA-approved drugs is limited by side-effects such as dizziness, sleepiness, weight gain and
      swelling of the hands, legs, and feet. As a result, many patients suffering from DPN pain do
      not get satisfactory pain relief.
