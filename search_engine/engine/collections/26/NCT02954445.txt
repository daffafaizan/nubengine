      as in B-cell derived leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. Despite of the fact that
      CD19-targeted CAR-T can re-induce remissions for many patients with relapsed and refractory B
      cell malignancies, a part of those patients will relapse with CD19-negative malignancies. To
      explore a rescue for those with CD19-negative B cell malignancies, this trial is designed and
      conducted to test the safety and effect of BCMA-targeted CAR-T.
