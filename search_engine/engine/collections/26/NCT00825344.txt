      ratio to receive either subcutaneous etanercept or saline before skin incision. The study
      will be double-blind (i.e. neither the surgeon, anesthesiologist, nor the person
      administering the injection will know which group they were assigned to). Group I will
      receive 50 mg of subcutaneous etanercept mixed in 1 ml sterile water 90-120" before skin
      incision. Group II will receive 1 ml of sterile water 90-120" before skin incision. The
      anesthesia and surgical procedures will be standardized. For the next 24 hours, patients will
      keep a q4 hour pain diary recording their average pain on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. They
      will also record the number of Percocet tablets they took. All patients will be seen 1 month
      after their surgery, where their average pain score, work status, and analgesic intake (if
      any) will be recorded. Patients will then be followed with a telephone follow-up 3, 6 and
      12-months post-procedure, where the same variables will be recorded.
