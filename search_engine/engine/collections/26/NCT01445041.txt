      autologous (the patient's own)umbilical cord blood cells in neonates with hypoplastic left
      heart syndrome. This is a prospective, randomized Phase I trial designed to assess the safety
      and feasibility of autologous UCB reinfusion in neonates with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
      (HLHS). Neonates who are identified prenatally as having a cardiac lesion consistent with
      HLHS will be referred to Duke Cardiology for further evaluation. If they meet inclusion
      criteria, UCB will be collected at the time of delivery and processed (red blood cell- and
      volume-reduced) for reinfusion. All enrolled infants will receive a dose of fresh UCB cells
      pre-operatively and Â½ of the enrolled infants will be randomly selected to receive a second
      dose of frozen and thawed UCB cells after stage 1 palliation (5-35 days post-operatively) and
      a third dose of frozen and thawed UCB cells 2 to 4 weeks after the 2nd infusion.
      Neurodevelopmental outcome measures will be assessed at 1 month after discharge, at 4-6
      months old and 12 months. The results of MRI's and echocardiograms that are obtained per
      clinical routine will be analyzed and described in study reports.
