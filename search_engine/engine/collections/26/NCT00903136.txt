        -  To determine the clinical feasibility of obtaining endoscopic esophageal images using a
           tethered capsule endoscope (TCE). (Phase I)

        -  To determine the optimal weight and possibly shape for rapid patient ingestion and
           extraction of the TCE. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the optimal tether design (e.g., rigidity, distance markings, and other
           material properties). (Phase I)

        -  To determine the optimal protocol for patient ingestion and extraction of the TCE.
           (Phase I)

        -  To compare the TCE to standard sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy for identifying
           suspected Barrett esophagus. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE:

        -  Phase I: Participants swallow the tethered capsule endoscope (TCE) so that the distal
           end of the TCE enters the stomach. The TCE is then slowly withdrawn by the physician in
           order to visualize the gastroesophageal junction and the esophagus in a retrograde
           fashion until the upper esophageal sphincter is reached. The image acquisition process
           is repeated and the participant may be asked to swallow the TCE in up to 7 different
           positions with 2 swallows per position (no more than 20 swallows total).

        -  Phase II: Participants undergo TCE as in phase I, followed by standard sedated
           esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) by a second physician.

      Images obtained via TCE and EGD are reviewed by a third physician blinded to the results of
      each exam.

      In both phases, participants and physicians complete a questionnaire after the TCE procedure
      to determine the ease of the procedure. Participants are also asked for specific suggestions
      to improve the TCE experience. Participants enrolled in phase II also complete a
      questionnaire 1 week after EGD to compare the TCE procedure with the EGD.
