      PICO P: Completely edentulous patients I: Laser surface treatment of implants C: Sandblasted
      Acid etched surface treatment O: Bony changes

      Each Participants will have 2 implants;one laser surface treated implants and another
      sandblasted acid-etched implant (split-mouth) installed in the intra-foraminal area of
      mandibular arch prosthetically driven by the prepared conventional denture. MS and AF are
      responsible for delayed-loading of the denture and will measure bony changes around laser
      treated surface implants using radiographic assessment using long paralleling technique
      periapical digital x-ray(SOREDEX™ DIGORA™ Optime)
