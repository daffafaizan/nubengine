      comprised ipilimumab 3 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes every 3 weeks
      for 4 doses followed by the NY-ESO-1 vaccine administered subcutaneously (SC). Arm A received
      the NY-ESO-1 recombinant protein mixed with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-poly-L-lysine
      carboxymethylcellulose (Poly-ICLC) and Montanide; Arm B received NY-ESO-1 overlapping long
      peptides 4 (OLP4) mixed with Poly-ICLC and Montanide; and Arm C received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 mixed
      with Poly-ICLC (without Montanide). The vaccine was administered immediately following the
      ipilimumab infusion, and patients were observed for 1 hour following administration. No dose
      adjustments or delays were permitted.

      Because the study treatment regimens had not been previously investigated in humans, the
      first patient in each treatment arm was followed for 28 days and evaluated for any
      regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT), defined as any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) that could not
      be attributed solely to either the vaccine or ipilimumab and was therefore considered to be
      related to the combination. If an RLT was observed in the first patient, the second patient
      was to be evaluated for 28 days before the third patient was enrolled. If at any point â‰¥ 2
      RLTs were observed in a treatment arm, accrual to that arm was to be terminated and the
      combination in that arm was to be declared unsafe.

      Patients were monitored for safety, immune and tumor response, and immunological changes in
      the tumor microenvironment for the duration of study participation, which may have been up to
      6 months.
