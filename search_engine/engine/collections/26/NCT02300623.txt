      (off-ART), separated by 16 weeks of treatment -or the time necessary to reach again to PVL
      <20 copies/mL- (on-ART). At the end of the 4th off-ART cycle (week 0) an interim evaluation
      was performed and the second phase initiated. During the second phase, the first 6 patients
      received ART until they reach PVL<20 copies/mL, discontinuing thereafter (final stop). The
      last 6 patients received ART and low doses of IL-2. ARV therapy was stopped after reaching
      PVL<20 copies/mL (final stop) and IL-2 after 6 months of treatment. IL-2 was prescribed at a
      dose of 750.000 UI/m2 daily and was self-administrated in all patients previous trained by a
      specialized nurse. ART was resumed in patient dropping CD4 cell count less than 350 cell/mm3
      in two consecutive determinations or in patients who developed opportunistic infections. A
      long term follow up analysis was performed at 3, 6 and 9 years since the final stop. It
      included time to resume ART, clinical events, survival rate, CD4-CD8-CD4/CD8 ratio.
