      whom they administer Synflorixâ„¢ in the course of their normal clinical practice according to

      Since there is lack of clarity regarding the PMS study requirement (both from Regulatory
      agency and Ethics Committee), it was decided that GSK will submit Local PSURs on a regular

      and if they want something more they are requested to revert back with specific requirements.
