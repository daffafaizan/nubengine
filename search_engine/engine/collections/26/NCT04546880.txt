      study.

      Twenty-three mothers in the experimental group receive stabilization exercises with breathing
      exercises 3 times a week for 8 weeks while 23 mothers in the control group receive only
      stabilization exercises during the same period of time. Each exercise session lasts about 60
      minutes and was performed 3 days per week, for 8 weeks. All mothers in both groups perform 15
      minutes warm-up stretching exercises prior to the core exercises and 10 minutes cool-down
      exercises at the end of each session.

      Breathing with the stabilization exercise group receives breathing exercises before the
      stabilization exercise program. A one-hour theoretical training is given to the mothers about
      the techniques of diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing at the beginning of the study. The
      pursed-lip breathing is one step further to the diaphragmatic breathing. Patients are
      instructed to do breathing exercises during the stabilization exercises, in which patients
      focus on their breathing circle, time, and movement while doing the stabilization exercises.

      All 46 mothers in both groups are given a one-hour training about the stabilization exercises
      before starting the study. The motor control tests for local muscles transversus abdominus
      and multifidi are performed after the training. The abdominal bracing test is performed in
      the quadruped position, in prone, and in hook lying position with the patient's spine supine
      with hips and knees flexed and knees in contact with the surface. Closed-chain segmental
      control exercises, a series of weight-bearing exercises, and open kinetic chain exercises to
      promote distal stability are performed.
