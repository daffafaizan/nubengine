      single-arm, nonrandomized study of ceftobiprole in healthy men and women. The study is
      conducted in 2 parts: a pilot study and a main study. Each study (i.e. the pilot study and
      the main study) consists of 3 phases: a pretreatment phase that includes up to a 21-day
      screening period, an open-label treatment phase (1 day in the pilot study and 2 days in the
      main study), and a posttreatment phase that included the end of study evaluations and
      follow-up study visit or telephone contact planned for 1 to 2 weeks after discharge from the
      study unit. Serial blood and dialysis samples will be collected at specified time points from
      predose through 24 hours after the start of the infusion for estimation of ceftobiprole and
      ceftobiprole medocaril concentrations. Additional samples will be collected for measurement
      of protein binding. The study will include the following evaluations of safety and
      tolerability: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, serum
      chemistry, and urinalysis), electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, physical examination,
      serology, pregnancy tests, urine drug screen, and alcohol breath test. In the pilot study,
      Ceftobiprole will be locally administered via a microdialysis probe at a concentration of
      approximately 30 Âµg/mL for 60 minutes. In the main Study, each volunteer will receive
      ceftobiprole locally via the microdialysis probe. After the washout period determined by the
      pilot study, each volunteer will receive a single 2-hour i.v. infusion of ceftobiprole.
