    
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia causes severe dermatological mutilations. Forms that
      require systemic treatment are complicated localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (cLCL),
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The clinical
      presentation of CL depends on various factors including parasite species, infection history
      and differences in the immune response. National guidelines recommend equally all drugs that
      are also used for visceral leishmaniasis treatment. Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) is one of
      these recommended medications. However, dermatologists in Ethiopia also use a combination of
      SSG and Allopurinol for treatment of complicated cutaneous leishmaniasis.

      Outcomes of patients receiving SSG and Allopurinol combination have never been documented
      systematically in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is not known how effective this combination is.
      This study will provide evidence to help clinicians make the best choice regarding treatment
      for complicated CL cases. Due to diversity in host-pathogen interactions across the different
      CL forms, early immunological correlates associated with treatment responsiveness and
      unresponsiveness could help treatment recommendation and provide us with the basis to develop
      new diagnostic and treatment strategies.

      This study aims to document treatment outcomes of patients with cLCL, MCL, and DCL receiving
      systemic treatment using SSG and Allopurinol combination within a routine care setting
      located in a highly endemic area in Ethiopia.
