    
      Study participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment
      sequences (i.e., SID530 on Day 1 followed by Taxotere on Day 21 or Taxotere on Day 1 followed
      by SID530 on Day 21). Randomization will be stratified by whether the study participant
      received prior docetaxel treatment.

      All study participants will be premedicated with oral dexamethasone, 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg
      b.i.d.) for three days, starting one day prior to each study drug infusion, in order to
      reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of
      hypersensitivity reactions. During each treatment cycle, both the test and the reference
      treatments will receive identical dosages of docetaxel (i.e., 75 mg/m2, by i.v. infusion,
      over 1 hour).

      Study completion will be defined as completing all protocol-specified procedures. Study
      participants who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will be requested to complete the
      assessments conducted at the Final Visit.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be obtained at the predefined times during
      Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.

      Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study, including 21 days after the last study
      drug infusion. Hematology assessments,other laboratory parameters and vital signs will be
      assessed.
