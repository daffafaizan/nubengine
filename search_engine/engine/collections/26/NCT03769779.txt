    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel twelve-week study of the
      performance of an oral test product to evaluate the effects of twelve weeks of lutein
      supplementation on skin health and appearance in healthy women. A seven-day washout period
      will precede the evaluation period. The subjects in each cohort will use consume one softgel
      of their assigned test product (treatment or placebo) daily in the morning with breakfast for
      12 weeks. Changes in skin condition and appearance as well as blood chemistry will be
      assessed using results from expert visual grading, instrumental assessments, skin and blood
      assays and subjective questionnaire responses. Subjects will be recruited during the winter
      season to account for seasonal variations of skin parameters.

      Evaluation points will occur pre-application (Baseline; Week 0) and after 42 and 84 days of
      use (D42, D84; Week 6, Week 12). Data will be collected on the following outcomes:

      1. Skin Hydration 2. Skin texture/smoothness 2. Reduction of facial fine lines and wrinkles
      3. Skin elasticity and firmness 4. Sagging skin, dry skin, skin tone, appearance from expert
      clinical grading and subjective questionnaire responses.

      6. Skin hydration 7. Skin collagen 8. Skin lipid content. 9. Skin Carotenoids
