      recommended Phase 2 dose. The starting dose is CC-292 375 mg twice daily and Lenalidomide 10
      mg once daily. After review of the data for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the second dose
      level will be enrolled. Doses for this second cohort are CC-292 500 mg twice daily and
      lenalidomide 10 mg once daily. Additional doses of lenalidomide in combination with CC-292
      may be evaluated to accurately determine the maximum tolerated dose. Once the maximum
      tolerated dose and/or optimal biologic effect has been ascertained, an expansion cohort of 24
      subjects may be enrolled.
