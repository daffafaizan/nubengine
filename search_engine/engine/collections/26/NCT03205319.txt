      are highly prevalent in the general population. Lifestyle modifications and medication can
      reduce symptoms in most patients. Guidelines state that oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is
      only indicated in a selected high risk group. In spite of these guidelines, OGD referrals for
      dyspepsia without alarm symptoms are still substantial, subjecting patients to unnecessary
      risks and causing a burden on healthcare costs and endoscopic capacity. Therefore a strategy
      is needed to reduce the volume of OGDs in dyspepsia without alarm symptoms.

      Objective: To evaluate the clinical use of a patient-centred, education based, clinical
      strategy to reduce the volume of endoscopies for dyspepsia in patients over 18 years of age
      without alarm symptoms, referred for OGD through open-access endoscopy compared to usual
      care.

      Study design: A multicentre, randomised, controlled superiority trial, with two parallel arms
      and a primary endpoint of the percentage of patients receiving OGD. Intervention and usual
      care will be compared.

      Study population: 119 Patients, aged 18 years or above, with upper GI symptoms without alarm
      symptoms, referred for open-access OGD.

      Intervention: Patients will be offered e-learning instead of endoscopy. The e-learning will
      contain educational material and questionnaires. Questionnaire data will be extracted from
      the e-learning.

      Main study endpoints: The main study endpoint is the difference in proportion of patients
      receiving OGD between both arms and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROMS), after a follow-up of
      12 weeks.
