      worldwide with evidence that support nutritional status may be associated with poor outcomes
      in TB patients. Data from observational and limited intervention studies support the
      hypothesis that nutritional supplements/micronutrients may be beneficial as well as potential
      treatments in TB. The effect of micronutrient status will be examined in the context of a
      double blinded placebo controlled randomized trial; 400 tuberculosis patients (age 6 weeks to
      5 years) will be randomized to receive either multi-micronutrients or placebo from the start
      of their anti-TB therapy, through 2 months of their anti-TB therapy. The primary objective is
      to evaluate the efficacy of a multivitamin supplement containing vitamins B, C and E on
      weight gain in childhood tuberculosis at 2 months after start of anti-tuberculosis therapy.
      Secondary objectives are to: evaluate the efficacy of a multivitamin supplement containing
      vitamins B, C, and E on clearance of chest x-ray in childhood tuberculosis at 2 months after
      start of anti-tuberculosis therapy; compare the treatment arms with respect to the following
      immunological parameters: ex-vivo lymphocyte proliferation; cytokines production including
      IL-2, IL-12, TNF - alpha, INF-gamma; and CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte counts at 2 months after
      start of anti-tuberculosis therapy; assess the validity of Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) for the
      diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis in a population with high BCG coverage and HIV
      prevalence; assess the validity and feasibility of using "microscopic observation broth drug
      susceptibility (MODS) assay" of sputum and gastric aspirates in the diagnosis of childhood
      tuberculosis; correlate the above-mentioned immunological markers (IL-2, IL-12, INF-gamma and
      TNF-alpha) with weight gain and chest x-ray at 2 months after start of anti-tuberculosis
      therapy; and compare the immunological response to a supplement containing vitamins B, C and
      E in childhood tuberculosis patients with and without HIV infection. The endpoints of
      interest include immunological parameters like CD4 T lymphocyte count and clinical outcomes
      such as, weight gain and resolution of chest x-ray after 2 months anti-TB therapy.
      Researchers will also examine the utility of these immune response parameters as surrogate
      markers for treatment efficacy in TB, irrespective of nutritional and other risk factors.
