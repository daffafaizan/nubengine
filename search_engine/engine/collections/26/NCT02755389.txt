      airway management is a lack of oxygen in the blood. If severe or prolonged, this lack of
      oxygen can result in permanent brain damage, damage to other vital organs or even death.
      Strategies already exist to help prevent a lack of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), however
      research involving new ways to oxygenate patients may help to minimize the chance of
      hypoxemia during airway management. Apneic oxygenation is a novel method of delivering oxygen
      to a patient despite a lack of active respiration (i.e. the patient is not breathing on their
      own and the investigators are not providing the patient an artificial breath). The simplest
      and least invasive method to provide apneic oxygenation is the application of oxygen through
      nasal cannulae during airway management. Several different techniques to provide apneic
      oxygenation via nasal cannulae have been previously described(1-3), however randomized trials
      comparing these methods do not exist. This study will examine the change over time of the
      amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood (PaO2) in each of the three treatment groups: a
      control group (no apneic oxygenation), a 15 L/min group and a 60 L/min group. This data will
      help to determine the extent of benefit apneic oxygenation provides in this setting.
