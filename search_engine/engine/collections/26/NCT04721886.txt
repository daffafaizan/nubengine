      I. To determine if the 3-dimensional (3D) subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE)
      results can be used to estimate interstitial fluid pressures (IFPs) in breast tumor and its
      surrounding tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the malignancy of breast tumor can be predicted by the 3D SHAPE results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultrasound without contrast. Patients then receive perflutren lipid
      microspheres (Definity) intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and undergo CEUS.
