      body weight, body composition, intramyocellular and/or intrahepatocellular lipid, and changes
      in association to body weight will be measured among other outcomes.

      The Intervention Group will follow a low-fat, vegan diet and will receive weekly classes and
      support.

      The Control Group will be asked to follow a conventional control diet.

      This study conducts a pilot sub-study to test the hypothesis that changes in insulin
      sensitivity and beta-cell function observed in response to a diet intervention correlate with
      changes in intramyocellular and/or intrahepatocellular lipid. Another sub-study assesses the
      association between metabolic outcomes and gut microbiome. One additional sub-study is
      looking for associations between metabolic outcomes and endothelial function.
