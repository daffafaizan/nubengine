      have a G551D-CFTR mutation and percent predicted forced expiratory volumn in 1 second (FEV1)
      between 40% and 90%.

      Based on in vitro studies and pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety profiles,
      ivacaftor was selected for clinical development as a possible treatment for patients with CF.
      Patients with the G551D mutation were the targeted population for this study because
      ivacaftor is a potentiator of the gating function of the CFTR protein, and the most prevalent
      mutation with a gating defect in CF is the G551D mutation.

      This study was designed to further evaluate the efficacy of ivacaftor in subjects with CF who
      have a G551D-CFTR gene mutation and to evaluate safety in this population over a longer
      period than previously studied.
