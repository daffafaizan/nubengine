    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of ensartinib in combination with carboplatin, pemetrexed and
      bevacizumab in patients with ALK-rearranged advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ensartinib in combination with
      carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine an objective response rate (ORR) in patients with ALK-rearranged advanced
      NSCLC treated with ensartinib in combination with carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab
      using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS). III. To determine overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine biomarkers associated with response and resistance to the study combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of ensartinib and fixed-dose carboplatin,
      pemetrexed, and bevacizumab followed by a dose-expansion study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive ensartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21,
      carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 15-60 minutes on day 1, pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on
      day 1 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive ensartinib PO QD on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
