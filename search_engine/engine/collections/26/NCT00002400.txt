    
      In this multicenter, open-label study, 45 HIV-1-positive patients receive either combination
      drug therapy with delavirdine (DLV), zidovudine (ZDV), and indinavir (IDV) or combination
      drug therapy with ZDV, lamivudine (3TC), and IDV. NOTE: Patients are treated for 24 weeks and
      may opt to continue on study for 24 additional weeks, if HIV-1 RNA is less than 5,000
      copies/ml or at the investigator's discretion.
