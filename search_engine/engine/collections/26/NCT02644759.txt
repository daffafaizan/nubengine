      of long-term complications. The best-established treatment is constricted control of blood
      glucose accomplished by regular daily injections or constant subcutaneous infusion of insulin
      as intensive insulin therapy. Although insulin therapy has advanced immensely, even the most
      modern technologies do not allow the maintenance of normal glucose levels.

      This is a prospective pilot study intended to treat patients with T1DM after at least one
      year of confirmed diagnosis. This study encompasses a two-arm approach; the first arm is
      composed of clinical-grade purification of autologous, leukapheresis-derived, Cluster of
      differentiation 34+ and 133+ stem cells (accomplished by utilisation of CliniMACS System and
      approved clinical-grade Microbeads and accessories), and transplantation of the purified ell
      populations into pancreatic artery and capillaries via interventional radiology techniques;
      while the second arm aims at halting the immune attack on pancreatic Î²-cells through
      immunomodulation, and is composed of incubation of patient's leukapheresis with cord
      blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells for 3-6 hours, and return of the patient's own white
      blood cells back into the patient via intravenous injection. Patients are first mobilised
      with 10 ug/Kg Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF) for five day, and then Mononuclear
      Cells are collected from the patient via leukapheresis.
