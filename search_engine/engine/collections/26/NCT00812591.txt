      blood obtained by fingersticking and administration of exogenous insulin in the form of a
      subcutaneous bolus injection or subcutaneous infusion. This treatment could be simplified if
      there were a stable ratio between blood glucose concentration and tissue glucose level at the
      site of insulin delivery so that tissue glucose levels could be used to estimate blood
      glucose levels, thereby circumventing the need for fingerstick blood glucose monitoring.

      The aim of this study is to ascertain whether a stable ratio between the blood glucose
      concentration and the glucose levels at the tissue site of insulin infusion exists when this
      tissue site is exposed to variable insulin infusion rates. To achieve this, microdialysis and
      microperfusion probes are applied in healthy and type 1 diabetic subjects to perform insulin
      delivery and glucose sampling at the same adipose tissue site during euglycemic clamps and
      oral glucose tolerance tests.
