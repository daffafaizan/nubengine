      (MRS) has provided researchers with the opportunity to study functional and metabolic changes
      of the central nervous system (CNS) in both healthy controls and individuals with
      neurological diseases in response to sensory, motor or cognitive stimulation. While MRI is in
      common usage in radiology departments and clinics MRI and MRS techniques and hardware are
      continually being upgraded and designed for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the CNS at 3.0 Tesla. We will evaluate new
      sequences on volunteers and for potential use in patients with CNS pathology. These studies
      are required in order to develop and implement new imaging techniques for research and
      clinical applications.
