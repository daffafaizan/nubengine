      stress are related to poor prognosis. Having recognized that acute emotional stress can
      induce cardiovascular events, many clinical tests of mental stress have been carried out to
      observe the correlation between emotional stress and cardiac damage, which ultimately lead to
      the formalization of the concept of Mental Stress Induced Myocardial Ischemia(MSIMI). In the
      past 3 decades, it has been evidenced that mental stress is internally related to myocardial
      ischemia. According to current studies, over 70% patients with stable coronary heart disease
      have MSIMI and are exposed to three or four times higher risk of cardiovascular events.
      However, few articles are about the therapeutic effect of MSIMI treatment. This study aims to
      discuss whether the combined treatment of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western
      medicine for MSIMI does effect, namely the conventional therapy for CHD combining with TCM -
      Xinkeshu tablets.
