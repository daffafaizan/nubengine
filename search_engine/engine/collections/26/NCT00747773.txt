    
      The primary endpoints for this study are patient safety and the histological effects of
      cryospray therapy in lobectomy patients.

      The proposed study is a single center study to evaluate the safety and treatment effect of
      sprayed liquid nitrogen through a catheter via FFB using surgical resection specimens from
      patients undergoing lobectomy.
