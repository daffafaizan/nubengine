      the clinical syndrome of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetes (T1D).
      This study will test the hypothesis that recurrent HG in T1D leads to an upregulation in
      brain glucose transport and alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic tone. The
      investigators will use MRS methodology that permits evaluation of cerebral cortex and
      hypothalamus in the same session to simultaneously evaluate the cerebral correlates/mediators
      of impaired awareness and impaired counterregulatory hormone responses (CRR). High MR data
      quality and reproducibility will be ensured by using high field MR scanners and technical
      advances (automated voxel placement, real-time voxel position, frequency, shim updates).
      Continuous glucose monitoring and actigraphy will be used to chronicle glucose variability
      and activity/exercise/sleep in the weeks before each experiment to assess the impact of these
      variables on IAH.
