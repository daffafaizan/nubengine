      Study population:

      CD patients 18-65 YO, men and women, with mild-moderately active disease determined by the
      Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) of 5≤HBI≤15, who were found eligible to commence treatment with
      vedolizumab (screened for tuberculosis and hepatitis B and without an active infection or an
      abscess) will be enrolled in the study.

      Follow-up: All patients will be followed by physician assessment, sample collection,
      anthropometric measurements and questionnaires during the scheduled visits at weeks 2, 6, 14,
      22, and at week 46, on which they will undergo a colonoscopic examination as part of their
      regular clinical followup.

      Side effects (SE): will be monitored by phone, 3 days post intervention and at vedolizumab
      infusion visits at weeks 2 and 6. Also, patients will receive direct contact details of both
      the study coordinator and the study PI.
