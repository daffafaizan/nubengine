      years of age. Despite advances in medical care, many survivors face a lifetime of disability,
      including mental and physical retardation, and chronic lung disease. More recently, both
      allogenic and autogenic cord blood cells have been applied in the treatment of neonatal
      conditions such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia
      (BPD).

      Objective-To assess the safety of autologous volume- and red blood cell (RBC)-reduced
      non-cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) cell infusion to preterm infants.

      Method- This study was a phase I, open-label, single-arm, single center trial to evaluate the
      safety of autologous, volume- and RBC-reduced non-cyropreserved UCB cell (5×107cells/kg)
      infusion for preterm infants <37 weeks gestational age. UCB cell characteristics, pre- and
      post- infusion vital signs, laboratory investigations were recorded. Clinical data including
      mortality rates and preterm complications were recorded.

      Results-After processing, (22.67±4.05) ml UCB cells in volume, (2.67±2.00)×108 cells in
      number, with (22.67±4.05)×106 CD34+, and (3.72±3.25)×105colony forming cells (CFU-GM),
      (99.7±0.17%) vitality were infused to 15 preterm infants within 8 hours after birth. No
      adverse effects were noticed during treatment. All fifteen patients who received UCB infusion
      survived. The duration of hospitalization ranged from 4 to 65 (30±23.6) days. Regarding
      preterm complications, no BPD, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity
      (ROP) were observed. There were 1/15 (7%) infant with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and
      5/15 (33.3%) infants with ventilation-associated pneumonia, 10/15(66.67%) with anemia
      respectively.

      Conclusions-Collection, preparation and infusion of fresh autologous UCB cells to preterm
      infants is feasible and safe. Adequately powered randomized controlled studies are needed.
