      the alternative patterns for the resectable rectal cancer worldwide since its first
      appearance. For mid-low rectal cancer, TaTME features superior viewpoints and direct access
      to mobilize the primary lesion without the pelvic anatomic limits. Therefore, the matured
      TaTME technique could deliver satisfactory clinic outcomes in both surgical and oncological
      senses. However, the studies that designed to compare the feasibility and repeatability of
      TaTME with conventional laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LaTME) remain sparse and
      limited.

      Study Objective: Evaluation of short-term mortality and morbidity, long term overall survival
      and disease-free survival as well as quality of life in rectal cancer patients in East China.

      Study Design: This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial with a
      central monitored electronic data processing system. Corresponding randomization, data
      collection and comparative analysis will be conducted based on the research group discussion.
      According to the non-inferiority principle, the power is 80% and the α is 0.05 with 10%
      margin delta (δ). Total patients will be 258, with 129 in each group given 10% lost in
      follow-up.

      Study Endpoints: The primary outcomes measures will be the Disease-free survival (3-years).
      The secondary outcomes measures will be overall survival (3-years), mesorectal completeness
      (the quality of the TME specimen, complete, near complete, incomplete), positive
      circumferential resection margin (CRM), number of retrieved lymph nodes, morbidity rate,
      mortality rate.
