      cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hPSC-CM ) from healthy donors. The cells will be injected
      directly into the myocardium at time of coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients will be
      assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months after cell transplantation for safety, feasibility and
      efficacy.
