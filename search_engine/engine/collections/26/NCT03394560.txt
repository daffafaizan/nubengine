    
      A randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded and parallel group trial (12 therapeutic
      sessions). Active or sham rTMS will be combined with body weight-support treadmill training
      to verify the improvement of sensory-motor function in patients with incomplete spinal cord
      injury. Behavioral assessments will be performed before, after 6 and 12 therapeutic sessions
      and at the 30-day follow-up after the intervention, though: (i) the WISCI-II Index; (ii) ASIA
      Impairment Scale (AIS), (iii) ASIA Lower Extremities Motor Scale (LEMS), (iv) Ashworth
      Modified Scale; (v) the Functional Independence Measure (SCIM-III), (vi) the Short Form
      Health Survey 36 (SF-36) and (vii) the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale - (PGICS).
