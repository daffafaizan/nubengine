      the head and neck or lung treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy
      followed by filgrastim (G-CSF). II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
      III. Determine the time to progression and the sites and pattern of progression in patients
      treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the median, 1-year, and 2-year survival rates of
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck vs salivary gland malignancy or other non-squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck vs lung cancer). Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour
      and cisplatin IV over 30-120 minutes on days 1-5. Patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily
      on days 1-5. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 6-13 or until blood
      counts recover. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 4 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42-84 patients (14-28 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 2-4 years.
