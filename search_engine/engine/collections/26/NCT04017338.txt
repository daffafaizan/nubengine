      20 other organs) using organs from HCV+ donors. Lungs to be used for transplantation will be
      exposed to ex vivo lung perfusion with use of ultraviolet C light during perfusion if
      clinically indicated for lung-related outcomes (ie. not determined by the study
      investigators). Ex vivo organ perfusion will not be used for other organs. Recipients who are
      scheduled to receive an HCV-infected organ will receive glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir
      (120mg) supplied as three fixed-dose combination tablets once a day starting prior to the
      transplant as soon the patient is in the hospital and it is confirmed that the transplant is
      proceeding. HCV treatment will continue for 7 days post-transplant (total 8 doses).
      Recipients will also receive ezetimibe (10 mg) once daily starting at the same time as G/P
      and continued until 7 days post-transplant. Recipients will have blood samples taken daily
      for the first 2 weeks and then weekly until 12 weeks post-transplant for HCV PCR (with
      additional final sample taken at 6 months post-transplant). The investigators hypothesize
      that HCV transmission to recipients will be prevented by the use of potent DAA prophylaxis
      plus ezetimibe with or without ex vivo organ perfusion in the immediate peri-operative
      period.
