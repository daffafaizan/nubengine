      our facilities. After informed consent, patients will be randomly given the standard or new
      catheter in our practice. Envelopes with the random assignment will be available to the
      individuals consenting patients. Randomization generally ensures that study groups are
      similar on average. As age, sex, and weight impact image quality, we will collect data on
      these factors in case randomization results in an imbalance. This will allow for control of
      these factors in analysis of the data. Data will be collected from CT abdomen pelvis
      examinations within a 6 month-1 year period in 2016 - 2017. Our primary outcome is image
      quality, measured as tissue density and distribution of contrast within the liver, spleen,
      aorta and IVC. Our secondary outcomes include Peak Contrast Infusion Pressure and Injection
      Flow Rate. Possible adverse events for use of any type of catheter include contrast
      infiltration into the subcutaneous tissues which is a minor limited event. All infiltrations
      will be recorded as part of the permanent medical record, documented in the chart, and the
      referring physician notified. The patient will be assessed by a physician immediately and
      referred to the ED if necessary for further evaluation. Current technology utilizes Power
      injector equipment which alerts the technologist to the pressure being achieved. If the
      injection pressure exceeds 325 psi the Power injector automatically shuts off.
