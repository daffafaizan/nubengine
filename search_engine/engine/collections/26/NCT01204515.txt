      (IBS) in adults and children, are among the most common and costly health care problems in
      the US. IBS disproportionately affects adult women (10-15% in western nations) and adolescent
      girls. Yet, health care providers remain challenged to provide effective clinical management.
      The etiology of IBS is not well defined and likely multi-factorial.

      A Need to Define Subgroups of IBS:

      This study emerges from the claim that identification of patient subgroups will advance our
      understanding of IBS and ultimately help develop treatment approaches. Most studies have
      lumped together patients with IBS into 2 groups (constipation-, diarrhea-predominant) and
      tested whether they differ from healthy controls. We propose that a paradigm shift is in
      order. We should recognize that IBS likely has multiple causes and therefore, multiple
      expressions. We speculate that by understanding better defined patient subgroups and linking
      them to newer biomarkers or tests, ultimately will further the understanding of the origins
      and create effective treatments.
