      and immunogenicity should be compared head-to-head with its reference product in at least
      non-inferiority study. Immunogenicity assessment should always be done because it is
      influenced by so many factors, from nature of the drug substance until patient and disease
      related factors. Moreover its consequences also vary considerably, from clinically irrelevant
      to serious and life-threatening. Immunogenicity of a biosimilar should always be investigated
      in humans, since animal data are usually not predictive of the immune response in humans.

      Since blinding of study participants is likely unfeasible, at least anti-drug antibodies
      should be determined in a blinded fashion. Since anti-insulin antibodies develop early, then
      6 months duration of study is adequate.
