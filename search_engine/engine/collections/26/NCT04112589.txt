      followed by transplantation, when possible, with up to 3 optional consolidation cycles. All
      patients in CR/CRi (complete remission / complete remission with incomplete hematologic
      recovery) will receive a maintenance schedule.

      A Phase I (dose escalation) will be performed at 40 mg x 14 days of quizartinib in the first
      3 patients, and if no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed, the next cohort of patients
      will receive 60 mg x 14 days. There is also the possibility of de-escalation cohorts at 60 mg
      x 7 days and at 40 mg x 7 days. Patients participating in the Phase I will receive the
      allocated dose level, and therefore, they must not receive strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
      concomitantly with quizartinib The Phase II will include 68 patients treated at the RP2D
      (recommended phase 2 dose). A 1-year maintenance schedule starting at 30 mg will be increased
      to 60 mg/day if appropriate.

      Patients will be followed up for a minimum period of 1 year since the first visit of the last
      patient included.
