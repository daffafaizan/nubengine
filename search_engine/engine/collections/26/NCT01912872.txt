    
      This was a multicentric, open label, randomized, parallel-group study with a 12-month
      treatment period. Participants were assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups, omalizumab
      plus budesonide/formoterol or budesonide/formoterol alone.

      The study comprised 4 phases:

      During the 4-week run-in phase adult participants received budesonide 800 mg and formoterol
      24 mg. If a participant complied with all inclusion and exclusion criteria and had received
      the according-to-age run-in proposed doses during the last month, the participant continued
      to the stable-steroid phase.

      During the 16-week stable-steroid phase, adult and pediatric eligible participants were
      randomized to one of the two treatment groups.

      During the 8-week steroid-reduction phase, adult and pediatric participants reduced 25% of
      the budesonide baseline dose every 2 weeks, depending of the asthma control, until they
      reached a 100% reduction of the baseline dose. The clinical control of asthma was defined
      according to criteria (GINA 2012).
