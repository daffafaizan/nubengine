        -  Compare the effect of chlorambucil vs involved-field radiotherapy on progression-free
           survival of patients with previously untreated stage III or IV follicular lymphoma.

        -  Compare the complete and partial remission rates and overall survival of patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral chlorambucil on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
           for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy on days 1 and 3 (and days 15 and 17 for split
           course).

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 3, 6, and 8 (arm I), and then at 4-6
      weeks after study.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, 3-4 months (arm I), 3 months and 6 months (arm II), 11,
      12, 15, 18, and 21 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 444 patients (222 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
