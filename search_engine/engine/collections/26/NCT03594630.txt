      I. To quantify the rates of organ preservation and tumor regrowth with non-operative
      management of locally advanced rectal cancer in patients achieving a clinical complete
      response (cCR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate clinical, radiographic, and pathologic findings after neoadjuvant therapy for
      rectal cancer.

      II. To determine the impact of active surveillance with deferral of surgery on oncologic
      outcomes.

      III. To assess decision quality for patients with rectal cancer facing multiple treatment
      options.

      IV. To explore the impact of patient-provider communication on patient decisions for surgical
      versus nonsurgical treatment decision for rectal cancer.

      V. To assess safety of deferral of surgery in distal rectal cancer patients with possibility
      of cohort expansion to more proximal locally advanced rectal cancer patients.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain tissue to monitor treatment response and any future biomarker analyses

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants who have achieved clinical complete response undergo standard surgical
      resection.

      GROUP II: Participants who have achieved clinical complete response receive active
      surveillance and consolidated chemotherapy for up to 4 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with incomplete response or regrowth of
      tumor, undergo surgical resection as in Group I.

      After the completion of study treatment, participants in Group I are followed up at 6 and 12
      months, and then once a year for up to 3 years. Participants in Group II are followed up
      every 3 months for 18 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then every year for up to 3
      years.
