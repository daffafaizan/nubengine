           diagnostic colonoscopy will be considered for inclusion. Patients with at least one
           histologically verified <10 mm polyp will be included. A short video-clip (around 15-20
           seconds) of each polyp both at white-light and FICE-light will be recorded and stored in
           an anonymized database.

        2. Once the video-library is completed, each of 7 experts will independently review all the
           cases. For each case, any observer will assess each of the three NICE criteria
           (colour/vascularization/surface), the degree of confidence (low/high), and classify the
           lesion as neoplastic or non-neoplastic. The primary outcomes are the accuracy of FICE
           technology with high-definition and without magnification, when adopting NICE
           classification, to differentiate between hyperplastic and adenomatous lesions, and the
           inter-observer agreement in such differentiation. Secondary end-points are to assess at
           multivariate measure the role of any individual criteria of NICE classification in the
           discrimination between the two histotypes, and possible adaptations of NICE
           classification in order to be applied with FICE.
