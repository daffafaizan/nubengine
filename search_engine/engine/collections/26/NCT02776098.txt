      confers a high risk of diabetes, with up to 40-50% of adults experiencing Cystic
      Fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is associated with an accelerated decline in lung
      function, nutritional status and survival and despite treatment mortality in patients with
      CFRD remains high. Airway inflammation and susceptibility to infections caused by
      hyperglycemia, and the catabolic effect of insulin deficiency are posited mechanisms of
      CFRD-associated morbidity. Respiratory failure caused by airway disease is well known but the
      contribution of respiratory muscle dysfunction may be critical. In Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      (T2DM) glucose and insulin defects are closely correlated with muscle function. The pulmonary
      muscles are crucial to respiration and airway clearance in CF. Muscle function is dependent
      on its mass, composition, and energy metabolism. Lean body mass (LBM) deficits are present in
      CF and improvement in LBM improves pulmonary function. Using T2DM as a model for muscle
      dysfunction, the study hypothesis is that glucose intolerance exacerbates LBM deficits,
      negatively affects muscle composition, and alters muscle metabolism leading to respiratory
      muscle dysfunction and a decline in pulmonary function.

      CF subjects without CFRD and healthy controls will undergo 3 study visits (baseline then
      annually for 2 years) and CFRD subjects will undergo 2 study visits (baseline and 6 months
      after baseline). Evaluations will include neurologic exams, anthropometric assessments, 3-day
      dietary recall, MRI scans, oral glucose tolerance tests (CF subjects only), blood work,
      pulmonary function testing, muscle strength testing, exercise testing, bone density scans,
      and adverse event assessment.
