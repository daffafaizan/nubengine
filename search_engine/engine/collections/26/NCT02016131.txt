      color-coded images and make quantitative measurements. Region of interest (ROI) measurements
      are performed equivalently in the endoleak and the aorta after the image generation. There
      are three kinds of ROIs including a small circle area with the shortest time to peak, a
      circle area with peak contrast intensity and the whole endoleak area. The ROI and a reference
      at the same latitude within the aorta are selected to undergo measurement which reflected the
      endoleak hemodynamics of the endoleak to the utmost extent.

      The following parameters will be acquired through the CQDSA for analysis.

        1. Time-versus-ROI contrast intensity graph. The graph contains one endoleak ROI flow curve
           and one reference aortic flow curve (Ref). The x-axis shows time from 0 second to the
           maximum frame time of the image. The y-axis shows the sum of pixel intensities, namely
           total contrast, representing the contrast concentration within the ROI.

        2. ROI Peak/Ref Peak. It is the ratio of intensity peak between the endoleak and the
           reference in the aorta.

        3. ROI TTP (Time to peak). Peak time of ROI in the vicinity of endoleak entry.

        4. ROI AUC/Ref AUC. Area under curve (AUC) is calculated through Time-versus-ROI contrast
           intensity graph. The parameter here is the ratio of ROI AUC in endoleak to the
           reference.
