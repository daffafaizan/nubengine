      episodes dominate over stress incontinence episodes, and vice versa. The treatment of MUI
      often begins with the most bothersome symptoms.

      MESA questionnaire is a reliable and validated tool to evaluate the severity and predominance
      of stress or urgency urinary incontinence. At present, it hasn't been translated into a
      Chinese language version and validated.

      The validation study of MESA questionnaire is embedded in a randomized controlled trial
      conducted among female patients, of which the data will be collected and analysed.
