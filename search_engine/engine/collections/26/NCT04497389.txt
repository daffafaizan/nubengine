      FDA-approved as a human cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/P) under
      21 CFR 1271 for tissue injury; and has been used to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in
      patients with a variety of ailments. Given this, the investigators hypothesize that
      intravenously (IV) administered processed sterile filtered amniotic fluid will reduce
      inflammation in COVID-19 patients, and improve secondary clinical outcomes. Specifically, the
      investigators hypothesize that patients who receive IV administered hAF will see a 50%
      reduction in mean C-reactive protein levels following treatment.
