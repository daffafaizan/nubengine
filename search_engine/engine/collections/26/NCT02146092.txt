    
      This study is a prospective blinded randomized control trial (RCT) where two arms will be
      assembled. Consenting eligible patients will be randomized to either the physiotherapy +
      incentive spirometry (PT+IS-intervention) arm or physiotherapy only (PT-control arm).
      Patients will be randomized with an equal (1:1) chance of being allocated to either the PT
      (control) arm or PT+IS (intervention) arm. Both the treating surgeon and data interpreter
      will be blinded to the intervention.
