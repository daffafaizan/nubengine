      initiated an early access program to make its investigational drug, adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg,
      available to those patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B at risk of disease
      progression. Protocol GS-01-550 provides access to patients with lamivudine-resistant
      hepatitis B virus who are in need of an alternative treatment to suppress HBV DNA replication
      and prevent progressive liver disease.
