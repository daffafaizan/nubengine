    
      One-month, approximately 36 subjects enrolled (~12/site), randomized, double-masked crossover
      trial.

      Existing scleral rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens wearing subjects are randomly
      assigned (block) to different arms of the trial and receive different saline solutions for
      use sequentially for 2-week periods. The subjects will continue to wear their existing
      scleral GP lenses if lens fit is acceptable following an initial evaluation. Subjects will
      agree to complete a survey administered daily (via email) that will address contact lens wear
      time and subjective symptoms.
