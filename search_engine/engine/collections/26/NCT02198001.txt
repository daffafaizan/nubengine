      bisphosphonates.

      This prospective randomized study will include a cohort of 100 patients treated with
      bisphosphonates (for benign or malignant conditions) and requiring dental extractions
      (non-retainable teeth for infectious, traumatic or parodontal reasons). 50 patients will
      benefit of PRF placement in the tooth extraction site (group 1) while 50 patients do not
      (group 2).

      The rest of the procedure will be the same in the 2 arms. In the literature, studies suggest
      a benefit from a long term antibiotherapy before and after tooth extraction. Extraction
      procedure should be the least traumatic as possible.

      The main objective of our study is to assess, after tooth extraction, the contribution of PRF
      in the prevention of jaw osteonecrosis induced by bisphosphonates.

      A follow-up period of one year after extraction is indicated.
