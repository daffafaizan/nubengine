      I. To determine if hypofractionated with a smaller total dose radiation is not inferior to
      standard-dose radiation in progression-free survival for initial distant metastases
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma .

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if hypofractionated with a low total dose radiation is not inferior to
      standard-dose radiation in overall survival and locoregional failure-free survival for
      initial distant metastases nasopharyngeal carcinoma II. To evaluate if hypofractionated with
      a low total dose radiation with chemotherapy decrease treatment-related toxicities

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms

      ARM 1: Patients receive hypofractionated with a low total dose radiation with induced
      chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.Hypofractionated dose IMRT: GTVnx 60Gy, GTVnd 60Gy,
      PTV1 50Gy and PTV2 45Gy in 25 fractions, 5 days/week.

      Induced chemotherapy: Paclitaxel 135mg/m2 D1+Cisplatin 75mg/m2 D1(or D1-3), 3-week
      chemotherapy for 3 cycles. After radiation, patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy Paclitaxel
      135mg/m2 D1+Cisplatin 75mg/m2 D1(or D1-3), 3-week chemotherapy for 3 cycles.

      ARM 2: Patients receive standard-dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy. Standard-dose
      IMRT: GTVnx 69.69Gy, GTVnd 60-68Gy, PTV1 59.4Gy and PTV2 54Gy in 33 fractions, 5 days/week.

      Induced chemotherapy: Paclitaxel 135mg/m2 D1+Cisplatin 75mg/m2 D1(or D1-3), 3-week
      chemotherapy for 3 cycles. After radiation, patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy Paclitaxel
      135mg/m2 D1+Cisplatin 75mg/m2 D1(or D1-3), 3-week chemotherapy for 3 cycles.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
