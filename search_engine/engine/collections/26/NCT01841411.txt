      tract symptoms. It has recently been observed that 90% of subjects with BV show the growth of
      bacteria in the form of biofilms,and that Gardnerella vaginalis was the predominant species.
      The propensity of G. vaginalis to form biofilm is clinically relevant because this form of
      growth allows it to tolerate higher concentrations of certain antibiotics, thus increasing
      the possibility of recurrent BV even after apparently curative therapy. So new treatment
      strategies must be used to insure complete cure and prevent recurrence. NAC is an amino acid
      with strong antioxidant, mucolytic and antibacterial properties, and is produced within the
      human body.Its effect in biofilms has been tested in several bacteria.

      This study aims to test the efficacy of NAC in treatment of BV either alone or in combination
      with the traditionally used metronidazole. Also the effect of using NAC in prevention of
      recurrence of BV will be monitored.
