    
      Background:

        -  BHD is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited disorder which confers susceptibility to
           develop multifocal, bilateral renal cancer, spontaneous pneumothorax and
           fibrofolliculomas.

        -  BHD is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene located on Chromosome17

        -  Defining the genetic and biochemical pathways leading to renal tumorigenesis in BHD may
           lead to the development of new molecularly targeted drugs.

      Objectives:

        -  To define the types and characteristics (including patterns of growth) of renal cancer
           associated with BHD

        -  To determine the risk of renal cancer, lung cysts and fibrofolliculomas in patients with
           BHD

        -  To define the natural history of BHD related renal tumors

        -  To determine if other genes contribute to BHD

        -  Identify genotype / phenotype correlations

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients suspected or known to have phenotype or genotype suggestive of Birt Hogg Dube,
           such as:

             -  Patients with histologically confirmed fibrofolliculomas,

             -  Patients with clinical evidence of multiple skin papules consistent with
                fibrofolliculomas, and/or a family history of spontaneous pneumothorax or kidney
                cancer

        -  Patients with a known germline FLCN mutation

        -  A relative (related by blood) of an individual with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis
           of BHD

      Design:

        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis, determine size
           and location of renal tumors, size at presentation, growth rate and metastatic potential
           of renal tumors.

        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations the BHD
           gene and to assess the relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease manifestations
           and phenotype.
