    
      This is a single-arm non-randomized two-stage phase II trial in previously untreated patients
      with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) arising in the oral cavity,
      oropharynx, or supraglottic larynx amenable to a transoral surgical approach. Treatment will
      consist of 3 parts: neoadjuvant induction with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel in
      combination with daily lapatinib for 6 weeks (PART 1) prior to transoral surgery (PART 2).
      Post-operative treatment (PART 3) will vary depending on the risk category assigned to the
      patient following surgery as follows: no further treatment or treatment limited to involved
      field radiation (low risk), ipsilateral radiation concurrent with weekly chemotherapy (
      medium risk); or cisplatin every 3 weeks and daily lapatinib concurrent with bilateral
      radiation (high risk).
