      potential benefits. Indeed, in similar contexts of announcement of bad news and choice of
      care, Parker and collaborators (1) have highlighted the positive impact of individualized
      care, respecting the needs, quality of care, and quality of life of patients. Given the
      clinical stake, and the lack of scientific knowledge devoted to communication in the context
      of resistance to treatment, it appears necessary to better understand its modalities. In this
      perspective, research has proven the value of tools for supporting communication, including
      the issue of question booklets for patients. These tools provide patients with a list of
      questions submitted to them before the medical consultation, and which they can ask during
      the consultation, and throughout the treatment. This tool fosters communication by helping
      the patient obtain a level of information that is adapted to his or her needs and experience,
      and thus, to be better prepared for care. Despite significant interest for these booklets in
      the field of oncology, none has yet been developed in the specific context of resistance to
      treatment.
