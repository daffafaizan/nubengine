      group (normotensive pregnant women) and Mild preeclampsia group. In both groups patients
      preloaded with 500 mL hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% (130/0.4) (Voluven). Spinal anesthesia
      will be performed with intrathecal 10-12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine in addition to 200 meg
      morphine. The patient was placed supine with left lateral tilt to alleviate aortocaval
      compression. 10 ml/kg of isotonic 0.9 sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions will be used co
      loading during the duration of the operation. Blood pressure was measured and recorded every
      three minutes. If severe hypotension (fall of > 20% of mean arterial pressure from baseline)
      occurred, vasopressors, 6 mg ephedrine (per dose) will be used. The blood pressure will
      rechecked 1 minute after each doses of ephedrine. If hypotension persisted after 30 mg of
      ephedrine, an additional 2 ml/kg of isotonic 0.9 NaCl solutions will be infused rapidly.
      Maternal hypotension is defined as at least a single administration of ephedrine within the
      period from induction of spinal anesthesia until transfer to postoperative recovery unit.
      Reactive hypertension is characterized as a blood pressure 20% greater than baseline mean
      levels after the use of the vasopressor. Bradycardia is defined as a fall of >30% of heart
      rate from baseline or <50 beats /minute. Bradycardia, and when associated with hypotension it
      will be treated with 0.5 mg of atropine intravenous. Upon completion of the cesarean section,
      the subject will be transported to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).
