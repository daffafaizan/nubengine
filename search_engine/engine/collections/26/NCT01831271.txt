      limitations and difficulties in returning to work. The current scientific evidence lacks
      randomised controlled trials to compare surgery with conservative treatment as well as to
      evaluate different conservative interventions. Most patients are not candidates for surgery
      and are sick-listed for long time with different treatment approaches or without any
      treatment at all. The purpose is to evaluate if treatment with neck-specific training and a
      cognitive behavioral approach improves the outcome compared with prescribed physical
      activity. Methods: A randomized controlled trial including 144 patients will compare the
      intervention neck specific training and cognitive behavioural approach with an intervention
      of prescribed physical activity. The interventions will be led by experienced and specialised
      physiotherapists and last 14 weeks. Main outcome variable is pain intensity (VAS scale)
      accompanied with assessments of impairments and subjective health measurements undertaken
      before intervention and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Implementation: The results will be
      presented scientifically as well as popularly in publications and professional meetings.
      Active implementation strategies to change physiotherapists treatment behaviour will be used.
      The best method will be chosen after surveying the physiotherapists treating patients in the
      current study regarding experiences, education and organisational context.
