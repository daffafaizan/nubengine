      with intraluminal staplers used to create the anastomosis since 1979. Successful utilization
      of these devices, whether in open or laparoscopic procedures, requires extensive training and
      experience. Even with experience, device issues such as stapler misfire, incomplete firing,
      low surgeon satisfaction, etc., may occur. In a retrospective study of 349 colorectal
      resections, 67 (19%) procedures had some type of technical error. The most frequently
      reported issues from the analysis were positive leak tests, difficulty placing or removing
      the stapler, and inadequate donuts. Surgeons may also experience psychological or physical
      stress during procedures due to complications, workload, or other factors.

      Patients scheduled to undergo a left-sided colon resection, and who meet study entry
      criteria, may be enrolled. Investigators will perform each procedure using the powered
      circular stapler according to the instructions for use (IFU). There will be no blinding or
      planned-interim analysis. Procedures may be performed open or via minimally invasive surgery
      (MIS) according to institutional standard-of-care (SOC). Use of a hand port and robotic
      assistance are permissible providing the powered circular stapler is used to create the
      anastomosis. Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery is permissible under the protocol
      at the surgeon's discretion for the patient's safety.

      The final scheduled study visit will occur 28 days post-procedure (routinely scheduled
      follow-up with surgeon). Follow-up by phone is permissible when an on-site visit is not
      planned or is more than six weeks post-operative.
