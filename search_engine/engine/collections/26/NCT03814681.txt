      presenting postoperative complications and, on the other hand, to identify those items of the
      ERAS protocols that are independently associated with a reduction in postoperative
      complications and hospital stay, which will allow to focus the perioperative efforts in those
      items that actually improve the postoperative outcomes.

        -  Aim 1 will establish the number of patients developing predefined postoperative
           complications within 30 days of surgery in adult patients undergoing elective colorectal
           surgery with any compliance of an ERAS protocol (including patients with 0 compliance).
           This will allow us to determine the actual impact of these protocols.

        -  Aim 2 will allow us to know the type of predefined complication presented by the
           patients included in the ERAS protocols and in patients undergoing colorectal surgery;
           This will allow, on the one hand, to have a starting point for future clinical trials,
           and, on the other hand, to focus efforts to avoid these complications.

        -  Aim 3 will allow us to identify those perioperative items of ERAS protocols that are
           actually associated with a decrease in postoperative complications.

      The proposed study will establish a real view of the number of patients presenting
      postoperative complications that will overcome the limitations of available retrospective
      studies and provide greater insight into the items of the protocols that are associated with
      decreased complications; on the other hand, our hypothesis is that the number of patients who
      develop predefined postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery decreases as there
      is greater compliance with the predefined ERAS protocol items
