      The amount of visualized mucosa is in direct correlation with the diagnostic yield.
      Nonetheless, frequently, the quality of the image obtained is hampered by the presence of
      bubbles, debris, bile and enteric fluid. Therefore many efforts have been putted in order to
      eliminate this factor such as the use of prokinetics, simethicone and bowel purgatives. The
      latter (namely the polyethylene glycol - PEG - solution) has accumulated evidence and is,
      therefore, recommended by the last European guidelines. Usually, the cleansing starts and
      finish in the day before the capsule endoscopy ingestion.

      We hypothesized that, similarly to what had become evidence to large bowel cleansing, a
      shorter gap between the polyethylene glycol intake and the exam could provide a better
      capsule endoscopy image quality and therefore gauging our diagnostic yield.
