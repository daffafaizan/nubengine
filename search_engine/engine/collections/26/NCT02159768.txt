      general anaesthesia will be recruited. They will have endotracheal intubation done with the
      Airtraq optical laryngoscope and handphone camera assisted visualization.

      The Airtraq optical laryngoscope fitted with the attachment holding the camera handphone will
      be prepared and loaded with an appropriately sized endotracheal tube. A standard general
      anaesthesia technique will be used. This will include standard monitoring including pulse
      oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, ECG and capnography, all started before induction of
      anaesthesia. Anaesthesia will be induced with proprofol and fentanyl, and muscle relaxation
      with atracurium.

      The airway management procedure will start after induction of anaesthesia and muscle
      relaxation. The Airtraq optical laryngoscope will be used. The Airtraq is fit with an
      attachment to hold the camera handphone, and loaded with an endotracheal tube. The Airtraq
      will be inserted and manipulated until the best view of the patient's laryngeal opening can
      be seen on the camera handphone screen. The endotracheal tube will then be placed in the
      patient's trachea and the cuff inflated. Successful intubation will be confirmed by 3-point
      auscultation and presence of end-tidal carbon dioxide tracing.
