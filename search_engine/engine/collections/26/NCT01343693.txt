      clinical outcomes of the MaxAnÂ® Anterior Cervical Plate System. Dr. Park, et.al conducted a
      retrospective review and found a positive association between adjacent-level ossification
      following anterior cervical plate procedures and the plate-to-disc distance. 1 They concluded
      that when the anterior cervical plates were placed at least 5mm away from the adjacent disc
      spaces, there was a decrease in the likelihood of moderate-to-severe adjacent-level
      ossification. The design of the MaxAn Anterior Cervical Plate and accompanying technique
      allows this type of plate placement; therefore we will be looking at the radiographic
      outcomes of these subjects and comparing them to the retrospective chart review conducted by
      Dr. Park using the MaxAn Technique allows you to achieve plate placement of 5mm from the
      supraadjacent level which will help minimize the risk of adjacent level ossification.
