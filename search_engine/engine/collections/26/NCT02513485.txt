      dopamine and the development of depression. Biomarkers of inflammation, such as inflammatory
      cytokines and acute-phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated in a
      significant proportion of patients with mood and psychiatric disorders. The investigators
      will study if administration of Levodopa (L- 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine [DOPA]-carbidopa,
      250/25mg) to depressed patients with high inflammation will 1) increase corticostriatal
      functional connectivity, and 2) improve objective measures of motivation compared to placebo.
