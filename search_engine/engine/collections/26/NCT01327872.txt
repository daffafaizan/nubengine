      parallel-group study. The PK and PK/PD relationship of AKR-501 will also be studied.
      Approximately 65 eligible patients will be randomized in a 3:3:3:3:1 ratio in a
      double-blinded fashion into one of five parallel treatment groups to receive daily doses of
      either AKR-501 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg or placebo for 28 days, respectively. Each AKR-501 dosing
      group will consist of 15 patients while the placebo group will consist of 5 patients. All
      study patients will be evaluated weekly (Days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28) for safety, efficacy,
      and (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28) AKR-501 pharmacokinetics while receiving study treatment with a
      final assessment for safety and effectiveness to be done 2 weeks after the last study dose
      (Day 42).
