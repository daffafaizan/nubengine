      patients (N=15) presenting CP. Candida spp count and salivary and gingival crevicular fluid
      concentrations of histatin, lactoferrin, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis
      factor-α will be determined at baseline, 30 and 90 days after the periodontal treatment. In
      order to minimize the influence of the immunosuppressive condition, patients have to present
      CD4 T lymphocytes < 200cel/mm3 blood count, non-detectable viral load and the same protocol
      of antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, investigators intend to determine the
      immunophenotypic profile of the gingival tissue through immunohistochemical analysis. This
      study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão
      Preto (CAAE: 50004415.1.0000.5419), and all patients need to provide written informed
      consent.
