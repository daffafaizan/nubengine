      myelodysplastic syndromes. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these
      patients. III. Assess the rate of progression to acute myeloid leukemia and overall survival
      in these patients treated with this regimen. IV. Evaluate the relationship between response
      status and cytogenetics, FAB class, ras mutations, and the presence of nonclonal
      hematopoiesis with this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Assess the effect of this
      treatment regimen on the number of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in these
      patients. VI. Evaluate neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis in these patients before and after
      this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive amifostine IV over 1-3 minutes on days 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22,
      24, and 26 plus azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4
      courses. Patients who achieve complete remission receive an additional 3 courses, and
      patients who achieve hematologic improvement or partial remission continue treatment until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-32 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 2 years.
