    
      This is a multi-site, randomized, controlled, parallel, dietary intervention food study
      designed to examine the impact of pulse-enriched foods on cognitive function and
      cardiometabolic health in obese adults. Recruitment will consist of approximately 160
      participants (n= 80 participants per site) at 2 sites located in Winnipeg and South
      Australia.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of 2 groups; a pulse group or a control group.
      The pulse group will consume pulse-enriched foods designed to deliver Â½ cup of pulses per day
      for 12 weeks. The control group will consume comparator foods for 12 weeks. The pulse and
      comparator food items will be provided to participants and they will be asked to incorporate
      these into their usual diet. Participants will be requested not to change their diet or
      physical activity habits during the study period, other than as required to comply with the
      study requirements. Five-day weighed food records will be completed during the week prior to
      baseline and during the final week of the study to monitor dietary intake, in particular
      intake of pulses. This will determine whether participants are incorporating the study foods
      as required, and will be used to evaluate associated changes in dietary intake and body
      weight, if they occur.
