      initial phase study part I (2003-2006) we will study over three years in 75 kindergartens of
      four administrative districts in Bavaria, Germany: Bamberg, GÃ¼nzburg, Ingolstadt and
      Schwandorf.

      The objective of the study part II is to evaluate the effects of the TigerKids intervention
      program on overweight prevalence in childhood. Data concerning BMI, nutrition behavior and
      physical activity are assessed both at baseline (September/October 2007) and after 10 months
      intervention in > 450 control- and intervention-kindergartens in Bavaria.
