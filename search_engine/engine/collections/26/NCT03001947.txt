      and developing a IgAN database in China. Patients' demographic characteristics (including
      age, gender, height, weight, BMI, smoking, drinking, and education), clinical characteristics
      (including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, primary cause of ESRD, and lab
      measurements of serum and urine), complications, drug information at the baseline will be
      collected. Patients will be follow-up every one year, the demographic and clinical
      characteristics, complications and drug information of patients will be collected at each
      visit. The investigators also record the clinical events at each visit, such as mortality
      (including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality), ESRD (defined as
      initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation) and hospitalization for any cause.
      All-cause and cardiovascular mortality and a composite renal outcome of doubling of serum
      creatinine and ESRD for IgAN patients will be compared using the IgAN database.
