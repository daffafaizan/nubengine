    
      A single application of electroacupuncture improves balance greater than placebo control in
      subjects with chronic functional ankle instability

      Specific Aim #1:

      Evaluate the effect of a single application of electroacupuncture on center of pressure mean
      total velocity in individuals with chronic functional ankle instability during single-leg
      stance compared to placebo control.

      H0: EA will not improve postural sway during single-leg stance compared to placebo control.

      Specific Aim #2:

      Describe the effects of a single application of EA compared to placebo on mean total
      displacement, as well as the mediolateral and anterioposterior components during single-leg
      stance for possible trends to inform hypothesis generation.

      Specific Aim #3:

      Correlate the results from the Star Excursion Balance Test with results of the single-leg
      stance measures to inform hypothesis generation.
