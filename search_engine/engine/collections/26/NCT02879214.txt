      cervical cancer. While there are several acceptable means to boost the disease in the low
      pelvis (i.e. brachytherapy, IMRT, or external beam), there is limited research into minimal
      invasive surgical resection after maximal downstage. This protocol is designed to determine
      the dose escalation of both chemo and radiation for treating tumor bearing regions within the
      abdomen and pelvis, using an two drug chemotherapy in first cycle of mitomycin/cisplatin or
      taxol/cisplatin along with simultaneously integrated boost technique to Biological target
      area defined by PET scan. This dose escalation is to downstage disease for minimal invasive
      surgical resection.
