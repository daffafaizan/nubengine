    
      CIDUS III/DUIT is a five-city (Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle)
      randomized controlled trial to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a six-session behavioral
      intervention for HIV and HCV uninfected injection drug users between the ages of 15 and 30
      years. The primary goals of the intervention are to:

        1. decrease the shared use of syringes and other injection paraphernalia,

        2. decrease sexual risk behaviors associated with HIV and HCV infection, and

        3. decrease the incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

      The intervention arm consists of six small-group training and skills-building sessions to
      teach and reinforce peer education activities around decreasing sex and injection risk
      behaviors for HIV and HCV infection. In the fifth session, participants practice peer
      education around sex or injection risk behaviors within their community. The control arm
      consists of six video and discussion sessions to control for attention. Prior to study
      enrollment, all participants in both arms receive HIV and HCV testing with client-centered
      pre- and post-test counseling to also control for the demand for risk reduction information.
      Behavioral assessments (by audio computer assisted self interviewing) and blood draws (for
      serologic testing) occur at baseline, 3 and 6 month follow-up. 3285 participants completed
      the baseline visit, of whom 1564 tested HIV and HCV seronegative and returned for test
      results making them eligible to enroll in the intervention trial. Of the eligible
      participants, 854 were randomized into the trial. 606 and 591 returned for 3 and 6 month
      follow-up assessments, respectively, and 712 participants completed at least one follow-up
      visit.
