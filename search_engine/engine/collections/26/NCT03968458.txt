      exercise 90 minutes or 30 minutes before an ad libitum buffet meal in adolescents with
      obesity. 18 adolescents with obesity will be asked to randomly complete three experimental
      sessions: i) one control session (rest); ii) one session with an acute exercise realized 90
      minutes before lunch; iii) one session with the same exercise performed 30 minutes before
      lunch. Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed during lunch as well as at dinner
      time. Appetite feelings will be assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in
      response to the lunch will also be assessed.
