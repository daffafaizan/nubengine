      To collect and evaluate long-term clinical outcomes of HIV infected participants previously
      enrolled in HIV-NAT trials.

      Secondary Objective:

      To Assess:

        1. Long-term consequences of initiation of antiretroviral as predicted by baseline CD4 cell
           count and/or baseline plasma HIV RNA level

        2. Incidence of lipodystrophy and other metabolic complications in three different groups
           of patients initially treated with NRTI-based regimens, NNRTI-based regimens, or
           PI-based regimens

        3. Class-specific incidence of lipodystrophy and metabolic complications such as d4T versus
           AZT, nevirapine versus efavirenz and individual PIs (IDV, SQV, Kaletra, and atazanavir)

        4. Resistance profiles in patients on different antiretroviral regimens

        5. Long-term consequences of antiretroviral agents on cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and
           endocrine function, skin, gastrointestinal system and urogentital tract

        6. Incidence of opportunistic infections or malignancy including hepatocarcinoma in
           patients with HIV/HCV or HIV/HBV co-infection

        7. Immune recovery syndrome

        8. Adherence to different antiretroviral regimens

        9. Quality of life
