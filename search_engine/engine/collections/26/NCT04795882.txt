    
      This is a Phase 1 rolling 6 trial design evaluating safety of a novel BCMA CAR alone and of
      CAR T cells engineered to co-express BCMA CAR and a CD19 CAR in patients with triple
      refractory Multiple Myeloma.

      Cohort 1 assesses BCMA CAR at 150 and 450x10^6 cells. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      cohort 1 will then determine starting dose of combined BCMA/CD19 CAR in cohort 2. For cohorts
      1 & 2, a dose can only be deemed tolerable if 0/3 or â‰¤1/6 patients experience a Dose Limiting
      Toxicity (DLT).

      A Summary of dosing on trial is outlined below:

      Cohort 1 (BCMA CAR-T cells)

        -  Dose level 1: 150x10^6 BCMA CAR-T cells

        -  Dose level 2: 450x10^6 BCMA CAR-T cells

      Cohort 2 (BCMA/CD19 CAR-T cells)

        -  Dose level 1: 75x10^6 BCMA&CAT19 CAR-T cells

        -  Dose level 2: 150x10^6 BCMA&CAT19 CAR-T cells

        -  Dose level 3: 450x10^6 BCMA&CAT19 CAR-T cells
