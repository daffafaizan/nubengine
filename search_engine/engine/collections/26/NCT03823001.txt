      urologist visits, interval PSA checks, and annual DRE to help establish a non-invasive method
      for 1) participants with a negative prostate MRI (PI-RADS 1 or 2) who have never had a
      biopsy; 2) participants with a positive MRI (PI-RADS score of 3, 4, or 5) and negative
      MRI-targeted biopsy pathology; and 3) monitoring participants with clinically diagnosed low
      risk prostate cancer who are on active surveillance. However, if at any point, clinical
      suspicion indicated either by the presence of suspicious lesions on the MRI, rising PSA,
      and/or positive DRE arises, then an immediate biopsy will be performed.
