      from physicians conducting clinically-indicated vascular, gastrointestinal (GI), urology and
      pain management procedures for engineering use, as deemed appropriate by the Sponsor, for the
      investigational OEC Elite Mobile Fluoroscopy System (OEC Elite) in the vascular
      configuration. Clinical procedures included in this study will involve three (3) anatomical
      regions of interest - extremities and neck, thorax, and abdomen and pelvis. These regions are
      being targeted because they represent the range of clinical applications and anatomical
      regions intended for OEC Elite in the vascular configuration.
