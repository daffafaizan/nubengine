      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) in patients with metastatic or
      unresectable solid tumors or lymphomas.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

      IV. Determine the recommended phase II dose of this drug for future studies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) IV over 1-6
      hours on days 1-3 or 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-2 patients receive accelerated escalating doses of
      17-DMAG until at least 1 of 2 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Cohorts are
      then expanded to 3-6 patients who receive escalating doses (in a standard manner) of 17-DMAG
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.
