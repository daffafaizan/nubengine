      disease is well established. It is well known that Drug Eluting Stent (DES) have dramatically
      decreased Restenosis rates for both on-label and off-label indications. However, the concern
      for increased (late) stent thrombosis is still present DES implantation in patient with acute
      myocardial infarction is still controversial because acute coronary lesion presents the
      highest possible thrombotic burden Newer DES with new antiproliferative drugs and more
      biocompatible polymers have shown a significant reduction of (late) stent thrombosis in
      patients in stable condition.

      Aim of the study was to asses the long term efficacy and safety on second generation
      everolimus eluting stent compared with first generation sirolimus eluting stent
