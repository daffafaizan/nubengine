      Rhopressa effectively lowers intra-ocular pressure by improving conventional outflow and
      decreasing episcleral venous pressure. While this may result in improved episcleral venous
      flow, current methods to quantify episcleral blood flow in vivo are rudimentary and unable to
      accurately and precisely determine flow. Proof that Rhopressa effectively increases
      episcleral venous flow would differentiate it from other medications. Furthermore, this
      evidence could galvanize interest in the use of Rhopressa after popular Minimally Invasive
      Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) procedures. In future studies, MIGS procedures could be used to
      improve the proximal outflow pathway, and Rhopressa to enhance distal outflow.

      Purpose/Aim:

      We have developed a technology to accurately and precisely determine episcleral and retinal
      blood flow in human subjects using ICG labeled erythrocytes via a technique we have coined as
      Erythrocyte Mediated Angiography (EMA). We propose conducting a pilot study to show the
      effect of Rhopressa on both improving episcleral blood flow as well as studying its effect on
      retinal blood flow. With lower intraocular pressure, and correspondingly higher ocular
      perfusion pressure, Rhopressa may also improve retinal blood flow.

      Specific Aim:

      To determine the effect of Rhopressa on episcleral venous outflow and retinal blood flow in a
      cohort of treatment-na√Øve ocular hypertensive and glaucoma suspect patients.

      Hypothesis:

      Rhopressa increases episcleral venous flow and retinal blood flow from baseline at both 1
      hour and 1 week after initiation of therapy.

      To test this hypothesis, we will measure and compare episcleral venous and retinal blood flow
      at baseline, 1 hour after Rhopressa instillation and 1 week after initiation of Rhopressa.
