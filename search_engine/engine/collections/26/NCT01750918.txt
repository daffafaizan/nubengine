    
      This is an open-label, four-part Phase I/II study to investigate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of trametinib (GSK1120212) and
      dabrafenib (GSK2118436) when administered in combination with the anti-EGFR antibody
      panitumumab in subjects with BRAF-mutation V600E positive colorectal cancer (CRC) and in
      subjects with CRC with secondary resistance to prior anti-EGFR therapy. Part 1 of the study
      will consist of dose-escalation cohorts, following a 3 + 3 enrollment scheme. Part 2 of the
      study will consist of expansion cohorts to investigate safety and clinical activity of
      dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and trametinib plus dabrafenib in combination with
      panitumumab. Part 3 of the study will be a randomized Phase II study comparing dosing with
      dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and trametinib plus dabrafenib in combination with
      panitumumab as compared to the chemotherapy comparator (a regimen of FOLFOX, FOLFIRI or
      irinotecan with or without panitumumab or bevacizumab). Subjects will be assigned to
      treatment groups in a randomized fashion to compare safety and clinical activity. Part 4 of
      the study will investigate the trametinib/panitumumab combination, including dose escalation
      and subsequent cohort expansion in two patient populations: 1) BRAF-mutation V600E positive
      CRC and 2) subjects with CRC who developed secondary resistance to prior anti-EGFR therapy.
      The objective of Part 4 is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose/regimen for trametinib
      dosed in combination with panitumumab in dose escalation and to identify an initial signal of
      clinical activity in expansion cohorts.
