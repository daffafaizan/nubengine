      futility. An independent Data Monitoring Committee found that even if the trial had been
      allowed to continue, treatment with single agent sunitinib would be unable to demonstrate a
      statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival
      compared with single agent capecitabine in the study population. Pfizer notified clinical
      trial investigators involved in the study and regulatory agencies of these findings on
      25Mar2009. Patients receiving sunitinib will be allowed to receive capecitabine or enter an
      extension trial if they are receiving clinical benefit from continued sunitinib therapy.
      There were no safety concerns leading to the decision to terminate the study.
