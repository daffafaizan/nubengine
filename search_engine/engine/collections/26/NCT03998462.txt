      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for Parkinson's disease; MBSR-PD or 2) Creative Education
      Care (CEC). Study visits may be held remotely, via online video format (Webex). Interventions
      are held within a group format consisting of approximately 6-10 individuals with PD. Groups
      will meet once per week for over a 9-week period. All participants will be administered a
      battery of neuropsychological tests to measure HRQoL, cognition (e.g., executive function,
      attention, memory), and mood (i.e., anxiety, depression, and apathy), as well as motor
      symptoms, disease severity, and mindfulness engagement/practice. Tests will be administered
      at baseline, 9 weeks (post-treatment), and 6- and 12-months (follow-up assessments) by an
      examiner blinded to group assignment.
