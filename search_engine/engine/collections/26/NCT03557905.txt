           recruitment maneuver; adequate monitoring at the bedside is essential. Several methods
           have been proposed, including measuring end-expiratory lung volume or pulmonary
           compliance, volumetric capnography, oxygenation indices, electrical impedance
           tomography, computerized tomography and lung ultrasound.

        -  For lung CT examination patients must be transported out to the radiation unit, which
           carries risk of transfer, high cost, and radiation exposure. The oxygenation method
           which is the most commonly used, but it is necessary to repeat arterial blood collection
           many times, which is cumbersome and expensive.

        -  Using lung ultrasound (LUS) as real-time guidance during the recruitment maneuver has
           gained popularity recently owing to its' easy applicability and non-invasive nature.
           Sonography is a radiation-free methodology which plays an important role in diagnosing
           pulmonary diseases in children, including obstructive and compressive atelectasis of
           different origins. Furthermore, lung ultrasound has shown reliable sensitivity and
           specificity for the diagnosis of anaesthesia-induced atelectasis in children.

        -  LUS can identify children needing a recruitment maneuver to re-expand their lungs and
           help optimize ventilator treatment during anesthesia.
