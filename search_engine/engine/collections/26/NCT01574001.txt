      and stroke recurrence within a few years after the first stroke. Searching for more efficient
      methods of antismoking interventions is therefore justified.

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of
      three anti-smoking interventions of different intensities.

      DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.

      METHODS: Study participants will be recruited among patients of neurological clinics of
      Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, hospitalized because of their first in a lifetime
      ischemic stroke. All stroke patients will be screened regarding their smoking status. The
      subjects will be patients smoking cigarettes immediately before their first-ever stroke, able
      to understand the research protocol procedures and able to cooperate during the
      investigation.

      Antismoking interventions will be based on the "5A's" method. Study participants will be
      randomized to one of three interventions differing in follow-up intensity.
