      this pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is to examine the effects of 6 months of
      home-/community-based exercise, prescribed according to the SCI exercise guidelines, on
      chronic bodily pain experienced by adults with SCI. Secondary aims are to test for 1)
      differential effects on musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain; 2) changes in inflammation and
      inhibitory control as pathways by which exercise reduces pain; 3) effects of chronic pain
      reductions on subjective well-being; and 4) economic benefits of the intervention.

      TRIAL MANAGEMENT. The experienced team of researchers has SCI-specific expertise in exercise
      psychology and physiology, pain and physiatry as well as health sciences expertise in
      immunology, biostatistics, health economics, and pragmatic RCT design and management. The
      team includes knowledge users representing local, provincial and national organizations, and
      a collaborator with lived experience of SCI.

      SIGNIFICANCE. The investigators' novel idea is that home-/community-based exercise performed
      according to the SCI exercise guidelines can be an effective behavioural strategy for
      reducing chronic pain in adults with SCI. Critically, this will be the first SCI exercise RCT
      to use chronic bodily pain as the primary outcome and to assess potential pathways by which
      exercise may alleviate pain. Furthermore, this will be the first pragmatic RCT of exercise as
      a behavioural pain management strategy conducted among adults with SCI. Importantly, our
      community-engaged, iKT approach will ensure rapid translation and dissemination of findings
      to Canadian and international end-users including clinicians, fitness programmers, people
      living with SCI and the community organizations that support them.
