      12-week open label treatment period with modafinil that is followed by a 12-week
      double-blind, randomized parallel treatment period with either modafinil or matching placebo.
      Patients who demonstrate at least minimal improvement after 12 weeks are randomly assigned to
      either continuing treatment at their current dose or switched to matching placebo for 12
      weeks.
