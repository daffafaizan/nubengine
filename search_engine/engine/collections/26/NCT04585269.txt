    
      Bright IDEAS-YA is a personalized approach to increase problem-solving ability by fostering
      positive appraisal of problems as solvable challenges that can be overcome and enhancing
      rational problem-solving skills to systematically work through any problem. Bright IDEAS-YA
      intervention consists of six 45-minute one-on-one sessions with a trainer who teaches the
      participant the Bright IDEAS stepwise approach to problem-solving and guides the participant
      through solving their own problems using the Bright IDEAS approach.

      Up to 344 young adult patients newly diagnosed with cancer will be recruited to participate
      in this multi-site randomized controlled trial, where the Bright IDEAS-YA intervention will
      be compared with enhanced usual psychosocial care. Efficacy will be evaluated by examining
      changes in psychosocial outcomes from baseline to post-intervention (3 months) and follow-up
      (6 and 12 months). The extent to which changes in aspects of problem-solving ability mediate
      the intervention effects will be examined.
