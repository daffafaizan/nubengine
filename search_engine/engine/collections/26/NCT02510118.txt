      there are few randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate comprehensive Traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions in colon cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the synergistic anti-tumor effect of ChangTai Keli based on chemotherapy for colon cancer
      patients. This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the synergistic anti-tumor effect of TCM on colon cancer patients. Following a
      run-in period, approximately 360 subjects will be randomly assigned to conventional
      chemotherapy treatment group, ChangTai Keli and conventional chemotherapy treatment group for
      26 weeks. After the 26 weeks treatment period, subjects in two treatments arms will follow-up
      36 months.
