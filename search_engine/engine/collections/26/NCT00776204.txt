      generation drug-eluting stents (DES). Delayed healing and poor endothelialization are common
      findings in vessels treated with DES and are probably related to the amount of drug and
      polymer applied to a DES. There is evidence to suggest that polymer applications may
      influence the processes of inflammation and vessel healing. The JACTAX family of DES have
      been designed to provide a maximum amount of drug delivered directly to coronary vessel
      tissue while excluding polymer and drug from contact within the vessel lumen. The JACTAX
      stents are comprised of a currently marketed bare metal stent (Libertè™) coated exclusively
      on the ablumenal stent surface with a carrier containing a bioerodable polymer, Polylactide
      and paclitaxel. The objective of this prospective study is to measure the completeness of
      strut coverage and vessel wall response (strut malapposition, neointima disomogeneities in
      texture) to the JACTAX stents vs Taxus Libertè in de novo coronary artery lesions at 6 months
      post index procedure. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) that detects smaller degrees of
      stent strut coverage more accurately than IVUS will be used at 6 months follow-up.
      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will be performed as per normal practice at any index
      procedures and at 6 months follow-up.
