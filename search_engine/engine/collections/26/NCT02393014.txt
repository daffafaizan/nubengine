    
      Having developed many tools to determine fall risk of 65 years and older patients, Angers
      University Hospital plans to develop a corrective action to prevent the occurrence of falls
      in this population.

      This study aims to assess the feasibility of a physical activity program with 3 difficulty
      levels (depending on the patient's risk of falling): easy (low fall risk), moderate (average
      fall risk) and difficult (high fall risk).

      The implementation process should be simply and fastly applicable in practice for routine
      care by paramedics.
