      through the path of a cutaneous nerve - branches of the saphenous nerve. Historically, no
      effort has been made to separate these branches and bury them away from the surgical scar. It
      has been noted that some patients develop a painful neuroma, that once resected results in a
      pain free knee. Investigators are trying to study if identification, ligation, and proper
      burial of the nerve can prevent the development of neuralgia compared to the typical surgical
      approach which ignores the nerve branches completely.
