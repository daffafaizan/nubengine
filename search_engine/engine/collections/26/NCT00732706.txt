      (anterior branch) causes an equivalent block to the classical method with stimulation of the
      quadriceps femoris muscle (posterior branch), for femoral nerve blockade. To test this
      hypothesis, we plan to conduct a randomised controlled double-blind study comparing success
      of femoral never block (motor and sensory) using sartorius twitch versus quadriceps femoris
      twitch as an end point.

      We will also evaluate the local anesthetic distribution under the facia iliaca sheath using
      ultrasound imaging.

      Methods: Following institutional ethical approval and obtaining written informed consent, we
      plan to recruit 60 patients aged 18-80, ASA I-III scheduled to undergo unilateral total knee
      arthroplastly in this prospective, randomised, double blinded controlled trial.
