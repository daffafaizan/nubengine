      of post-operative pain, the quality of life (QOL), as well as return to normal activities
      (work) for the two procedures. Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) and Visual Analogue Score (VAS)
      assessments will be held at regular intervals to evaluate these objectives.

      The secondary objective of the study is to identify any short-term study related
      complications/adverse events.

      The follow up will be immediately post-operative, post-operative day 1, and 1, 2,and 4 weeks.
      The first and 4th week's visits are mandatory office visits (if possible). If not available
      for office visit, a CCS assessment will be mailed or will be conducted via phone.

      Up to 50 patients may be enrolled for this study (25 per arm). A report may be generated for
      presentation at an international meeting such as the AHS, EHS, or APHS if decided by the lead
      investigator.
