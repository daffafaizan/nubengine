        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination
           with conventional chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
           leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate the likelihood of leukemic blast cells to undergo apoptosis in vitro with the
           efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate drug resistance as manifested by dye efflux or multiple drug resistance-1
           expression by leukemic blast cells with the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Patients are
      assigned by cohort to 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

        -  Regimen A: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 1-4,
           mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour on days 3-6, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on
           day 7.

        -  Regimen B: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 2, 8,
           and 9, asparaginase intramuscularly on days 2 and 9, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2
           hours on day 3.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive de-escalating doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose below that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
