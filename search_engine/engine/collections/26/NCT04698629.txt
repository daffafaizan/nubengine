    
      Single-arm, prospective observational study of 40 adult persons who inject drugs (PWID) who
      screen positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) with a reactive antibody test at community sites
      who are offered facilitated linkage to community-pharmacy program through patient navigators.
      Individuals who are eligible and enroll will complete a baseline survey to assess
      sociodemographics, substance use, HIV risk behaviors, and awareness of and interest in HCV
      treatment. After the survey, the participants will be linked to the community-pharmacy
      program, via the patient navigator, where treatment for HCV and opioid use disorder (OUD), as
      well as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), Naloxone and vaccinations, will be offered to
      participants.

      After 6 months, participants will complete a follow-up survey, which will include questions
      on: whether an evaluation for HCV occurred at the community pharmacy, whether HCV treatment
      was initiated since baseline visit, substance use, HIV risk behaviors, receipt of medications
      to treat HCV, opioid use disorder, Naloxone and PrEP receipt, medication adherence, and
      injecting network.
