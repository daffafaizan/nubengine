      suffer from specific problems that interrupt the rehabilitation period in their subacute
      phase.

      Various modes of treatment available as part of the physical rehabilitation but there is not
      enough data in the literature regarding the contribution of cycling training with leg cycle
      ergometer as part of conventional physiotherapy treatment in elderly patients after hip
      fracture surgery.

      This study evaluates whether the additional cycling to physiotherapy treatment will improve
      the functional ability, the balance performance while standing, hip muscle strength and pain
      level in those patients.
