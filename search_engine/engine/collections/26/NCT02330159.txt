      Aim 1: To evaluate wound healing at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively
      in a prospective MatriStem Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix cohort

      Aim 2: To evaluate pilonidal recurrence, reoperation rates, healthcare utilization, and
      quality of life at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively in a prospective
      MatriStem Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix cohort

      The investigators main hypothesis is that using MatriStem Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix for
      postoperative wound care will significantly improve healing rates, healthcare utilization,
      and quality of life outcomes. The null hypothesis of the study is that there is no
      significant difference in healing rates, healthcare utilization, and quality of life outcomes
      between MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix and negative pressure dressing cohorts. The
      alternative hypothesis is that there are differences in healing rates, healthcare
      utilization, and quality of life outcomes between MatriStem Wound Matrix/ MicroMatrix and
      negative pressure dressing cohorts.

      Twenty consecutive patients undergoing surgical excision for Pilonidal Disease will be
      recruited for treatment. All patients will undergo comparable surgical excision and
      application of the novel protocol. The wound will be left undisturbed for 10-14 days (until
      the 1st follow-up visit). At the 1st scheduled postoperative visit, the wound will reassessed
      in the operative suite, and a second application of the protocol may be performed at the
      surgeon's discretion. The next follow-up visits will be at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.
      At these visits, the wound bed will be measured, photo documentation will be captured, and
      patients will complete a survey to assess quality of life.

      Study Endpoints are:

        1. Wound healing at 6 months. Success is defined at a 60% healing rate of epithelialization
           and wound contracture by volume measurements in centimeters.

        2. Observation of quality of life, total costs for treatment, recurrence and reoperation
           rates at 6 months
