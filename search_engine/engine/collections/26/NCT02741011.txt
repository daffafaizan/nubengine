      help of the technological development of radiological devices. However, medical procedures
      like dental treatment and medical imaging (magnetic resonance imaging-MRI, computed
      tomography-CT, orthopantomography- OPG, etc.) that require cooperation are usually hard to
      apply to mentally handicapped (MHP) or uncooperative patients (UCP). Treatments that will be
      done without radiological examination can be missing or incorrect.
