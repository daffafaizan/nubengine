      hours) to consider their participation in this study, the investigators will ask them to sign
      a consent form, which shows their willingness to take part. The investigators will then
      collect information from their medical records about their hospital admission with COVID-19,
      including their age, ethnicity, medical conditions, length of hospital stay, tablets or any
      other treatments they received, as well as details of their stay in the intensive care unit.

      For the two groups - COVID AKI and COVID non-AKI, telephone follow-up with a study
      questionnaire will be performed at recruitment, 6-9 months and 12-15 months after hospital
      discharge. The study questionnaire will include the following:

        1. Details of any medical event and date of medical event since last study follow-up.

        2. Details of any hospital re-admission.

        3. Details of current medication.

      In addition, at the same time points, participants will be asked to attend their general
      practitioner surgery or other clinic to have simple clinical measurements (height, weight and
      blood pressure), blood and urine tests.
