      neuronal injury cauesd by and indirectly by surgical trauma. Progesterone can decreas
      vasogenic brain oedema. Our primary outcome is to ameliorate microscopic cytoplasmic injury
      and decrease brain oedema exploited by biopsy from brain tumor interface. Exclusion criteria
      demonstratd as refusal to participate in the trial , emergency craniotomy, recurrent brain
      tumor.
