      compare the effect of Biguard bifurcation stent system and regular stent system in patients
      with bifurcation lesions. Based on the previous studies, the rate of 1-year target lesion
      failure was around 12% after PCI with regular stent system. And the investigators previous
      data showed that this event at 12-month after Biguard bifurcation stent system was 4%.
      Considering the lost to follow-up, it is anticipated that up to 400 patients will be enrolled
      in the trial. All patients will have repeat angiography at 13 months, with clinical follow-up
      to 2 years.
