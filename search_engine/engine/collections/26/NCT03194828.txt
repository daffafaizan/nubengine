      understanding of this behavior remains limited due to biased measures of medication use. The
      Kali Drop device is a potential improvement in our ability to capture medication use in
      patients using dropper bottles by precisely capturing the amount dispensed in real-time.
      Moreover, such technology creates data that can be leveraged into driving behavior change
      using connected mobile technology in order to improve adherence and, ultimately, health
      outcomes. While evidence suggests that reminders may improve adherence to glaucoma
      medications, the power of doing so using real-time data has yet to be explored. This study
      will compare simple monitoring of patients to those who are being monitored and who receive
      reminder messages when the system determines one is necessary due to a missed dose.
