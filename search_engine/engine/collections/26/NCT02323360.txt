      nodules no more 3 cm in diameter after incomplete TAE or TACE, are randomized to stereotactic
      radiotherapy in 3 or 6 daily fractions or to a new cycle of TAE or TACE. A total of 80
      patients (40 in each arm) will be recruited into the trial over a 2 years period and will be
      randomised on an equal basis to either SBRT or TAE/TACE. The follow-up period will be
      finished 1.5 years after the final patient is randomised.
