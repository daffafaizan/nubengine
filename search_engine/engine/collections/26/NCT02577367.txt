      Levothyroxine dosage change in hypothyroid patients after the starting of enteral feeding in
      an inpatient setting in two different groups: a control group where Levothyroxine will be
      administered with continuous enteral nutrition, and an intervention group where enteral
      nutrition will be held for two hours before and two hours after the Levothyroxine
      administration.

      The enrollment of eligible patients will be over two to three years and follow up will
      continue for the duration of the hospital stay or 12 weeks, which ever occurs earlier.
      Eligible patients will have thyroid function tests at enrollment (within three days of the
      starting of the tube feeding) and afterwards weekly. Levothyroxine dosage will be adjusted by
      the endocrinology research team according to the thyroid function results. Initial
      Levothyroxine dosage and subsequent dosages will be recorded and the mean percentage decrease
      or increase of Levothyroxine dosage required will be measured in each group. An eventual
      difference between the two groups mean percentage change will be tested for statistical
      significance.
