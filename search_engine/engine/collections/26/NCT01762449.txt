      Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS). An attempt will be made to include all of the participants of
      the Scleroderma Lung Study, who were reported as alive at the end of that study.

      A total of 158 subjects (79 per treatment arm) were randomized on the original Scleroderma
      Lung Study. Of those, 109 subjects completed the study. A single telephone interview with the
      participants to assess the occurrence of severe events and a review of the participant's
      medical records may be conducted. The outcome information will be combined with information
      collected about all participants in the SLS study. The data being collected includes
      information on mortality, development of cancers, development of organ failure, and
      performance status.
