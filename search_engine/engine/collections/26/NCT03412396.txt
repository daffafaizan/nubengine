      I. To determine whether 6 months (24 weeks) of neoadjuvant apalutamide prior to prostatectomy
      for intermediate risk prostate cancer results in a reduction of aggregate pathologic risk
      features that drive post-operative radiotherapy recommendations from 35% to 15%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of 6 months (24 weeks) neoadjuvant apalutamide
      followed by radical prostatectomy for intermediate risk prostate cancer.

      II. To estimate the frequency of clinical complete responses and "near" complete responses
      (currently defined as < 6 mm total tumor volume).

      III. To characterize the molecular features of the treated prostate cancers and link them to
      morphologic characterization.

      IV. To measure the 3-5 year biochemical recurrence rate of treated patients as a baseline to
      inform a larger phase III trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) daily for 24 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2 weeks of completing apalutamide, patients
      undergo radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months.
