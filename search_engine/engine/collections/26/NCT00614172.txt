      cancer following lumpectomy. Post-lumpectomy radiotherapy is a proven treatment that reduces
      cancer recurrence in the breast and improves survival. When standard whole breast radiation
      techniques are utilized, portions of the chest wall, lung and heart may also receive
      significant doses of radiation which can lead to radiation induced complications. Radiation
      techniques that limit the treatment area to the portion of the breast where the cancer arose
      can minimize and even eliminate radiation dose to the chest wall, heart and lung. This is
      called partial breast radiotherapy. This study is designed to evaluate the use of proton beam
      radiotherapy to deliver partial breast radiotherapy in women with early stage breast cancer.
