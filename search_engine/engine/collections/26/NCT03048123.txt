    
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of
      TACE for patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B. Our previous
      prospective study also revealed similar results of large HCC patients treated with TACE.
      Recently, the results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that, compared with TACE,
      hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve tumor response for HCC with large
      HCC.

      Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective nonrandomized control to demonstrate the
      superiority of HAIC over TACE.
