      CART-19 immunotherapy for Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL),
      and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) as part of UPCC #13413. Subjects underwent two FDG-PET/CTs.
      One performed within 6 weeks of CART-19 infusion and a repeat scan at about 1 month after
      infusion.
