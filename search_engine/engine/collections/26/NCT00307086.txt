      diagnosed or previously treated will receive 2-cycles of standard dose bortezomib followed by
      high-dose melphalan and bortezomib as a conditioning regimen prior to a tandem autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Following treatment with two cycles of
      standard dose bortezomib, sequential cohorts of patients will be given escalating bortezomib
      doses combined with standard and constant conditioning regimen doses of melphalan. Once the
      MTD of bortezomib is reached, that dose will be administered in combination with melphalan as
      conditioning prior to PBSCT.
