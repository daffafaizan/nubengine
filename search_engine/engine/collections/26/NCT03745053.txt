      randomized, open label, 2-arm parallel group, trial in patients undergoing Percutaneous
      Coronary Intervention (PCI) comparing Xlimus DES versus Synergy DES with respect to optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) derived measures at 6-month Follow Up (FU) and clinical events at
      12 months after procedure. A total of 180 patients will be recruited and randomized in the
      two groups in a 2:1 ratio. After index procedure, patients will be followed up by
      angiographic follow-up at 6 months and clinical follow-up at 12 months.The primary endpoint
      will be independently evaluated by the Core-Lab which will be blinded as to group assignment
