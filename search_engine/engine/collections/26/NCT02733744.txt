      to shape one's immune system given its direct contact with normal cells in our intestine.
      Recent studies have suggested that a microbiome with very few bacteria (low diversity) seems
      to be bad for health and a high-diversity microbiome (many different species) appears to be
      good. This appears to be true even for patients after HSCT where low diversity microbiome
      status has correlated with infections, GVHD and overall survival.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is routinely performed for an infection caused by
      Clostridium difficile but is not yet approved by the FDA as a treatment for any disease. FMT
      restores a high diversity microbiome. It is hoped that through FMT, overall outcomes after
      HSCT can potentially be improved.

      FMT will be performed in the first 3 weeks after recovery of white blood cells after HSCT.
      The source of FMT will be from healthy 3rd party donors. FMT will be performed through the
      ingestion of 30 capsules over 2 consecutive days.
