      importance to both researchers and decision makers. Only a limited number of well validated
      instruments that measure Quality of Life in children exists, and in Norway only few has been
      translated into Norwegian. Up to date there are no studies investigating the quality of Life
      in Norwegian child and adolescent psychiatric patients in a longitudinal perspective,
      compared to the normal population.

      Two generic Quality of Life instruments (KINDL, Bullinger & Ravens-Sieberer 2000 and the ILC,
      Matejatt & Remschmidt 1998) are introduced in Norway by this study in addition to the use of
      other well established measures like the "Child behaviour Check List" (Achenbach et al.
      2001), etc.
