      that, SIS fixation has become a common technology in fixing pelvic posterior ring injuries
      with important progress in the past 20 years. Currently, SIS fixation represents the only
      minimally invasive technique to stabilize the posterior pelvic ring. For that reason, it is
      steadily gaining popularity, becoming one of the most commonly used techniques. The sacrum,
      serving as the foundation of the spine, transmits the stress between spine and pelvis through
      sacroiliac joints. Thus, the goal of surgical fixation is the reconstruction of the
      spino-pelvic-junction to allow early weight-bearing and to facilitate nursing care,
      particularly for multiple injured patients.

      As a result of the deforming forces acting perpendicular to the implant axis, routine
      ilio-sacral screws fixation may not provide adequate stabilization, especially in certain
      unstable injuries. Longer trans-sacral screws that traverse the entire upper sacrum and exit
      the contralateral iliac cortex may improve holding power and also stabilize concomitant
      contralateral posterior pelvic injuries. These trans-sacral screws are reliably safe to
      insert using routine intraoperative fluoroscopy, and they provide durable fixation.
