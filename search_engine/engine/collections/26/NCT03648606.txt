      neonatal intensive care unit does not favour sleep. Given that several studies in adults have
      described a 'vegetative preparedness to sleep' (in which distal skin vasodilation before
      lights-out promotes rapid sleep onset), the investigators looked at whether or not this
      process operates in preterm neonates. Sleep propensity was assessed in terms of the duration
      of a spontaneous episode of wakefulness (W). Skin temperatures at six body sites (the
      abdomen, pectoral region, eye, hand, thigh and foot) were measured (using infrared
      thermography) during nocturnal polysomnography in 29 9-day-old preterm neonates
      (postmenstrual age: 209 9 days).
