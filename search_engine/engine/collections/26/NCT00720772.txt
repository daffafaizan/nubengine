      High serum phosphate, the intake of calcium containing phosphate binder as well as dialysis
      vintage have been shown to be associated with the increasing prevalence of CAC. High CAC
      score examined by electron-beam CT scan or multi-slice CT scan associates with an increased
      cardiovascular mortality in ESRD. In series of case reports, intravenous sodium thiosulfate
      (STS) reduced the calcium burden in calcific uremic arteriopathy and soft tissue
      calcification. This was believed to be due to the calcium chelation effect of STS.
