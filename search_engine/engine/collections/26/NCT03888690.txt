      adolescents require multiple invasive procedures that cause pain and discomfort. These are
      paramedical procedures (blood sampling on the peripheral vein, placement of infusions,
      placement of Hubert's needles on an implantable device, ...) and medical procedures (lumbar
      punctures, medullary punctures, ...).

      The short-term (phobia of care) and long-term consequences (memory of pain, behavioral
      disorders, nociceptive sensitization) are clearly reported in the medical literature, and the
      importance of thinking about pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques
      well-established procedural pain prevention.

      The quality of the management of the pain and anxiety induced by these invasive oprocedures
      in pediatric onco-hematology conditions the adhesion to the care and the treatments, and thus
      constitutes a challenge in the care of the patients. The non-pharmacological methods are
      numerous and still insufficiently used by the care teams. Virtual Reality is on interesting
      option.
