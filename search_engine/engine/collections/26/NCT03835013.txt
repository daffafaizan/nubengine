      development for type 2 diabetes with the dual intention of reducing body weight and
      controlling blood glucose. However, there is a lack of data on the effects that co-agonism
      has on haemodynamic regulation. Healthy male participants, by acting as their own control,
      will attend for five intravenous infusion visits as described. These will occur in a
      predefined but random order so that participants will be blinded to the infusion they are
      receiving. Each infusion visit will comprise of 15 minute baseline, then 120 minute infusion
      followed by a 30 minute washout period. Detailed non-invasive cardiovascular measurements
      (including peripheral/central blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, heart rate
      variability) and bloods (including insulin, glucose, GLP-1, glucagon) will be collected as
      part of the study.
