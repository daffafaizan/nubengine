      caudal anesthesia showed siginifiant increase of optic nerve sheath diameter in group of high
      volumes. Increase of ICP can result in harmful effect including reduced cerebral flow and
      oxygen saturation. Also, increase of ICP can cause headache, syncope and transient loss of
      visual acuity. The proven and valid method of measuring ICP indirectly is using optic nerve
      sheath diameter. This study was designed to examine the changes of optic nerve sheath
      diameter and cerebral oxygenation when equal volume of contrast medium or normal saline was
      injected in epidural space.
