      demonstrate that the interval between internation normalized ration (INR) tests can be
      extended from the recommended 4 weeks to 12 weeks for patients with stable INRs. PROBE
      design. Patients receiving warfarin therapy that have exhibited INR stability, defined as no
      change in maintenance dose for at least 6 months, are potentially eligible for enrolment in
      the study. The primary outcome is a composite of major bleeding (ISTH criteria) plus
      objectively verified arterial or venous thromboembolism (excluding superficial
      thrombophlebitis) plus death related to thromboembolism. Justification: the study is not
      reflecting a "trade-off" scenario where one regimen is expected to be more effective at the
      cost of increased harm compared to the other regimen. Conversely, the potential disadvantage
      of the experimental regimen in this trial is increased variability in INR, which may result
      in an increased rate of low as well as high INRs and therefore potentially an increase of
      both types of clinical events.
