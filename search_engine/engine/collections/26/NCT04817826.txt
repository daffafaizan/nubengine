    
      This study will pre-screen approximately 310 patients, in order to enrol a total number of 31
      patients, 18 in Cohort 1 and 13 in Cohort 2, across 25 Italian Centres.

      After central confirmation of MSI-high, dMMR and EBV-negative status, patients with
      resectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer (Siewert II/III), categorized as cTâ‰¥2,
      any cN, M0 or any cT, cN1-3, M0 according to TNM classification 8th edition, will be enrolled
      and they will receive a pre-operative treatment with tremelimumab 300 mg single
      administration (day 1) and durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W for 3 cycles (day 1, 29 and 57).

      All patients will undergo a complete disease restaging with chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scan,
      18-FDG PET/CT, EUS with biopsies and liquid biopsy.

      In Cohort 1, patients will undergo standard gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy between weeks
      15 and 18 from enrolment (at least six weeks after the last treatment administration),
      followed by an active follow-up every 12 weeks for two years and then a standard follow-up
      every six months until the end of the fifth year from surgery. In Cohort 2, patients with no
      evidence of complete clinical response (defined as absence of disease persistence at
      radiological imaging, liquid biopsy and EUS) will be treated as in Cohort 1. Patients with
      complete clinical response will undergo a non-operative management (NOM) and will start an
      active follow-up phase every 12 weeks for two years with chest-abdomen-pelvis CT with
      contrast, 18-FDG PET/TC, if clinically indicated by the Investigator, EUS with multiple
      random biopsies of the tumor site and FNA of clinically suspicious regional nodes and liquid
      biopsy, followed by standard follow-up every six months until the end of the fifth year. At
      any time during follow-up, in case of clinical suspicion or confirmation of residual gastric
      cancer, either at imaging, pathologically at tissue biopsies/cytological specimens or at
      ctDNA in liquid biopsy, the patients will undergo standard surgery according to the clinical
      practice at their Centre (subtotal/total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy).

      Enrolment in Cohort 2 will start only after the completion of enrolment in Cohort 1 and after
      the extensive evaluation of the final results of Cohort 1 regarding to all endpoints
      (including exploratory endpoints) and after potential amendment(s) on study design,
      eligibility criteria and study procedures requested by the Sponsor's Steering Committee and
      an Independent Data Monitoring Committee made of foreign experts, and after the approval of
      the Ethics Committee and the Italian Medicines Agency.
