      labeling of image data, precise positioning, and perfecting the anatomical data of children's
      limb deformities.Improve the positioning accuracy of key points in X-ray images of children's
      limb deformities by means of step-by-step supervision to improve the accuracy of
      diagnosis.Realize an intelligent report generation system that combines patient background
      information, establish an end-to-end auxiliary diagnosis and treatment suggestion
      demonstration application system; realize a full set of artificial intelligence solutions for
      children's skeletal deformities, early screening and diagnosis of children, and forming an
      intelligent referral system of children's limb deformities.
