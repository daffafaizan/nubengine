      anthracycline drugs, such as doxorubicin, are at risk for developing cognitive and cardiac
      impairment. This potential cognitive impairment is refered to as "chemobrain" by some
      patients. We have demonstrated in mice that the drug mesna, which is used to prevent other
      complications of other chemotherapy drugs, prevents certain types of doxorubicin-induced
      damage of blood proteins. Blocking doxorubicin's damage of these blood proteins has blunted
      or prevented the subsequent markers of neurologic and cardiac injury in mice. This clinical
      trial will determine if mesna prevents doxorubicin-induced damage of blood proteins in cancer
      patients, and may establish if blood protein injury is the first step in
      anthracycline-induced cognitive and cardiac dysfunction and if using the drug mesna can blunt
      or prevent these changes in blood markers of injury for patients with cancer.
