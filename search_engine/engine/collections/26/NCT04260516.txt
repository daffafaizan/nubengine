      efficacy as anti oxidant. Patients with thalassemia major are at great risk for oxidative
      stress due to excess of b-globin chains and iron overload. In this study the investigators
      compared the effect of NAC on oxidative status , pretransfusion hemoglobin levels and iron
      overload in thalassemia patients before and after treatment with NAC for 3 months and with
      that of patients who served as controls.
