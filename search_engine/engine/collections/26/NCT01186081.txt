      preoperative chemoradiation have many theoretical advantage compared with postoperative one.
      Preoperative radiotherapy with intensive short course regimen showed significant improvement
      in local control even with TME, but there has been no large prospective randomized trial
      which proved the efficacy of preoperative chemoradiotherapy compared with the standard
      postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Although the final result of the German Trial may give the
      answer for this question, there has been no randomized controlled trial which investigated
      the efficacy of preoperative chemoradiotherapy using oral fluoropyrimidine which have many
      theoretical and clinical advantages mentioned above; the German Trial used 5-day continuous
      infusion of 5-FU. The investigators think that preoperative chemoradiotherapy with oral
      capecitabine could be new standard regimen in locally advanced rectal cancer, but this
      regimen must be compared with the standard postoperative chemoradiotherapy through well
      designed prospective randomized trial. Based on the potential advantaged of preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy and oral fluoropyrimidine, the investigators planned prospective randomized
      phase III trial which compares preoperative chemoradiotherapy and postoperative
      chemoradiotherapy with conventional radiation schedule and oral fluoropyrimidine to establish
      new standard neo-adjuvant therapy regimen in locally advanced rectal cancer.
