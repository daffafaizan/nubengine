      options available to patients with metabolic disorders, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
      In preclinical experiments, HE3286 has shown to have anti-inflammatory activity associated
      with corticosteroids but without the side effects known with corticosteroid use, such as
      immune suppression and bone loss. HE3286 has demonstrated glucose-lowering and
      insulin-enhancing effects in several preclinical mouse and rat models of insulin resistance.
      In these experiments, HE3286 lowered blood glucose levels and prevented progression of
      hyperglycemia and HE3286 appeared to enhance insulin sensitivity.
