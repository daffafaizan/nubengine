    
      This is an open-label, sing-arm phase IV clinical study which will recruit about 20 patients
      in China.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of afatinib in LSQC patients
      with EGFR sensitive mutation, and to explore the clinical factors which might be predictive
      for the effectiveness in LSQC.

      Target patient population:Locally advanced (IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV)
      immunohistochemistry (IHC)-verified Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSQC) with EGFR sensitive
      mutation patients, whom previously untreated or received platinum-based doublet chemotherapy
      as first-line treatment with subsequent disease progression, and had to be eligible for
      second-line treatment.

      Investigational product, the dose and administration method: Afatinib is a member of the
      second generation TKIs, which binds irreversibly to the erbB family of receptors. Afatinib
      will be administrated orally with the starting dose of 40 mg tablets, once per day. If
      patients can't tolerate drug related AEs with 40mg, patients can receive 30mg once per day
      after AEs recovered to Grade 0-1 (CTCAE 5.0).

      Study assessment: The collected data include the patient's demographic characteristics,
      information needed to determine whether the patient is eligible (including medical history,
      attributes of previous and current disease, and EGFR mutation status in tumor tissues),
      efficacy of objective response rate(ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival
      (OS), and safety (including serious adverse events and dose change-induced adverse events).
