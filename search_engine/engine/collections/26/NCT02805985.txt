    
      As detailed by Expanding Orthopedics Inc., the FLXfit™ is an expandable, articulated
      interbody fusion device (IBFD) used in conjunction with supplemental fixation to provide
      structural stability in skeletally mature individuals following total or partial discectomy.

      The FLXfit™ is a unique titanium cage which articulates laterally as well as expands in
      height. This enables larger footprint support as well as restoration of disc height and
      lordotic angle correction. A bullet-nose design facilitates self-distraction and ease of
      insertion. The open architecture of the device allows it to be packed with autogenous bone
      graft.
