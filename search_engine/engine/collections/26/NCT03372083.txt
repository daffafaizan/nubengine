      to assess eligibility of patients that were chelation na√Øve or on a prior iron chelator
      treatment other than DFX. For Patients on DFX treatment prior to study entry only one
      screening visit (screening visit 1) were to occur to determine eligibility. Any current
      chelation therapy except deferasirox were to be discontinued to undergo a 5-day washout
      period prior to commencing a 24 week treatment period with crushed deferasirox FCT.

      All patients were to have weekly visits for the first month to monitor renal function.
      Hepatic function were to be assessed biweekly during the first month. Thereafter, monthly
      safety assessments were to be performed, including the monitoring of serum ferritin values
      and trends in order to adapt patient treatment.

      Eligibility, application of dosing standards and adjustments, as well as safety and serum
      ferritin assessments as specified in the protocol.

      The planned duration of treatment was 24 weeks followed by a 30-day safety follow up.
