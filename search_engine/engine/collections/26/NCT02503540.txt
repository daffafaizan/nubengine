    
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) and macular edema secondary to retinal venous occlusive diseases
      are the most common cause of vision loss from a retinal vascular disease. Recently, vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ranibizumab) have
      been described as new first-line therapies for these conditions. Aflibercept is the most
      recently approved VEGF inhibitor for the management of these conditions. Clinical trials have
      shown that treatment with aflibercept improves visual acuity and reduces macular edema in a
      large percentage of patients.

      This study will examine the changes that occur with intravitreal aflibercept to perfusion and
      leakage in treatment naive eyes over the course of 1 year.
