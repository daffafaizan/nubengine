    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, concurrent control study of subjects with
      acute on chronic hepatitis. Subjects meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will
      be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either standard medical therapy for acute
      liver failure plus the ELAD system, or standard medical therapy alone, with the latter
      defined as conventional therapy for acute on chronic hepatitis determined to be clinically
      appropriate by the treating physician.

      Immediately prior to treatment initiation, subject eligibility will be confirmed. Treatment
      with ELAD will continue for a minimum of 3 days and up to a maximum of 10 days or until
      clinical status improves relative to study entry. Subjects will be followed until 30 days has
      elapsed since study enrollment (control) or 30 days has elapsed since cessation of ELAD
      therapy (ELAD group), whichever comes first.
