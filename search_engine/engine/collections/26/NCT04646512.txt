      exercise that promotes increased thermogenesis (browning effect). Similarly, taurine is also
      associated with modulations of energy metabolism with promising actions in the control of
      metabolic disorders. Thus, it is believed that chronic taurine supplementation associated
      with physical training can optimize irisin concentrations after exercise.

      Objective: Evaluate the effects of taurine supplementation associated with interval aerobic
      training on plasma irisin concentrations, energy expenditure, body composition and physical
      fitness in obese women. Methods: Twenty-two women aged 25 to 45 years, sedentary, with grade
      I obesity (BMI ≥30-35 kg / m²) and without comorbidities will be recruited for the study. The
      subjects will be submited to a high intensity interval aerobic training for 8 weeks, being 3
      times by week, for 50 minutes, associated to the supplementation with 3g of taurine or
      placebo.

      Methods: Assessment of dietary intake, Resting Energy Expenditure (GER) by indirect
      calorimetry, body composition by deuterium oxide, anthropometric measurements, HPLC plasma
      analysis of taurine, multiplex irisin and physical fitness variables will be performed pre
      and post intervention. The results will be expressed as mean and standard deviation and the
      ANOVA test two way repeated measures mixed model will be applied, with post hoc Sidak, to
      verify differences and statistical interactions (p <0.05).
