    
      This is a clinical study to evaluate the effect of CMPN to the bone.

      Three individual cohorts are defined; a cohort consisting of 50 patients with Polycythemia
      Vera (PV), a cohort consisting of 50 patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), and a
      cohort consisting of 25 patients with Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF).

      Patients are recruited from the Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital.

      Interventions consist of:

        -  Conventional DXA scan to measure Bone Mineral Density (BMD).

        -  Experimental HR-pQCT to assess geometry, strength and microstructure of the bone in 3
           dimension.

        -  Blood-samples are collected and frozen for later analyses of Biochemical Bone Markers:
           1-CTP, Ctx, ALP (alkaline phosphatase)and P1NP.

      The outcome is compared to healthy control individuals.
