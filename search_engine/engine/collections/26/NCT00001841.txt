    
      Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is a developing technology that
      permits the non-invasive evaluation of arterial and venous structures without the need for
      x-ray based catheter angiography. While dramatic progress has been made in the last few
      years, there are still substantial limitations in the accuracy of MRA in judging stenoses and
      detecting small accessory vessels. The purpose of this study is to recruit patients with
      suspected or documented atherosclerotic disease for evaluation with state-of-the-art MRA
      using new surface coils, new pulse sequence designs, novel contrast administration
      strategies, and advanced image processing algorithms. This work represents a collaboration
      between NIH, USUHS and General Electric Medical Systems and is supported by a Cooperative
      Research Agreement (CRADA). The goal of this pilot study is to improve MRA to the point that
      it can reliably replace diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography in the evaluation of patients
      with atherosclerotic disease.
