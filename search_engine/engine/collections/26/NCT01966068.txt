      of implementation success, implementation outcomes, and health care outcomes resulting from
      implementing an asthma portal, MyAsthma, in the national, Agency for Health Care Research and
      Quality(AHRQ)-funded, Center for Pediatric Practice Research and Learning. Technically, the
      portal will be implemented with 2 innovative approaches that facilitate rapid cycle
      evaluation in multiple Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Although many patient portals are
      simple vehicles for transferring information about upcoming appointments, test results or
      laboratory findings, the asthma portal in this project extends this basic functionality to
      provide asthma education, collect patient-reported outcomes, evaluate medication use and side
      effects, and track parents' preferences and goals. Because asthma is an AHRQ priority
      condition which addresses three AHRQ priority criteria (children, low income, and special
      health care needs), our study will use this population to focus on stage 3 Meaningful Use
      (MU3) objectives. It is the hope that by conducting this study, translational knowledge will
      be gained to make recommendations for practice implementation and actionable policy
      statements.
