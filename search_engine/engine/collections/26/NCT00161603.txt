           facilitate or serve as barriers to behavioral change in angioplasty patients. Through a
           series of open-ended questions we will explore and build a better understanding of how
           culturally different patient groups perceive heart disease and the difficulties in
           changing health behavior. In addition, we hope to better understand and anticipate
           barriers and issues that participants face in successfully changing their behaviors.

        2. To use the responses obtained in the qualitative interviews to inform how we should
           operationalize and tailor the positive affect induction and self-affirmation
           intervention methods in each of the populations under study. Specifically, this involves
           assessing what small gifts participants prefer to receive and what would be most
           effective in inducing positive affect.
