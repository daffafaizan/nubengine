      Aim 1: Test the efficacy of the MAPSS-DM intervention for improving cognitive function, A1C,
      and DM-SM. Based on preliminary data, our working hypothesis is that compared with the
      control group, persons who receive the intervention will have improved memory, executive
      function, and perceived cognitive function, greater use of cognitive strategies, and improved
      DM-SM immediately post-intervention and at three and six-months post-intervention.

      Aim 2: To explore changes in glycemic variability and their association with changes in
      cognitive function. Our working hypothesis here is that MAPSS-DM participants will exhibit
      less glycemic variability post-intervention as compared with baseline and glycemic
      variability will mediate improvements in cognitive test performance.
