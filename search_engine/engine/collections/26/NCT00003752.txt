      in patients with advanced breast cancer. II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this
      treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Evaluate the efficacy of oral bexarotene
      in terms of induction of differentiation and decreased aberrant cell proliferation in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to prior therapy for metastatic disease. Patients are randomized to one of two dose
      levels. All patients receive oral bexarotene once daily. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every week for the
      first month, at weeks 6 and 8, then monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84-180 patients will be accrued for this study.
