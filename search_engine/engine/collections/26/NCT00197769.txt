      in routine use in the US for five years. The purpose of the trial is to determine the minimum
      number of does required to protect UK infants and toddlers, and to assess the compatibility
      of the pneumococcal vaccine with the other vaccines given in the UK childhood immunisation
      programme. The vaccine used in the US protects against seven strains of pnemococcus whereas
      the vaccine used in this trial protects against nine strains. Infants received either two
      doses at two and four months or three doses at two, three and four months of age, the latter
      comprising the routine infant schedule for other paediatric vaccines in the UK. The infants
      also received the usual vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus, polio, whooping cough and Hib
      together with meningitis C vaccine which is currently only used in the UK and a few other
      countries worldwide. A group of toddlers aged twelve to fifteen months also took apart and
      received either one or two doses of pneumococcal vaccine around the same time as their MMR
      vaccine. All children in the study received a booster dose some months later. The response to
      the vaccine is assessed by measuring levels of protective antibodies to the pneumococcal
      strains in blood samples taken at various times during the immunisation schedule.
