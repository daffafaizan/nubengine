      community college news bulletin board inviting them to take part in the study. They were
      asked to complete the NAETÂ® Allergy Symptom-Rating (ASR) questionnaire upon arrival at the
      research center. Observing inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 32 subjects from both
      sexes with varied health problems were selected out of the forty-two who volunteered for the
      study. All 32 subjects were tested for 21 commonly used food substances via NST. Out of 32
      tested, 26 subjects tested positive for one item each, from the 21 items tested and six
      subjects tested positive for multiple items from the selected food list. The 32 subjects had
      a total of 50 positive NSTs out of 672 (21X32) tests performed. The items that produced
      positive results by NST were further evaluated via laboratory blood serum analysis for
      IgE-specific antigens. According to NST the percentage of observed total food reactions in
      this group of 32 was 7.44%. Soon after the completion of NST the laboratory technicians
      collected blood from 32 subjects for IgE-specific antigen study on 50 positively tested
      items. The IgE-specific antigen tests were found positive on a total of 49 out of 50 tests
      performed.
