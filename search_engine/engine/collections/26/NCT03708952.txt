      still lacking. The investigators aim to collect basic characteristics of participants at
      baseline, including sex, age, smoking, exercise, marriage, education level, dietary factors
      and so on, to assess the associations between lifestyle and dietary pattern and precursor
      lesions of colorectal cancer. Results from this study will be valuable for colorectal cancer
      prevention in China.
