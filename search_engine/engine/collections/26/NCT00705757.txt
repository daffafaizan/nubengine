      the eyes, which is reversible. There are three different brands of the medicine which are
      equally effective in lowering eye pressure but their likelihood of changing skin color is
      unknown. Qualifying patients will be randomly assigned to use one of the three eye drops. We
      will take skin color measurements from several locations on the face over one year to measure
      pigmentation changes.
