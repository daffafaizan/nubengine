    
      In France, there is usually a long delay (approximately 6 weeks) before a general
      practitioner can obtain a specialized advice by dermatologists for diagnosis of "unusual"
      dermatologic conditions of their patients.

      Previous studies have shown that teledermatology is a reliable way for diagnosis in
      dermatology.

      We hypothesize that a teledermatology advice could reduce delay before diagnosis and
      therefore treatment for patients.
