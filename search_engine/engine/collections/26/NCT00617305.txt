      vascular resistance (PVR), and other hemodynamic parameters, following the addition of
      ambrisentan to background phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) therapy in subjects
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to
      PDE-5i monotherapy.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the change from baseline in other
      clinical measures of PAH following the addition of ambrisentan to background PDE-5i therapy
      in subjects with PAH who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to PDE-5i monotherapy.

      The safety and tolerability of ambrisentan/PDE-5i combination therapy will be evaluated
      throughout the study. In addition, long-term efficacy will be examined.
