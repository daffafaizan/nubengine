      indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Both compounds
      appear not to be cross-resistant with prior therapy. Therefore, it is of interest to combine
      bendamustine and bortezomib in this patient population.

      Preliminary results from patients with multiple myeloma showed that the combination of
      bendamustine and bortezomib is efficacious and well tolerated. However, there are so far no
      data on this combination in patients with NHL or CLL.
