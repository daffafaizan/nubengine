    
      1> Patient selection

      Enroll criteria:

      1) Gastric cancer patients and their first-degree relatives and 2) family with two or more
      gastric cancer patients within three-generation pedigree.

      A three-generation pedigree will be used for diagnostic consideration or risk assessment of
      rare variation.

      Personal history will be acquired by questionnaire which asks smoking, alcohol intake,
      dietary preference, socioeconomic information and history of previous eradication of HP. For
      any family member with gastric cancer, age at diagnosis, histology type, methods of treatment
      or pathological reports will be evaluated.

      2> Whole exome sequencing, variant annotation, filtering and prioritization After whole exome
      sequencing, functional annotation of genetic variants will be conducted using ANNOVAR.

      3> Linkage analyses To perform variant and gene-based linkage analysis in pedigrees, data
      will be analyzed using pedigree-VAAST.

      4> Validation using a genechip
