      households in the rural areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states of India. The
      investigators enrolled women (primary cook) and one child (age 8-15) in each of these 96
      households. The investigators compare the effect of traditional wood burning stoves (the
      control condition) to that of improved wood burning stoves on the respiratory health of women
      and children, and also undertake community-based system dynamics modeling to delineate the
      feedback mechanisms involved in sustained use or abandonment of improved cookstoves. The
      study and research program are aligned with recent international attention to explore
      determinants impacting the sustained use of cleaner cooking systems in poor communities of
      the world. Thus, in achieving the aims of this R21, the investigators will then have: 1)
      necessary preliminary data; 2) pre-emptive strategies for most of these unanticipated but
      preventable challenges. The investigators will leverage these insights to proceed with a
      larger scale intervention: 1) to examine the effect of sustained use of cleaner cooking
      systems and respiratory health outcomes in women and children due to reduced HAP in rural
      India; 2) to explore barriers and enablers of implementation of cleaner cooking systems in
      multiple resource poor settings. Numerous studies have shown that sustained and exclusive use
      of cleaner cooking systems irrespective of their types have been a challenge. Lukewarm
      sustenance of cleaner cooking systems in poor households stems from a limited understanding
      on the grounds of social, technical, economic, and ecological intersections of energy
      security. The investigators intend to address this gap by using a trans-disciplinary approach
      to contribute to our understanding of factors that influence the implementation of cleaner
      cooking systems for rural poor in India.
