      involves: (i) aortic arch segmentation with data from the preoperative CT-scan (ii) numerical
      modeling of the actual stentgraft used to treat the patient (iii) simulation of stentgraft
      deployment in aortic arch (iv) validation of simulation results based on post-operative CT
      scan images The goal of this study is to develop a numerical model of stentgraft deployment
      able to predict the actual deployement of the double branched device in aortic arch aneurysm.
