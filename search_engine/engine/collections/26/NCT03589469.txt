      loncastuximab tesirine used as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The
      study will enroll approximately 140 patients

      Loncastuximab Tesirine is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody
      directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a
      valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.
      Loncastuximab tesirine has been designed to target and kill CD19-expressing malignant
      B-cells.

      A 2-stage design will be used in this clinical study, with an interim analysis for futility
      on the first 52 patients. If â‰¥10 patients respond (CR+PR), the study will proceed to complete
      full enrollment. Enrollment will continue during the interim analysis; however, further
      enrollment will be halted if futility is confirmed.

      For each patient, the study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment
      Period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up
      to 3 years after treatment discontinuation).

      Patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other
      discontinuation criteria, whichever occurs first.
