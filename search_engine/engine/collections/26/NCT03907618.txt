      patients who use DM1 diagnosed between 18-40 years old will be examined. Gonadotropin and AMH
      levels will be measured in follicular phase. To calculate the number of antral follicles
      (AFC) and ovarian volume, ultrasound will be looked at. Fasting and satiety blood glucose,
      HbA1c and C-peptide levels will be evaluated.
