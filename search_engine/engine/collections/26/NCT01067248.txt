    
      Rationale:

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as a preventable and treatable
      disease with significant extrapulmonary effects. Osteoporosis is recognized as one of these
      extrapulmonary consequences. It results in increased risk of fracture and thereby an
      increased morbidity and mortality. Nowadays it is believed that the patho-physiology of
      osteoporosis is multi-factorial. However, which factors are most important in patients with
      COPD is still not clear.

      Objective:

      The main objective is to study important factors in the patho-physiology of osteoporosis in
      patients with COPD. Therefore, we will study biological markers in plasma and urine and
      correlate them to markers of bone turnover and clinical data.

      Study design:

      The present study will be an observational, cross-sectional study.
