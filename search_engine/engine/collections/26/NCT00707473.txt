      I. To determine the clinical/radiographic complete and partial response rate after induction
      chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF).

      II. To improve local tumor control to 80% at 2 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Disease specific-survival and overall survival rates. II. Organ
      preservation (orbital, maxillary, cranial) rate. III. Patterns of treatment failure (local,
      regional, and distant). IV. Acute and late treatment-related toxicity. V. The effect of
      treatment on Quality of Life with and without surgery (i.e., M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory
      [MDASI], M. D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory [MDADI], Xerostomia Questionnaire, Performance
      Status Scale for Head & Neck Cancer Patients [PSS-HN], etc.).

      VI. To evaluate the effects of induction chemotherapy on biological markers that could serve
      as surrogates for response and predictors of long-term outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1,
      cisplatin IV over 30-180 minutes or carboplatin IV on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously
      on days 1-4. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 1 additional
      course of treatment and undergo chemoradiotherapy over 6-7 weeks. Patients who have stable
      disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) to induction therapy, or less than a complete
      response to chemoradiotherapy undergo surgery and radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 4 months for 1 year and every 6 months for 2 years.
