      with left ventricular hypertrophy and other adverse cardiac consequences. Fluid management is
      therefore an important aspect in the management of dialysis patient. Despite improvements in
      dialysis methods and other techniques in these patients, fluid overload persists due to the
      great limitations of the affected population: physiopathological, economic, educational,
      social and psychological. The above creates the need for other therapies that lead to the
      reduction of overload and thus avoid the comorbidity that this entails. The objective of this
      study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the use of diaphoresis achieved through
      the use of portable sauna baths in peritoneal dialysis patients with fluid overload. The
      patients are subjected to a period of data collection for 3 days and then use the portable
      sauna bath 30 minutes a day supervised by the research team during the 6 following days,
      without interrupting their peritoneal dialysis therapy. We plan to recruit at least 9
      patients with PD with fluid overload. Changes in the degree of overhydration are determined
      by bioimpedance spectroscopy and patient weight at the beginning and end after treatment.
      Changes in body weight, blood pressure, potassium, urea and creatinine levels, the degree of
      edema, as well as knowledge about the salt and liquid line were also evaluated. Adverse
      events will be reported.
