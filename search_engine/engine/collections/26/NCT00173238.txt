    
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a promising new class of diagnostic medical imaging
      technology that utilizes advanced photonics and fiber optics to obtain images and tissue
      characterization on a scale never before possible within the human body. OCT combines the
      principles of ultrasound with the imaging performance of a microscope and a form factor that
      is familiar to clinicians. Whereas ultrasound produces images from backscattered sound
      "echoes," OCT uses infrared light waves that reflect off the internal microstructure within
      the biological tissues.
