      cm umbilical incision. A flexible endoscope will be inserted through the mouth and into the
      stomach. Using commercially available endoscopes, endoscopic instruments and accessories, a
      small incision will be made in the gastric wall and the endoscope will be advanced into the
      insufflated peritoneal cavity. Two to three small laparoscopic trocars will be placed for
      laparoscopic instrument insertion to manipulate, retract and cut tissue. The flexible
      endoscope will provide visualization of the surgical field and flexible endoscopic
      instruments may be used to augment surgical manipulation with the laparoscopic instruments.
      Once dissected free, the gall bladder will be removed through the stomach and out of the
      mouth. Commercially available endoscopic clips, sutures and/or tissue anchors will be used to
      close the gastrotomy; additionally, the gastrotomy will be tested for leaks and
      laparoscopically oversewn with suture as needed.

      Patients will be discharged per the standard of practice for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
      During the hospital stay severity of pain and use of pain medications will be recorded.
      Length of time spent in the recovery room and in the hospital will also be collected.
      Patients will return and be evaluated by their surgeon two weeks following their procedure.
      At this visit, any complications will be noted in the patient's medical record. Additionally
      at this visit and at the preoperative visit, patients will complete a standardized Quality of
      Life (QOL) assessment (i.e., SF-36) and perceived pain levels and type and frequency of pain
      medications will be recorded in the patient's medical record.
