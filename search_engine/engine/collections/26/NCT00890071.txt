      critical ill patients is still a matter of concern, since fluid overload could worse the
      clinical situation of these patients. Parameters of fluid responsiveness usually require an
      invasive monitoring (like arterial pulse pressure variation).

      We hypothesize that noninvasive evaluation of respiratory variation of peak velocity in
      brachial artery using Doppler ultrasound could provide a feasible estimation on fluid
      responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with acute circulatory failure.
