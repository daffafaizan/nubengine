      tertiary public hospital with 35 beds allocated. Hospitalized patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Patient recruitment will
      begin in the first 48 hours of admission to the ward, which will be identified through the
      list of patients admitted to the hospital and assigned to the Department of Geriatrics. The
      doctor who decides the inclusion in the intervention or control group will not be the
      attending physician. Patients or their families (if the patient has cognitive impairment)
      will be informed of the random inclusion in one group, but will not be informed as to which
      they belong. Randomization will be performed by applying http://www.randomizer.org/. The
      information in both the intervention group and the control group will obtained in four
      different stages: the initial visit and at months 3, 6 and 12 after hospital discharge.
