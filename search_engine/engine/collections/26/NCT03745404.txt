      treatment with Lido-Patch was followed by a 2-day to 14-day Double-blind Phase with
      Lido-Patch or Placebo Patch treatment. Only participants responding to open-label treatment
      with Lido-Patch were included in the Double-blind Phase. In a Follow-up Phase without
      treatment, the safety of participants was monitored for 1-2 weeks. Alternatively, patch
      application could be continued for up to 12 months in the clinical study KF10004/02.
