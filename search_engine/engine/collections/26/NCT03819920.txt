      preventable, but screening participation remains suboptimal. Several factors have been
      associated with screening compliance, such as perception of CRC risk. Here we study the
      impact of telephone-based administration of the National Cancer Institute Colorectal Cancer
      Risk Assessment Tool (CCRAT) compared to usual care.
