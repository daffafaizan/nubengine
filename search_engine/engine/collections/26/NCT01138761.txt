      for the caregivers of newly diagnosed pediatric atopic dermatitis patients at the University
      of Missouri Dermatology clinic. Caregivers of children with atopic dermatitis will be
      randomized to one of two instruction/education procedures. The goal is to determine if
      improved retention of information by caregivers/parents of children with atopic dermatitis is
      associated with better patient outcomes.
