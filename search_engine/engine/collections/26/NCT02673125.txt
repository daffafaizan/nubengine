      vital role in embryonic development and are essential for various cellular functions. And
      unlike other cellular organelles, they contain their own DNA (also known as mitochondrial DNA
      or mtDNA). Embryonic development is a complex energy-driven process and is thought to be
      highly dependent on mitochondrial function and mtDNA gene expression. It is believed that
      amounts of mtDNA remain constant in first three days of preimplantation development.
      Significant alterations in mtDNA are not initiated until after day 5 when the embryo has
      undergone the first cellular differentiation into trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass. It
      is possible that mtDNA variation may account chromosomal abnormalities by affecting the
      accuracy of chromosome segregation.

      In addition to describing the relationship between mtDNA expression and clinical outcomes,
      Reprogenetics and Fragouli et al. (2015) were able to establish a threshold over which no
      clinical pregnancy was established. These results were further validated in a prospective
      blinded study and independently validated using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis.
      The quantification of mtDNA therefore provides important information in selecting the best
      embryos for transfer. MitoGradeTM is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method
      developed to quantify the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) present in human
      preimplantation embryos. It is believed that a chromosomally normal embryo with a MitoGradeTM
      score lower than the established threshold will have a higher chance of successful
      implantation in comparison to a similar embryo with a higher MitoGradeTM score.
