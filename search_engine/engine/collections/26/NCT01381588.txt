      post menopausal patients. Post menopausal patients who visit OS(orthopedic surgery) including
      GHs(general hospitals) and clinics will be enrolled. They will take the evaluation of spine
      X-ray and answer to a few questions. Their medical record will be reviewed and relevant
      clinical findings will be collected.
