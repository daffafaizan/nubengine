      daily oral AB1010 at doses 3, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg/day.

      The study treatment is administered for 16 weeks:

        -  the first 4 weeks are a run-in period during which corticosteroids remain stable;

        -  during the following 8 weeks, corticosteroids are decreased every week until weaning or
           an exacerbation occurs;

        -  the last 4 weeks are a stabilization period. Patients have to perform a visit every 2
           weeks during run-in, then every week for the following 3 months.
