      bulimia nervosa struggling with nightmares, looking at either objective or subjective
      measures. The investigators plan to probe the effectiveness of prazosin in bulimic patients
      experiencing nightmares due to PTSD using both subjective and objective measures in order to
      improve future clinical care. The effects of prazosin on decreasing nightmares and bulimic
      symptoms on subjective scales and effects on sleep architecture using objective polysomnogram
      (PSG) measurements will help inform targeted psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic
      strategies to improve clinical care of bulimic patients struggling with distressing dreams
      secondary to PTSD. This study will be performed in two phases. Phase A will involve eight
      participants who will be tested using subjective scales (mentioned below). If Phase A data
      analysis leads to detection of a signal of efficacy 2 more participants will be recruited to
      participate in phase B of this trial using objective polysomnogram measurements. The results
      from this project will aid in establishing a fully powered clinical trial for treatment of
      nightmares in bulimic patients and improve outcomes in this high risk population.
