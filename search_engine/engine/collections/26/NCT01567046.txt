      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Existing NRSTS samples from the COG D9902/ARST0332 studies Sampling
      Method: Non-Probability Sample

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency with which actionable mutations are found in archived
      non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) tumor specimens using mass spectrometry (MS)
      analysis of tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Archived DNA tissue samples are analyzed for frequency of genetic mutations, including single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and small deletions
      and/or insertions, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and mass spectometry (Sequenom
      MassARRAY). Results are then analyzed to determine whether specific mutations correlate with
      patient or disease features such as tumor stage, histological grade, or outcome.
