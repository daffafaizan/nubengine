      therapy with MTX) or MTX observational and treatment-emergent SAEs, Adverse Events of Special
      Interest (AESI) and Pregnancy in patients diagnosed with moderately to severely active
      polyarticular or polyarticular-course JIA through Year 5. From Year 6 through Year 10 SAEs, a
      subset of AESI that includes congestive heart failure (CHF), malignancies, AEs at least
      possibly related to and/or leading to discontinuation of registry treatment and pregnancies
      will be collected. For JIA patients 2 to< 4 years of age in countries with available local
      approval for this group of patients at the time of consent to the registry, emergent AESI,
      SAEs and pregnancy (at the age when a patient can become pregnant) will be collected for the
      full 10 years. The approved age range for HUMIRA in the U.S., European Union (EU) and in
      Australia is 4 years of age and older, and recent approval in EU for JIA patients 2 to < 4
      years of age.

      Patients who discontinue from the registry before 10 years will be offered to participate in
      the direct to Health Care Provider follow-up process, as allowed by local regulations.
