      anti-inflammatory drugs). Many studies with animals have been made which show a clear
      tendency for delayed bone healing by taking NSAIDs.

      It is known that an early intake of NSAIDs prevents ectopic ossification in patients,
      receiving total hip prosthesis. However, cases of prosthetic loosening and instability after
      10 years were almost exclusively observed in the group of patients who received NSAIDs
      postoperatively. However, very few clinical studies still show this tendency. In this study
      we include patients with fresh fracture in the wrist; Colles fracture. The fracture may seem
      unstable when there is a lack of bone healing. These fractures are very common in the
      orthopaedic clinic.

      Although there is no dislocation of the fragments, newly formed bone can be weaker as
      demonstrated by DEXA scanning (bone mineral density measurement). Histological examination of
      the healing bone can give a definitive answer whether the bone was affected or not. Thus, the
      possibilities of studying NSAIDs affect on bone healing in humans and the clinical
      significance are very positive.
