      The primary objective of this research is to establish a clinic-based case-control study for
      examination of potential risk factors for primary adult brain tumors. After assembling a
      series of 1,500 cases and 3,000 controls, investigators will test current hypotheses on
      ge-netic and environmental risk factors for the occurrence of these tumors.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      In this case-control study, persons with a recent diagnosis (within 4 months) of a primary
      brain tumor will be identified in the neurology/neurosurgery clinics at major treatment
      referral centers in the Southeast. Non-blood related relatives (eg. in-laws), friends or
      other persons will be recruited as controls. Names and contact information of eligible
      controls will be ascertained from patients. A total of 1,500 cases and 3,000 controls will be
      enrolled over the course of the 5-year study. All enrolled subjects will complete a one hour
      interview on lifestyle, environmental exposures, diet, physical activity, tobacco use and
      medical history. They will also be asked to provide a DNA sample, a water sample and a
      toenail sample (from each great toe). At the end of data collection, lifestyles and genetic
      attributes will be compared in cases and controls to identify any differences that may be
      relevant to the causation of disease. Because the study will recruit patients near the time
      of disease diagnosis, full enrollment should be possible. In addition, high re-sponse rates
      are anticipated among the controls. Thus, with the large numbers of patients available and
      high anticipated response rates, the study offers a unique opportunity to successfully
      identify environmental and genetic risk factors for this uncommon form of cancer.
