      post-partum perineal pain with unknown effectiveness in its suppository form; the
      investigators would like to conduct this study to investigate the effectiveness of
      acetaminophen rectal suppository versus diclofenac rectal suppository in controlling
      postpartum perineal pain. This study will be conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 is a 3 months
      prospective observational study which aims to determine the prevalence and severity of
      perineal pain following childbirth in Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru; while Stage 2 is
      a single blinded, open-labelled, randomized control trial study design which will determine
