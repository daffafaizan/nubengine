      toxicities, and reversibility of toxicities) of erlotinib to that of platinum-based therapy
      in NSCLC. A sequential therapy design has been chosen such that all patients will receive any
      potential benefits of both platinum-based and erlotinib therapy, without compromising
      survival by denying anyone potential therapy. With this design, progression-free survival
      will be tracked by treatment received. However, data will be generated which will show the
      safety and efficacy of erlotinib in the frontline setting (alone and with historical
      comparison to platinum-based therapy), as well as the potential safety and activity of
      platinum-based therapy in the "second-line" (post-erlotinib) setting. This should allow for
      the demonstration of the relative median time to progression, objective response and clinical
      benefit rates, overall survival, and safety and tolerability of erlotinib and platinum-based
      therapy in both the frontline and second-line settings in NSCLC. Also, in this fashion, the
      treatments serve as controls for each other, as well as being compared to historical
      controls; in the first line treatment portion, the platinum-based regimens serve as the
      historical control, while in the second-line setting, erlotinib serves as the historical
      control arm.
