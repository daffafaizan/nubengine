      major cause of morbidity and mortality. An estimated 346 million people had diabetes in 2011,
      and diabetes is predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death in the world by the
      year 2030. In the United States, the incidence of diabetes nearly tripled between 1990 and
      2010, with 1.9 million new cases diagnosed in 2010. Hypoglycemia (HG) is recognized as a
      limiting factor in optimal glycemic management of patients with diabetes. This potentially
      costly condition, occurring in approximately 20% to 60% of patients who receive oral
      medications for diabetes, threatens patient safety, quality of life, and potentially,
      cardiovascular health. Investigators have identified risk factors for HG, built a risk
      calculator for use by clinicians, integrated the calculator into the G3 electronic medical
      record system, and demonstrated our ability to collect data about outcomes. In this project,
      investigators studied the outcomes of implementing the risk calculator tool into clinical
      practice in ambulatory primary care. The findings and tools developed from this project will
      promote improved patient safety and medical care for diabetes.
