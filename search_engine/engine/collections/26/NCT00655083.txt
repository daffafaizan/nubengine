    
      This trial aims to evaluate the oral adsorption of nepadutant (0.1 or 0.5 mg/Kg given as one
      single dose as oral solution) in infants divided in three age strata (from 6 to 24 weeks
      old). Oral absorption is evaluated by measuring the amount of nepadutant in the urine output
      collected during the 24 hours after oral administration with special diapers.

      Safety and tolerability of the drug will be evaluated by monitoring any changes in
      signs/symptoms at medical examination and vital signs during the fist 4 hours post-dose in
      the Hospital site and then by the parents at home up to 24 hours and 1 week post nepadutant
      administration.
