    
      This is an open-label, randomized two period crossover study. Each subject's participation is
      expected to last about seven weeks and includes a brief enrolment period followed by two
      consecutive three week treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2).

      In Period 1, subjects will use the first assigned study pen needle (either the 4mm Nano or
      the 8mm Short) to self-administer daily all their pen-based diabetes medications. Upon
      completion of Period 1, subjects will switch to the alternate pen needle for Period 2. The
      randomization schedule will determine the order of pen needle use.

      Blood samples for determination of fasting blood glucose and serum fructosamine
      concentrations will be collected at baseline (Visit 2) and the end of Period 1 (Visit 3) and
      Period 2 (Visit 4). Blood samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.
