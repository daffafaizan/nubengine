      follow-up to 5 years. Thirty-two individuals presenting with newly diagnosed acute or early
      HIV-1 infection as described in the inclusion criteria will be enrolled, with sixteen
      randomized to each arm. Individuals will be randomized to one of two arms: the "Intensive"
      arm with standard HAART (Emtricitabine 200mg /tenofovir 300mg QD + Lopinavir 400mg /ritonavir
      100mg BID) + Raltegravir + Maraviroc or the "placebo" arm with standard HAART+ Placebo for 48
      weeks. Another group of individuals diagnosed with acute or early HIV-1 who elect to forego
      early treatment will be followed as non-randomized, untreated controls. At week 48, all
      patients will be informed of study results. If results are positive in the intensive
      treatment group, the placebo group will be offered to roll-over to the intense treatment arm
      and followed as an open-label cohort out to five years. Participants may stop treatment at
      any time and withdraw from the study. If they choose to do so, they will be followed
      according to the standards employed for all HIV-1 patients at the Maple Leaf clinic. At the
      five year point, the decision to terminate treatment will be made based on the existing state
      of the HIV-1 literature at the time.
