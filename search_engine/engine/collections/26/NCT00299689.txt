      a significant response rate in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      Although the development of effective immunotherapy and the characterization of multiagent
      chemotherapy regimens have substantially improved in the treatment of metastatic malignant
      melanoma, the overall results remain dismal with a 6% five year survival rate for stage IV
      disease. Of the common adult-onset cancers, melanoma is widely held to be the most amenable
      to immunological intervention.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate and the overall
      survival of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma treated with two regimens of ONTAK.
