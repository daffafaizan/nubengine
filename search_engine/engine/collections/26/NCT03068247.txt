      10 weeks. Volunteers will undergo imaging with structural and functional MRI and PET with
      [11C]carfentanil to determine baseline μOR BPND and changes in BPND measures during acute
      i.v. medication administration at the time of scanning before and after the 10-week treatment
      period.

      To elicit the activation of µ-opioid-mediated neurotransmission in the scanner, we utilize
      the introduction of medication (active or inactive) 1mL into an intravenous port every 4
      minutes, 15 sec per infusion, starting 45 minutes after radiotracer administration, until
      scan completion. Participants are made aware that the study drug will be administered at the
      time a computer-generated human voice recording reads a second-by-second count of the
      infusion timing (15 sec).
