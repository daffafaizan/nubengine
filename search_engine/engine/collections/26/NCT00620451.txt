      with three treatment arms: larazotide acetate 4 mg TID, larazotide acetate 8 mg TID and
      placebo TID in subjects with celiac disease. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy
      of larazotide acetate versus placebo in inducing remission in subjects with active celiac
      disease, as defined by an improvement in the Villous Height to Crypt Depth (Vh:Cd) ratio,
      obtained by duodeno-jejunal biopsy. Secondary objectives included assessment of the safety
      and tolerability of larazotide acetate, to prospectively validate the components of a
      composite weighted index of celiac disease activity (celiac disease Activity Rating Score,
      CeDARS), individually and as a whole, to To compare the CeDARS against the Clinician Global
      Assessment of disease (CGA), Psychological Well Being Index and the Short Form 12 version 2
      (SF-12 v2) health survey and to assess the effects of larazotide acetate on inflammatory
      markers in subjects with active celiac disease.
