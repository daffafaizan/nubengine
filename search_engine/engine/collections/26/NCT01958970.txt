    
      This is a randomized (participants will be assigned by chance to study treatments),
      double-blind (participants and study personnel will not know the identity of the study
      treatments), placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial)-controlled study in patients who receive
      maintenance hemodialysis. Three participants will receive PINTA 745 for every participant
      that receives placebo. PINTA 745 or placebo will be taken intravenously once per week
      following dialysis.

      The study period will consist of screening, treatment for 12 weeks, and follow up for 8
      weeks. Evaluations will be performed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what
      the body does to a drug), pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body) and
      effectiveness in treating protein energy wasting (such as increasing muscle size and muscle
      function) throughout the study.
