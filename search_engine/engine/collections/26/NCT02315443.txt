    
      NA-1 is being developed as an emergency drug aimed at reducing global disability in patients
      with acute cerebral ischemia if administered early after symptom onset.

      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of NA-1 in reducing global disability in
      patients with acute stroke. The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of NA-1 in
      reducing functional dependence, improving neurological outcome, improving activities of daily
      living, and increasing the proportion of subjects who are candidates for endovascular
      recanalization therapy.

      The leading safety objectives are to determine the effect of administering a target dose of
      2.60 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 270 mg) IV infusion of NA-1 within three hours of symptom
      onset by paramedics in the field on serious adverse events and 90-day mortality.

      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study
      initiated prehospital in the ambulance. It is being conducted using Emergency Medical
      Services (EMS) in Canada. Subjects with suspected acute stroke will be identified in the
      field by trained paramedics using the approved stroke protocol in use by the local EMS
      system, and further screened for eligibility and approval by an on-call trial physician. The
      paramedics will administer the study drug. Upon arrival at the emergency department, subjects
      will receive standard-of-care.

      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will perform safety reviews of the clinical data.
