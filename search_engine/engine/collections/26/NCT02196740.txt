      periodontitis in certain criterion. We will divide the patients into two groups randomly.One
      group will get treated with triple antibiotic paste while the other with creosote.We want to
      evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of the two groups to get a conclusion of the
      clinical value of triple antibiotic paste.
