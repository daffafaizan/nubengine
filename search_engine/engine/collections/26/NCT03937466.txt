      line at which time they will be screened for their initial eligibility using a telephone
      screener. Women who are eligible and willing to participate, will either come to the Research
      Center in Winston-Salem to be consented and complete baseline questionnaires or complete
      these by mail or email. After two weeks, women will mail back their diaries and continue to
      record their daily hot flashes until they are notified by study staff of their eligibility,
      within a week of receiving the diary. If they qualify, a cooling mattress pad will be
      provided by study staff to be used for the duration of the intervention phase for
      approximately 8 weeks. The study staff will determine the efficacy of the cooling mattress
      pad through comparing answers to subject questionnaires at baseline and follow up in addition
      to comparing the baseline diaries to the intervention diaries.
