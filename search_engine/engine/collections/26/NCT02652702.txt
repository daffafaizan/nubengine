      sutures of the colostomy due to the different techniques employed and varying levels of skill
      of surgeons in different regions.Thus, various postoperative colostomy complications are
      inevitable after surgery. Surgeons have been looking for a simple and efficient way to
      standardize colostomy and reduce its complications.

      So we want to compare the safety and efficiency of circular stapler-assisted colostomy with
      conventional hand-stitching colostomy in colorectal cancer patients.
