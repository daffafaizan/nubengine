      eating, are increasingly recognized as a significant clinical problem in Parkinson's disease
      (PD), occurring in up to 15% of patients. Dopamine agonist (DA) treatment is thought to be
      the primary risk factor for the development of ICDs in PD. ICDs often lead to significant
      impairments in psychosocial functioning, interpersonal relationships, and quality of life.
      The management of ICDs in the context of PD can be complex. Patients may be reluctant to
      discontinue DA treatment due to the motor benefits derived from treatment, so patients often
      have chronic symptoms. Thus, additional treatment approaches are needed.

      A medication shown to be efficacious for the treatment of ICDs with minimal impact on
      parkinsonism would allow many ICD patients to continue on full-dose DA treatment. Naltrexone,
      a long-acting opioid receptor antagonist, helps in the treatment of alcohol and opioid
      dependence. In addition, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that it helps in the
      treatment of pathological gambling in the general population. Opioids regulate dopamine
      pathways in areas of the brain linked with impulse control disorders, and opioid antagonists
      block opioid receptors in these regions. In this study, 48 PD patients with an ICD will be
      treated either with naltrexone (50-100 mg/day) or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. The study
      will assess if naltrexone improves ICD symptoms in PD and is well tolerated. To our
      knowledge, the proposed study is the first controlled trial of an agent to treat ICDs in PD.
