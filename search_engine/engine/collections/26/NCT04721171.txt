      Given the lack of knowledge about pathophysiology and evidence-based therapies, patients are
      often hospitalized to treat symptoms of CVS. During an episode, patients present with severe
      vomiting and abdominal pain and are treated empirically with IV fluids, antiemetics,
      benzodiazepines, and opioids. Estimates of opioid use range from 23%-27% in adults with CVS.
      Patients are often dissatisfied with the level of analgesia as recurrent opioid use results
      in tolerance and dependence. This often undermines the physician-patient relationship and
      patients even leave against medical advice out of frustration with what they perceive as
      ineffective care. This can lead to worse outcomes including recurrent hospitalizations,
      morbidity and increased health care costs.

      Preliminary data from a study by our group reveals that of 101 patients hospitalized with CVS
      at Froedtert Hospital, chronic opioid therapy is associated with a two-fold increased risk of
      hospitalization (RR 2.22, CI 1.1-4.4, P=0.02) and three-fold increase in hospital length of
      stay (LOS) (RR 3.43, CI 1.26-9.34, P=0.01). In a study of 132 CVS patients, opioid use was
      associated with non-response to amitriptyline (53% vs 15%, p<0.05), a prophylactic therapy
      used in CVS. This in turn was associated with increased frequency and duration of CVS
      episodes per year and increased number of hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits
      at baseline (18% vs 15.2%, p<0.05). Hence there is an urgent need for an opioid-sparing,
      non-invasive strategy to treat CVS symptoms.

      In summary, CVS is common and disabling and is associated with significant health care costs.
      Our proposed project using a novel, non-invasive device to treat CVS will also address the
      current opioid crisis.
