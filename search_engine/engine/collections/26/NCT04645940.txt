      conducted with 14 healthy male or female subjects. The study will consist of a Screening
      Phase (Screening and Day -1), a Treatment Phase (Periods 1, 2, and 3), and an End of Study
      (EOS) Phase. For Periods 1 and 2, subjects will be randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment
      sequences, with all subjects then moving to the same treatment in Period 3.

      Periods 1 and 2: 14 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 possible
      treatment sequences:

        -  Fed/Fasted: fruquintinib 5 mg with food on Day 1 and fruquintinib 5 mg without food on
           Day 15

        -  Fasting/Fed: fruquintinib 5 mg without food on Day 1 and fruquintinib 5 mg with food on
           Day 15

      Period 3: all subjects will take rabeprazole 40 mg orally once daily in the morning from Day
      23 to Day 29. On the morning of Day 29, all subjects will take rabeprazole 40 mg orally
      without food one hour before taking a fruquintinib 5 mg oral dose. Subjects will continue to
      fast until lunch.
