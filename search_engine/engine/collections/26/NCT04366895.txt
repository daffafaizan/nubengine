      that address limited financial resources of patients and simultaneously enabled the
      management of conventional complete denture problems. CAD/CAM technology helped to mitigate
      the problems encountered with conventional fabrication techniques, which results in improved
      dentures fit and retention. Therefore, the aim of the current trial study was to evaluate
      whether overdentures fabricated using CAD/CAM printed technology exhibited improved patient
      satisfaction, denture retention, implant survival rate and decreased post-insertion
      maintenance or not compared to overdentures manufactured using conventional techniques.

      Methods: A randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed. The participants were randomly
      allocated into either of the two groups intervention or control group each of seven
      participants. Participants in control group (Group-A) received conventional manufactured
      implant overdenture while participants in intervention group (Group-B) received CAD-CAM
      manufactured implant overdenture.
