    
      ASSIST is a prospective, global, consecutive enrollment Registry of anterior circulation
      acute ischemic stroke patients with an LVO who undergo treatment with one of the
      interventional techniques using Stryker Neurovascular devices for the first pass. The purpose
      of this Registry is to assess the procedural success and clinical outcomes associated with
      various operator techniques for mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusions (LVO) in
      the anterior circulation. Data will be collected on the use of Stryker market-released
      neurovascular mechanical access and mechanical thrombectomy devices that are commercially
      available or that may be approved for commercial use during the conduct of the Registry. This
      Registry will also collect data, including time-to-treatment and quality of life measures, to
      allow for subset analyses.
