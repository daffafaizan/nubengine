      normal daily activity that may significantly improve function in patients with knee pain in
      general, and specifically knee osteoarthritis (OA). Capitalizing on the reported excellent
      adherence and clinical benefit of Apos Therapy in patients with significant lower limb
      arthritis, the investigators propose to evaluate this as a conservative treatment that may
      supplant/supplement traditional pain medications and physical therapy in knee OA population.

      A potential use of AposTherapy as a replacement for traditional physical therapy may yield a
      less costly, more effective therapy with better adherence. Problems with traditional therapy
      include poor patient adherence (patients often do not complete the sessions and have very
      poor adherence (about 50-60%) to home therapy programs), added cost of travel (which may be
      more than $100 per session for ambulette or access-a-ride for eligible patients), and the
      lack of continuation in an ongoing exercise program, leading to relapse and need for
      retreatment. Additionally, access to physical therapy is limited for many patients since
      there are not enough available outpatient therapy services to meet the needs of all patients.
      Finding an alternative exercise program that will increase adherence, decrease total therapy
      visits, and improve patient's outcomes with decreased dependence on pain medications is a
      high priority from both patient care and cost management perspectives.

      AposTherapy potentially overcomes many of these issues with improving/modifying abnormal
      biomechanics (therefore decreasing pain), and a home-based exercise program utilizing
      footwear that causes exercise with normal activity by promoting perturbation. This
      biomechanical approach may significantly reduce pain and improve function in patients with
      knee OA. Capitalizing on the reported excellent adherence and clinical benefit of AposTherapy
      in patients with significant knee OA, the investigators propose to evaluate the biomechanical
      exercise (wearing an appropriately calibrated shoe at home for a prescribed amount of time
      each day) as a conservative treatment that may supplement or supplant traditional pain
      medications, interventional pain procedures and physical therapy in an at-risk urban inner
      city population with knee OA.
