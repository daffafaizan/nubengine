      vancomycin on salivary mutans streptococci (MS) levels, on a double-blind, randomized
      clinical trial. Sixty-nine healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at least one active
      carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the
      study. A gel formulation containing 1.23% sodium fluoride, 1% chlorhexidine, 3% or 10%
      vancomycin was topically administered to the dentition every 24 hours, during 6 consecutive
      days. Salivary MS levels were measured at baseline (D1), on the 6th (D6), 15th (D15) and 30th
      day (D30). For microbiological analysis, MSB agar medium was used.
