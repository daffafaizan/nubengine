      study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic effect of single ascending doses of
      duvoglustat on rhGAA administered 1 hour before initiation of a single rhGAA infusion. During
      Period 1, participants received a single intravenous infusion of rhGAA. During Period 2, each
      participant received a single oral dose of duvoglustat 1 hour prior to initiation of a single
      rhGAA infusion.
