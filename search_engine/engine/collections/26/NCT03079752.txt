      through the child's fourth year of life, its long-term effects remain unexamined. The current
      study was conducted to determine the extent to which the beneficial effects of the program
      set in motion early in the life cycle altered the life-course trajectories of the mothers and
      the children's adaptive functioning through the first child's 15th birthday. This study
      examines the long-term effects of the program on two domains of maternal functioning: 1)
      maternal life course (subsequent children, use of welfare, employment, substance abuse, and
      encounters with the criminal justice system); and 2) perpetration of child abuse and neglect;
      and two domains of the children's behavior: 1) their functioning in schools, and 2) their
      criminal and antisocial behavior. The investigators hypothesized that the program effects in
      these domains of maternal and child functioning, as in earlier phases of the study, would be
      greater for families in which the mothers experienced a larger number of chronic stressors
      and had fewer resources to manage the challenges of living in poverty and being a parent.
