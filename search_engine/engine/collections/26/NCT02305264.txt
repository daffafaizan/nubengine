      study in 45 MS patients and 20 controls.

      Four groups of person will be included and compared:

        -  Group I: 20 healthy volunteers aging from 18 to 65 years. These healthy volunteers will
           be matched for age and sex with patients (1/2).

        -  Group II: 15 patients aging from 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting (RRMS), with
           less than 10 years of evolution since the first manifestation and no recent relapse.

        -  Group III: 15 patients aging from 18 to 65 years with secondary progressive MS (SPMS),
           with less than 10 years of evolution since the occurrence of the secondary progressive
           phase.

        -  Group III: 15 patients aging from 18 to 65 years with primary progressive MS (PPMS)
           diagnosed since less than 10 years.

      Study centres MS patients and the 20 healthy volunteers will be recruited in the Hospital
      Pitie-Salpetriere

      MS patients will be recruited in the Hospital Tenon

      This study will be performed by complementary teams already collaborating on molecular
      imaging trials in MS (which assess neuronal loss or demyelination/remyelination): i) the
      "Centre d'Investigation Clinique" (Salpetriere hospital, Paris), which is strongly
      experienced in the coordination of clinical and translational research on MS; ii) the CENIR
      (centre for neuroimaging research, Salpetriere hospital, Paris) a specialized MRI centre for
      research on neurological diseases; iii) the SHFJ (DSV, CEA, ORSAY) which is a world class
      molecular imaging centre;

      Study duration Per patient the study will last two years Per control the study will last up
      to 8 weeks
