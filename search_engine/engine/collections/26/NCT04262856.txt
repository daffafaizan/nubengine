    
      This is an open-label phase 2 study in participants with non-small cell lung cancer which
      will assess the safety, efficacy and tolerability of zimberelimab as monotherapy and in
      combination with other immunotherapeutics across multiple treatment arms.

      Approximately 150 participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: 1) zimberelimab,
      2) zimberelimab + domvanalimab (anti-TIGIT antibody), 3) zimberelimab + domvanalimab +
      etrumadenant (dual adenosine receptor antagonist). Participants that progress on the
      zimberelimab monotherapy arm may cross-over to receive the third arm combination of
      zimberelimab + domvanalimab + etrumadenant.

      The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of each combination
      therapy by assessing: 1) objective response rate (ORR) of participants with measurable
      disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and 2) progression free
      survival (PFS).
