        -  The principal aim of LEVNEONAT-1 is to determine the levetiracetam optimal dose defined
           as the highest efficient dose under toxicity restrictions for treating neonatal
           seizures.

        -  LEVNEONAT-1 is an open-label, sequential dose-finding study with 3 increasing dose
           levels of levetiracetam.

      Strenghts and limitation of study

        -  For the first time, levetiracetam will be used as the first-line treatment of neonatal
           seizures and not as an add-on therapy.

        -  Statistical model is designed for a rare clinical situation with a sequential adaptive
           method updating in real time the dose allocation for next patient by using all available
           data from previous participants.

        -  The targeted population, i.e. the newborn less than 3 days of life, is particularly
           sensitive and the written consent of both parents is required before the levetiracetam
           administration.
