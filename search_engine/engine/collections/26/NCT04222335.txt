    
      LUNG-RESIST is a translational, monocentric and prospective research study on 40 patients
      whose objective is to characterize Drug Tolerant Cell (DTC) type cells in patients with a
      NSCLC carrying an EGFR mutation and to discover and monitor potentials biomarkers involved in
      this mechanism of resistance to osimertinib. The study will be offered to patients, and for
      whom the therapeutic decision was decided collegially during multidisciplinary molecular
      meetings (molecular Tumor Board). Following informed consent, patients will be registered in
      a single cohort. In this study, treatment with osimertinib is not studied and will be
      delivered according to current recommendations
