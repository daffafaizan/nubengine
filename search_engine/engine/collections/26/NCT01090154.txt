    
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease which often results in
      significant morbidity as well as impairment in quality of life. Cimzia (certolizumab pegol),
      an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is an effective treatment for Crohn's disease, a
      similar inflammatory bowel disease. The aims of this study are to determine if Cimzia is
      effective for both the induction and maintenance of response/remission for the patients with
      moderate to severe Ulcerative colitis.
