      (recombinant FSH) stimulation protocol. Pituitary down-regulation with GnRH agonist
      (triptorelin, 0.1mg/d, ×10d, then 0.05mg/d until E2 ≤40 pg/ml in serum), was initiated during
      the luteal phase on the cycle-day 21. Two weeks later, if E2 in serum was ≤40 pg/ml and
      absence of follicular activity was detected, the stimulation of ovaries was started by
      recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (recFSH, Gonal-F, Serono, Switzerland) with doses
      ranging 150-250 IU/d. Doses were adjusted accordingly with ovarian monitoring and follicles
      growth. GnRHa (0.05mg/d) was injected stimulously with FSH before dominant follicles were ≥
      14 mm. When the diameter of one or more follicles was ≥ 14 mm, GnRHa (0.05mg/d) was withheld
      in the study group. In the control group, GnRHa was used to the day of ovulation trigger.
      Ovulation was induced with HCG (5000-10000 IU) when at least three follicles greater than
      16mm in diameter were detected on ultrasound examination and the leading follicles reached ≥
      18 mm in diameter. Oocytes retrieval for IVF or ICSI was performed 34-36 hours later under
      transvaginal ultrasound guidance.

      Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum E2 levels, VEGF levels in Serum and follicular fluids,
      retrieved oocytes, fertilization, implantation rate and pregnancy rate (PR), the rate of
      OHSS.
