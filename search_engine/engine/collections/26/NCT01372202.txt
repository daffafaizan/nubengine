    
      Primary Objectives

      â€¢ To determine the rate of pathological complete response when the inclusion of paclitaxel in
      neoadjuvant therapy is based on the presence or absence of CHFR methylation in diagnostic
      biopsy specimens.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the survival outcome with this treatment strategy.

        -  To determine time to disease progression with this treatment strategy.

        -  To determine the agreement between tumor CHFR methylation and detection in plasma.
