    
      All patients requiring external ventricular drain (EVD) for treatment of acute obstructive
      hydrocephalus receive intraventricular fibrinolysis with rt-PA via the ventricular catheter.
      Lumbar drainage (LD) is inserted at a timepoint, when communication between the internal and
      the external CSF-spaces is recognizable on CT ("opening" of third and fourth ventricle and
      aqueduct).
