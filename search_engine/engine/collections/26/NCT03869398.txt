      calcium prior to thyroidectomy decreases postoperative hypocalcemia. The primary outcome to
      be measured is clinical hypocalcemia, defined as peri-oral numbness and/or tingling, numbness
      and/or tingling in fingers, tetany, seizures, hypotension, palpitations. A secondary outcome
      measure of biochemical hypocalcemia will be measured. Biochemical hypocalcemia will be
      defined as a corrected calcium for albumin of less than 8.5 at 8 hours, 1 day, and 3 days
      postoperatively. Additional secondary outcome measures will be hospital length of stay, need
      for calcium gluconate IV supplementation, need for additional calcium monitoring.

      Postoperative hypocalcemia is the most common complication after thyroidectomy. Symptoms
      range from perioral numbness/tingling and tingling in fingers to severe complications such as
      hypotension, arrhythmias and tetany. In prior studies hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy can
      occur up to 50% of the time. A retrospective cohort study from 2017 shows that treating
      patients with vitamin D and calcium preoperatively decreases the rate of postoperative
      hypocalcemia. Preoperative treatment in that study included calcitriol 0.25mcg PO BID and
      Tums 1,500mg PO TID starting 5 days before surgery. This showed a significant decrease in
      postoperative hypocalcemia, decreased hospital stay, and overall decrease in cost for
      patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. This study was limited by its retrospective and
      observational nature. By performing a prospective randomized study on preoperative
      supplementation the investigators hope to provide a stronger level of evidence to support
      this practice.
