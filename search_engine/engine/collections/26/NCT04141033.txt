      mouth scaling and root planing will be performed. All clinical parameters will be recorded at
      the baseline visit before mechanical debridement and after 3 months of treatment. Saliva
      samples will be collected at the primary visit before scaling and root planing as a baseline
      value, and after 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
      samples will be collected at the primary visit before scaling and root planing as a baseline
      value, and after 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. Neopterin will be measured in the
      samples using commercially available Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit.
      Statistical analysis will be performed to the results.
