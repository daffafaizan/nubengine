    
      This Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study consists of 2
      treatment periods: a 16-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Period 1: Weeks 0
      through the end of Week 15) followed by a 36-week open-label period (Period 2: Weeks 16
      through 52). Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio based on Hurley Stage as
      stratification factor to receive adalimumab 40 mg every week (qwk), adalimumab 40 mg every
      other week (eow), or matching placebo during Period 1. During Period 2, participants receive
      open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow with the option to escalate to 40 mg weekly dosing at Week 28
      or Week 31 if the participant has a Physician's Global Assessment of moderate disease or
      worse (score of greater than or equal to 3). The primary objective of the study is to
      determine the clinical efficacy and safety of participants with moderate to severe chronic
      hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) after 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the maintenance of efficacy and continued safety of adalimumab for an additional 36
      weeks of treatment. (Note: Hurley Stage is a classification system for skin involvement that
      is largely based on the presence and extent of abscess formation accompanied by scarring and
      sinus tracts. Hurley Stages are I [abscess formation without scarring and sinus tracts], II
      [widely separated recurrent abscesses with scarring and sinus tracts], and III [multiple
      interconnected abscesses and sinus tracts across entire area]. Randomization in this study
      was performed using stratification by Hurley Stage [III versus (I or II).) At the present
      time, Period 1 double-blind data only is provided; additional information will be provided
      when analysis of open-label Period 2 is completed.
