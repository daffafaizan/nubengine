      participants meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. Investigators will report to the sleep
      laboratory on two nights, (1) after continuing their CPAP or (2) after discontinuing CPAP for
      3 nights. The order of observation will be randomized. A standard research dinner is provided
      before each study. IV's are placed so that blood can be sampled at frequent (30 min)
      intervals throughout the night. In the morning after each study, a glucose tolerance test and
      endothelial function study (endoPAT) are performed. Serum samples will be analyzed for
      glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides, hormones, and other metabolic biomarkers.
