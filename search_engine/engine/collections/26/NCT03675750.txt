      hyperprolactinemia may affect bone metabolism through direct and indirect effects and
      increase the risk of osteoporosis and fracture.The investigators assess the duration, the
      severity of hyperprolactinemia and its effects on bone metabolism in schizophrenics taking
      antipsychotic drugs through analyzing the correlation between prolactin levels and
      biochemical markers of bone metabolism and the correlation between the duration of
      hyperprolactinemia and abnormal bone metabolism. Meanwhile, the investigators aims to obtain
      the boundary value of prolactin levels in patients with abnormal bone metabolism.
