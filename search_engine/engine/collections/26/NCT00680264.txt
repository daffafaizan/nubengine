      most progressive curves require surgical intervention in order to sustain or improve sitting
      (or ambulatory) abilities. Surgery is a demanding intervention for these patients, with
      variable functional gains. Controversy persists regarding indications for surgery, timing,
      and technique. Concerns about complications are paramount. Previous neuromuscular studies
      have been confined to a small number of surgeons with a narrow range of surgical
      instrumentation, technique, and correction. Very little evidence exists regarding the impact
      spinal surgery on the quality of life in children with scoliosis related to cerebral palsy.
      The instruments to measure quality of life are not specific to children with scoliosis
      related to cerebral palsy. There have been no comprehensive prospective studies published.
      This study would be the first large-scale prospective, multi-center series of spinal fusion
      outcomes in patients with Cerebral Palsy.
