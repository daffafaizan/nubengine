      nucleotide polymorphisms from cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 gene on acute pain after tissue injury
      and the analgesic effect of a COX inhibitor. Patients will be healthy volunteers scheduled
      for the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Genotyping will be performed before
      surgery and patients stratified to treatment with a COX inhibitor in this protocol or to
      other protocols examining different polymorphisms.

      Under local anesthesia, 2 mandibular third molars will be removed. Microdialysis sampling in
      the extraction socket will be performed with pre- and post-surgical biopsies. Patients will
      receive a COX inhibitor as an analgesic drug for the post-operative pain. Outcomes evaluated
      will include clinical pain response, gene expression profile using microarray and
      quantitation of related proteins after oral surgery and the interaction of these factors with
      analgesia by a COX inhibitor. By studying these responses in patient samples for each
      genotype (non-variant homozygote, heterozygote and variant homozygote) from the COX-2 gene,
      we will attempt to replicate and extend previous findings on the role of genetic factors in
      the inflammatory process, clinical pain and variation in response to analgesic drugs.
