      randomized (patients will be assigned by chance to receive 1 of 2 treatment schedules with
      trabectidin) study designed to examine the the survival, safety, and pharmacokinetics (blood
      levels) trabectedin when administered to patients with 2 types of cancer (Liposarcoma or
      Leiomyosarcoma) who have received treatment with other anti-cancer therapy (Anthracycline
      and/or Ifosfamide). Trabectedin (also referred to as Yondelis) is a drug being developed to
      treat patients with cancer. Yondelis will be administered intravenously (i.v.) via a central
      catheter (tube) into a central vein once a week (0.58 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion on Days 1,
      8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle) or once every 3 weeks (1.5 mg/m2 administered as a
      24-hour infusion on Day 1 of every 21-day treatment cycle) until disease progression.
      Patients in each arm will be pretreated with 20 mg of dexamethasone i.v. 30 minutes prior to
      each infusion.
