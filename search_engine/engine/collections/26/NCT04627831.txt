      acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), also known as contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), and the
      equivalence of image quality following administration of Captisol-Enabled™-Iohexol
      (CE-Iohexol) Injection compared to Omnipaque™(Iohexol) Injection in patients with impaired
      renal function undergoing invasive coronary angiography.
