      dramatically reduced the need of repeat revascularization procedures, and, thanks to the
      excellent results obtained in various patient subsets, these devices are now used in almost
      90% of the stent implantation procedures performed in US hospitals. Along with the increasing
      number of patients receiving drug-eluting stents and availability of long-term follow-up
      data, concern has arisen regarding the safety of these devices. At the core of this concern
      is the potential for increased inflammatory and thrombogenic responses and their
      life-threatening consequences associated with the polymers employed for the delivery of
      antirestenotic agents. A growing interest has been shown on polymer-free stents with a
      microporous surface as an alternative to stents employing polymeric coating for local drug
      delivery. Recently, we developed a mobile system which enables coating in the catheterization
      laboratory of polymeric free stents with different drug doses or combinations. Using a
      porcine coronary model of restenosis, we found that coating with rapamycin of a polymer-free
      microporous stent is feasible and effectively reduces neointimal proliferation. More
      recently, in a clinical study in which the efficacy of several doses of rapamycin was
      assessed, we showed that non-polymer coating with rapamycin is safe and leads to a
      dose-dependent reduction in restenosis. While the advantage deriving from the lack of
      polymeric cover in on-site coated rapamycin-eluting stents is readily understandable, their
      relative efficacy as compared with commercially available polymer-based drug-eluting stents
      has yet to be evaluated.
