      Unit (QENSIU), Glasgow. Individuals with tetraplegia and upper limb weakness will be randomly
      allocated to receive either a tailored progressive resistance training (PRT) programme
      alongside usual care or usual care alone.

      Up to 30 participants admitted to the QENSIU will be recruited to the study. They will be
      randomised to the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive 8 weeks
      of PRT. An upper limb functional goal will be identified through discussion with the
      researcher and the participant. PRT will be individually tailored to target two muscle groups
      which contribute to achieving this goal. For each muscle group 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions
      will be carried out, resistance will be applied using wrist weights, free weights or
      resistance bands as required. Measurements of muscle strength and function will be assessed
      prior to, and following the study. Outcome measures: Manual muscle testing, Handheld
      Dynamometry, The Spinal Cord Independence Measure, The Action Research Arm Test.
