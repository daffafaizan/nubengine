      there is a difference in the 6MWT distance when the assessor walks behind the patient
      compared to the patient walking alone.

      Patients with COPD referred for pulmonary rehabilitation will be invited to perform an
      accompanied 6MWT (assessor walks behind the patient) and unaccompanied 6MWT (assessor does
      not walk behind the patient) in random order.

      The tests will be performed at the end of a pulmonary rehabilitation program, after patients
      are familiarised with the 6MWT testing procedure and learning effects can be excluded.
