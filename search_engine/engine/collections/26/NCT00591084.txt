      toxic accumulation in the nervous system following cerebral ischemia. Ginsenoside-Rd, a
      purified component from total saponins of Panax notoginseng, has a molecular formula of
      C48H82O18â€¢3H2O with a molecular weight of 1001.2. Ginsenoside-Rd has been shown to inhibit
      receptor-operated Ca2+ influx through receptor-and-store-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCC) ,
      attenuate oxidative stress in stroke, reduce the size of the cerebral infarction and preserve
      brain functioning in animal models of acute ischemic stroke.
