      with moderate to severe psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of at
      least 10 and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of 3 (0-4 scale). Following run-in
      subjects received either oral 30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily or placebo once daily for 12
      weeks. Subjects attended the clinic at Baseline (Day 0) when they were reviewed and confirmed
      they met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects were then randomized and received either oral
      30 mg ZPL-3893787 once daily or placebo once daily for 12 weeks.
