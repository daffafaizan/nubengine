      Participants will be seen twice during the first week of treatment, weekly during the first 2
      weeks of treatment and then every 2 weeks up to the end of the 8-week treatment period.
      Participants who complete the 8-week treatment period will have a follow-up visit
      approximately seven days after the last visit. A safety follow-up phone call will be made 30
      days after completion of the 8-week treatment period.

      Based on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee which determined
      that the study data had met pre-determined criteria for futility, Takeda has made a decision
      to terminate the study. No safety concerns were identified by the Independent Data Monitoring
      Committee
