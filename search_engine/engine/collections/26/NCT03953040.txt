    
      Patients with NSTE-ACS presented to the study site fulfilling the eligibility criteria during
      enrollment period of 1 year. The culprit lesion(s) being responsible for the acute event will
      be revascularized by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Both OCT (OPTISTM, St. Jude
      Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) and IVUS (Boston Scientific iLabTM Ultrasound Imaging
      System, MA, USA) will be performed after PCI to examine the non-culprit lesion(s) for
      detection of atherosclerotic plaques with the morphological characteristics consistent with
      high-risk plaques, namely "Vulnerable plaques". Plaque characteristics from IVUS and OCT
      imaging will be merged to establish novel scores, which help improve diagnostic accuracy for
      detection of high-risk lesions. Correlations IVUS and OCT images will be performed to
      identify most reliable factors associated with plaque vulnerability.Patients will be followed
      up to 6 months after PCI for detection of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes (MACE) after
      ischaemia-driven revascularization of the culprit lesion(s).
