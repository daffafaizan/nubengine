      in patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphomas with cutaneous involvement.
      Primary cutaneous CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) represent a spectrum from
      lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), to primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (C-ALCL),
      to transformed mycosis fungoides (TMF).

      The most indolent form of primary cutaneous CD30-positive LPD is LyP, which is usually well
      controlled with low dose oral methotrexate, but control of the disease frequently requires
      life-long therapy. In contrast, TMF is an aggressive disease which does not have a standard
      of care, as patients are treated with various modalities of care with variable outcomes). The
      spectrum of other CD30-positive lymphomas with cutaneous presentation is very broad and
      involves systemic B and T cell lymphomas with various clinical behaviors.

      Redirecting Natural Killer (NK) cells towards these CD30-positive malignancies through direct
      engagement with AFM13 is expected to induce tumor cell killing through NK cell-mediated and T
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (i.e., cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)).

      The primary objective of this trial is to study the biologic and immunologic effects induced
      by the administration of various doses of AFM13, when given as a single agent.
