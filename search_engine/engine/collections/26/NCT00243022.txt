      Primary

        -  To determine whether a herbal approach to decreasing 5-LO eicosanoid production reduces
           peritumoral brain edema in patients with HGG.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if this adjuvant approach improves the quality of life and progression free
           and overall survival of patients with HGG.

      OUTLINE: This a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I (intervention): Patients receive oral Boswellia serrata herbal extract 4 times a
           day and oral cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) once a day for 6 months in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive oral vitamin B-12 once a day for 6 months. All
           patients are encouraged to eat a regular balanced diet (as recommended by the American
           Cancer Society for cancer prevention) with limited consumption of red and processed
           meats.

      Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and then at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
