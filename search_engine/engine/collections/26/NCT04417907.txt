    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design across different titration rates of
      perampanel in healthy volunteers. The study consists of 8 visits, 4 of which will occur at
      the participant's home, over a 7-week period. One hundred and three (103) normal healthy
      subjects will be treated with perampanel (PER) at one of four different titration rates: (1)
      2mg/day PER for one week followed by 4mg/day PER for five weeks, (2) 2mg/day PER for two
      weeks followed by 4mg/day PER for four weeks, (3) 4mg/day PER for six weeks, or (4) placebo
      (0mg/day PER) for six weeks. Cognitive and behavioral function testing along with safety
      testing will be conducted at screening, pretreatment baseline, the end of each week during
      the titration and maintenance period.
