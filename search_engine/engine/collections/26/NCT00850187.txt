      mitotic capacity of chondrocytes in vivo. Because some patients with articular cartilage
      defects may progress to osteoarthritis, such defects need to be repaired even though their
      exact natural course remains obscure. Traditional methods for repair, such as micro fracture,
      perforations, abrasion arthroplasty, have not produced consistent satisfactory long term
      clinical results. Transplantation of autologous bone marrow MSCs expanded in culture would be
      a promising approach in the repair of articular cartilage defects in human osteoarthritic
      knees. This method is clinically straightforward to perform because autologous cells can be
      readily harvested and expanded in culture without losing their capacity to differentiate into
      chondrocytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results obtained with
      autologous MSCs expanded in culture for the treatment of full-thickness chondral defects in
      human knee.
