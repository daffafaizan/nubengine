      Prior to give taping method participants who have hair around the shoulder was instructed to
      remove hair. Two types of tape was used, a self-adhesive 1.5" cotton undercover tape (VPK,
      Chennai) and a 1" rigid strapping tape (VPK, Chennai). To approximate the humeral head into
      the glenoid cavity participants were instructed to place their affected arm on a wooden
      table. Three piece of tape was used, firstly the investigators applied cotton undercover pre
      tape and then the investigators applied the rigid post tape on it. First piece (middle) of
      tape was applied from 1.5 inches below the deltoid tuberosity up to 2 inches above the
      glenoid cavity. Second piece (posterior) was applied from 1.5 inches below the deltoid
      tuberosity upto the 1.5 inches above the mid spine of scapula. Third piece (anterior) was
      applied from the 1.5 inches below the deltoid tuberosity upto the 1.5 inches above the
      clavicle. (Figure-1). The tape was removed and new tape applied every Monday, Wednesday, and
      Friday and remained on the patient for 6 consecutive weeks.

      All the participants were received standardized conventional neuro rehabilitation programme.
      The conventional neuro rehabilitation treatment includes, active, and passive range of motion
      exercise, bilateral activation of pectoralis major, activation of lattisimus dorsi,
      activation of the retractors, weight bearing exercise of upper extremity, activation of
      supraspinatus, reaching activities, grasping, holding and release, and ADL activities. Every
      participant was received conventional neuro rehabilitation for 45 minutes and 5 days a week.
