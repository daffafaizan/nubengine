      I. To establish a longitudinal cohort (n=10,000) of women who undergo mammography screening
      with follow-up for at least five years for each study participant or until breast cancer
      diagnosis.

      II. To create a repository of blood specimens from the cohort to use for biomarker discovery
      and validation.

      III. To create a comprehensive integrated database of imaging, clinical data, health
      measurements, and questionnaire data on the study participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete questionnaires over 15-25 minutes about personal and family history of
      cancer, health status, breast cancer risk factors, diet, weight gain, and physical activity,
      and undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and then annually for 5 years.
      Participants also undergo standard of care mammography at baseline and then annually for 5
      years.
