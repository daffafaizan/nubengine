      assess the effects of exercise on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which is
      a dose-limiting and painful side effect of chemotherapy for which there are no established
      treatments. The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized clinical trial in 40 cancer
      patients receiving chemotherapy where Arm 1 is 12 weeks of exercise during chemotherapy and
      Arm 2 is 12 weeks of nutrition education (control condition) during chemotherapy. The
      investigators will acquire data on CIPN via patient reports and clinical assessments as well
      as general pain and hypothetical mechanistic factors that may help explain how exercise may
      treat CIPN; these factors include measures of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,
      neuropsychological, and immunological function. The primary outcomes are related to the
      feasibility of identifying, recruiting, and obtaining complete data from research
      participants.
