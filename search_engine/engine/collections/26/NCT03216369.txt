    
      Patients:

      Patients with unilateral severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis of stroke eligible
      were enrolled who underwent CAS vs CEA.All patients underwent previous scan in 7 days before
      CAS and CEA and consecutive scan once per 24 hours after CAS and CEA.

      Baseline characteristics of patients were recorded including age,gender, hypertension,
      hypercholesterolemia, diabetes melitus, smoking, obesity, qualifying stroke event.

      Protocols:

      MRI scan protocols T2 weighted image,T1 weighted image,diffusion weighted
      image(DWI),fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR),arterial spin labeling(ASL) with Post
      labeling delay (PLD) of 2.0s,Territory ASL(TASL)(PLD=2.0s),3-dimensional Fast Spoiled
      Gradient Echo(3D-FSPGR).

      Imaging evaluationï¼š

        1. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) with post labeling delay (PLD) of 2.0s
           evaluation of cerebral blood flow in target downstream territory.

        2. FLAIR hyperintensity vascular sign.

        3. Collateral pattern assessment by Territorial ASL(TASL) (PLD=2.0s).

      Treatment strategy:

      Patients were randomly treated by CEA(carotid endarterectomy) or CAS(carotid artery
      stenting).

      Follow up:

      Patients were followed up every 24 hours after treatment procedure, and would have a repeat
      MRI scan after 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
