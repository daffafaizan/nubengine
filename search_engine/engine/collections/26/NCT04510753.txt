      uses a fingertip PPG sensor as a signal source. The system provides systolic, diastolic and
      mean arterial pressure values, for use in hospitals and other clinical settings. The PPG
      waveform is analyzed by a proprietary software algorithm, calculating BP values.

      The current best method to obtain similar information is by using an Arterial line catheter
      which will serve as a reference device. In this study, the sponsor aims to prospectively
      collect continuous radial arterial line & PPG waveforms, as well as NIBP data over the period
      of the surgery in order to test and refine the algorithm.
