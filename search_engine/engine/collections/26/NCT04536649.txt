      diagnosed glioblastoma. Patients will be randomly allocated with 1:1:1 to three groups:
      Control Group, standard-dose photon radiotherapy (60 Gy); Study Group A, standard-dose proton
      radiotherapy (60 GyE); Study Group B, standard-dose proton radiotherapy (60 GyE) plus
      induction carbon-ion radiotherapy boost (15GyE/3F). All patients will receive concurrent and
      adjuvant temozolomide according to the Stupp protocol. The primary endpoint is overall
      survival (OS). The secondary endpoint is progression-free survival, side effect and quality
      life.
