      surgery for head and neck cancers that are due to the human papilloma virus (HPV). In
      general, these cancers have better cure rates than other types of head and neck cancers.
      Therefore, the investigators are studying whether we can safely reduce the amount of
      treatment after surgery, such as surveillance (instead of using radiation) or less radiation
      or less chemotherapy, while maintaining good cure rates. The investigators hope that by
      reducing the intensity of treatment, this will lead to less side effects during and after
      cancer treatment.
