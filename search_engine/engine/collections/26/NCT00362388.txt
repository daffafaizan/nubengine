      undergone myocardial revascularization procedures (either percutaneous or surgical) but still
      remain symptomatic despite maximally tolerated medical therapy. Others are considered
      non-optimal candidates for a complete myocardial revascularization procedure due to the
      extension and diffuseness of the disease.

      Cell therapy with autologous bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) is a novel therapeutic strategy
      being tested for many cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, acute myocardial
      infarction, chronic ischemic heart disease.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of intramyocardial injection of
      autologous BMC on the myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function as an adjunctive
      therapy (compared to placebo) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the effect of intramyocardial injection of
      autologous BMC on functional class (angina/heart failure), functional capacity, global and
      cardiovascular mortality, and quality of life in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
      surgery (CABG).
