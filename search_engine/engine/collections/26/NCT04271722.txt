      high-resource countries. While the pharmacological modifications to the collagen matrix of
      the cervix, that allow it to dilate (cervical ripening) occur spontaneously in many women,
      allowing labour to be induced with oxytocin, in others the process needs to be triggered
      artificially. Cervical ripening is traditionally accomplished with prostaglandins or
      mechanical agents, in processes that typically require 12-24 hours of hospital stay. More
      recently, a limited number of hospitals have shifted towards starting the process in house,
      but then allowing women to return home and be re-evaluated on the following day.

      The main aims this study is to compare efficacy and patient satisfaction of mifepristone vs
      balloon catheter for cervical ripening.
