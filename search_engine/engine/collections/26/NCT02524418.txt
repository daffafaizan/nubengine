      SpyGlass Direct Visualization System for per-oral cholangiopancreatoscopy was introduced and
      since then has been shown to provide incremental diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. The
      main limitations of the original SpyGlass platform are fiber optic visualization system,
      limited tip angulation, square cut Spy scope tip, and complex multi-component setup. A new
      generation cholangioscopy platform, SpyGlass DS is currently in clinical use. The new system
      addresses many of the shortcomings of old platform including digital optics, improved tip
      angulation, tapered tip and simplified set up. It is unclear at this time whether this
      technical improvement will translate into better outcomes. Therefore, the investigators want
      to study the clinical utility of SpyGlass DS by prospectively collecting data on the clinical
      outcomes of patients undergoing cholangioscopy with Spyglass DS as part of their routine
      medical care.
