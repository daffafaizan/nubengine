        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of paclitaxel administered via
           hyperthermic retrograde isolated lung perfusion in patients with unresectable pulmonary
           malignancies.

        -  Determine the nature of the toxic effects of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between pharmacodynamic parameters and toxic effects of this
           regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel.

      Patients undergo posterolateral thoracotomy or median sternotomy. Patients receive paclitaxel
      over 90 minutes administered via hyperthermic retrograde isolated lung perfusion. The entire
      surgery lasts approximately 4 hours.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 months. Patients with responding disease continue to be
      followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 31 patients will be accrued for this study.
