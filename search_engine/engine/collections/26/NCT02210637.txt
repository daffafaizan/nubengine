      medical practice, representing a significant cost to the health care system, and resulting in
      disruption of daily work planning.Nonattendance at medical appointments has consequences not
      only for doctors (as it requires a greater use of resources and time), but also for patients,
      because there may be deterioration in the quality of care, and dissatisfaction associated
      with delays in obtaining a new appointment
