    
      Since April 2018, the study database has been updated with all patients (currently there are
      340 patients per group) and variables - both reflecting effectiveness of the procedure and
      cost. Preoperative variables being captured include comorbidity factors and variables
      relating to the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) score , which is a pre-procedure assessment
      of surgical risk.

      The postoperative data collection includes a variety of complications and comorbidities the
      patient could experience during their hospital stay. These variables will provide us with
      information regarding procedure effectiveness, patient recovery and further costs associated
      with the procedure. Medications and antibiotics provided during the stay are also being
      captured. Total hospital costs will include any costs associated with ward stay, separated
      per level of care: Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Cardiac Surgical Unit (CSU), and regular ward.

      The two follow up periods are 30 days and 6 months. Both look at the same effectiveness
      variables, any emergency room (ER) visits, re-admissions, and their respective reasons.
      Quality of life will be obtained by looking at the number of complications the patient
      experienced during these periods. The frequency of home care services provided to each
      patient, if any, are also being tracked. Cost calculations will be done by obtaining the
      time, length and number of visits to the ER, re-admissions and clinic visits.
