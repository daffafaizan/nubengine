      raises the importance of effective strategies for the primary prevention and treatment of the
      metabolic syndrome in order to combat the epidemic of type 2 diabetes and to reduce the
      increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.

      Increased sympathetic nervous system activity may participate in the pathogenesis and
      complications of the metabolic syndrome. This Study will use a randomised controlled design
      to evaluate the effects of pioglitazone treatment on sympathetic activity in middle-aged
      subjects with the metabolic syndrome.The results will generate new information on the
      neuroadrenergic effects of thiazolidinediones in this clinical setting. This is relevant to
      the understanding of the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome and to its clinical
      management.
