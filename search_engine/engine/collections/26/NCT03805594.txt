    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule of lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617
           (177Lu-PSMA-617) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic
           castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC). (Part A)

        2. To determine the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. (Part B (Dose Expansion))

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To characterize the safety profile of the combination.

        2. To determine the median duration of response by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

        3. To determine the proportion of patients who experience >= 50% decline from baseline in
           serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

        4. To determine the median PSA progression-free survival.

        5. To determine the median time to symptomatic skeletal related event.

        6. To determine the 6 month radiographic progression-free survival rate and median
           radiographic progression-free survival.

        7. To determine the median overall survival.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the lesion-specific response rate by baseline PSMA avidity on gallium Ga
           68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) positron emission tomography (PET).

        2. To quantify the change from baseline in T cell repertoire, circulating T cell subsets,
           tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry after
           one priming dose of Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (RLT).

        3. To explore the relationship between timing of the 177Lu-PSMA-617 priming dose with
           initiation of pembrolizumab with respect to immunologic, safety, and efficacy outcomes.

        4. To descriptively characterize the patterns of uptake on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET at the time of
           disease progression.

        5. To explore relationship between tumor genomic profile with clinical outcomes including
           response rate and progression-free survival.

        6. To explore the relationship between tumor dosimetry with objective response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to 1 of 3 treatment schedules.

      SCHEDULE 1: Patients receive lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617 intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes
      on day 1. Beginning in cycle 2, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

      SCHEDULE 2: Patients receive lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617 IV over 20-30 minutes and pembrolizumab
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

      SCHEDULE 3: Starting day -21, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes. Patients
      also receive lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1.

      In all schedules, treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles (2
      years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve
      stable disease (SD) or better may receive 17 additional cycles (approximately 1 year) of
      pembrolizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days.
