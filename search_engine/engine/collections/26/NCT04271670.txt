    
      A randomized, controlled trial with cross-over design in which the subjects (23 patients with
      an oncological disease, 13 healthy controls) receive warm water footbaths with added ginger
      (experimental) or mustard powder (experimental) or without additives (active comparator). The
      wash-out period between two consecutive footbath interventions is at least one day. Outcome
      measures are assessed right before (t1), right after (t2) and 10 minutes following the
      footbath (t3). The main focus is on the change in subjective perception of warmth
      distribution between t1 and t3. Moreover, the objective skin temperature distribution and
      psychosocial scores are assessed. The primary outcome measure is analyzed with a linear mixed
      effects model (after checking for carry-over effects). Secondary outcome measures are
      described descriptively.
