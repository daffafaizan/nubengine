    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This project involves 2 clinical studies. Members of known kindreds
      participate in Study I; members of kindreds who have not been surveyed, genotyped, or
      phenotyped participate in Study II.

      In Study I, participants undergo clinical, hormonal, radiologic, and biochemical studies.
      Assessment on unrestricted fluid intake includes body weight, urine volume, osmolality,
      creatinine, sodium, potassium, urea, glucose, arginine-vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin, and
      aquaporin-II.

      Participants with diabetes insipidus (DI) undergo a standard fluid deprivation test; those
      without DI undergo standard water load and hypertonic saline testing.

      Previously untreated DI patients may be given intranasal or subcutaneous desmopressin or oral
      chlorpropamide (adults only) for 2 or 3 days.

      Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary-hypothalamic area is performed on all patients
      with and without gadolinium.

      Infants and children are studied annually for the first 5 years or until they develop DI.
      Affected adults are studied every 2-5 years. Unaffected adults are re-tested only if they
      subsequently report de novo symptoms suggestive of DI.

      In Study II, participants undergo similar genotype and phenotype testing. Kindreds
      demonstrating the familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus phenotype and genotype are
      added to Study I. Kindreds found to have a different type of DI are directed into a companion
      protocol.
