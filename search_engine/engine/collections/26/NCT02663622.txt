      multi-center study to investigate adding CD24Fc to standard of care tacrolimus and
      methotrexate in acute graft-versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) with matched unrelated donors in treatment of
      leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of CD24Fc in patients undergoing matched
      unrelated donor myeloablative allogeneic HCT for malignant hematologic disorders. Three dose
      cohorts are planned with 240 mg at day -1, 480 mg at day -1, and the multi-dose cohort of
      480-240-240 mg at day -1, day 14 and day 28. The CD24Fc : placebo ratio is 3:1.

      The second part is a prospective open label phase II expansion cohort trial investigating the
      addition of CD24Fc to standard acute graft-versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Based on the Phase IIa safety
      results and the pharmacokinetic data, the Phase II expansion dose will be the multi-dose
      480-240-240 mg regimen administered on day -1, day 14 and day 28. The primary objective of
      phase II expansion is to determine if the addition of CD24Fc to standard GVHD prophylaxis
      improves 180 days grade III-IV acute GVHD-free survival (AGFS) when compared to CIBMTR
      database registered control patients who had standard GVHD prophylaxis alone. Eligible
      patients will be those requiring allogeneic HCT for malignant hematologic conditions and
      receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen.
