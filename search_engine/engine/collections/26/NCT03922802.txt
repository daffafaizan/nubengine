        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training modulates spinal
           locomotor networks in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves locomotor
           function in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves symmetry of
           gait in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether acute intermittent hypoxia therapy (AIH) combined with
           transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation during ambulation training improves standing
           posture and balance in individuals with spinal cord injury

        -  To determine whether ambulation efficiency (improved cardiovascular conditioning)
           improves with a combination of AIH, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation and
           ambulation training in individuals with spinal cord injury
