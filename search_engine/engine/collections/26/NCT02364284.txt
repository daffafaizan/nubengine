    
      This will be an observational, historical cohort study from medical chart review of adult
      hospitalized patients for each of the three conditions of interest (complicated urinary tract
      infection (cUTI), complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP)
      including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)). For this study, the proposed patient
      selection period extends for 12 months, from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. Patients selected
      during this period will be followed from diagnosis (i.e., diagnosis of cUTI, cIAI or NP)
      until symptom resolution, discharge or 30-days post discharge [based on data availability to
      assess readmission and outpatient visits], death while hospitalized, loss to follow-up or the
      end of study period if not yet discharged from index hospitalization [December 31, 2014]).
