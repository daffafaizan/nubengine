    
      GSK1120212 has demonstrated anti-proliferative activity against a broad range of tumors cell
      lines and xenograft models. To date, MEK inhibitors have demonstrated evidence of both
      pharmacodynamic and clinical activity in early trials.

      This is the first clinical experience in Japan with GSK1120212, a novel MEK inhibitor. This
      study is designed to identify recommended doses and regimens in Japanese subjects for the
      future development of GSK1120212.

      This study will be conducted in subject with solid tumors, and GSK1120212 single agent
      treatment to assess safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy (Part 1) and combination treatment
      with gemcitabine in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary
      cancer, urothelial cancer or other tumor types for which gemcitabine has been approved in
      4-week schedule to assess safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy(Part 2) will be conducted in
      the same protocol.
