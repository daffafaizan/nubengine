      and, consequently, affect activities of daily living (ADL). Some authors suggest that the
      rest of hand could decrease pain and inflammation. Splints are external appliances that used
      in a specific body part provides the best alignment and rest in correct functional position.
      The goal of a hand, fingers and thumb in RA is stabilize the hand while the patients are not
      making theirs ADL and try to decrease the pain.
