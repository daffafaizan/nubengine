        1. Screening period, Subjects will be included in the screening period after signing the
           informed consent form (ICF). The screening period is up to 28 days, subjects will enter
           the study treatment period if they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of exclusion
           criterion.

        2. Treatment period, Subjects will be allocated to the designated dose group to receive
           corresponding treatment in accordance with the progress of study.

           Enrolled subjects will receive DLT observation at first, and upon completion of DLT
           observation, the subjects will continue their administration at the original dose if
           they are tolerated as judged by investigator, until progression of disease, intolerable
           toxicity or other reasons specified in the protocol. Response evaluation criteria in
           solid tumors (RECIST v1.1) will be used for efficacy evaluation every 9 weeks (±7 days)
           in the first year and every 12 weeks (±7 days) in the 2nd year and thereafter.

        3. Follow-up period, safety follow-up visit is required 30 days (±7 days) after the last
           dose of study drug or before the initiation of new antitumor therapy. If the new
           antitumor therapy has not been initiated, additional safety follow-up should be
           completed 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose as far as possible.
