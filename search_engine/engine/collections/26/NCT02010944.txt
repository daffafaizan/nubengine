    
      There are three parallel groups each with 24 healthy male and female subjects (with a minimum
      of 10 subjects per gender). Each group receives one dose strength.

      The study utilizes a partial replicate cross-over design with three periods and each subject
      receives the same strength of either the FDC or SET formulation twice.

      Screening takes place within 21 days before admission and subjects are admitted on Day -1.
      Dosing takes place on Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Subjects remain
      fasted until 4 hours post-dose. There is a wash-out period of at least 14 days between each
      dose administration.

      Subjects are discharged on Day 4 and return to the clinical unit on Days 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11
      for outpatient assessments.

      An End-of-Study Visit (ESV) takes place on Day 11 of Period 3 or within 7-14 days after
      discontinuation.
