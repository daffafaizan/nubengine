      cold is an important regulator of BAT development and function. Yet, little is known about
      the regulation of BAT in humans.

      With this study the investigators aim to investigate the effects of seasonal changes in
      outdoor temperature on genetic markers of BAT in human deep neck adipose tissue.

      Project participants are patients who are admitted to Aarhus University Hospital for elective
      neck surgery. Operations are primarily due to suspected malignancy in the thyroid gland or
      hyperparathyroidism.No additional surgery is necessary to obtain the biopsies.
