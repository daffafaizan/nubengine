      atopic dermatitis (AD or eczema) by 10 weeks of age. The aim is to compare the effect of
      proactive sequential skin care, including the twice-daily use of a tri-lipid skin barrier
      cream (Epiceram) and proactive use of fluticasone propionate cream, against reactive AD
      therapy, to reduce the occurrence and severity of AD in early infancy and thereby prevent
      food allergy (FA). The study design will randomize participants to 2 groups to receive either
      regular trilipid cream and proactive topical steroids or reactive therapy (i.e. no systematic
      skin care).
