      Patients receive copper regulation therapy with zinc acetate: an existing cohort on
      maintenance therapy will be followed for long-term data collection; presymptomatic patients
      are treated prophylactically; and pregnant patients are evaluated for fetal outcome. All
      patients are evaluated for copper balance, clinical control, and toxicity.
