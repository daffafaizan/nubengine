      the highest need for effective, culturally congruent and community-based suicide prevention.
      Drs. Rasmus and Allen have been working collaboratively with Yup'ik communities in the Yukon
      Kuskokwim region and Dr. Wexler has been doing community-based participatory research in
      Northwest Alaska (NWA) for 20 years. Both research teams have spent this time partnering with
      tribal communities and developing evidence-based and self-determined suicide prevention
      initiatives that reflect local, AN understandings and values, strengthen community systems of
      support, and build local capacity for strategic prevention practice. The collaborative hub
      will extend this successful partnership model to include all of the tribal health regions
      across the state. With relevance for all of rural Alaska, the Alaska Native Resilience Study
      will provide important insights into the community level factors-institutions, traditions,
      resources and leaders-and mechanisms-the community perceptions, practices and norms-that
      increase resilience from suicide and reduce risk. The resulting Alaska Community Resilience
      Mapping (AK-CRM) Tool will provide a user-friendly, visual representation of the
      community-level protective factors and processes, and will engage Alaska community members in
      identifying the community-level protective factors in their community and will offer
      scientifically-based recommendations for action. In this way, ANCHRR's proposed activities
      translate results from the research study into practical suggestions for tribal leaders,
      local practitioners and policy makers, to maximize its public health impact.
