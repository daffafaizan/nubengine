    
      i. Diagnosis:

        1. History taking [personal, medical and dental].

        2. Clinical examination using mirror and probe.

        3. Radiographic examination to make sure that the caries is simple.

        4. Preoperative photograph is taken.

      ii. Interventions to each group

        1. Group A: Live modelling technique

             1. In the 1st dental visit the operator will start by measuring the behavior of the
                child by Frankl behavior rating scale.

             2. A cooperative patient will be the model for the child.

             3. In the 2nd dental visit the pulse oximetry device will be installed on the child's
                finger and another form of Frankl behavior rating scale is filled.

             4. The treatment is performed as follows:

           i. Place topical anesthesia. ii. Place anesthetic injection. iii. Cavity preparation.
           iv. Filling material placement. v. Finishing of the filling. e. The child will be asked
           to complete a facial image scale

        2. Group B: video modelling technique (1) In the 1st dental visit the operator will start
           by measuring the behavior of the child by Frankl behavior rating scale.

             1. A recorded film will be shown to the child.

             2. In the 2nd dental visit the pulse oximetry device will be installed on the child's
                finger and another form of Frankl behavior rating scale is filled.

             3. The treatment is performed as follows:

           i. Place topical anesthesia. ii. Place anesthetic injection. iii. Cavity preparation.
           iv. Filling material placement. v. Finishing of the filling. d. The child will be asked
           to complete a facial image scale.

        3. Group C: No modelling

             1. In the 1st dental visit the operator will start by measuring the behavior of the
                child by Frankl behavior rating scale.

             2. In the 2nd dental visit the pulse oximetry device will be installed on the child's
                finger and another form to Frankl behavior rating scale.

             3. The treatment is performed as follows:

           i. Place topical anesthesia. ii. Place anesthetic injection. iii. Cavity preparation.
           iv. Filling material places. v. Finishing of the filling. d. The child will be asked to
           complete a facial image scale.
