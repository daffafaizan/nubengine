      classical protocol including the use of a naso-gastric tube and starvation for several
      postoperative days till the recovery of bowel movement, or bed resting at immediate
      postoperative period followed by ward ambulation at the postoperative day 1 or 2. Restarting
      the oral alimentation is based on gas or feces reappearance after surgery and usually this is
      possible at several days following surgery. However, prolonged starvation might be
      uncomfortable for the patient as well as increasing his postoperative hospital stay.
      Recently, several studies reported the efficacy of early rehabilitation protocols after
      intestinal surgery, showing that early oral alimentation could reduce the length of hospital
      stay and cost of hospitalization without significant increase of postoperative complications,
      compared to traditional management.

      This prospective, randomized study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      postoperative care pathway using rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet for patients
      undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal resection compared with the traditional
      postoperative care.

      In order to conduct this study, patients having a laparoscopic colon resection will be
      randomly attributed to enhanced recovery program group or control group, which is divided
      based on the postoperative management protocol.
