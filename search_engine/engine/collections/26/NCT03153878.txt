      addition, the investigators will analyze the benefit-risk of antithrombotic or anticoagulant
      therapy in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms associated with ischemic heart
      disease or ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The investigators aim to use research data to
      create a China national database of UIA. This study is supported by a research grant from the
      Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China. The investigators will
      collaborate with the other 19 medical centers which locate in the different districts of
      China.

      During the study period, all the patients included in this study will observe and treat in
      the collaborating medical centers. Included patients will be followed-up for at least 1year.
      Research data will represent the real natural course of UIA in China. For this study, the
      investigators consulted and hired professional experts about data collection, data and
      methodology. An intact systematic project steering committee, including Data Monitoring
      Committee, Data Management Committee, Project Academic Committee, Executive Group, Project
      Manager, Project Statistician, and Technical Support Center has been built up. Scientific
      regulations have also been made
