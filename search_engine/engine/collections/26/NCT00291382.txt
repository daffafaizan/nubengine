    
      A multi-centre, randomised, double blind, stratified, and parallel group study to evaluate
      whether a treatment strategy based on aiming for 'Total control' results in better airway
      hyper-responsiveness than a treatment strategy based on maintaining the treatment level at
      which 'Well-controlled' asthma was achieved.
