      environmental factors. Marketplace trends for excessive and growing portion sizes in and
      outside the home have reinforced concerns that large portions may directly contribute by
      promoting excessive intake. To date, however, systematic investigation of portion size
      effects on children's eating has been extremely limited. Two laboratory studies have reported
      that serving large portions of macaroni and cheese to young children promoted energy
      consumption at meals. Whether portion size effects would be seen with other foods of varying
      energy content and preference is unknown. Of particular public health interest is whether
      serving large portions may affect children's intake of sweetened beverages, fruits and
      vegetables, and energy dense foods. This study will address these questions using an
      experimental approach to test the effects of portion size on children's eating.
