    
      Epispadias is the mildest form of exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC); a congenital
      malformation disorder involving the midline abdominal and genitourinary structures. Patients
      with epispadias have a defect in the urethral sphincter resulting in urinary incontinence.
      This trial investigates the injection of autologous primary human muscle stem cells into the
      urethral sphincter with the aim of repairing the defect and restore the anatomic ability for
      continence.

      Eligible participants will undergo muscle biopsy during a routine cystoscopy. Acquired muscle
      tissue is used for the isolation and expansion of muscle stem cells ex-vivo. Muscle stem
      cells are injected into the urethral sphincter under visual control using cystoscopy.
      Participants are assessed for safety and efficacy for a minimum of 12 months
      post-intervention.
