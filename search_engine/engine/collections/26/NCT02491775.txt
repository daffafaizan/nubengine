      baseline along with tumor samples obtained prior to starting afatinib and at the time of
      disease progression (a total of two tissue samples and one blood sample per patient). The
      samples will be collected via consent to the IRB (Institutional Review Board) approved
      banking study "Tissue and Blood Acquisition for Genomic Analysis and Collection of Health
      Information from Patients with Thoracic Malignancies, Suspected Thoracic Malignancies, or
      Mesothelioma".

      If carried out successfully, the proposed strategy very likely will lead to a larger and
      adequately powered study (perhaps using whole genome sequencing) to understand fully evolving
      molecular changes due to clonal selection under treatment pressure. The pace of progress in
      the field of sequencing technology currently underway is only likely to accelerate in the
      near future yielding richer and highly content-rich information. Moreover, it is likely that
      genomic information from DNA sequencing and transcriptome will be supplemented by analyses of
      translatomes and proteomes.

      Successful completion of the proposed study would enable future studies to fully harness the
      potential of emerging technologies to develop novel approaches to treat and even ideally
      prevent resistance to EGFR TKIs (tyrosine-kinase inhibitor) and other molecularly targeted
      therapies. This could serve as a template for other cancer types as well. Over time, this
      approach, broadly used, would create simultaneously, highly valuable annotated tumor
      specimens along with germ line DNA for high-throughput genomic studies to identify novel
      targets and their impact on the course of disease. Re-analyzing molecular changes in the
      tumor at the time of disease progression would likely be a new standard of care to guide
      salvage therapy.
