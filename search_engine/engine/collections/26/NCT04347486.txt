      for reversal of neuromuscular blockade, aged between 2 and 18 years old.

      After routine anesthetic induction with 1% propofol and 0.6mg/kg of rocuronium, maintenance
      of anesthesia with total intravenous anesthesia is commenced. For neuromuscular monitoring,
      train-of-four (TOF) count and T4/T1 ratio are monitored, with recording of the time to
      recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9.

      On reappearance of T2 after rocuronium administration , 2 or 4 or 8mg/kg of sugammadex sodium
      or conventional neuromuscular reversal agent is administered according to randomization
      table.

      For pharmacokinetic analysis, patient blood sample is obtained before / 2 min after
      rocuronium administration, before / 2min / 5min / 15min / 60min / 120min / 240min / 480min
      after sugammadex administration. Plasma concentration of rocuronium and sugammadex sodium are
      analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection.
