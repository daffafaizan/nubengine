      key role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In addition, the activity of
      non-histone proteins can be regulated through HDAC-mediated hypoacetylation. In recent years,
      inhibition of HDACs has emerged as a potential strategy to reverse aberrant epigenetic
      changes associated with cancer, and several classes of HDAC inhibitors have been found to
      have potent and specific anticancer activities in preclinical studies.

      Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a relatively uncommon lymphoma histotype, with an incidence in
      Italy of approximately 1700 new cases per year (approximately 12% of all lymphomas).
      Combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy cures approximately 70 percent of
      advanced-stage HL. Fifty percent of the failing patients can be salvaged by second line
      chemotherapy (mainly high-dose regimens), while the remaining patients eventually die by
      disease progression. The development of an effective salvage regimen for this
      refractory/resistant population represents a true unmet medical need.

      The use in the latter patient subset of HDAC inhibitors, like ITF2357, is supported by
      several considerations. Namely: (1) a chemically related HDACi hydroxamate has shown activity
      in this clinical condition; (2) the drug markedly inhibits the production of several
      cytokines, and cytokine production in HL granuloma has a defined role in the pathogenesis of
      HL; (3) an effective treatment for refractory/relapsed HL is presently lacking; (4) ITF2357,
      up to 200 mg daily per os, has shown a favorable toxicity profile. All the above mentioned
      arguments represent a strong rationale prompting the use of ITF2357 in this patient
      population.
