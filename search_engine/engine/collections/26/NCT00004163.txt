      find the exact primary completion date (PCD) or study completion date (SCD). The September
      2001 date used for both is based on known enrollment dates and an estimate on median time to
      progression (TTP) in the setting of this clinical trial. Since participants were treated
      indefinitely until progression, TTP is deemed to reflect generally the time on treatment for
      evaluation of the primary response outcome. Furthermore, patients were followed for
      progression to estimate TTP, a secondary outcome measure.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to trastuzumab in patients with advanced or
      metastatic salivary gland cancer. II. Determine the time to progression in these patients
      after this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of trastuzumab in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histology: intercalated duct (adenoid cystic
      carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade
      adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) vs excretory duct (squamous cell
      carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
