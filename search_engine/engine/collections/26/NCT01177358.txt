      botulinum. The toxin specifically inhibits release of the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine at
      synaptic junctions, thus preventing neuromuscular transmission, and inducing paralysis of the
      muscle.

      Previous studies have indicated that tensile forces on the skin may affect the healing of a
      wound. These forces act against the immature collagen laid down during wound healing and may
      stimulate overgrowth, thereby contributing to the formation of hypertrophic scars or keloids.

      Using botox to paralyse the underlying muscles may reduce the tensile force on the overlying
      skin, and thus reduce scar formation and promote healing. Botox has also been shown to affect
      the cell cycle distribution of fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scars.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effects of BTX-A in wound healing and the
      reduction of scar formation.

      Patients undergoing a thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy will be randomized to receive either
      BTX-A injections along the surgical site or placebo immediately following closure. All
      incisions will be sutured in a similar fashion. BTX-A or normal saline will then be injected
      along the platysma muscle. The patient and the surgeon will be blinded to the treatment arm.
      Photographs will be taken of the surgical site at 4 weeks and 6 months. The patient and two
      otolaryngologists will independently score the healing of the wound using a standardized
      scoring method. The scores be compared between the two surgeons to determine correspondence
      and interobserver reliability.

      The scores of the two treatment arms will be compared to reveal the effect of BTX-A on wound
      healing.
