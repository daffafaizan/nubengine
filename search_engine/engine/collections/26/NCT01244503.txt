      of NAFLD (non alcoholic fatty liver disease).

      Octanoate is absorbed promptly from the intestinal lumen and transported rapidly to the liver
      through the portal venous system, enters the hepatic mitochondria independently of the
      carnitine transport system and undergoes hepatic mitochondrial beta-oxidation which produces
      acetyl coenzyme A (CoA). Finally, acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle and is oxidized by carbon
      dioxide (CO2). This is a non invasive test that can be performed routinely at every visit to
      assess disease severity. The subject is connected to a breath analyzer via a nasal cannula
      for approximately 1 hour, that measures baseline breath and changes in delta over baseline
      due to metabolization of Octanoate.
