    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase I study of panobinostat, carfilzomib in patients
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Based on the preclinical data supporting the use
      of combined histone de-acetylase (HDAC) and proteasome inhibition, the incidence of
      single-agent panobinostat and carfilzomib anti-myeloma activity, and clinical data
      demonstrating safety and efficacy of panobinostat with a different proteasome inhibitor
      (bortezomib), this study will evaluate the combination of panobinostat and carfilzomib in
      patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in a phase I trial.
