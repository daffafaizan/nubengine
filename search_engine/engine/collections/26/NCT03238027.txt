    
      This is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 study consisting of Phase 1a and Phase 1b. The
      study will evaluate SNDX-6352 monotherapy (in Phase 1a) and SNDX-6352 combined with
      durvalumab (in Phase 1b) in patients with advanced solid tumors which must have progressed
      following prior treatment and have no standard therapy alternatives left (i.e.. patients must
      not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit). The primary objective will
      be to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of SNDX-6352 as monotherapy (Phase 1a) and in combination
      with durvalumab (Phase 1b) as evaluated by the incidence of AEs that are defined as DLTs. In
      both study phases, a standard "3+3"dose escalation schema will be used to determine an MTD
      with 3-6 evaluable patients enrolled per dose level. The RP2D will be determined based on
      data from the dose escalation patients as reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC;
      comprised of investigators and the Sponsor).
