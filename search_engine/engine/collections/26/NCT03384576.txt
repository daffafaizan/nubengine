      level. If the patient meets the low acuity requirement and if they have a wait time greater
      than 20 minutes then the caregiver will be approached to obtain informed consent once they
      have been placed in a room. If they choose to be included in the study, the patient's medical
      record number will be recorded, a personal identification number will be assigned, and the
      patient's information will be entered into the personal identification number key and into
      our research database. A questionnaire asking participants age and relation to patient and
      the state-trait anxiety inventory will be administered to the caregiver. An additional
      question of perceived wait time will also be asked.
