      on post-chemotherapy fatigue among 150 cancer survivors age 65 and older -- Senior Physical
      Activity after Chemotherapy (S-PACT). Participants must have potentially curable cancer,
      moderate to severe fatigue (score of 4 or higher on the Brief Fatigue Inventory), currently
      exercise less than 120 minutes per week and have completed chemotherapy treatment (radiation
      treatment must also be completed if it is part of the patient's treatment plan) within the
      last 6 weeks. The design is a randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to a
      3-month physical activity program (intervention group) or to wait-list control (this group
      begins the walking program at 3 months post-randomization). The primary objective is to
      compare the change in fatigue scores from baseline to 3 months between the intervention and
      wait-list control groups.
