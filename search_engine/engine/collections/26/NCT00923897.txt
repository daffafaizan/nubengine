      metastatic disease. Gastrointestinal tumours, breast, lung and melanoma are the most common
      primary sites for hepatic metastases. Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is the sixth most common
      cancer worldwide, with over 600,000 new cases diagnosed per year. It is the third most common
      cause of cancer related death.Although, predominately a disease in Asia and sub-Saharan
      Africa, the incidence of HCC is increasing in North America. The use of radiation in
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas, as well as hepatic metastases, for palliation is
      uncommon in clinical practice.

      This may be because there is a prevailing perception that radiation to the liver will
      inevitably lead to radiation induced liver disease (RILD). However, several single
      institution, predominantly retrospective studies, have demonstrated effective palliation for
      locally advanced HCC as well as hepatic metastases with minimal toxicity.In this study,
      palliative radiotherapy (RT), delivered in one fraction of 8Gy, will be given to symptomatic
      patients who are not candidates for radical treatment. We hypothesize that palliative RT will
      provide symptomatic relief to a large fraction of the patients, with both primary and
      metastatic disease. We also expect minimal toxicities at this treatment dose.
