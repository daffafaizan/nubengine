    
      This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase 2 study of pegfilgrastim given either
      the same day as or the day after a chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (R-CHOP).

      Chemotherapy was administered every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in subjects with aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; mantle cell or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Subjects were
      administered R-CHOP on day 1 of each cycle. All subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms: arm A subjects were administered pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day 1 of each cycle (within 4
      hours of chemotherapy completion); arm B subjects were administered pegfilgrastim 6 mg on day
      2 of each cycle (at least 24 hours after chemotherapy completion). All subjects were
      administered placebo on the day they did not receive pegfilgrastim. A total of 77 subjects
      were enrolled at 24 centers across the US. Protocol treatment duration for subjects was up to
      18 weeks (6 three-week cycles).
