      for children with post-concussion syndrome. Forty children with post-concussion syndrome
      referred to the Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) Complex Concussion Clinic will be
      randomized to receive either usual care in the NCH Complex Concussion Clinic (comparison) or
      usual care in the NCH Complex Concussion Clinic plus four weekly sessions of C-STEP
      (treatment).

      C-STEP has been developed for patients with post-concussion syndrome. The CBT intervention
      involves 4 primary components: psychoeducation, activity management, sleep hygiene, and
      relaxation training (adapted from McNally et al., 2018). Psychoeducation involves providing
      patients and families with information about typical concussion symptoms and recovery, the
      role of non-injury/psychological factors in post-concussion syndrome, and information about
      the mind-body connection. Activity management involves setting specific goals to achieve a
      return to normal daily activities such as school attendance, schoolwork completion, household
      activities, and participating in social/leisure activities. The sleep hygiene component
      involves providing individualized recommendations to promote healthy sleep habits such as
      eliminating naps, keeping a consistent sleep schedule, turning off electronics at bedtime, or
      other needed modifications. Finally, relaxation training involves teaching specific
      evidence-based strategies for relaxation and coping with stress such as diaphragmatic
      breathing and progressive muscle relaxation.
