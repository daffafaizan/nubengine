      small, benign adrenal lesions. In addition to the common laparoscopic lateral transperitoneal
      adrenalectomy, the posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy is becoming increasingly
      important.

      To date, there is no consensus regarding the preferred approach in the resection of benign
      adrenal tumors. A comprehensive adrenal tumor program should be able to offer both options,
      however, patient selection criteria for a given approach have not yet been defined. The
      choice between lateral transperitoneal adrenalectomy and posterior retroperitoneal
      adrenalectomy is relevant for patients with unilateral tumors < 6-7 cm and without previous
      abdominal surgery.

      The aim of this study was to determine the limits of posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy
      using anatomical parameters to enable the preferred access to be chosen preoperatively to
      prevent conversion. In addition, the investigators describe the relationship between these
      parameters and the operation time to find a measure of the degree of technical difficulty.
