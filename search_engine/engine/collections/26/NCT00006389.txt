      I. Determine the response rate and survival in patients with metastatic or unresectable
      carcinoma of the stomach treated with bryostatin 1 and cisplatin.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      molecular determinants of response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 72 hours on days 1-3 followed by cisplatin IV over 1
      hour on day 4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
