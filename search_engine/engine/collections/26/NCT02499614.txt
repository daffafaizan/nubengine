      pretreated NSCLC patients with ROS1 translocation or MET amplification or MET exon 14
      mutation (figure 1). Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, pretreated with at
      least one previous chemotherapy line and with at least one measurable tumor lesion will be
      considered eligible for the trial. All potentially eligible patients will be evaluated for
      MET and ROS1 by FISH to detect MET amplification or ROS1 translocation. MET mutation will be
      assessed using direct sequencing or high sensitive methods. After evaluation of inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, and after signature of informed consent form, all MET amplified or MET
      exon 14 mutation or ROS1 translocated eligible patients will receive crizotinib 250 mg BID
      p.o until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
