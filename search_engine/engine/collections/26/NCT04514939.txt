      flow, within the venous system. Venous return results from the interaction of diverse
      mechanisms, such a central pump (respiratory cycle and the heart), a pressure gradient, a
      peripheral venous muscular pump, and the veins valvular system. Therefore, the venous volume
      in the lower limb is the result of the interaction between these mechanisms and reflects the
      balance between blood inflow and outflow. Blood outflow improves during sleeping because of
      the lying position and, in this position, even more with leg elevation. In fact, it is known
      patients with chronic venous disease (CVD) improve leg symptoms in lying position and with
      leg elevation.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the level of comfort of hospital inpatients, without
      CVD, if they lie with a moderate leg elevation during hospital stay.

      Unselected patients with a hospital stay of at least seven days will be recruited and random
      assigned to two groups of patients: Group A, that will lie in their hospital bed with a
      moderate leg elevation (between 15 and 30 degrees). Group B, that will lie in their hospital
      bed without leg elevation.

      All patients will undergo echo duplex scanning of vascular system of lower limbs to exclude
      any vascular disease.

      For every patient complete demographic and comorbidity data will be collected. Every single
      the day, the following parameters will be retrieved for each patient: ankle and calf
      diameters, heart rate, blood pressure, breath frequency, body temperature, leg heaviness
      (rating scale 1-10), perceived leg comfort (rating scale 1-10), hours of night sleep
      (number).
