      Eligible subjects in this pilot study will be taught a series of Kiko exercises. Subjects who
      meet inclusion and exclusion criteria at the screening visit will be given a diary in which
      they will document their migraine frequency and severity for one month. Once subject diaries
      are complete, subjects will meet for a group lesson to learn the background of Kiko and study
      exercises. A DVD or videotape will be issued for subjects to use during practice at home.
      Subjects will maintain a diary of their migraine headaches, as well as a diary of their
      exercise routines. Subjects will meet weekly to reinforce training and encourage training
      continuation. Diaries will be collected at the end of the first, second, and third months.
