        -  To allow women undergoing breast conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer to
           have access to accelerated partial breast irradiation therapy on a controlled trial.

        -  To capture prospective data on acute and late toxicity and disease recurrence in
           patients treated with this therapy.

        -  To summarize the institutional experience of these patients treated with this
           experimental therapy.

      OUTLINE: Within 9 weeks after surgery, patients undergo accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (including conformal external-beam irradiation, interstitial brachytherapy,
      intracavitary brachytherapy, or proton beam irradiation) twice daily for 5 days (10
      fractions).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 to 6 months for at least 5
      years and then annually thereafter.
