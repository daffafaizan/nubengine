      environmental exposures and genetic predisposition influence disease manifestations. Our work
      has identified a new area of genetic linkage for leiomyomas from a genome wide scan. We
      therefore propose to prospectively collect biologic samples that will allow us to analyze
      gene/environment interactions of women enrolled in leiomyoma clinical trials or undergoing
      leiomyoma clinical treatments using the same methodology used previously. Specifically we
      will collect serum aliquots, genomic DNA and information using a genetic epidemiology
      questionnaire. In the short term we will also be able to use prospectively obtained
      information on epidemiologic and anthropomorphic data to characterize women undergoing
      treatment.
