      study will be conducted over a one-year period until data from 20-40 patient encounters is
      obtained. There will be no randomization and no control group. Information will be collected
      from all patients who meet the study´s inclusion criteria. Patients will be given a survey to
      complete at baseline, on all days of chemotherapy, and for five days after the conclusion of
      chemotherapy using the BARF Scale and a 4-point Likert scale. The information collected from
      the survey will include the incidence and severity of nausea and emesis, evaluation of
      appetite, activities of daily living, and rescue medications used for acute CINV. The
      specific chemotherapy regimen that each patient receives will be recorded. Any data
      identifying the patient will be de-identified after all pertinent data is collected.
      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze data.
