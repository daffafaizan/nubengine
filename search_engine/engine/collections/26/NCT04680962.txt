      ACR criteria will be randomized to receive treatment with stable methotrexate therapy with
      either MabionCD20, MabThera or Rituxan. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 24 weeks
      to establish pharmacokinetic and clinical similarity and to compare PD, safety and
      immunogenicity parameters between the three rituximab products.
