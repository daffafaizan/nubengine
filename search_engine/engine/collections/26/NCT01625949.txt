      The benefit of opening an infarct related artery after the period of myocardial salvage (In
      patients who do not come to medical attention within 24 hrs of an infarctions) has been
      questioned in recent trials. On the other hand, Stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction
      has been shown to improve myocardial function both in the acute and chronic phases. It is
      possible that the lack of benefit seen with late revascularization (>24 hrs) after MI may be
      offset by giving intracoronary stem cells after opening the artery. Patients with recent
      myocardial infarction (MI) and occluded infarct related arteries supplying a large myocardial
      territory and with reduced ejection fraction will be randomized to a percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) arm and a PCI plus stem cell arm .

      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate that opening an infarct related artery after 24
      hours and before six months and following it with intracoronary stem cell therapy may provide
      incremental benefit.

      The primary objective

      To demonstrate benefits in left ventricular recovery (improvement in function by
      echocardiogram and Nuclear imaging: Multigated acquisition [MUGA], reduction in scar size by
      tetrofosmin scan/Positron Emission Tomography[PET]. )

      The secondary objectives

      To demonstrate improvement in functional capacity as assessed by 6 minute walk test and
      quality of life assessment, along with reduction of first occurrence of recurrent MI,
      hospitalization/treatment of New York Heart Association class IV congestive heart failure, or
      death
