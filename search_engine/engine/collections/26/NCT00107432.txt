      I. To determine the response rate (partial response (PR) and complete response (CR)) in
      patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with BAY 43-9006.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine 3-month failure free survival in patients with malignant mesothelioma treated
      with BAY 43-9006.

      II. To describe the median and overall survival of malignant mesothelioma patients treated
      with BAY 43-9006.

      III. To describe the toxicity profile of BAY 43-9006 in patients with malignant mesothelioma.

      IV. To determine whether mesotheliomas contain mutations in exons 11 and 15 of the B-raf gene
      and correlate these findings with anti-tumor activity of BAY 43-9006.

      V. To determine whether the amount of expression of phospho-ERK1/2, as determined by
      immunohistochemistry from pre-treatment tumor specimens, correlates with anti-tumor activity
      of BAY 43-9006 in patients with mesothelioma.

      VI. To determine whether baseline levels and changes following BAY 43-9006 treatment in
      angiogenic cytokines (VEGF and PDGF) correlate with anti-tumor activity of BAY 43-9006.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 2 months for 1
      year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
