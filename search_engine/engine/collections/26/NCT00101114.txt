      I. To assess response (confirmed complete and partial responses) of patients with advanced
      renal cell cancer treated with the combination of BAY-43-9006 and interferon alfa-2b.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the probability of treatment failure at 6 months and the median overall survival
      of this group of patients.

      II. To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen. III. To
      investigate in a preliminary manner the association of tumor response with measures of
      increased signaling through the Ras-Raf pathway (p-MAPK, p-JNK, p-p38, and p-AKT), with VHL
      gene status, and whether changes in levels of IL-6 and tumor markers of hypoxia including
      PAI-1, VEGF, and osteopontin correspond with clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28 and interferon alfa subcutaneously
      on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.
