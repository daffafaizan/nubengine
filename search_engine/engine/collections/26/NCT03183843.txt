      valve replacement using mechanical prostheses warfarin is administrated during the whole
      life. Biological prostheses allows do discontinue anticoagulation 3 months after surgery in
      the absence of other risk factors of thrombosis especially atrial fibrillation. The common
      approach to patients with mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation is mitral valve
      prosthetic replacement concomitant to Cox-Maze procedure. This allows to maintain sinus
      rhythm in 65-80% of patients. In the study the safety and efficacy of dabigatran in
      comparison with warfarin will be evaluated after the mitral valve surgery and Cox-Maze
      procedure.
