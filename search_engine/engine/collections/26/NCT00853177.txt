      micro-injection. Initially done by laparoscopy with general anesthesia, the oocyte collection
      is now carried out by trans-vaginal controlled ultrasound puncture. This potential painful
      event, related to trans-vaginal puncture or mechanical movements of the stimulated ovary,
      requires analgesia or anesthesia. General anesthesia is certainly effective in terms of
      collected oocytes. It remains, however, a heavy time consumer, with personal risks and
      distributor of anesthetic agents in blood or follicular fluid. These products could have a
      deleterious effect on early embryonic development or implantation. Few data are available
      concerning these risks in the literature. General anesthesia is still essential for
      pusillanimous patients or for patients with a heavy surgical past. Nitrous oxide is an
      inhaled gas with properties widely used in obstetric during parturition. It is regularly used
      during general anesthesia performed for oocyte retrieval. With a gas composed of 50% N2O and
      50% O2, its main interest is to provide analgesia in a state of conscious sedation. The
      effects of nitrous oxide in this form had never been assessed on the clinical or biological
      Oocyte collection. We conducted a preliminary study to assess pain in patients receiving
      local anesthesia, according the current protocol. Thus, 44% of patients had severe pain (VAS>
      40/100) during or just after transvaginal oocyte retrieval. In our preliminary experience,
      immediate or distance post-operative pain was high and we plan to evaluate the benefit of
      analgesia with nitrous oxide in terms of immediate post-operative pain with a prospective,
      randomized and controlled study as compared with local anesthesia associated to Alprazolam.
