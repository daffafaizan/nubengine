      OZ439 OD administered with full fat milk for three days to healthy male and female subjects
      between 18 to 55 years of age, using features of an adaptive study design. The study is
      expected to have three cohorts with a total of 36 healthy male and female subjects. An
      additional two cohorts may be used if required. The results of this study will inform the
      maximum tolerated exposure of OZ439 following OD dosing for three days in subjects who are
      not fasted.
