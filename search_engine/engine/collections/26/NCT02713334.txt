    
      For Phase 1 of this study, the investigators will conduct a prospective, observational study
      with cancer patients undergoing tumor genomic profiling (n = 300) and their family members
      (anticipated n â‰ˆ 150). Data collection will occur through an embedded mixed methods design,
      in which both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., semi-structured interview)
      data are collected at the same timepoint in order to obtain a more complete understanding of
      specific processes and outcomes.

      They will be recruited from those who already enrolled in protocol #12-245, and who agree to
      receive their secondary findings through Consent Part C of this existing protocol.

      For Phase 2 of this study, participants (n=500) who have received pathogenic secondary
      findings through protocol #12-245 will be recruited.
