      and chronic pain. CS is as important as nociceptive component in the pathogenesis of
      OA-related pain. Therefore, the necessary interventions for CS should be also considered when
      deciding the treatment protocol.TENS and IFC have been safely and commonly employed in the
      conservative treatment of knee OA. However, there are limited and inconsistent data
      concerning the impact of these modalities on CS component of pain.Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to investigate whether these agents are effective on CS and they are superior to
      each other.
