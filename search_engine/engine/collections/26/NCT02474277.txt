      for rehabilitation is difficult as it has to been performed within 48 hours. Is it possible
      to use the the Chair Stand Test in combination with admission complaints and identified risk
      factors to predict the need for rehabilitation? An investigating of the Chair Stand Test is
      needed, as its validity with hospitalized patients is undocumented.
