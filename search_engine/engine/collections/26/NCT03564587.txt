      focused on increasing hope in order to improve quality of life and health-promoting behaviors
      in survivors of young adult cancer. Adaptation of this intervention to incorporate messaging
      for adolescents and their guardians has the potential to have a long-term impact on
      adolescent cancer survivors. The goals of this project are to adapt the AWAKE platform into
      an intervention acceptable for use in adolescent cancer survivors and their guardians in
      order to improve survivors' hope, quality of life, and health-promoting behaviors, and to
      generate the preliminary data needed for a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of
      the AWAKE platform in this population.
