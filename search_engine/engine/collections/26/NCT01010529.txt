      participation of patients. Occupational Therapy aims to optimise functional performance and
      engagement in meaningful roles and activities. The lack of scientific evidence for the
      effectiveness of Occupational Therapy (OT) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) highlights the urgent
      need for high quality intervention studies. The recently developed Dutch clinical practice
      guideline for OT in PD offers a good basis for conducting an intervention study. This
      proposed pilot study is an important step towards setting up a large scale RCT to evaluate
      the effectiveness of OT in improving daily functioning of patients with PD and reducing
      caregivers' burden.
