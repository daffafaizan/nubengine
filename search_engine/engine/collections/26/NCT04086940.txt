      bariatric surgery. Sympatholytic drugs might decrease the need for intravenous or Inhalation
      anesthetics and opioids. In this study we wanted to analyze effects of esmolol on
      intraoperative anesthetic-analgesic requirements, postoperative analgesic requirements,
      postoperative pain, PNV and hypoxia.

      Methods: Sixty patients have been included. Propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium were used for
      induction. Study groups were as follows; group E Esmolol infusion was added to maintenance
      anesthetics (Sevoflurane and fentanyl), group N only Sevoflurane and fentanyl was used during
      maintenance. They have been monitored during the intraoperative period and postoperatively
      for 24 h for analgesic requirements and PNV. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain was
      also been assessed.
