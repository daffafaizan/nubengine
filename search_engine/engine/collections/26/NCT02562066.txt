      phase for up to 4 weeks until stable dose and frequency of amifampridine phosphate is
      achieved for 7 days. After this phase, blinded treatment effect will be assessed in a
      randomized fashion of continuation or cessation of drug (Placebo) starting with Period I
      (duration 7 days). Following experimental Period 1, patients will be returned to the stable
      dose administered at the end of the open-label run-in period for approximately 2 weeks,
      followed by cross over treatment in Period 2 dosing for 7 days. After completion of Period 2,
      patients will be eligible for expanded access with restoration of open-label amifampridine
      phosphate at the same dose and frequency as established in the run in phase of the study.
