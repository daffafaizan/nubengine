    
      TREATMENT PLAN

        -  The patients will be admitted to laminar air flow room.

        -  The patients will have triple lumen Hickman central venous catheter (CVC) placed. Chest
           X-ray should be taken after CVC placement to confirm the location of CVC and absence of
           pneumothorax.

        -  Menstruating women will be given norethindrone (Primolut) 10 mg po daily.

             1. The preparatory regimen is as follows:

                Conditioning therapy will start on day -5 in patients who are randomized to receive
                Cy+ATG. Hydration with 0.45% NaCl at 6 liters/24 hours will be started on day -5.
                Cy 50 mg/kg in D5W 200 ml i.v. over 1-2 hours on days -5 to -2 by pump through a
                central venous catheter. Mesna 12 mg/kg iv push immediately before Cy and 3, 6, 9,
                and 12 hours after Cy. Thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 0.5
                mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL (less than 2 mg/mL) iv daily
                at 8 am on days -4 to -2. Premedication for ATG (ALG) will include
                methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg iv infusion, Tylenol 600 mg po, and Avil 45.5 mg iv
                push. The doses of cyclophosphamide and ATG (ALG) will be calculated using actual
                body weight.

                Conditioning therapy will start on day -7 in patients who are randomized to receive
                Flu-ATG. Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 will be infused intravenously over 30 minutes in D5W
                100 ml for 6 consecutive days (days -7 to -2). Thymoglobuline 3 mg/kg in N/S
                500-800 mL (less than 0.5 mg/mL) or lymphoglobuline 15 mg/kg in N/S 500-800 mL
                (less than 2 mg/mL) iv daily at 8 am on days -4 to -2. Premedication for ATG (ALG)
                will include methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg iv infusion, Tylenol 600 mg po, and Avil
                45.5 mg iv push. The doses of cyclophosphamide and ATG (ALG) will be calculated
                using actual body weight.

             2. GVHD prophylaxis will include cyclosporine plus methotrexate.

                The patients will receive cyclosporine 1.5 mg/kg in NS 100 ml i.v. over 2-4 hours q
                12 hrs (dose of cyclosporine rounded to nearest 5 mg) starting day -1 at 6 a.m.
                Cyclosporine dose will be adjusted to provide appropriate level and according to
                the change of renal function (see Appendix II).

                Cyclosporine dosing will be changed to oral dosing when oral feeding became
                feasible at the twice the i.v. dosages.

                In addition, the patients will receive methotrexate 15 mg/m2 i.v. push on day 1 and
                10 mg/m2 on days 3, 6, and 11. The dose of methotrexate will be decreased or
                omitted according to the guideline provided in Appendix III.

                The dose of cyclosporine will be decreased by 10 % every month starting day 60 of
                BMT provided that there is no clinical evidence of GVHD.

             3. Hematopoietic stem cell collection from the donors.

      Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells are used but bone marrow collection in case of sibling
      donor is permitted.

      Bone marrow collection

        -  Packed red cell 2 units will be collected from donor for autologous transfusion before
           hematopoietic stem cells collection.

        -  Hematopoietic stem cells are collected from bone marrow under an appropriate anesthesia.

        -  After collection, Feroba 1T bid will be given to the donor for 1 month.

      Mobilized peripheral blood stem cell collection

        -  Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 10 mcg/kg will be
           administered sc to stem cell donors daily for 4 days (from day -3 to day 0).

        -  Daily CBC will be done.

        -  Starting day 4 of G-CSF administration (day 0), peripheral blood mononuclear cells will
           be collected by leukapheresis CS3000 for 2 days (days 0 and 1). A sample will be taken
           for cell count of total cell, mononuclear cells, CD34+ cell, CD3+ cell, CD4+ cells, and
           CD8+ cells.

        -  After the sampling, the final product will be infused to the patients immediately on day
           0 and day1.

        -  At least 2x10^6/kg of CD34+ cells should be collected on day 0. If not, additional
           collection may be scheduled under the discretion of attending physician.

           4.Hematopoietic stem cell infusion

        -  For ABO matched or minor mismatched transplantation, premedication with Avil 45.5 mg
           i.v. push and tylenol 600 mg p.o. will be given. Stem cell will be infused via CVC over
           1 hr.

        -  For major ABO mismatched transplantation, premedication with Avil 45.5 mg i.v. push,
           tylenol 600 mg p.o., 10 % mannitol 100 g i.v. over 4 hrs will be started 30 min before
           stem cell infusion, and hydrocortisone 250 mg i.v. will be given immediately before and
           30 min of stem cell infusion. Stem cells will be infused via CVC over 1 hour.
