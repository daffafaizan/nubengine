    
      Aim of the study To determine the improvement in diagnosis of papillary carcinoma by
      detecting mutation V600E BRAF in retrospective cases with inconclusive cytologic diagnosis
      (categories III, IV and V of Bethesda System).

      Design: Retrospective observational study. Scope: The study will be peformed at the Pathology
      Service, from cytological samples and paraffin file post-diagnosis. Mutations are detected by
      pyrosequencing technique.

      Subject of study:

      Cases with histological diagnosis of papillary carcinoma (CP) and previous cytological
      diagnosis in groups III, IV and V Bethesda, collected between October 1989 and July 2014 in
      Corporació Parc Taulí.

      Methodology:

        -  Identification of cases

        -  Detection of BRAF V600E mutation, initially in histological material from the surgical
           specimen, and if present, detection in cytological material.

      The statistical analysis will use SPSS. Univariate and bivariate analysis will be done.
      Results will be presented in the form of frequency tables and percentages for qualitative
      variables and by average, median and standard deviation for quantitative variables. Pearson
      chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be applied. The Student t test or the Mann-Whitney
      test will be performed for quantitative variables.
