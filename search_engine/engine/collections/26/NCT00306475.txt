      disorder. It has been found that cognitive dysfunction may be even more important than
      positive or negative symptoms in predicting functional outcomes such as community adjustment,
      ability to work, social interactions, and caretaker burden. Preclinical data from our
      laboratory provided the rationale for a clinical trial to test whether divalproex sodium ER
      can improve cognitive impairment in patients.

      The major objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the addition of
      divalproex sodium to an atypical antipsychotic drug other than clozapine will significantly
      improve: a) cognition; and b) psychopathology (positive, negative, and mood symptoms) in a
      double-blind, randomized trial of 6 weeks duration in patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.
