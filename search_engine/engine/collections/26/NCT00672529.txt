      although it is commonly used by naturopathic practitioners to treat respiratory problems in
      individual children. A well-designed controlled trial is needed to determine if this approach
      is effective. This smaller study should establish guidelines for a large trial to follow.
      This proposed research is particularly important, as the trend to use natural treatments may
      encourage non-compliance with conventional medical treatments, leading to poor asthma
      control.
