        -  Determine the incidence of fungemia in relation to the number of admissions to the
           hospital in patients with solid tumor or hematologic malignancy or in patients who have
           undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the fungal species distribution, prognostic factors for outcome, and crude and
           attributable mortality in patients also diagnosed with fungemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, prospective study.

        -  Group A (no documented fungemia at study entry): Data regarding the number of patients
           with cancer or who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, including
           those who develop documented fungemia, who are admitted to the hospital is collected for
           2 years.

        -  Group B (documented fungemia at study entry): Fungal strains isolated from the initial
           positive blood culture are collected and undergo examination, including confirmation of
           species identification, susceptibility testing, and/or minimum inhibitory concentration
           determination. Data, including antifungal treatment, clinical and microbiological
           response to antifungal treatment (at 2, 4, and 12 weeks after diagnosis), and survival
           status, is collected for each documented fungemia episode* for up to 12 weeks after
           diagnosis of fungemia.

      NOTE: *That occurs within a 2-year period.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study.
