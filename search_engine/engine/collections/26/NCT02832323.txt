      circulation. They are easily monitored on every automatic dosing machines. Nevertheless,
      among the dialysis population, they are seldom used and attempt to define a normal
      reticulocyte level, attesting a correct medullar response to the administrated EPO dose
      failed due to the timing of blood collection (corresponding to the Nadir day of
      reticulocytosis).

      In a preliminary study, it has shown that reticulocyte count kinetics depends on ESA's type,
      dose and administration frequency. Reticulocyte kinetics were compared in three groups of
      stable dialysis patients, depending on their ESA treatment. Reticulocyte curves under a
      monthly Mircera® treatment were different from the other ESAs, showing a high reticulocyte
      peak (av. 80 000 reticulocyte/ml) occurring on Day (D)8-D10 after Mircera® administration. On
      the contrary, at nadir's point (D20-D30 after injection), reticulocyte levels are low for all
      the patients, preventing from any interpretation of the reticulocyte level at monthly routine
      assessment. It looks as though it is the peak level of reticulocytes that should be used as a
      marker of ESA response.

      Therefore, monitoring of reticulocytes would support the therapeutic decision on the need to
      adapt the EPO dose.

      The study is design to determinated the interest of the reticulocyte peak in the daily
      practice
