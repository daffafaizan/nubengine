      weight gain, increase hunger and carbohydrate craving.

      The present study is designed to address whether in T2D, a change in meal timing;
      specifically, by adding calories, protein and carbohydrates to the breakfast vs.the omission
      of breakfast will influence the postprandial elevation of glucose, insulin, intact GLP-1,
      glucagon and free fatty acids (FFA) after subsequent meals at lunch and dinner.

      The investigators expect that compared to the day with breakfast condition the day when the
      breakfast will be omitted the postprandial glucose , free fattly acids, and glucagon response
      after lunch and dinner will be significative higher while insulin and intact GLP-1 response
      after lunch and dinner will be reduced
