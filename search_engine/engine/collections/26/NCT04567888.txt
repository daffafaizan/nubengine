      which participants receive access to Happify Teens, a digital platform rooted in several
      therapeutic traditions that aims to improve wellbeing, or a waitlist control group. Both
      group conditions last 8 weeks. Participants assigned to the Teen Happify platform will have
      full access to the Teen platform of Happify, with featured tracks that focus on dealing with
      stress, worries and building building skills for greater happiness. Participants assigned to
      the waitlist (control) condition will be asked to not download Happify for the complete
      duration of the 12 weeks. Once the 12 weeks is over, participants in the waitlist control
      will receive access to download the Teen Version of Happify. Participants will be asked to
      complete questionnaires before, during, and after the 8-week program as well as 1 month
      follow-up questionnaires after the program is complete, at which point study participation
      will end.
