      young children and child mortality is very high. Despite availability of interventions to
      improve maternal health, the major issue in implementation of those interventions is because
      of limited availability of trained health professionals . Therefore the aim of this study is
      to train TBAs in delivering Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based intervention called
      "Changing your life with seven sheets of paper". Participants will be recruited from low
      income area in Karachi. Total 36 participants will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups;
      intervention and Treatment As Usual (TAU) group. Total 8 sessions will be delivered by
      trained TBAs over the period of 3 months.
