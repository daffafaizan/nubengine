      based antiretroviral regimen. As a consequence, enfuvirtide resistant virus can emerge. It is
      not yet known if enfuvirtide has continued virologic or immunologic benefit after the
      drug-resistant variant emerges. Interrupting enfuvirtide may reduce the accumulation of
      enfuvirtide mutations and may allow for a potent response of enfuvirtide with future
      regimens.

      Subjects must have evidence of viral replication (HIV RNA > 1,000 copies/ml on two
      consecutive measurements) while on a stable antiretroviral regimen containing enfuvirtide.
      Patients will then interrupt enfuvirtide while continuing all other antiretroviral agents.
      Subjects will be seen weekly for four weeks, every two weeks for an additional 8 weeks, and
      then every four weeks through week 48.

      Plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+/CD8+ T cell counts will be measured in real time at each
      visit, and provided to the referring primary care physician. Subjects will be allowed to
      resume enfuvirtide at any time during the course of this study. Subjects will be encouraged
      to resume enfuvirtide (with or without modifying the background regimen) if plasma HIV RNA
      levels increase by > 0.5 log on two consecutive occasions. Subjects are seen every four weeks
      for 24 weeks after enfuvirtide is resumed.

      Plasma will be collected at those visits for HIV RNA and stored for retrospective
      genotype/phenotype evaluation.
