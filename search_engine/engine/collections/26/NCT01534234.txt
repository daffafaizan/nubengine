      been observed that approximately 30% of recipient patients are non-responsive to therapy.
      This non-responsiveness can be decreased by optimizing the device programming, particularly
      the stimulation rate, paced and sensed atrioventricular (AV) delay, and the interventricular
      (VV) delay.

      All CRT patients need a 100% rate of ventricular capture, but beyond this the achievement of
      therapy effectiveness requires the identification of the optimal pacing configuration, which
      varies among patients. The optimization of CRT systems, usually based on ultrasound imaging
      is time-consuming and the number of patients in need of multiple optimization procedures due
      to ventricular remodeling is growing rapidly.

      The mechanical effects of a more coordinated contraction result in a shortening of the
      isovolumetric contraction phase and the pre-ejection time, and an increase in LV dP/dt
      (change in left ventricular pressure over time. The concept of measuring contractility with
      an implantable accelerometer was first clinically validated through a multicenter study on a
      rate responsive pacing system (BEST - Living from SORIN Biomedica) in 1996. This study
      positively demonstrates that measurement of Peak Endocardial Acceleration signal (called PEA
      or SonR) is feasible and reliable in the long-term, both for the purpose of rate response and
      as a hemodynamic monitor of cardiac function.

      More recent clinical studies have demonstrated that optimal VV and AV Delays determined using
      algorithms based on SonR signal analysis (SonR method) are correlated with the highest
      hemodynamic improvement and lead to significant clinical benefit for the patients, thus
      reducing the rate of non-responsiveness to CRT therapy.

      Therefore, automatic AV and VV delay optimization in patients with CRT devices could benefit
      both the patient and physician.
