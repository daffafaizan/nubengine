      length inequality (LLI), determine if there is an association between foot posture (flat
      foot, normal, and high arch) and LLI, and gather preliminary data on lift therapy as a
      treatment for LLI and knee/hip symptoms. The specific aims of the project are as follows:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the validity and reliability of 4 clinical methods for assessing
      LLI.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine differences in static and dynamic foot postures between longer and
      shorter limbs.

      Specific Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of conducting a specific lift therapy intervention
      among individuals with a LLI and knee or hip pain, refining procedures as needed.

      Public Health Impact: Results from the proposed research will be used to: 1) improve
      diagnosis of LLI by providing evidence on the various assessment methods for the clinicians
      who most frequently use clinical methods (i.e., physical therapists, chiropractors,
      podiatrists, and primary care physicians), and 2) develop and test new
      non-pharmacologic/non-invasive intervention strategies aimed at reducing pain and improving
      function in individuals with osteoarthritis and LLI.
