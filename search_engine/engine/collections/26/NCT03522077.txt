      function to stop bleeding without obstructing radial artery flow, and have been shown to
      reduce the occurrence of radial artery occlusion.

      The SoftSeal-STF hemostatic pad is an FDA-approved, chitosan-based, non-woven pad with a
      unique, proprietary fiber structure that when hydrated with tissue fluids forms a gel-like
      synthetic clot. Its mechanism of action is believed to be due to bioadhesion between the
      chitosan polymer chains, which are positively charged, and the negatively charged blood and
      tissue components, thereby stopping bleeding.

      In this study the RadAR EasyCLik and TR BAND® Compression devices will be used with the
      SoftSeal®-STF hemostatic pad to promote hemostasis at the puncture site. Both vascular
      compression devices are FDA approved.

      The VascBand™ Hemostat is an FDA-approved compression device designed to assist hemostasis of
      arterial, venous and hemodialysis percutaneous access sites.
