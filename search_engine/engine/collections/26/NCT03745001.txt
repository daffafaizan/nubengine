    
      This Phase 1, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be
      conducted in 2 parts: the single ascending dosing (SAD) will constitute Part 1 and the
      multiple ascending dosing (MAD) will constitute Part 2. In Part 1 (ie, SAD) of the study, up
      to 64 eligible subjects will be randomized with an allocation ratio of 3:1 to receive EHP-101
      Liquid or matching placebo within one of up to 8 sequential cohorts; Sentinel subjects (1
      receiving EHP-101 Liquid and 1 receiving placebo) will be dosed prior to dosing the remaining
      6 subjects to allow for observation of adverse reactions before exposing the Investigational
      Product (IP) to a greater number of subjects, in the SAD cohorts. In Part 2 of the study, up
      to 40 eligible subjects will be randomized with an allocation ratio of 4:1 to receive EHP 101
      Liquid or matching placebo within one of up to 4 cohorts. Dose-escalations, initiation of a
      single-dose food effect cross-over investigation and the start of the MAD part of the study
      will be coordinated by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) following review of available safety
      data.
