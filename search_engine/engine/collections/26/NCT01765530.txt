      coated with a thick bacterial biofilm, which is a potential source for bacterial colonization
      of the lower respiratory tract and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Accumulation of
      mucus/secretions on the interior of the ETT also effectively lowers the cross section of the
      ETT and increases significantly the work of breathing in intubated patients, who then require
      increased MV support, with prolonged intubation and ICU stay.

      A primary goal for all ICUs is to shorten the time of MV, to decrease the incidence of ETT
      microbial colonization and ultimately VAP incidence. To meet this goal several airways
      technologies to maintain the ETT free from debris/bacteria have been developed in order to
      improve the current ventilator-liberation standards in intubated critically ill patients.

      Based on preliminary laboratory, animal and clinical data, The investigators now wish to test
      the hypothesis that a novel commercially available ETT cleaning device can be effective in
      targeting two specific issues:

        -  Specific aim 1: To evaluate the mean difference in ETT luminal volume of ETTs cleaned
           with the novel cleaning device (EndOclear) vs. ETT cleaned in the standard manner.

        -  Specific aim 2: To determine whether ETTs cleaned with the novel device show a lower
           degree of microbial colonization for the entire period of mechanical ventilation.

      Data about in-vivo respiratory mechanics measurements, microbial diversity and antibiotic
      resistance analysis, users' feedbacks and safety of the device will also be collected.

      The investigators will conduct a clinical trial on 74 intubated patients randomized to
      receive standard ETT cleaning or cleaning with the EndOclear.
