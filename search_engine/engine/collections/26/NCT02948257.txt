      arteriotomies, it is important to collect performance and complication outcomes data related
      to this procedural variable. The aim of this registry is to consistently collect prospective
      data on procedural outcomes on antegrade access cases closed with the VASCADE VCS in a way
      that is consistent with the RESPECT Study design and the FDA-approved Instructions for Use
      (IFU).
