      repetitive twisting movements affecting one body part; in some patients, the entire body can
      twist and contort painfully. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are normally used to
      evaluate changes in brain structure in DYT1 dystonia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      is a painless, non-invasive method to test how your brain conducts electrical messages to the
      rest of your body, including your muscles.

      If you are a DYT1 dystonia patient, then this study involves up to three visits. The first
      visit (before DBS surgery) will last about 4 hours and the second and third visits (after DBS
      surgery) will last about 4 hours as well. These visits will include a complete physical and
      neurological exam, video recorded dystonia and mood rating scales, followed by
      electromyography (EMG) and TMS sessions. Subjects who have already undergone DBS surgery may
      participate in applicable visits based on the length of time since their DBS surgery.

      If you are a control subject, this study involves one visit, about 4 hours long. This visit
      will include TMS and EMG sessions.
