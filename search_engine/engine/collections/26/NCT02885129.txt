    
      During a routine appointment (D0), the patient filled a newsletter and a questionnaire to
      complete.

      The doctor collects medical informations for the case report form.

      At the end of the first consultation (D0), an additional EGOMAC scale and a stamped envelope
      is delivered to the patient by asking him to fill that scale to 15 days and return it by Post
      Office (reproducibility study).

      Finally, a new scale will be addressed to the patient at the end of 3 months, which will
      return by Post Office too (stability study).
