      All sites will participate in a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial, with 80-120 sites
      total. This design is helpful when simultaneous implementation of an intervention is not
      feasible or practical, and allows for each site to collect baseline data for comparison with
      post-intervention data. There will be 3 groups (or clusters) of approximately 30-40 sites
      each, with randomization to intervention occurring at 2 month intervals. Randomization will
      be stratified by: geographic region, size and baseline rate of IVF use.
