    
      Recurrent pleural effusion (PE) is associated with impaired quality of life, the main symptom
      being dyspnea. The mechanisms causing dyspnea in PE is not fully understood. These patients
      are in need of recurrent therapeutic thoracentesis.

      By evaluating the movement of diaphragma before and after thoracentesis and measure the
      patients symptoms before thoracentesis and until the next thoracentesis the researchers aim
      to clarify the temporal development in symptoms and the role of the diaphragm.

      The researchers will also evaluate the ability of the pulmonologist and patient to predict
      when the patient will need the next therapeutic thoracentesis in patients with recurrent
      unilateral pleural effusion.
