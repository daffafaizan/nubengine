      conventional fractionation irradiation, tumor cells will accelerate repopulation after 3 to 4
      weeks during radiotherapy, resulting in decreased efficacy. Hypofractionated radiation is
      increasingly used in radiotherapy of lung cancer. It can shorten the overall treatment time,
      and can potentially reduce the effect of tumor accelerated repopulation. Compared with
      conventional radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy can theoretically obtain a higher
      biological effective dose (BED). The application of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
      (SBRT) or Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in advanced or central lung cancer is
      restricted when the tumors are adjacent to important organs. Moderate hypofractionated
      radiotherapy can not only shorten the overall total treatment time, but also reduce the
      severe toxicities. It is widely used in lung cancer nowadays. However, most data of the
      tolerated doses for normal tissue and organs comes from conventional radiotherapy. Whether or
      not it is suitable for hypofractionated radiotherapy has not been determined. In our study,
      the incidences of Grade III and above radiation-reduced esophagitis and radiation-reduced
      pneumonia, as well as their predictors, were obtained by retrospective analysis of patients
      received moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy of 3Gy/f. At the same time, the efficacies of
      this scheme are also evaluated.
