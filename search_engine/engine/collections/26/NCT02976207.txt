      upper airway evaluation during artificial sleep before surgical treatment for patients with
      obstructed

      .)OSA(sleep apnea

        -  Aim: To evaluate the value of DISE for tailoring the proper treatment for patients with
           snoring and OSA DISE is a safe procedure, easily practicable, valid and reliable. We
           consider it a fundamental clinical procedure that is essential before choosing the
           surgical treatment. Our results so far suggest that a multilevel collapse is
           significantly associated with higher apnea hypopnea index values. We think that the
           weight did not play a significant role in RDI (Respiratory Disturbance Index) reduction.
           Our results till now show tailored surgery based on DISE may leverage sleep surgeries
           outcome significantly presenting 70% success rate based

        -  on our experience We therefore want to evaluate the patients in a long follow up period
