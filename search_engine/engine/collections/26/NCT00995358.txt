      advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who had failed
      for the standard therapy indicated that the vaccine treatment were well tolerated and
      feasible, and that antigen-specific T cell responses were strongly induced by the vaccination
      with some objective clinical responses. Thus, we are currently initiating the randomized
      phase II clinical vaccination study for the same cohort with ESCC to evaluate the survival
      benefit of the cancer vaccination.
