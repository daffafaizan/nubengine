      some measure of pain and anxiety. Patients have been reported to suffer from recurring
      distressing recollections of, or dreams about, the surgery and other post-operative,
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder-like sequelae. High anxiety during surgery correlates with
      post-operative psychological disturbances. Notably, listening to music reduces anxiety in
      patients undergoing awake surgical procedures. Nonetheless, DBS is typically performed
      without music because ambient noise typically interferes with interpretation of neuronal
      recordings. Recording objective and subjective measures of stress during DBS provides a
      unique opportunity to determine the effect of music on intra-operative patient anxiety levels
      in patients listening to music compared to non-music listening control patients. The
      investigators hypothesize that playing music will improve intra-operative anxiety as measured
      by objective and subjective measures of stress, including blood pressure, heart rate,
      cortisol levels and anxiety questionnaires. Additionally, previous data in the investigator's
      lab has demonstrated that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) responds to melodic music by
      decreasing the average frequency of neuronal firing. The investigator's pilot study also
      suggests that STN and thalamic neurons respond differently to melodic music; the neurons in
      the STN increase synchrony of firing, while neurons in the thalamus decrease synchrony of
      firing over the course of the music clip. The investigators, therefore, aim to characterize
      the neuronal firing pattern changes in patients undergoing awake DBS procedures in greater
      detail, drawing from a larger sample size.
