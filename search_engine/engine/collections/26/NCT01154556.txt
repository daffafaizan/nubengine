      records who began treatment with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and
      subsequently failed. Patients who have virologically failed previous NNRTI treatment, or have
      resistance to 1 drug in the NNRTI class are examined further. Such patients will have
      attended the clinic every 3-6 months for routine medical care. The data source for variables
      collected is the patient's electronic medical records. This database is located at Holdsworth
      House Medical Practice (HHMP), Sydney.
