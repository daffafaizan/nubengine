      I. Determine the acceptability and completion rates of free HPV vaccination among the
      underserved adult patients at the Volunteer in Medicine Clinic (VIM) in Jacksonville,
      Florida.

      II. Determine if an education program on HPV vaccination increases the acceptability of free
      HPV vaccination among the underserved adult patients at the Volunteer in Medicine Clinic
      (VIM) in Jacksonville, Florida.

      III. Determine the baseline prevalence of HPV vaccination completion rates among VIM patients
      age 18-45.

      IV. Determine if there are differences in acceptance and completion rates of HPV vaccination,
      among VIM patients of different sex, age (18-26 versus [vs] 27-45), ethnicity or race,
      following an education program on HPV as part of this protocol participation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive educational materials on HPV and are asked of their willingness to proceed
      with the first HPV vaccination. Patients who express interest in receiving the HPV
      vaccination, then receive the first dose of the HPV vaccine and the next 2 doses
      approximately 2 months and 6 months following the initial vaccine.
