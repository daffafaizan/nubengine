      mutation or deletion in the gene that is responsible for producing blood-clotting factor VIII
      protein. Individuals with hemophilia A suffer from repeated bleeding episodes, often into the
      joints, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometime results in death due to the
      inability of the blood to clot efficiently. This chronic joint disease can have significant
      physical, psychosocial, and quality-of-life effects, including financial burden. The current
      treatment is intravenous (i.v.) injections of factor VIII protein products, either 2-3 times
      weekly or in response to bleeding.

      Recent preliminary clinical data of a hemophilia B gene transfer study (which is also being
      conducted by Spark Therapeutics) shows all study participants achieving therapeutic factor IX
      activity levels (average of maintaining factor IX activity levels around 30% of normal with
      no confirmed bleeds, after receiving Spark gene transfer, with the approach of using the
      novel bio-engineered recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector carrying a high
      specific activity of a factor IX gene. The approach being tested in this clinical research
      study uses a further modified novel AAV vector (with a stronger attraction to the human
      liver) to deliver the human factor VIII (hFVIII) gene into liver cells so that they can
      produce factor VIII protein.
