      I. To determine if the utilization of a prophylactic antibiotic during the postoperative
      period will decrease the rate of urinary tract infection (UTI) post robot-assisted radical
      cystectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify pre- and post-operative factors that may be associated with the development of
      a 90-day UTI following radical cystectomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (ANTIBIOTIC): Patients receive ertapenem orally (PO), levofloxacin PO, or clindamycin
      PO induction therapy per standard of care. At the time of full diet, patients receive
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole PO daily or nitrofurantoin PO daily on days 1-30. Patients
      complete a drug diary for each day they receive the antibiotic.

      GROUP II (CONTROL): Patients receive ertapenem PO, levofloxacin PO, or clindamycin PO
      induction therapy per standard of care.

      After surgery, patients are followed up to 120 days.
