      is also a source of inflammatory mediators. This study is a randomized, open-label study,
      designed to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor inhibits inflammation and improves vascular
      endothelial cell function to a greater extent than clopidogrel in ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction(STEMI) patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients
      who are scheduled to undergo emergency Percutaneous Coronary Intervention(PCI) will be
      randomly assigned to receive ticagrelor 180mg for treatment group or clopidogrel 600mg for
      control group ,then after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention(PCI) treatment group treated
      with ticagrelor 90mg twice daily while the control group received clopidogrel 75mg once a day
      . All patients should receive Acetylsalicylic Acid(ASA) 300 mg as a loading dose before
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention(PCI) then 100 mg daily unless intolerant. Glycoprotein
      Ⅱb/Ⅲa receptor antagonists and low-molecular-weight heparin and other additional medication
      will be directed by the treating cardiologist. All interventions will be performed via the
      radial approach with the standard technique within 12h after they are involved, and
      drug-eluting stents will be placed according to stenosis of coronary artery.

      The vascular endothelial function will be tested by Circulating Endothelial Cells (CECs) and
      levels of inflammation will be tested by CD40 ligand (CD40L), C-reactive protein (CRP), and
      P-selectin to identify that ticagrelor inhibits inflammation and improves vascular
      endothelial cell function to a greater extent than clopidogrel.
