      Targeted medications such as trastuzumab, bevacizumab and lapatinib have recently been more
      extensively adopted for many cancers, particularly breast cancer. Among these targeted
      medications, bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody acting on vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor and it works by preventing the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).
      Published articles indicated that monotherapy of bevacizumab on breast cancer showed only a
      9-17% response rate, while combining with paclitaxel, the treatment outcome appeared to
      improve progression-free survival and the objective response rate. We are curious about the
      additive effect of bevacizumab on conventional chemotherapy, the toxicities induced when
      combined target therapy with conventional chemotherapy and the duration of remission that
      these treatment could achieve. In this study, we utilized bevacizumab, docetaxel plus
      cisplatin for metastatic breast cancer patients and furthermore, we are evaluated the
      treatment response, toxicities and duration of remission as our main goals.
