      two groups of 50 people each. The patients in group FP were given fentanyl infusion of 1ug/kg
      intravenously 5 minutes before the process. They were given propofol infusion: a loading does
      of 1-2mg/kg immediately before the process then maintenance does of 1mg/kg/h. The patients in
      group OP were administered oxycodone of 0.1 mg/kg and 1-2mg/kg loading dose of propofol
      intravenously 5 minutes before the process. Then they were given 1mg/kg/h maintenance does of
      propofol infusion. In order to maintenan Ramsey Sedation Scale (RSS) between 3 and 4, all
      patients were administered 0.2~0.5 mg/kg bolus of propofol when necessary. Time of induction
      of anesthesia, operation time, wake-up time, recovery time, occurrence of adverse
      cardiovascular events, bucking, nausea and vomiting and respiratory depression ,total dosage
      of used propofol were assessed.Furthermore,different time point of regional cerebral oxygen
      saturation (rScO2) ,serum levels of irisin and cognitive function by mini-mental state
      examination (MMSE) were rated.
