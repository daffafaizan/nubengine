    
      This is a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of mastoid oscillation for
      treatment of Ménière's disease. Eligible subjects will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation
      to either mastoid oscillation or placebo (oscillator device that provides the same sound but
      no vibration of the mastoid) received for 30 minutes at four weekly study visits, with
      efficacy determination via change in frequency and severity of Ménière's symptoms following
      the final study visit.
