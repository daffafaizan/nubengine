      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was originally described through an antegrade
      transeptal route by Cribier and colleagues in 2002. Because of the complexity of the
      procedure and risks of damaging the mitral apparatus, this approach was abandoned in favor of
      less challenging alternatives, with transfemoral (TF) route as primary option. Nevertheless,
      the TF approach is not feasible or of high risk in between 15 and 35% of the patients and
      vascular complications have been shown to be an independent predictor of death warranting
      alternative access techniques for TAVI. In this regard, the transapical, direct aortic,
      transcarotid, transcaval, and transubclavian/transaxillary (TSc) implantation routes
      currently serve as alternative access options. The TSc approach was initially used in
      selected cases. However, recent series suggest that TSc may provide better outcomes than
      alternative routes when TF is inadequate. Additionally, same studies suggest that, as
      compared to TF approach, TSc TAVI may present lower rate of vascular complications with
      comparable rates of other major outcomes despite the worse baseline profile of patients who
      are considered inappropriate for TF procedures. Moreover, fully-percutaneous TSc approach can
      be successfully performed with low rate of complications as was recently proposed by some
      authors. However, comparisons have been based in small series of cases, most of them with
      former iteration of TAVI devices, and a formal prospective comparison has never been
      performed. Therefore, our aim is to gather all cases of fully-percutaneous TSc and TF
      approaches for TAVI in Spain and Portugal and compare the standardized safety and efficacy
      endpoints through a matched analysis.
