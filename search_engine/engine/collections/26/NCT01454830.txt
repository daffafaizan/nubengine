      health and functional outcomes. Intervention studies to promote CPAP adherence have shown
      relatively small effects in selected samples and were costly. The overall objective of this
      research is to examine the effect, feasibility, and acceptability of a tailored intervention
      on CPAP adherence among adults with newly-diagnosed, CPAP treated OSA. The central hypothesis
      is that critically timed tailored interventions that focus on sociocultural aspects and
      cognitive perceptions of the individual experience with OSA diagnosis and treatment will
      improve overall CPAP adherence rates. The pilot randomized controlled trial will examine CPAP
      adherence outcomes at 1wk, 1mo, and 3mo among those randomly assigned to the tailored
      intervention or usual (standard) care and examine specific feasibility and participant
      acceptability outcomes in order to design and conduct a subsequent larger randomized
      controlled trial testing the overall efficacy of the tailored intervention.
