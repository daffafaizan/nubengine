      5.7%, 6.3% and 11.7% of the medication errors intercepted by medication reconciliation (MR)
      could have had major, critical or catastrophic consequences for patients. If the consequences
      of a medication error have a clinical or institutional translation for the patient, they can
      also directly impact the hospital or caregivers, for example by extending the average length
      of stay or by increasing the number of consultations or readmissions.

      The efficiency of the medication reconciliation approach has never been evaluated in France
      in comparison with standard care. Before initiating cost-effectiveness studies, we propose to
      conduct a micro-costing study to evaluate the production costs of this conciliation approach.

      The costs are almost exclusively related to human resources and the present study will assess
      the time spent by the different actors involved in the process.
