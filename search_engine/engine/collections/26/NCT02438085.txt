      area of Ferrara (400.000 residents). The cath-lab of the University Hospital of Ferrara is
      the hub center of the network for the management of patients with ACS. This finding
      guarantees a very high number of patients with ACS admitted to University Hospital of Ferrara
      (more than 1500 by year). In the cath-lab are performed more than 2000 coronary artery
      angiography by year and more than 1100 PCI by year. The staff of the cardiology unit has a
      great experience in the management of studies (investigator-driven, randomized controlled
      trials, with or without sponsor) enrolling patients with ACS and treated with PCI. All
      consecutive patients with ACS admitted to hospitals of the Ferrara area will be included in
      the registry. All data will be related to long-term clinical outcome.

      METHODS:

      Prospective collection of following data:

        -  baseline characteristics including cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, CV history and
           comorbidities (see below)

        -  clinical management (CV drugs, imaging exams, diagnostic exams, time to cath-lab access)

        -  biomarkers evaluating inflammation, endothelial, platelet, thrombotic function and
           activation

        -  procedural details including coronary disease description, intervention modality, stent,
           coronary imaging, CV drugs during intervention, procedural complications and management,
           access site

        -  in-hospital adverse events

        -  medical treatment at discharge and during the follow-up

        -  clinical follow-up (1, 2, 3, 4 5 years)

      PRE-SPECIFIED SUBSTUDY

      The Authors will focus the attention in specific subset of patients:

        -  patients with diabetes

        -  patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

        -  patients with chronic kidney disease

        -  patients with rheumatologic disordes

        -  patients with malignancy In these subsets of patients the Authors will collect a more
           detailed description of symptoms, clinical presentation, disease management and
           relationship between comorbidity and ACS.

      Similarly, a specifc substudy of the registry will be focused on the characterization of
      coronary artery disease and of atherosclerotic plaque morphology in patients with
      comorbidities (diabetes, COPD, CKD, malignancy) as compared to patients without
      comorbidities.

      Finally, the Authors will evaluate the quality of life of ACS patients in the area of Ferrara
      applying at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years the following questionnaires: EQ-5D and SF-12 v2
