      18F-hydroxyphenethylguanidines, 4-[18F]fluoro-meta-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ([18F]4F-MHPG)
      and 3-[18F]fluoro-para-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ([18F]3F-PHPG) will be performed. All
      studies will be performed in normal healthy volunteers.

      PET stands for Positron Emission Tomography which is a type of imaging that uses a
      radioactive tracer. This is also called a radiotracer which is a compound linked to a
      radioactive element. Most compounds are short-lived, meaning that the radioactivity breaks
      down quickly or is excreted from the body.

      In the first stage of the study, dynamic PET imaging for 90 min will be done with
      [18F]4F-MHPG (n = 4) and [18F]3F-PHPG (n = 4).

      Data from these studies will assess each radiotracer's imaging properties, pharmacokinetics
      and metabolic breakdown in plasma. Application of tracer kinetic analysis methods to the
      kinetics of each tracer in heart and plasma will be studied to see if these methods can
      provide accurate measurements of regional nerve sympathetic nerve density in the hearts of
      human subjects. Results from these initial studies will be used to select the lead compound
      for further studies in patient populations.

      In the second stage of the study, whole-body PET imaging studies (n = 4) with the selected
      lead radiotracer will be performed to acquire data necessary for generating more accurate
      human radiation absorbed dose estimates.
