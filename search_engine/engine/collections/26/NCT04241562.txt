      Predictive biomarkers that can identify individuals at risk of developing severe and
      persistent pain, which is associated with worse disability and greater reliance on opioids,
      would promote aggressive, early intervention that could halt the transition to chronic pain.
      The investigative team has uncovered evidence of a unique cortical biomarker signature that
      predicts pain susceptibility (severity and duration). The biomarker signature combines
      resting state sensorimotor peak alpha frequency (PAF) measured using electroencephalograph
      (EEG) and corticomotor excitability (CME) measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS). This PAF/CME biomarker signature could be capable of predicting the severity of pain
      experienced by an individual minutes to months in the future, as well as the duration of pain
      (time to recovery). In the current study, the investigators aim to undertake analytical
      validation of this biomarker in healthy participants using a standardized model of the
      transition to sustained myofascial temporomandibular pain (masseter intramuscular injection
      of nerve growth factor). The investigators will record PAF/CME at multiple time points before
      and during the development of pain and use online diaries and in-laboratory assessments of
      pain, sleep, stress, and other psychosocial variables. Specifically, the investigators will
      test if the biomarker signature predicts an individual's pain sensitivity (high- or low-pain
      sensitive).
