      development or progression of plaque formation. It is extensively accepted that low and/or
      oscillating shear stress causes endothelial dysfunction and is one of crucial factors in
      localizing early atherosclerosis .In contrary, normal and high shear stress is atheroma
      protective and is involved in compensatory remodeling . Most studies reported that the
      endothelial shear stress distribution in often idealized geometrical models of human coronary
      arteries was the subject of numerous investigations , and in these studies it was shown that
      the geometry of coronary arteries is the main determinant of the observed shear stress
      distribution. Generally, downstream of a plaque, low shear stress can be expected, Several
      cardiovascular active drugs have been shown to be cardio-protective for patients with
      obstructive coronary disease. Of these drugs, calcium channel blocker is one of most
      prescribed in everyday clinical practice. Ninomiya et al. reported calcium channel blocker
      was associated with increased coronary diameter and blood fluid with dose-dependent pattern
      in patients with normal or mild stenotic coronary artery. However, no reports on the dynamic
      change of endothelial shear stress after calcium channel blocker in -vitron were published so
      far. As a result, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intra-venous injection
      of Nicardipine, one calcium channel blocker with shorter half-time, on the re-distribution of
      endothelial shear stress in patients with acute coronary syndrome and mild stenotic (<50%)
      coronary artery disease.
