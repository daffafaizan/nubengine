      comparison of the VTC and in-person modalities using rigorous methodology and a sophisticated
      analysis of treatment equivalency in clinical and process outcome domains. Outcome domains
      include clinical and process outcomes. Approximately 154 female veterans, Reservists,
      National Guardsmen, or civilians with PTSD have been recruited from multiple VA clinical
      sites and community health centers (for N=110 completers). Consistent with the male combat
      veterans CPT study, prospective participants received a comprehensive assessment battery at
      baseline to determine eligibility. The exclusion criteria selected are consistent with large
      PTSD randomized clinical trials as well as research using the CPT protocol with military
      populations with PTSD. The treatment is delivered up to twice a week for up to 12 weeks by a
      doctoral level psychologist. Quality control procedures have been incorporated into the
      study's design to ensure integrity, fidelity and standard administration of the CPT
      intervention across both conditions. It is expected that the results from this project can be
      applied to other VA and military locations, where similar specialized PTSD clinical services
      are needed but unavailable due to geographic barriers.
