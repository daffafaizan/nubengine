      developed countries. It is not characterized by nasal symptoms only (such as congestion and
      sneezing), but may also cause general complaints such as fatigue and cough. AR can also have
      detrimental effects on mood, sleep, social activities and scholastic performance.

      Lertal® is a novel nutraceutical containing seed extracts from Perilla Frutescens, Quercetin
      extracted from Sophora japonica and Vitamin D3, all compounds that have demonstrated their
      ability to reduce allergy symptoms and the use of anti-allergy drugs in adults.

      The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lertal® as an add-on treatment for children affected by
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.
