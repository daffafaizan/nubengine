        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of amifostine chemoprotection with peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation plus chemotherapy in patients with high-risk or relapsed solid
           tumors or brain tumors.

        -  Determine response or time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of amifostine. Patients are stratified according to
      age (1 to 18 vs 19 to 45 years).

      All patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV for 1 week. On day 6 of G-CSF administration,
      patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest followed by chemotherapy.

      Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -6 followed by melphalan IV over
      30 minutes on days -5 and -4 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients receive
      amifostine IV over 5 minutes beginning 30 minutes prior to melphalan and thiotepa
      administration on days -5 to -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of amifostine until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed on day 50; at 3, 6, and 9 months; and at 1, 2, and 3 years post PBSC
      transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
