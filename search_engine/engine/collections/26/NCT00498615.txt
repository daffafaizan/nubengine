      cutaneous arterioles characterized by typical skin color changes and tissue ischemia (1).
      Avoidance of common triggers such as cold temperatures and emotional stress often leads to
      improvement of symptoms. When such a strategy yields inadequate benefits, pharmacologic
      therapy is needed.

      Cutaneous vasoconstriction occurs through a general sympathetic adrenergic response and
      through local mechanisms in response to cold. While under normal conditions, the vasomotor
      tone is regulated mainly by a.2A- adrenoreceptors (a.2A-AR) expressed on vascular smooth
      muscle cells (VSMC) (2); during cold exposure the normally "silent" a.2C-AR relocate from the
      Golgi complex to the cell surface, driving the cold-induced vasoconstrictive response (3).
      Interestingly, the reactivity to a.2-AR stimulation is highly increased in cutaneous arteries
      of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) (4), and block- age of a.2C-AR has
      shown to shorten the time to recover digital skin temperature after a cold challenge in
      patients with Raynaud's Phenomenon secondary to Scleroderma (5).

      The RhoA/Rho kinase pathway is activated by cooling and mediates vasoconstriction of
      cutaneous arteries by inducing a.2C-AR relocation to the cell surface and by increasing
      calcium-dependent Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMC )contractility (6). Rho kinase
      inhibition has been shown to effectively reduce

      a.2-AR-mediated response during cold exposure and to prevent cold-induced vasoconstriction in
      human skin (6) Therefore, RhoA/Rho kinase inhibition may provide a highly selective
      intervention directed toward the mechanisms underlying thermosensitive vasomotor responses in
      the skin of Raynaud's Phenomenon patients.
