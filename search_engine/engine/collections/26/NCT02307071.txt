      CM is difficult to treat and preventive treatment options are limited. Due to the
      inefficiency of available and the lack of new preventive anti-migraine drug, neurostimulation
      methods have raised great interest in recent years.

      The ONSTIM study showed a reduction in headache frequency in 39% of patients treated with
      active ONS during 12 weeks, compared to no improvement in the "non-effectively" stimulated or
      medically treated groups.
