      improve the prognosis of children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) provided that the
      centres can benefit from a precise and adapted protocol and logistical support.

      The GFAOP has been working with units for the past 20 years and this is the second study put
      in place by the group for the treatment of LAL. The initial study was a feasibility study
      with the treatment of standard risk LAL. This study GFALAL2019 aims to include both standard
      and high-risk forms of LAL.

      With this study it is hoped to:

        1. Ensure the feasibility of these recommendations.

        2. To show that the correct application of the therapeutic recommendations will result in a
           complete remission rate (CR) close to 85% at the end of the induction treatment.

        3. The survival without relapse of patients in RC will be close to 65% at 5 years.
