      have received TAA with the calcaneal stem. Due to the fixation of the stem in the calcaneus,
      talar component position, osteolysis and bone quality are of interest to the FDA.
      Specifically, subsidence and/or migration of the talar component, osteolysis as a measure of
      wear, and bone quality of the talus, cuboid and navicular are to be evaluated in this study.
      Therefore, the radiographic outcomes of this study aim to assess these parameters
