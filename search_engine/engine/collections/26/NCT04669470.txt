      intragastric balloons, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, aspiration therapy) on components of
      the metabolic syndrome in obese patients, especially on influencing non-alcoholic steatosis
      and steatohepatitis and signs of liver fibrotization and weight reduction. The method
      consists in performing a mini-invasive endoscopic procedure and, as a result, in reduced food
      intake.

      Current state of knowledge:

      Based on data evaluated according to EBM (Evidence Based Medicine), it is an indisputable
      fact that bariatric methods have a demonstrable effect not only on improving the parameters
      and regression of many metabolic syndromes, but also improve the course of non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is this nosological unit that is becoming the dominant cause
      of liver disease in developed countries and has two subunits, where simple hepatic steatosis
      (NAFL) is considered a benign disease, while the second, where fat accumulation in the liver
      is associated with the inflammatory process called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). )
      has serious consequences for the liver with the development of fibrotization leading to
      cirrhosis with all its adverse effects. Recently, however, it has been shown that even simple
      steatosis is not as benign as it seemed, but carries an independent risk for the patient due
      to an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, oncological manifestations and a higher
      incidence of metabolic syndrome manifestations. Classical bariatric endoscopy carries a
      number of risks associated with the patient for the surgical procedure, however, we also have
      less invasive methods of gradually more and more developing endoscopy and dreams of
      associated bariatric procedures with many times lower risk for the patient.
