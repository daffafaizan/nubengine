      mortality in patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). However, despite interventions,
      almost two-thirds of smokers resumed smoking in the year after hospitalization for CHD
      related illnesses; one-third resumed smoking within one month. A critical challenge for
      institution-level programs is how to provide consistent patient follow-up and linkage to
      community-based smoking cessation resources. Interactive voice response (IVR) technology has
      the potential to improve follow-up with smokers after hospitalization and to enhance triage
      to clinical support for smoking cessation. IVR uses natural language to place automated
      out-going calls that can pose questions regarding smoking status and progress with smoking
      cessation, that is then dropped into a database. A counselor is then able to link with the
      database and obtain information about the patient's smoking cessation needs and provide
      support as appropriate. A randomized control trial (RCT) is planned to evaluate whether an
      IVR system for follow-up and triage helps smokers hospitalized for CHD, quit smoking over 26-
      and 52-week follow-up periods. Participants are randomized into either a Usual Care or IVR
      group. Both groups will receive in-patient counseling and offer of nicotine replacement
      therapy. The IVR group will additionally receive a telephone call from the IVR system three,
      14, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after hospital discharge. Variables that will be assessed
      at 26 and 52 weeks include: smoking status, both 7-day point-prevalent and continuous
      abstinence, as well as self-efficacy for smoking cessation, use of effective cessation
      resources and patient satisfaction (at 26 weeks).
