      Zenapax(R) to be both efficacious and safe when used in several different dosing schedules.
      Little data is available regarding pharmacokinetics, safety and appropriate dosing in
      pediatric heart transplant patients. Yet this ever-increasing group of patients presents a
      significant challenge for the prevention of primary rejection and the appropriate maintenance
      of immunosuppression. Induction of long term allograft acceptance through peripheral
      tolerance has been shown in animal models to be more easily induced in young animals. Once
      established however, allograft rejection and immunologic responses in the young are quite
      vigorous. This dichotomy makes young allograft recipients a particularly attractive
      population for the study of immune modulators targeted at preventing proliferative expansion
      of alloreactive T cell clones. This is precisely the mode of action of anti-IL2R monoclonal
      reagents such as Zenapax(R).

      Although some pharmacokinetic data have been generated in adult heart transplant patients on
      multidrug immunosuppressive regimens including both Zenapax(R) and mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF), detailed pharmacokinetic data on this combination in multidrug immunosuppressive
      regimens is not available for pediatric heart transplant subjects.

      Objectives:

        -  Determination of pharmacokinetics of Zenapax(R) in pediatric patients receiving a
           uniform multidrug immunosuppressive regimen for primary induction.

        -  Determine whether there are any unusual drug interactions peculiar to the pediatric
           population that would require dosing modification.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Investigate long term effects of Zenapax(R) containing induction regimen on pediatric
           patients.
