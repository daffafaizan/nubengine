      Comparison of Fast-Track (FT) and traditional management protocols. the primary endpoints is
      length of hospitalization post-operation (d, meanÂ±SD). It was calculated by the difference
      between date of discharge and date of surgery. The secondary endpoints are complications in
      both groups are assessed during the first 21 days postoperatively. Including infection(wound
      infection, lung infection, intraperitoneal infection, operation space infection),
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) , ileus, postoperative hemorrhage, postoperative
      thrombosis and APACHE II score.

      The advantages of fast-track most likely extend to gynecology, although so far have scarcely
      been reported. NO randomised controlled trials for now. The aim of this study is to compare
      the LOS (Length of hospitalization post-operation) after the major
      gynaecological/gynaecological oncologic surgery and analyze the complication after surgery.
      This trial can show whether the FTS program can achieve early hospital discharge after
      gynaecological surgery meanwhile with low levels of complications.
