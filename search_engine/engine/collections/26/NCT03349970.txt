      important component of hemodynamic assessment during cardiac (and non-cardiac) surgery. It
      has become standard of care in guiding fluid management and inotropic therapy in both the
      operating room (OR) and the intensive care unit (ICU) in most centres, and is considered by
      far the most understood and commonly communicated parameter of cardiac performance, in
      addition to being consistently shown as a predictor of patients' outcome.

      Several methods have been used to measure CO. The most commonly used is via thermodilution
      (PAC), but its invasive nature and potential for serious complications led to the utilization
      of the non-invasive methods, such as those based on TEE.

      Since the establishment of the role of TEE in the setting of hemodynamic monitoring during
      cardiac surgery, various ways of quantifying LV function have been utilized. The method
      recommended by current guidelines is a volumetric calculation via the method of disks
      (modified Simpson's method, MOD). Recent advances in ultrasound technology and software
      development allow the utilization three-dimensional (3D) volumetric assessment and speckle
      tracking for cardiac deformation.
