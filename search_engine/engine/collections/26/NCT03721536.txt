      inhaled air, increase mucociliary clearance, maintain body temperature, reduce fluid loss,
      result in savings of up to 75% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce treatment costs
      (10 - 13). However, it is necessary to examine whether the reduction of fresh gas flow
      affects the quality and safety of anesthesia management, especially during high-risk
      operations such as laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

      Low-flow anesthesia has been used for years with positive results, but its effects on
      hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation are not clearly known in high-risk morbidly obese
      patients who are prone to pulmonary dysfunction related to the obesity. Therefore, this
      prospective randomized study aimed to compare the effects of low-flow (0.75 L/min) and
      normal-flow (1.5 L/min) anesthesia on hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation in morbidly
      obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery.
