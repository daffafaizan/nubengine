      active controlled, phase III randomized (2x2 factorial), clinical trial to demonstrate the
      superiority of apixaban against the current standard of treatment (acetylsalicylic acid) for
      the longterm treatment after ESUS. ATTICUS will follow a dynamic treatment protocol
      implementing conversion from the acetylsalicylic acid arm to the apixaban arm in case of
      detection of relevant episodes of AF during the course of the study. ATTICUS is designed to
      test the superiority over acetylsalicylic acid to reduce new ischemic lesion detected by
      FLAIR/DWI MRI.
