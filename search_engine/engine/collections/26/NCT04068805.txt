      intervention or a psychoeducation control group. Both programs last 8 weeks and take place on
      a simplified research version of the Happify platform. Participants assigned to the diabetes
      positive affect program will have full access to Happify, with a track that focuses on
      building skills for greater happiness, reducing stress, and coping better with diabetes
      displayed as the feature track. Participants assigned to the psychoeducation (control)
      condition will be asked to complete a series of polls on various wellbeing topics, and then
      provided with some social comparison data about how their responses compared with the
      responses of other users, as well as information about why the well being topic is important.
      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires before, during, and after the 8-week
      program as well as 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up questionnaires after the
      program is complete, at which point study participation will end.
