      memory and cognitive function in general. There are changes in the quantity of REM sleep
      after certain forms of anesthesia, especially with barbiturate, as shown in mouse model. This
      study is designed to be the first explorative clinical studyl to measure changes in sleep
      architecture in surgical patients undergoing different types of anesthesia (general
      anesthesia and spinal anesthesia) and its potential associations with the development of
      postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Additionally, parameters will
      be collected, that from recent research are suspected to be reliable markers for systemic
      inflammation that might account for delirium and cognitive dysfunction after surgical
      interventions.

      Patients were stratified into two groups: age (â‰¤ 65 years; > 65 years) and benzodiazepine
      premedication (yes/no).
