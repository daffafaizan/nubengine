      improving maximum oxygen consumption and increasing treadmill time when preceding aerobic
      exercise training.This study was conducted to determine the effects of pre- exercise low
      level laser therapy on aerobic capacity in burned patients. Low level laser therapy was
      applied to the study group for 12 weeks before aerobic exercises, three sessions / week,
      while control group received 12 weeks of aerobic exercises, three times weekly. Patients in
      both groups were received the traditional physical therapy program as a routine treatment.
      Aerobic capacity was assessed by measuring maximum oxygen consumption and time to exhaustion
      at baseline and after twelve weeks of interventions for both groups.
