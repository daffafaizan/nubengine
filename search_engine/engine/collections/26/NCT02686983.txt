      is a treatment option for cluster headache. In general, there is a marked paucity of evidence
      concerning GON blocks in migraine. Corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing the pain
      intensity and frequency in these patients. This is an RCT to assess efficacy and safety of
      sub-occipital steroid injections with local anesthetic in patients with chronic migraine.
