      evaluated during the dose escalation period: 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, and maybe an additional fixed
      dose (e.g., to evaluate 200 mg or other fixed dose as RP2D). The drug is scheduled to be
      administrated Q3W. Actual dose increments or dosing frequency may be adjusted according to PK
      data and safety of MW11. Safety, tolerability, and DLT will be assessed within 3 weeks (21
      days) after initial administration. Anti-tumor efficacy will be assessed every 6 weeks during
      the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks ever since. The study will be divided into screening
      period and treatment period. The drug administration will be continued until the
      investigators consider that the subjects will no longer benefit from the treatment, or the
      subjects meet intolerable toxicity, or the subjects withdraw the informed consent, or disease
      progression occurs.
