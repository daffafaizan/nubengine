      Primary

        -  To evaluate the impact of quality-of-life assessment in routine oncology practice on
           satisfaction with care, health-related quality-of-life, and toxicity in patients with
           primary nonmetastatic head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of using quality-of-life tools in routine oncology practice.

        -  To evaluate the impact on the occurrence of toxicity.

        -  To determine the impact on overall survival.

        -  To study the concordance between the toxicity reported by the clinician and those
           reported by the patient quality-of-life questionnaires.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to sex, tumor localization, and TNM stage.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC tools only, including
           EORTC QLQ-SAT32, EORTC QLQ-C30, and specific module QLQ-H&N35/Euroqol EQ-5D) before each
           consultation with the clinician for one year.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo standard follow-up care comprising consultation with the
           clinician for one year.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then at 2
      years.
