      should rotate the injection site, if possible. You will do this once every day for 12 weeks.
      You will then have 4 weeks off of IL-2. During the first 6 weeks of IL-2, you will continue
      to take steroids without changing the dose your doctor has set for you while you are on IL-2.
      After 6 weeks of IL-2 therapy, your doctor may reduce the amount of steroids you take.

      While you are on study, a member of the study team will examine you to evaluate your cGVHD.
      These assessments may include examination of your skin, joints/muscles, eyes, mouth, lungs
      and gastrointestinal system.

      You will have clinic visits for evaluation of toxicity and clinical benefit approximately
      every 4 weeks. You will also have immunologic assays approximately every 8 weeks. Immunologic
      assays will measure the effect of IL-2 on immune cells.

      You will be on the study for about 16 weeks. You may continue on study treatment for longer
      if you experience a clinical benefit.
