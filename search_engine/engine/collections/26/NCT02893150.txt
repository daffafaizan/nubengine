      Primary Care combined a generic MBI (with 8 sessions) developed by our research group, called
      "Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion" (MBHP) program versus TAU plus MB-EAT. It will be
      included women aged ≥18 and < 60, literate , with a BMI (body mass index) ≥ 25 kg/m2. The
      primary outcome is the improvement of the eating behaviour measured by DEBQ. Secondary
      outcomes are: It is expected improvement of nutritional status (reduction of body weight by
      at least 5% of the weight) along the intervention, as well as maintenance of this (without
      weight regain) which could lead to the prevention of multiple morbidities related to excess
      body weight. Will be assessed the levels of Mindfulness, stress, anxiety (psychometric scale
      and serum cortisol) and self-compassion. There will be performed basal (baseline), at
      post-intervention, 3 and 6 months follow-up measurements. The control group will receive the
      intervention that has been shown to be more effective at the end of the study (MBHP or
      MB-EAT).
