      laboratory for isolation of immune cells. These immune cells are then proliferated over a two
      week period and used to produce the patented product IKC (Immune Killer Cells). The IKC will
      then infused back into the patient to treat the cancer. Each patient will receive a total of
      six infusions.

      For each indication (cancer of the lung or liver) 10 patients are anticipated to be
      recruited, making a total of 20 subjects. All subjects will receive treatment as this is a
      single-arm study.
