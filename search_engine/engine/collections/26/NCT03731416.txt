      severe horizontal bone atrophy, to overcome the drawback of bone blocks techniques.6,8 To
      protect and prevent the invasion of the clot by nonosteogenic cells, maintaining an adequate
      biological space for the regeneration of bone tissue, the use of resorbable membranes, in
      combination with autologous or heterologous particulate bone have been proposed. Expanded
      polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) membranes are the most used non-resorbable membranes with
      the longest published follow-up, considering them the gold standard in the reconstructions of
      major horizontal bone defects. However, a second surgery is needed to remove them and they
      may get exposed in the oral cavity and contaminate with possible infection and graft loss.
      Conversely, the resorbable membranes most advantages are an ability to merge with the host
      tissues, as well as a rapid resorption in case of exposure, thereby reducing the risk of
      bacterial contamination. Resorbable membranes in combination with particulated anorganic
      bovine bone (ABB) can be used for the augmentation of horizontally deficient ridges.
      Particulated autogenous bone can be mixed with bone substitutes to add more osteogenic
      factors.
