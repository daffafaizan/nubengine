    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test if the recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine (9vHPV vaccine) delivered
      after treatment for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) reduces the risk of
      histologically confirmed recurrent neoplastic lesions (HSIL) by 50% in the vaccinated versus
      (vs.) placebo arms.

      II. Evaluate safety of the HPV vaccine in HSIL participants.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly
      (IM) at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at months 7, 12, 18, 24, 36,
      and 42.
