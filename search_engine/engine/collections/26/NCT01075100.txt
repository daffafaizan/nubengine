      (as stratified below). All patients will receive ixabepilone 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 and
      carboplatin AUC=2.5 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. Patients will be stratified by
      either hormone receptor positive [ER+/PR+/HER2-, ER+/PR-/HER2-, ER-/PR+/HER2-]- (n=50) or
      triples negative ER-/PR-/HER2- (n=53). If one group fulfills their accrual goal first,
      registration into that strata will be stopped and only patients meeting stratification
      requirements for the other group will be registered.
