      surgery and abdominoperineal resection. Because of ethical issues, it is difficult to conduct
      as a randomized trial. On the basis of tumor location, extent, and preoperative anal
      function, patient will be attributed to two different operative method groups. On the
      assumption that 10% of the patients are lost to follow-up at 1 year, at least 74 patients
      undergoing APR and 220 patients undergoing SPS will be recruited. The study will be continued
      until the target sample size will be achieved.
