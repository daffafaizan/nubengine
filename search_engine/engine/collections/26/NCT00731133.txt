      disulfiram at 250 mg/day in up to fifteen methamphetamine dependent individuals. After
      undergoing screening procedures (approximately one week), eligible subjects will enter the
      study proper attend clinic every weekday during week 1 of the trial in order to receive the
      disulfiram under observation and complete assessments. Then subjects will receive weekly
      blister packs of medication and attend clinic thrice weekly during weeks 2-6. During weeks
      7-8, subjects no longer take disulfiram, are followed for two weeks, then referred to
      treatment elsewhere, if desired. Urine samples will be obtained and a disulfiram side-effects
      checklist will be completed thrice-weekly. Self-reported drug use, craving and mood ratings
      will be completed weekly. All subjects undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. Adjunctive
      contingency management procedures will be utilized to enhance retention. The primary outcomes
      of interest include retention, side-effects, and drug use. Results of this study will provide
      initial safety and drug use data for grant applications proposing to examine the clinical
      efficacy of disulfiram or similar agents to for treating methamphetamine dependence under
      placebo-controlled, double-blind conditions.
