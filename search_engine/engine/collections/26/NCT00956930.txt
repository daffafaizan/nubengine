      Primary

        -  Compare and contrast TACE and Y90 in order to determine either equivalence or
           superiority as measured by time-to-progression.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the safety and toxicity profile of these regimens.

        -  Determine the need for subsequent treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in these patients

        -  Characterize change in quality of life and functional status in these patients.

        -  Determine time to progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to receive either TACE or Y90

        -  Arm I (radioembolization): Patients undergo radioembolization with yttrium Y 90 glass
           microspheres by hepatic artery infusion for approximately 1-3 courses.

        -  Arm II (transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]): Patients undergo TACE with mitomycin C,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cisplatin by hepatic artery infusion for approximately
           1-3 courses.

        -  In both arms, treatment modifications may apply according to response.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
