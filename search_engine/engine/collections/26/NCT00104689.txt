      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin as first-line treatment, as
           defined by stabilization or improvement by 1 point on Katz's Activities of Daily Living
           scale, in older patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients who receive the first 3 courses of this regimen (at
           lower doses) and the percentage of patients who receive all 6 courses of this regimen
           (at both lower and higher doses).

        -  Determine efficacy of this regimen, as defined by RECIST criteria, in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine* once daily on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin* IV on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *The doses of both capecitabine and oxaliplatin are increased in courses 4-6 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
