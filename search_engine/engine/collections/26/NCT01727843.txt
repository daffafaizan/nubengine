      hemiarthroplasty of the hip for femoral neck fractures? The type of information collected by
      the research assistant will consist of estimated blood loss during surgery, length of stay in
      hospital, any wound infections as well as any thromboembolic side effects (blood clots in
      legs and/or heart) that may occur. The number of units of red blood cells transfused will be
      recorded up to and including postoperative day 8. Preoperative hemoglobin and lowest
      postoperative hemoglobin levels up to and including post-op day 8 will also be collected as
      well as any use of ambulatory aids will be recorded on presentation to hospital, discharge
      and 6 weeks post operatively.
