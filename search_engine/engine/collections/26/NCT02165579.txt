      amputations are dramatically increasing. Soft tissue and bone infections are one of the most
      common reasons for amputation. It is often difficult to determine if diabetic foot ulcers
      have an underlying bone infection. Inaccurate diagnosis of osteomyelitis leads to unnecessary
      antibiotic treatment, surgery, and amputation. In addition, we do not have good diagnostic
      tools to determine when osteomyelitis has been treated successfully.

      The role of biomarkers specific to bone turnover (resorption and formation) in relation to
      bone infections is poorly understood. We know that remodeling is an essential function in
      bone physiology with increased osteoclast production leading to resorption of old bone
      coupled with increased osteoblast production associated with new bone formation. The balance
      between these two functions is known to be disrupted in disease states including
      osteoporosis, but has not been examined specifically in infected bone. Procalcitonin has been
      suggeasted as a tool to both diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of therapy for various
      infections, but there is very little work in diabetic foot osteomyelitis.

      Aim 1. To evaluate the role of procalcitonin as a screening tool to diagnose diabetic foot
      osteomyelitis using bone culture and histopathology as the "gold standard" to establish the
      diagnosis.

      Aim 2. To determine the role of procalcitonin as a management tool to determine osteomyelitis
      treatment success versus treatment failure (indicated by bone biopsy) after completing a
      standard course of antibiotics for 6 weeks.
