      health and performance. For example, increased fat oxidation could help to induce a negative
      fat balance and over time improve body composition. Furthermore, increasing the oxidation of
      fat could spare carbohydrate utilization during exercise which should improve endurance
      performance by preserving the bodies limited carbohydrate reserves for the latter stages of
      competition. Interestingly, there is substantial individual variation in the balance of fuels
      used for energy during exercise and in particular the maximal capacity to oxidize fat (MFO).
      Whilst habitual diet is known to affect the metabolic response to exercise, the influence of
      nutrition on the individual variability observed in maximal fat oxidation has not been
      comprehensively studied.

      Therefore, the proposed investigation aims to build on current understanding of how various
      nutritional factors influence MFO during exercise. Based on previous small intervention
      studies, it is suspected that energy balance and macronutrient content or distribution may
      exert the strongest influence on MFO during exercise. Specifically, the main hypothesis would
      be that negative energy balance; higher fat intake and/or low carbohydrate intake would be
      the strongest positive influencer's of MFO. Nonetheless, the determination of an array of
      habitual and acute nutrient intake data in a relatively large cohort of healthy individuals
      will enable an insight into the influence of a comprehensive array of nutrients on MFO during
      exercise. With a greater understanding of the nutritional factors that influence MFO during
      exercise, new nutritional interventions can be designed to promote the oxidation of fat for
      improved health and performance.
