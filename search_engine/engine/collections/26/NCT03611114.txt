    
      Endothelial function measured via flow mediated dilation (FMD), blood pressure,
      anthropometric measures, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and
      endothelin 1 (ET-1), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) will be evaluated in healthy
      overweight/obese Caucasians prior to and following 2-week consumption of blood orange juice
      and a control drink. Evaluation of endothelial function as measured by FMD will be conducted
      on specific days of the menstrual cycle to minimise the fluctuation in oestrogen levels in
      premenopausal women, which will be monitored in serum samples.
