      occlusive tape and will remain on the skin for 24 hours. The patches will be removed after 24
      hours and assessed as 30 minutes post patch removal and again at 24 hours post patch removal.
      Each test site will be scored for erythema and oedema by a dermatologist.

      The primary endpoint for this Clinical Investigation is the irritation of the test products
      according to the Cutaneous Irritancy Index value. The test products success criteria is to be
      graded as 'non-irritant' and this should be confirmed by the study dermatologist.
