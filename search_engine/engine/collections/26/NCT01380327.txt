      allergy and cockroach exposure is one of the most important factors contributing to the
      dramatic increase in asthma morbidity seen in inner city children with asthma. Therefore, a
      major goal of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Inner City
      Asthma Consortium (ICAC) is ultimately to conduct a large multi-center trial of cockroach
      sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in inner-city asthma. As a step toward achieving this goal,
      ICAC is conducting a clinical trial comparing two doses of glycerinated German cockroach
      (Blattella germanica) allergenic extract to placebo, administered under the tongue
      (sublingual).
