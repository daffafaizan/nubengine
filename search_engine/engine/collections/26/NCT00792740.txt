      has been demonstrated to selectively inhibit the in-vitro production of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines and to exhibit in-vivo anti-inflammatory effects, both in animals and in humans.

      Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory disease of the
      gastrointestinal tract of unknown aetiology. The disease, which affects slightly more females
      than males and has a peak incidence at about 30 years of age, leads to significant physical
      morbidity and a marked impairment in quality of life. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea are the
      most common symptoms, although patients with CD may also develop a number of other clinical
      features such as malnutrition, anemia, osteoporosis, disabling perianal fistulae, and
      extra-intestinal symptoms such as fatigue, low-grade fever, arthritis and abnormalities of
      liver function. CD may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterised by
      a pattern of relapses and remissions that may require treatment, including surgical
      intervention. More than 70% of subjects will require surgery during the course of their
      disease.

      The present study has been designed in order to prove that the short-term (8 weeks) treatment
      with oral ITF2357 can induce disease improvement in a substantial proportion of patients. Its
      aim is to evaluate whether a short term treatment with ITF2357 for 8 weeks, at the selected
      dose of 50 mg b.i.d., is able to induce healing of mucosal lesions, evaluated endoscopically,
      in patients with endoscopic and clinical evidence of moderate-to-severe active Crohn's
      disease, not controlled by ongoing treatment with conventional therapies such as
      5-aminosalycylates, steroids or immunosuppressants.
