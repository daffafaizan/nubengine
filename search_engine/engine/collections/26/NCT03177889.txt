      limited therapeutic approaches. From the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine,
      congenital insufficiency of the lung, spleen and kidney, when coupled with external injury or
      mood impairment, may collectively contribute to bronchiectasis pathogenesis due to heat
      trapping in the phlems, congestion of wind evils and stagnation of blood. Symptomatic
      treatment may be effective and safe for ameliorating respiratory symptoms and hindering
      disease progression of bronchiectasis. Here, the investigators have explored the Lung
      Dispersing, Turbid Descending and Gut Clearing Decoction (LTGD) which targets at expelling
      the wind evil in patients with bronchiectasis. The investigators sought to conduct a
      multicenter, randomized cross-over trial which investigates the efficacy and safety of LTGD
      on clinically stable bronchiectasis.
