           burden of ovarian cancer patients and a diagnostic staging laparoscopy under general
           anesthesia is often necessary to allow correct and accurate staging. The applicant
           propose an "all-in-one" imaging modality providing high quality thoracic-abdominal
           images without using ionizing radiation and/or radioactive material. This allows
           accurate assessment of operability in a minimally invasive manner.

        2. Early treatment assessment --- Although response to the first administration of
           chemotherapy is quite reasonable, most patients show tumor recurrence and achieve
           increasingly poorer response rates to second- or third-line regimes. Therefore it is of
           major concern that a individualized prediction of chemosensitivity can be performed
           avoiding unnecessary toxicity from inefficient chemotherapeutic agents. A promising
           perspective is that the predictive data to be generated might prove to be sufficiently
           powerful to predict chemosensitivity early in the course of the treatment, facilitating
           a timely change of treatment in nonresponders. This could avoid unnecessary toxicity for
           patients, improving quality of life and moreover implicate considerable savings for the
           healthcare sector.

        3. Identifying tumor recurrence --- Identifying tumor recurrence at an early stage could
           translate into reduction of unnecessary biopsies, cost savings and reduced morbidity
           associated with the biopsy procedure. But the most important issue is that early
           diagnosis can be life saving with respect to tumor recurrence.
