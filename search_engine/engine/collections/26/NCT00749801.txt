      Adult men and women who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and gave consent to participate
      were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: Group A: nattokinase-mono formula (18
      subjects); Group B: nattokinase compound (multiple formulae) (18 subjects); Group C: placebo
      (10 subjects).

      Laboratory tests, including TG, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, fibrinogen, D-Dimer, uric
      acid, vital signs and body weight will be evaluated at screening visit, 1 month, 3 months, 6
      months visits after the initiation of treatment. Vital signs and body weight will be measured
      at every visits.

      Patient self-evaluation of tolerance and physical improvement will be assessed by a Patient
      Questionnaire at each visit. Each patient will be carefully monitored for the development of
      any adverse events (AE).

      The change of all lab tests and vital signs will be plotted and compared against time.
      Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test will be performed to compare the baseline and 6 months after the
      initiation of administration. Change from baseline for all lab and vital evaluations will be
      compared among three groups by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by LSD multiple
      comparison.
