      (BMNC) has a positive effect on the natural loss of motor units and on the increase in the
      size of the motor unit that occurs in patients with ALS during the evolution of the disease.

      This hypothesis is based on experimental work done in animal models of ALS and the results of
      our previous phase I clinical trial. In this clinical trial (TCIM / ALS, ClinicalTrials.gov
      Identifier: NCT02286011) we studied with electrophysiological techniques (in a small number
      of patients with ALS) the effects of intramuscular injection of a single dose of BMSC in the
      tibialis anterioris (TA) muscle. . The results indicate that this is a safe procedure and
      show the presence of a positive and apparently transitory effect on the size and number of
      motor units of the TA muscle.
