      Hyperthermia devices are collected. The participating centers are obligated to report any
      device-related failure and Adverse Event (injury to the patient). The center reports together
      with the device-internal data allows to calculate the failure and the complication rates. It
      will be analyzed regarding the kind of tumor and the concomitant treatment (radiotherapy
      and/or chemotherapy). The outcome groups (with/without failure or complication) will be
      analyzed regarding demographic and treatment parameters.
