    
      Cohort B was a 1:1 randomized, controlled study independently powered to compare
      transcatheter heart valve therapy with the first generation (SAPIENâ„¢ THV) system to
      transcatheter heart valve therapy with the second generation (SAPIEN XT THV) system in
      patients who could not undergo surgery (inoperable).

      Patients in the control arm of Cohort B received an Edwards SAPIEN THV with the associated
      delivery system while patients in the treatment arm of Cohort B received an Edwards SAPIEN XT
      THV with the associated delivery system.
