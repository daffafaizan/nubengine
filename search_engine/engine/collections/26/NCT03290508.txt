    
      This is a long-term prospective registry to evaluate the impact of Prolaris testing on
      therapeutic decisions in patients with newly diagnosed favorable intermediate-risk localized
      prostate cancer and to summarize clinical oncologic outcomes. The design of the study is
      non-interventional, and therefore the protocol will not require a specific treatment plan for
      study participants. However, in the absence of a universally accepted timeframe for repeat
      biopsies within existing active surveillance recommendations, study sites will be encouraged
      to monitor patients for disease progression as per the standard of care (e.g., current
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] guidelines) with the expectation of a repeat
      biopsy within 18 months of the initial biopsy.

      Patients who undergo Prolaris testing will be included in the registry as well as patients
      who do not undergo Prolaris testing. Data collection for the first primary objective extends
      over a 3-year period. During this time, data is collected on the treatment initiated, any
      follow-up prostate biopsy performed in patients initially treated with active surveillance,
      definitive treatments performed (with pathology data if surgical therapy is performed), and
      the reasons definitive treatment was pursued, as well as data related to disease progression
      such as biochemical recurrence, development of prostate cancer metastases, or disease
      specific death.

      Data collection for the second primary objective extends out to 8 years. During this time
      data is collected on any follow-up prostate biopsy in patients still treated with active
      surveillance, definitive treatments performed (with pathology data if surgical therapy is
      performed), and the reasons definitive treatment was pursued, as well as data related to
      disease progression such as biochemical recurrence, development of prostate cancer
      metastases, or disease specific death.
