      health repercussions. Also, macrovascular complications of diabetes such as myocardial
      infarct or stroke have been increased. Individuals with diabetes have a greater risk of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), approximately two to four times than that of those without
      diabetes. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires demonstration that new
      anti-hyperglycemic agents do not increase cardiovascular risk. The comprehensive and
      multifactorial management in type 2 diabetes, which includes control of hypertension,
      dyslipidemia and obesity, is known to significantly reduce the risk of CVD as shown in
      Steno-2 study. However, most anti-diabetic agents currently used in clinical practice do not
      seem to provide enough cardiovascular protection.
