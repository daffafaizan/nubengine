      efficacy, that is the capacity of inducing an idiotype- and tumor-specific immune response
      (Kwak LW et al. NEJM 1992); clinical efficacy, that is the capacity of inducing specific
      immune responses able to kill in vivo follicular lymphoma cells that had survived pre-vaccine
      chemotherapy (Bendandi M et al. Nature Med 1999): clinical benefit, that is the capacity of
      prolonging survival of responding patients (Inoges et al. JNCI 2006). Now, we want to test
      whether it is also capable of contributing to the ultimate goal of preventing relapse
      indefinitely in responding patients.
