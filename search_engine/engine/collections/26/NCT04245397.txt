      responding well to the treatment they can continue SX-682 treatment. The first participants
      will be administered 25 mg orally twice daily. Unless dose limiting toxicities occur,
      participants will enroll and receive the following increasing twice daily doses of SX-682: 50
      mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg.

      After establishing the maximum tolerated dose 40 additional participants will be enrolled at
      the maximum tolerated dose (or at the highest dose studied if a maximum tolerated dose is not
      identified). Participants will receive continuous SX-682 twice daily oral therapy in 28-day
      cycles for a total of 6 cycles. For patients responding well at the end of 6 cycles treatment
      may continue until disease progression or an adverse event leads to SX-682 discontinuation.
      Except for blood product transfusions, concurrent therapy for Myelodysplastic Syndromes is
      not permitted.
