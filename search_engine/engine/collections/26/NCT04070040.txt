      confined to the brain, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eyes. The optimum treatment for
      patients with recurrent PCNSL remains challenging and at present there is no universally
      accepted therapeutic approach . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of camrelizumab [a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor] for recurrent patients
      with primary CNS lymphoma.
