      comparator study. In this Phase I study, cells administered will be delivered in 6-10
      intramyocardial injections that will be tested in 20 patients and 10 patients will be
      controls with a total of 30 HLHS patients.

      A total of 30 patients with HLHS will be enrolled in a staged enrollment process. In this
      open-labeled study, a maximum of 20 patients will eventually receive intramyocardial
      injection of the allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells and 10 control patients with no cell
      injection. The enrollment of the patients will occur in two stages groups: Group A and Group
      B. In Group A, 10 consecutive HLHS patients will be initially enrolled in the allogenic MSCs
      treatment arm to determine feasibility and safety. After 6 months of the last enrolled
      patient in Group A, all Group A patients will be assessed in order to determine whether it is
      feasible and safe, including the harvesting, processing, and administering of the allogeneic
      MSCs. Thereafter, Group B will start enrolling a total of 20 HLHS patients which will be
      randomized to the treatment and control arms in a 1:1 ratio, respectively, in order to have
      10 allogeneic MSCs-treated patient and 10 control patients. At the completion of this Phase I
      clinical study, the total enrolled cohort will be 20 patients treated with allogeneic MSCs
      and 10 patients in the control arm.
