      with Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAOD) fulfilling one of the the following criteria:

        1. Any suitable patient in need of an infrarenal vascular reconstruction with Fontaine
           class IIb or indicated vascular reconstruction aneurysm repair.

           or

        2. Any suitable patient with an increased risk for early graft failure except those
           mentioned under (3). These may include

             -  diabetics

             -  Fontaine class> IIb

             -  patients of advanced age (≥75 y)

             -  patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 1.50 mg/dl or ≥130 µmol/l)

             -  patients with COPD or documented coronary artery disease (prior PCI, prior CABG,
                documented myocardial ischemia)

             -  patients with major amputation

             -  immunosuppressed patients

             -  patients with autoimmune disease, malignancy

           or

        3. Any suitable patient with graft infection or present infection in the anatomical
           position of indicated vascular reconstruction.
