      incidence increases with age. The amount of patients suffered from AF is still underestimated
      due to insufficient diagnosing silent AF. The incidence of patients with silent, asymptomatic
      AF might be approx. 80% , particularly in patients with heart failure. The most frequent
      consequence of undiagnosed AF is not only thromboembolism but also heart failure development
      and loss of quality of life. The incidence of chronic heart failure (CHF), which is the most
      frequent consequence of coronary heart disease, still increases and nowadays in patients
      above 70 years affects approx.10%. What is more, AF which is one of the result of CHF
      occurred in 30% of those patients. Atrial fibrillation ablation is one of the most
      established method to treat symptomatic patients and its' efficacy is about 70 - 90 %. Hence,
      the appropriate and effective treatment of those patients might influence not only on the
      survival but also the quality of life and functionality of health care system.

      Among many data about AF in patients with impaired LV (left ventricle) systolic function
      there is still a lack of randomized, multicenter trials which would compare the influence of
      AF cryoablation with conventional treatment in patients with LVEF (left ventricle ejection
      fraction) â‰¤ 35% (despite optimal pharmacotherapy) on long term survival and efficacy. The
      deficiency in this field was an inspiration to conduct this study.
