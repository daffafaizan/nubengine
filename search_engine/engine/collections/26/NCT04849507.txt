    
      In this Phase I study, we will conduct a small-scale safety and efficacy study of the
      BabyStrong portable taVNS feeding system. We will test the BabyStrong feeding system using
      active (n=10) and sham (n=10) taVNS in infants with twice daily (A or B treatment) for 10
      days, with cross over to B/A treatment if there is no progress with feeds within 10 days of
      taVNS treatment. Subsequent A /B treatment will be continued for another 7 days for any
      treatment effect, prior to arranging for G-tube placement if infant continues to make no
      progress. If the infant attains full oral feeds and gains weight, they may be discharged at
      any time during the treatment protocol. The treatment assignment will be blinded to care
      providers, study personnel and parents. We will compare daily oral feeding volumes over 10
      days prior and the 10 days of treatment, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      changes before and after 10 days of taVNS treatment, and after another 7days if the
      cross-over design is employed. Safety measures will be bradycardia and discomfort, as in our
      prior taVNS feeding pilot trial, "taVNs paired with bottle feeding in infants failing oral
      feeds" National Clinical Trials #04643808.

      Criteria for success of BabyStrong feeding system: No sustained increase in discomfort
      scores; No bradycardia; Improvement in daily feeding volumes compared with pre-taVNS, and/or
      attainment of full oral feeds in 50% of infants; improvement in white matter microstructure
      by diffusion MRI before and after active treatment.
