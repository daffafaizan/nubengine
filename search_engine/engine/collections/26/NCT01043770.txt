      of developing diabetes, heart disease and strokes. Metabolic syndrome is a major public
      health concern requiring urgent action because 25% of the adult UK population fulfil the
      criteria, and this will increase as people continue to be less active and levels of
      overweight and obesity rise.

      The aim of our study is to see if people with metabolic syndrome who attend a structured
      group education programme based on lifestyle changes (dietary and increased physical
      activity) can lessen their risk of having diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the future.
      Overall, we hope to show that this type of education reduces the number of people who have
      metabolic syndrome.

      Subjects recruited with metabolic syndrome will be randomised to intervention or control
      arms. The intervention arm will receive group education and the control group will receive
      routine care.

      The results will inform primary prevention strategies in people from varied ethnic
      backgrounds who are at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
