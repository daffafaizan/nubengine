      transplantation. The risk of severe infections remains high for several months and CD3+
      reconstitution could take more than 10 months. The low number of lymphocytes infused with the
      graft, the degree of HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) disparity, and a reduced thymic function
      in adults and differences in host/donor antigen presenting cells are contributing causes.

      The infusions of HSV-TK engineered lymphocytes may represent a significant therapeutic
      improvement in haploidentical HCT (hematopoietic cell transplantation), because it remarkably
      may enhance both GvL (Graft versus Leukemia) activity, thus reducing the occurrence of
      disease relapse, and post-transplant immune reconstitution in the absence of chronic immune
      suppression, thus decreasing the rate of both post-transplant opportunistic infections and
      transplant-related mortality. Furthermore, the efficient control of GvHD achieved via the
      suicide mechanism allows also the multiple infusion of HSV-TK-treated donor lymphocytes, when
      needed, that might further improve post-transplant host immune reconstitution, and survival
      in patients receiving haplo-HCT. Finally, this therapeutic approach can become a valuable
      option for all candidates, including patients with advanced disease and older age.

      The proposed clinical trial represents an innovative therapeutic treatment for patients
      affected by high risk acute leukemia, who have undergone haploidentical stem cell
      transplantation.
