      the relationship between traumatic experience and the neural mechanisms of various PTSD
      symptoms, and determine how this relationship changes during PTSD extinction. Also, this
      proposal aims to better understand how the genetic/epigenetic profile of several genes
      predicts, and perhaps changes, in response to recovery from PTSD along with its neural
      correlates. This understanding will help identify individuals who will respond most optimally
      to a specific empirically based PTSD treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy, while further
      connecting genetic biomarkers of risk with neural intermediate phenotypes underlying PTSD
      symptomatology.This study is observational as the investigator does not assign specific
      interventions to the participants of the study.
