      Such assessment is suspected to lead to underestimation. In addition, to our knowledge, no
      comparison has been done between those induced abortions and the natural miscarriages.

      Illegal aspects of non-medical use of misoprostol and consequently bad self-declaration are
      hindrance to good assessment of the burden of such practice among patients asking for medical
      care at emergency unit for miscarriage or threatened miscarriage. They may also impair
      quality of evaluation of the relative risk associated to miscarriage threatened miscarriage
      induced by misoprostol compared to the same obstetrical complication without absorption of
      misoprostol. After a dose, misoprostol is quickly active and metabolised. It is mainly
      eliminated in urine. This elimination seems to be a way to increase the length of detection
      of the use of misoprostol. The aim of our study is to perform a detection of misoprostol in
      urine sample of patients hospitalised for a miscarriage or threatened miscarriage. This
      sample will be done during emergency cares. The study will not change the procedure of
      medical care of the patients during or after hospitalisation. All data will be obtained from
      information and result of tests normally done in such situation.
