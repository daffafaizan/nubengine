      pilot data to determine the effects of a physical therapy intervention on physical function,
      gait, balance, posture, pulmonary function, and quality of life. Additionally the 30 day
      readmission, ER visits, and mortality was to be tracked. This study failed due to lack of
      recruitment. However, the aim to examine the effectiveness a physical therapy intervention
      was still used just in a broader population. The intervention and measures remained the same
      except for 30 day admission/mortality data.

      The new aim was to examine the effectiveness of manual therapy and exercise on posture,
      function, gait, pulmonary function, and quality of life in older community dwelling adults
      with hyperkyphosis or forward head posture. Kyphosis, osteoporosis, decreased trunk
      flexibility, and pain are considered potential causes of restrictive lung function. The
      physical therapy intervention targets both soft tissue and skeletal restrictions to improve
      mobility. The outcomes were chosen to examine not only the direct impact on posture but also
      the indirect impact on physical function including pulmonary status. Lastly, cognitive
      mapping was used to record the change in the perceptions of the participants as they
      improved.
