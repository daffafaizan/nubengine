      skin of aged individuals. The objective of the study was to examine whether normalizing of
      the pH by acidification through topical treatment helps to strengthen the skin barrier, to
      induce epidermal differentiation and to reduce Inflammation. The effect of a cosmetic
      oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion adjusted to pH 4 in comparison to the same emulsion adjusted to
      pH 5.8 on the integrity of the skin barrier and the mechanical stability was examined in
      healthy volunteers from age 18 to 75 years.
