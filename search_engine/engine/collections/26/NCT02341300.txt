      counseling, food recall, prenatal vitamin, +/- iron and vit c) improve the hematocrit of
      pregnant women with anemia? Study Intervention: To provide a cast iron pot to those pregnant
      women with anemia who are randomized to intervention group and an aluminum pot to those women
      in the control group. Women will be blinded to their allocation. Women with a qualifying
      hemoglobin will meet with our nutritionist (as they would if not enrolled in the study), and
      she will perform a standardized 24 hour food recall and nutrition counseling according to the
      standard of care, as well as perform written informed consent. The 24 hour food recall will
      be submitted to the manufacturer (Nutrition Quest) to calculate the baseline iron intake of
      each subject. Subjects will be enrolled only if they can agree to incorporate the provided
      pot into their cooking (in any capacity) 3x/week. Subjects will be called 1x/month and asked
      about the frequency of pot use over the past month as well as their compliance with iron and
      vitamin C supplements, if prescribed. Subjects will then also be contacted postpartum to
      determine satisfaction with the intervention.

      Outcome measure: We will be looking at hemoglobin levels in the first, second, and third
      trimester as well as postpartum (which are all routinely collected labs in pregnancy).
      Ferritin will be added along with routine labs at approximately 19 weeks as this is often
      performed in the workup of anemia. No labs outside of routine maternal labs will be
      performed.
