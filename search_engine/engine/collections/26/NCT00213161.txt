      mild anemia can have serious implications for child development. In India, government
      programs within India have been ineffective in controlling this public health problem due to
      the lack of effective iron supplements reaching children.

      Our research group developed 'Sprinkles', an inexpensive micronutrient supplement which is a
      single-serve sachet of tasteless powder that contain encapsulated iron and other
      micronutrients. Parents can be easily instructed to mix the contents of one sachet into a
      bowl of any complementary food.

      This study is part of a partnership and capacity development between interdisciplinary
      research groups at The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Canada and the King
      Edward Memorial Hospital in India, aimed at developing a long-term program of research that
      will address iron deficiency anemia among infants and young children in India. For Sprinkles
      to be implemented into national programs in India, a comprehensive strategy is needed which
      includes a single, safe and effective iron dose for the Indian population.

      This specific study is to conduct a community-based, randomized clinical trial in India to
      determine the appropriate dose of supplementation required for the target age group.
