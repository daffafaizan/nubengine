    
      A multicenter, stratified, open, randomized, comparator-controlled, parallel-group phase III
      study. In this study, treatment with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate plus best supportive care
      (30 mg Octreotide LAR) will be compared to treatment with high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR in
      patients with inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive, histologically proven midgut
      carcinoid tumours; these patients should be progressive under Octreotide LAR. In case
      patients in either arm experience clinical symptoms (i.e. diarrhoea and flushing) associated
      with their carcinoid tumours, Octreotide s.c. rescue injections are allowed.

      Objective tumour response in both arms will be assessed every 12Â±1 weeks from the first
      treatment date according to RECIST Criteria. The baseline CT scan/MRI must not be older than
      4 weeks before the projected randomization date.

      Patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability in accordance with the Visit Schedules
      for the 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate arm and the Octreotide LAR arm as indicated in Table 1
      and Table 2, respectively.
