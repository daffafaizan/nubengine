    
      The proposed phase II study is a single-centre, randomized, double masked, parallel arm,
      vehicle-controlled trial, designed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of rhNGF
      eye drops at 20 Âµg/ml concentration administered six times daily for 8 weeks in patients who
      underwent cataract and corneal refractive surgery, both known to damage the corneal sensory
      nerve plexus.

      After confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria all eligible patients will be
      randomized at 2:1 ratio to rhNGF or vehicle control treatment with 8 weeks of study
      treatments administration with 4 weeks Follow-up.
