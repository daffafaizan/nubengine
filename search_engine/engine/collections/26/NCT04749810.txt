      vaccinated against meningococcal infections were treated by Elizaria®.

      The study is planned to include at least 50 patients receiving Elizaria® for the aHUS
      treatment.

      The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, including, if necessary,
      immunization with meningococcal vaccine, a treatment period of 52 weeks.

      Medication will be prescribed in accordance with routine medical practice. Accordingly to
      minimize the risks and subjectivity of assessments the methods adopted in the routine
      practice of treating patients with aHUS will be used.

      Investigators enroll patients with aHUS diagnosis who have indications for pathogenetic
      therapy and who are receiving Elizaria® under the government program. Patients will receive
      medication in accordance with the established requirements of national standards and
      protocols for the treatment of patients with aHUS. The registration of the amount of the drug
      used will be carried out on the basis of information in the Patient Diaries, as well as
      primary documentation.
