    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two
      parallel group of patients, Phase IIIb clinical study to test the efficacy and safety of
      adding low-dose hCGs in a short protocol with GnRH agonist and ovarian stimulation with
      recombinant FSH (rFSH) from the onset of the follicular phase and throughout the duration of
      stimulation in enrolled women to the increase in the rate of clinical pregnancies.

      Main end point will be the rate of clinical pregnancy (positive heart rate at 7 weeks of
      gestation in the ultrasound), while secondary endpoints will be

        -  The number of follicles (> 11,> 14,> 18 mm) on the day of triggering with hCG

        -  The thickness of the endometrium on the day of follicular maturation

        -  Live birth rates

        -  Automatic abortion rates (loss of pregnancy after positive heart function up to 20 weeks
           of gestation)

        -  The rate of ongoing pregnancy (positive heart function after 12 weeks of gestation),

        -  The percentage of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (after triggering) with hCG for the
           next 2 weeks

        -  The rate of multiple pregnancy.

      Participants will be randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group (Group 1) and
      the control group (Group 2). Randomization will be done using sealed envelopes marked "Group
      1" and "Group 2". The randomization list will be prepared centrally for the four
      participating clinics (research centers) and there will be a "stratification" per center, per
      30, respectively, and will be shared among the participants.

      "Group 1" will indicate the application of the protocol by adding hCG with the initiation of
      controlled ovarian stimulation protocol for IVF / ICSI with rFSH, and "Group 2" will indicate
      the application of the conventional protocol without the addition of hCG .

      Each patient's assignment to a treatment group will be made by calling the unit's midwife who
      will have 2 envelopes with the above indications and who will not be present when the pair is
      informed by 2 members of the research team.
