      efficacy for acute ischemic stroke currently. The primary hypothesis of this trial is that
      Xingnaojing will increase the proportion of people alive and independent at three months.
      Xingnaojing, combined with guidelines-based standard care, will be compared to standard care
      alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset. All patients
      will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) entry score of 5-20. Patients
      in each group will be treated according to the guidelines-based standard care, including
      intravenous thrombolysis if appropriate. The primary outcome will be determined at 3 months.
