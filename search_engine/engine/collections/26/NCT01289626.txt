      debilitating vasculopathy seen primarily in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD)
      which almost always affects the skin. It has a prevalence rate ~4 % in long term hemodialysis
      patients, with 1-year survival of 45% and an 8-fold risk of death as compared to the general
      dialysis population. (Surgery 1997;122:1083-1089, Kidney Int 2001;60:324-332). Despite being
      described in the literature for over 100 years, there has been no proven effective therapy.
      Lanthanum carbonate (FOSRENOL速) is a potent non-aluminum, non-calcium phosphate binder that
      was approved for use to reduce serum phosphate levels in patients with end stage renal
      disease. Since the proposed etiologic mechanism of injury and vascular calcification of
      calciphylaxis is predominantly hyperphosphatemia, elevated serum PTH, and hypercalcemia,
      FOSRENOL速 would be an ideal pharmacologic agent to utilize in this extremely enigmatic
      disease (Dermatol Clin. 2008 Oct;26(4):557-68). Furthermore, a recent case report
      demonstrated a significant improvement in laboratory parameters and calciphylaxis skin
      lesions with the use of FOSRENOL速 (WMJ. 2008 Nov;107(7):335-8). The primary hypothesis is
      that since calciphylaxis represents the ultimate sequelae of metastatic vascular
      calcification predominantly involving hyperphosphatemia, elevated serum PTH, and
      hypercalcemia, FOSRENOL速 will be efficacious in its treatment.
