      disease treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel compared with those with
      intravenous administration. Currently, prospective cohort study showed a survival benefit of
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy compared with intravenous chemotherapy. Despite this
      improvement, intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not widely used as standard therapy owing to the
      high rate of adverse effects and inconvenience of administering therapy intraperitoneally.
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a multi-modal approach with combined
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy and hyperthermia. It maintains the theoretical benefit of
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy and reduces most of the adverse events from catheter-related
      problems with delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent at the end of surgery. In addition,
      hyperthermia increases the penetration of chemotherapy at the peritoneal surface and
      chemo-sensitivity. In this trial, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HIPEC
      procedures performed after interval debulking surgery in patients with advanced ovarian
      cancer.
