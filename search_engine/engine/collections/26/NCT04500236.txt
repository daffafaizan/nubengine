      period. Whether surgery and specifically anesthesia contribute to the development of
      perioperative cognitive dysfunctions is not clear.

      Cell culture and animal studies have suggested detrimental effects of anesthetic
      exposure.1,2,3 Otherwise, it has been shown in animals that surgery plus anesthesia produced
      worse POCD than anesthesia alone.4 Proinflammatory cytokine levels increase during surgery.
      These elevated levels of inflammatory markers associated with the activation of microglial
      cells may induce neuroinflammation enhancing ongoing neurodegeneration.5 However, anesthetics
      may be capable of modulating inflammation and may alter the neuroinflammatory response.

      Clinical studies associating the effects of general anesthesia with POCD and POD are
      conflicting.6 These varying results could be due to heterogeneity of patients' baseline
      status (e.g. cognitive status, education, associated diseases), type of surgery, as well as
      methods used to determine POCD and POD.

      The use of serum neurobiomarkers, sensitive and specific for neuronal cell injury will
      address the hypothesis of general anesthesia neurotoxicity. Serum Neurofilament Light (NFL)
      is such a neurobiomarker.Currently no study has compared the release of Neurofilament Light,
      a biomarker of neuronal injury, in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia
      compared to surgery with Hypno-analgesia and thus without anesthetic drugs. Our hypothesis is
      that surgery under GA compared to hypnosis does not statistically increase the risk of
      neuronal injury as measured by serum NFL.
