    
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, repeat-dose study designed to assess liver safety, non-liver
      safety, and efficacy in subjects who previously experienced liver chemistry test
      abnormalities while treated with tolvaptan and were permanently discontinued from the drug
      for that reason. Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled. Evaluations will include frequent
      testing of liver chemistry (every week during the Baseline and Titration Periods and every 4
      weeks during the Maintenance Period), physical examinations, vital signs, safety labs (serum
      chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine
      specific gravity and osmolality determinations and trough serum concentration of lixivaptan.
      After meeting entry criteria during a 1-3 week Screening Period that can extend up to 8 weeks
      for medication adjustment, subjects will enter a 3 week no study treatment Baseline Period to
      obtain baseline measurements followed by a 3-6 week Titration Period during which lixivaptan
      administered twice daily (BID) will be titrated to a dose that is tolerated and results in a
      reduced trough urine specific gravity (or the maximum dose level). The minimum dose to enter
      the Maintenance Period is 100 mg BID. Treatment will continue for up to 52 weeks (12 months)
      after which study drug will be held, and final assessments obtained during the Follow-up
      Period of 4 weeks. The total study duration will be up to approximately 73 weeks (16.8
      months).
