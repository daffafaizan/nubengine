      clinics. Physicians will screen every patient attending to each clinic during the enrollment
      period for the presence of main eligibility criteria. Those patients who appear to be
      eligible will be introduced to the study and referred to a researcher for a more in-depth
      screening evaluation. Eligible patients who are interested in participating in the study will
      be asked to sign the informed consent. Consecutive patients will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to an experimental group or a control group. During the first month, participants
      in the experimental group will receive a well-being promoting intervention in adjunction to
      the treatment as usual (TAU), while those in the control group will be asked to follow the
      TAU. In the following 3 months participants in both groups will receive the small change
      intervention in adjunction to the the TAU. All in person sessions of the intervention will
      take place in an office of both the 2 diabetes clinics involved. Data about psychological and
      clinical variables will be collected for each participant through questionnaires and
      interviews at baseline, at post-intervention, and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.
      Participants' weight will be measured at each assessment point using a scale. Medical charts
      will be accessed to collect further data about physiological parameters, treatment received
      and medical history.
