      patients and will sub-categorize and organize this cohort based on individuating
      characteristics including but not limited to type and severity of condition, associated
      symptoms, and medical/psychological issues (e.g., depression, disability, sleep). Detailed
      evaluations and classification will be completed for each enrolled subject. This will
      encompass genomic and epigenomic studies, past medical history, imaging reports, and specific
      physical exam results for each patient. It will also enable the study investigators to match
      patients with suitable interventional clinical trials.

      Similar diseases, such as other paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT, SUNA, hemicrania continua, and
      trigeminal neuralgia may also be investigated.
