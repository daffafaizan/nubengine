    
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, controlled, 1:1 allocation trial comparing Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation only (Group A) to those undergoing bariatric surgery six
      months prior to AF catheter ablation (Group B) in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF
      who also have morbid obesity.

      Participants will be followed for 12 months after their protocol-assigned catheter ablation.
      Scheduled visits Group A will be at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post AF ablation. Scheduled
      visits in Group B will be baseline, clinical visit prior AF ablation, and at 3, 6, and 12
      months post AF ablation. At each post ablation visit the following data will be collected:

      AT/AF recurrence determined by ambulatory monitoring, clinic visit, or hospitalization;
      Physical Exam (weight, height, vitals); 12 lead ECG; Medication Regimen; AF Symptom Severity
      Scale (AFSS); Quality of Life (AFEQT); Laboratory Testing; and Adverse Events
