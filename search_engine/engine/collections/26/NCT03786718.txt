    
      Up to 70 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be enrolled and given access to a
      diabetes dashboard within an existing patient web portal. Patients will be invited by mail
      (or email) to be screened for enrollment in the study. Patients may also respond at a study
      flyer and contact the study team to be screened for enrollment. Eligible and interested
      patients will be emailed a link to a secure study website where they will complete a web
      consent form. After enrollment, participants will complete a baseline web-based
      questionnaire. After completing the enrollment questionnaire, they will be provided access to
      the diabetes dashboard within the patient web portal for one month. After one month,
      participants will receive an additional follow-up (final) questionnaire to assess outcomes.
