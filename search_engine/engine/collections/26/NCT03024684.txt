      patients with HCC at BCLC stage 0 or A will be enrolled from 8 hospitals in Taiwan. After
      complete ablation or hepatic resection of the tumor(s), participants are randomized 1:1 to
      receive either atorvastatin 10mg once daily (intervention group) or matched placebo (control
      group) for 3 years. During the 3-year period, patients are monitored for recurrence of HCC by
      dynamic computed tomography (or magnetic resonance image) every 4 months. They will be
      followed up until death, withdrawal from participation, study termination, or 3 years after
      the ablative treatment. The primary endpoint is to compare the 3-year cumulative incidence of
      recurrent HCC between the intervention group and control counterpart. Secondary endpoints are
      occurrence of clinical complications related to hepatic decompensation (including
      gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, spontaneous peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy,
      hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatopulmonary syndrome), liver-related mortality, and all-cause
      mortality.
