    
      Participants with moderate to severe acute kidney injury (AKI) who are discharged from
      participating centers (the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center, University of Kentucky) will be randomized to coming to a
      dedicated AKI clinic at one of the three recruitment centers for up to four visits over 3
      months or usual care. At the visits to the AKI follow-up clinics, medicine reconciliation
      will be done, blood pressure will be measured, information on hospitalizations and other
      adverse events will be taken and blood and urine samples will be collected to check kidney
      function and store samples to measure biomarkers of AKI. Participants randomized to usual
      care will be contacted by telephone to review medications currently being taken and to
      collect information on hospitalizations and other adverse events. The primary outcome
      measures will be include both process of care and clinical outcomes.
