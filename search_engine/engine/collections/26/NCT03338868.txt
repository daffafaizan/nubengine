      level, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and central obesity. MetS has become a large public health
      issue with common interrelation to different accompanying disorders. Moreover, the link
      between MetS and musculoskeletal disorders has previously been demonstrated.

      Presence and prevalence of MetS in patients having musculoskeletal pain seems common and
      interrelated.However, to our knowledge, manifestations with clinical symptoms of MetS, some
      inflammatory markers via serum concentrations and physical and psychological health profiles
      of patients with seeking treatment from outpatient physical therapy for musculoskeletal pain
      conditions have not been researched up to now.
