      clinical remission with standard platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. Surrogate biomarkers
      are needed for the evaluation of efficacy of treatment and for use as predictors of disease
      in screening and for relapse diagnosis. CA-125, the existing ovarian cancer marker, will
      become elevated with relapse in some but not all of the 80 percent of patients for whom it
      was increased at initial diagnosis. Elevation in CA-125 may precede clinical evidence of
      relapse by as much as 6 - 10 months or lag behind clinical relapse by the same time
      intervals, making it a less than satisfactory clinical tool. Emerging proteomic technologies
      allow for scanning of cellular proteins in a simple, short, reproducible, and quantitative
      chemical assay. We hypothesize that changes in a patient s protein pattern will be detectable
      and will be reliably associated with relapse. This protocol is a pilot study for our ability
      to ascertain and evaluate samples from ovarian cancer patients followed in first clinical
      remission, and investigate whether analysis of sequential protein fingerprints will yield a
      reproducible pattern of change that may be associated with relapse.
