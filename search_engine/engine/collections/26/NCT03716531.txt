      in treating pancreatic cancer after 3-6 months of chemotherapy and external radiation
      therapy. IORT works by delivering radiation therapy to the tumor while reducing the amount of
      healthy tissue exposed to the radiation therapy. The investigators believe that the
      administration of IORT after 3-6 months of chemotherapy will help to stop the cancer cells
      from growing.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved IORT for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.
