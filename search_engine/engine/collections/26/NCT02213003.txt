    
      Islet transplantation will be performed in subjects with unstable Type 1 diabetes mellitus
      under permanent immunosuppression. Islets are re-suspended in autologous plasma and
      distributed on the omental surface by a minimal invasive approach. Cell adherence is achieved
      by addition of clinical-grade recombinant human thrombin that reacts with plasma to create a
      biocompatible, degradable gel containing the islet graft. The primary efficacy endpoint is
      the proportion of subjects with HbA1c â‰¤6.5% at 1 year AND free of severe hypoglycemic events
      from Day 28 to Day 365, inclusive, after the islet transplant. The primary safety endpoint is
      to demonstrate patient safety throughout all stages of the trial.
