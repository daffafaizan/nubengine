    
      This Phase 1a clinical trial is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of
      the Pfs25-IMX313/Matrix-M transmission blocking vaccine in healthy adult volunteers. An
      important secondary objective is to to assess the immune response to the vaccine.

      8 volunteers will receive 3 doses of 10µg Pfs25-IMX313 in 50 µg Matrix-M1 on days 0, 28 and
      56. Blood samples will be taken for safety testing and to collect information about the
      immune response. Any symptoms that occur after vaccination will also be recorded.

      Healthy volunteers aged 18-45 will be recruited in England at the Centre for Clinical
      Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford.
