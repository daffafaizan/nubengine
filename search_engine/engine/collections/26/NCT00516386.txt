      time when healthy adolescents are rapidly accruing bone, with implications for peak bone mass
      and fracture risk in later life. They are also deficient in insulin-like growth factor I
      (IGF-I), the bone trophic factor made in the liver in response to growth hormone (GH),
      despite elevated levels GH. It is possible that deficiency of IGF-I, a hormone very important
      for the maintenance of skeletal integrity, may contribute to the severe osteopenia seen in
      AN. The physiologic effects of rhIGF-I treatment in adolescents with AN had not been studied.
      The goal of this proposal was to investigate the acute effects of rhIGF-I on bone metabolism
      in adolescent girls with AN.

      Specific Aim: It was hypothesized that adolescent AN patients, being IGF-I deficient, would
      respond to exogenously administered rhIGF-I with elevations in biochemical indices of bone
      turnover. Therefore, rhIGF-I was administered to AN patients by subcutaneous injection over
      10 days with concomitant measurement of indices of bone turnover, and calcium regulatory
      hormones.
