      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy with vs without concurrent goserelin, in
           terms of biological and/or clinical progression-free survival, in patients who have
           undergone surgery for recurrent or refractory prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare metastases-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the immediate and delayed toxicities of these regimens.

        -  Compare the delay in reaching the prostate-specific antigen nadir in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life at 1 and 5 years after radiotherapy in these patients.

        -  Compare the functional dependence at 1 and 5 years after radiotherapy in patients age 75
           years and over.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients also receive goserelin
           subcutaneously on day 1 and again 3 months later.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 466 patients will be accrued for this study.
