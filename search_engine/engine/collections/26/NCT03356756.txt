      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology, which can result in
      myocardial inflammation. Approximately 5% of patients with sarcoidosis have clinically
      apparent cardiac involvement, yet autopsy series indicate that cardiac involvement is present
      in up to 25% of cases. This discrepancy suggests that cardiac sarcoidosis may be
      under-diagnosed in clinical practice. Recent studies have demonstrated high diagnostic
      accuracy of both cardiac MRI and 18F-labelled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET for detection
      of cardiac involvement. However, cardiac MRI may fail to identify areas of active
      inflammation even with fluid sensitive T2-weighted sequences.

      Fasting 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to identify early cardiac
      sarcoidosis with relatively high sensitivity. To date, simultaneous PET/MRI evaluation of
      cardiac inflammation and sarcoidosis has only been described in limited case reports. The
      objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the utility of simultaneous PET/MRI imaging
      in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and other inflammatory cardiomyopathies.
