    
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of a balance training program in a virtual
      environment (using a gaming system with balance board device) with and without verbal/manual
      physiotherapeutic intervention, on the motor function, balance and gait in chronic stroke
      patients.

      It is a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial, performed at Center of
      Research of the Department of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of
      SÃ£o Paulo University.

      Forty chronic stroke patients will be randomly in control and experimental group, 20 each
      one. Both groups conduct 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session
      will consist a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and
      axial mobility exercises. After this, both groups will perform more 30 minutes of balance
      training using eight Wii Fit games which stimulate motor and cognitive functions.

      The main outcome measures will be: the lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment
      (FMA-LE); Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) and 6- minute walk test (6MWT).
