    
      Central Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that high muscle force induced via a novel,
      portable, active standing intervention will increase muscle force properties, alter gene
      expression for atrophy and fiber type pathways, and improve systemic insulin sensitivity in
      Veterans with complete paralysis.

      Aim 1: To determine the training effects of 3 tiers of quadriceps muscle force on muscle
      physiological properties in Veterans with chronic paralysis from SCI.

      Aim 2: To determine the training effects of 3 tiers of quadriceps muscle forces on muscle
      mRNA for genes associated with atrophy and muscle fiber type in Veterans with complete
      paralysis.

      Aim 3: To determine the training effects of 2 tiers of compressive load induced by quadriceps
      muscle forces on insulin sensitivity and markers of inflammation in Veterans with SCI.
