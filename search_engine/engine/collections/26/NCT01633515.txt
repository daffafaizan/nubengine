      cryotherapy - freezing of the skin lesion with liquid nitrogen. This method is highly
      effective for the treatment of BCC. The purpose of this study is to determine the cure rates
      of BCC utilizing intralesional cryotherapy.

      surgery in the gold standard for the treatment of BCC, however in the case of skin malignancy
      in the elderly and in the lower extremity, surgical complication (including skin grafting)
      are high. Therefore cryotherapy which is a non surgical treatment method provides an optimal
      therapeutic choice.

      10 cases of BCC (confirmed by biopsy) in the lower extremity of elderly will undergo
      intralesional cryotherapy. A Cryoneedle is introduced through the skin lesion and the BCC is
      frozen. Treatment success will be determined according to biopsy results 3 months after
      treatment. Participants will be followed at the out patient clinic for the duration of wound
      healing, an expected average duration of 3 weeks.
