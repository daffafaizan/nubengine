      was composed of 6 participants. The Training follows the cognitive-behavioural model. In the
      first part of every meeting, theoretical aspects about stress and anxiety were explained,
      while in the second part some relaxation techniques were taught. During relaxation, we used a
      selected music that was also going to be used during the diagnostic tests. Since the first
      meeting, patients experienced these relaxing techniques in order to learn them. In order to
      support the adaptability, at the end of every meeting the participants received some
      homework. They had to take notes on how many times they repeated the relaxation exercises and
      on the anxiety level before and after the training.

      For the study, 43 people were recruited. Anxiety was measured with Beck Anxiety Inventory
      (BAI); it values the seriousness of the physiological behaviour connected with anxiety. This
      test an "anxiety gauge", which allows us to obtain numerical data on emotional changes. The
      test is composed of 4 interpretative levels: serious, moderate, small and minimal anxiety.

      The coping style was measured with Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced-New Italian
      Version (COPE-NIV); this test evaluates the way in which people resolve and face traumatic or
      usual stressful situations.

      The research project was approved by the Ethics Committee of Veneto Institute of Oncology.

      Every patient signed a written informed consent to process the data for research purposes and
      to publish it.

      Forty-three patients who had to undergo one or more diagnostic tests (PET, TAC, fMRI,
      Mammography, Endoscopy, Colonoscopy) took part in the study. The average age was 52.4 and
      61.5% were married.
