    
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled Phase I/II multi-center trial, of the safety and
      efficacy of Celecoxib in a cohort of 81 HNPCC subjects and gene carriers. The three proposed
      intervention arms are: Celecoxib (to be provided by Searle) will be administered at 200 mg
      p.o. BID x 12 months or 400 mg p.o. BID x 12 months vs. Placebo p.o. BID x 12 months.
      Assessment of endoscopic and tissue-based biomarker endpoints will be conducted at baseline
      and 12 months on study drug or placebo. Patients that present with polyps at baseline will
      undergo a month 4 endoscopy. Plasma drug trough samples for pharmacokinetic analyses will be
      collected at baseline and month 12. NCI-Chemoprevention Branch will coordinate the efforts
      and activities of all sites.

      Safety monitoring will occur via in-patient interviews with exams at month twelve; symptom
      questionnaires completed at baseline, months one, four, eight and twelve; blood and
      urinalysis at baseline and at months one, four, eight and twelve. A post-administration
      telephone call to evaluate side effect resolution will occur at months 13-14 for patients who
      have unresolved adverse events at the end of month 12.
