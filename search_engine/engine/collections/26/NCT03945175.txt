    
      One purpose of this trial is to extend the evidence basis for Mydayis in adult ADHD to
      include efficacy with a clinical ADHD symptom measure validated for DSM-5 adult ADHD. Another
      purpose of this trial is to re-examine the clinical efficacy of Mydayis later in the day on
      ADHD symptoms; the data on ADHD symptoms via the TASS 1 (Spencer et al. 2008) is a decade old
      and has not been examined in subsequent trials.
