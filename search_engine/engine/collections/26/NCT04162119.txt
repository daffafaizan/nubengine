      Therefore, the combination of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies with CART therapy may further
      improve the clinical efficacy of CART cell for multiple myeloma.

      The investigators screened PD-1 mutant that have high affinity bind with the PD-L1 ligand,
      and the affinity of the prepared mutant PD-1 Fc fusion protein to bind to PD-L1 reached
      clinical anti-PD-L1 antibody levels. The investigators prepared BCMA CART cells which
      secretes the mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein, and the prepared CART cell culture supernatant can
      well block the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1. Preclinical studies have shown that BCMA CART cells
      secreting mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein have a superior killing effect on PD-L1 positive
      multiple myeloma tumor cells to BCMA CART cells which does not express PD-1 fusion protein.

      The trial was conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of BCMA-PD1-CART cells in
      Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.
