    
      Hypothesis Genetic variants of the elements in the folate-related cycles and methotrexate
      disposition networks are associated with the TRANCE phenotype of childhood leukemia
      survivors.

      Objectives

        1. To identify TRANCE phenotypes of the childhood leukemia survivors.

        2. To characterize the folate and vitamin B12 levels of these children

        3. To identify DNA methylation patterns associated with TRANCE trait in the leukemia
           survivors

        4. To identify SNPs associated with the TRANCE trait in the leukemia survivors.

        5. To identify the "deficit genotype" associated only with the TRANCE leukemia survivors,
           but not with general population children who show developmental phenotypes similar to
           TRANCE: TRANCE-unique deficit variant

        6. To replicate the association between the TRANCE-unique deficit variants and the TRANCE
           trait in a population of childhood leukemia survivors.

        7. To evaluate the importance of rare genetic variants in the TRANCE trait in the leukemia
           survivors.

      Study design: A case-control study of leukemia survivors

      Analyses

        1. Leukemia survivors will be characterized by their status of neurocognitive function, and
           categorized into the Deficit case and the non-deficit Control case.

        2. They will be also characterized by the following attributes

             1. Pathway-based genetic variant status (folate and PK-related genes)

             2. Folate and vitamin B12 status

             3. Epigenetic markers

        3. Comparative analyses between neuro-cognitiive deficit phenotype (TRANCE) and Control on
           those parameters
