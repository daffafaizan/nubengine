      I. To determine clinical, pathologic, and molecular predictors of germline DNA repair gene
      (gDRG) mutation carriers in a population-based cohort of men diagnosed with metastatic
      prostate cancer (mPC).

      II. To characterize stepwise cascade genetic testing for at-risk male relatives of mPC cases
      with gDRG mutations.

      III. To identify a cohort of men with gDRG mutations without a prostate cancer diagnosis who
      may benefit from an early detection protocol for prostate cancer. (Note: An early detection
      study for men with gDRG mutations without a prostate cancer diagnosis will be conducted as a
      separate trial.)

      OUTLINE:

      Participants with mPC identified through the Washington State Cancer Registry receive mail
      and phone invitations to participate. Participants complete a web-based or hard copy
      questionnaire on their health history and family history of cancer and are mailed a saliva
      collection kit. Saliva samples are mailed back to Color Genomics for genetic testing, and
      results are provided both to participants and to study researchers. Participants who are
      identified to have an inherited mutation in a DNA repair gene receive phone-based genetic
      counseling, and are also asked for permission to contact their adult male relatives. If
      permission is granted, those relatives receive mail and phone invitations to complete genetic
      testing in a similar fashion.
