      childhood to adult life. It's heritability is 76%. It was found that there is a greater ADHD
      prevalence in first-degree families of ADHD subjects- 4-6 times more than the general
      population.

      Pharmacological treatment is the first line treatment today in ADHD, in children and adults,
      and Methylphenidate (specially Ritalin IR) is the first medication given for the disorder.

      The study includes couples of first-degree family members, both diagnosed with ADHD. Subjects
      will receive Ritalin IR for 4 weeks and undergo several psychiatric and cognitive
      questionnaires at each time of the follow-up meeting (a total of 3).
