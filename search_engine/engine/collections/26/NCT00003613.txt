      I. To determine the kinetics of AGT depletion in CTCL skin lesions. II. To determine the
      toxicity of low dose BCNU plus O6BG.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carmustine.

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed by topical carmustine once every 2
      weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carmustine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 6 weeks.
