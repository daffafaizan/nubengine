      older with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension for a randomized trial using willpower to
      manage high blood pressure. Voluntary participants will complete three phases: baseline,
      intervention, and post-treatment. Baseline phase includes a preliminary phone screening,
      fasting blood draw, physiological test (measuring heart rate variability, chest compression,
      etc.), and a psychosocial inventory. Intervention phase includes 8 weeks of once weekly
      trainings (approximately one hour long) to be held on a weekday evening. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the two willpower groups and will be asked to rehearse the
      willpower method at least once daily for 30 minutes during these 8 weeks. Post-treatment
      phase includes two follow-up booster sessions (at week 12 and week 16) for refreshing
      willpower techniques, a follow-up fasting blood draw, a physiological test, and a
      psychosocial inventory.

      Participation is completely voluntary and confidential. Volunteers completing each of the
      phases will be compensated $100 for their time. If someone is interested in participating,
      they should call our office at 850-645-0247 or email fsuwillpower@gmail.com.
