    
      This study is designed to compare long-term outcomes among patients randomized on the BMT CTN
      0702 protocol (NCT01109004). All patients who consent will be followed for death,
      progression, Second Primary Malignancies (SPMs), and Quality of Life (QOL). Patients who do
      not consent to the long-term follow-up mechanism or who have experienced progression on the
      BMT CTN 0702 study will be followed through the standard Center for International Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) long-term follow-up mechanism. Additionally, patients who
      are eligible and are willing to continue with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy will be
      provided lenalidomide free of charge. These patients will continue to receive lenalidomide as
      maintenance therapy until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or
      withdrawal from the study. The endpoints assessed will include progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), incidence of second primary
      malignancies (SPM) and health quality of life (QOL).
