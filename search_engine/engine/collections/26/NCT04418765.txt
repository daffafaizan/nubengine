      weeks and includes a screening period (28-30 days), a placebo-controlled treatment period (24
      weeks) and a treatment extension period (48 weeks).

      The patient will start treatment at the baseline visit and follow a 12-week dosing schedule
      with either eptinezumab (100 or 300 mg) or placebo by intraveneous (IV) infusion. Patients
      who were assigned to placebo in the placebo-controlled treatment period, will be randomly
      allocated to one of two treatment groups: eptinezumab 300 mg or eptinezumab 100 mg.
