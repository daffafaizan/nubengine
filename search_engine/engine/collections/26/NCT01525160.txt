      The primary outcome of this study is to test the null hypothesis that no significant
      difference exists between fractal dimension (Df)and vascular injury markers including serum
      amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and
      intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)in patients with OSAHS and sleepy, snoring controls
      of similar age, gender and BMI.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in measured markers
           before and after a night's sleep in OSAHS and controls.

        2. To test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in measured markers
           following 1 month of CPAP treatment, in those with OSAHS.
