      was a non-blinded, randomised, and prospective clinical trial.

      Sample size: This study included 20 maxillary anterior and 25 posterior teeth that required
      restoration due to excessive material loss. The study groups were:

      Zirconia crown(ZC) restoration on the primary central and lateral tooth with root canal
      treatment (n = 10), strip crown(S) restoration on the primary central and lateral tooth with
      root canal treatment (n = 10), Zirconia crown(ZC) restoration on primary teeth with root
      canal treatment (n = 12), Stainless-steel crown(SSC) restoration on primary teeth with root
      canal treatment (n = 13).

      Clinical Procedure:

      Assessment

      Clinical assesment: Table 1 Gingival scores: Löe and Silness Gingival Index(GI)[Löe, 1967].

      Periapical radiographic evaluation: Preoperative and every follow up visit. (Radiographic
      assesment: Table 2)

      Intraoral photos (standard method): before treatment, after treatment and at every follow-up
      visit.

      Crown restoration: All caries were removed after administration of local anaesthesia and
      proper isolation. Calcium hydroxide/iodoform paste (Vitapex®) pulpectomy was performed
      according to the guideline. Teeth were restored with a composite resin Nova Resin (IMICRYL®,
      Konya, Turkey) and glass ionomer cement (MERON®, Voco, Germany) was used as a base material.
      Strip Crown Forms (3M-ESPE, St. Paul,Minnesota, USA) were used to restore teeth group SC. ZC
      group (NuSmile, Houston, Tex. the USA) and SCC(3M ESPE, Minnesota, USA) used.

      Visual analogue scale(VAS): 0-2: no pain/discomfort 4-6:moderate 8-10: high pain/discomfort.

      The child was asked to choose his/her feelings about the tooth after the procedure and in
      follow-up appointments. Parents were asked to complete their satisfaction surveys, including
      the post-op and 6-month controls for patient satisfaction assessment.

      Statistical Method:

      IBM® SPSS® Statistics V23 analysed data. The Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests were used
      for intergroup comparisons within the anterior and posterior regions. The Friedman and
      Cochrane Q tests were used for intra-group time-wise comparisons. Analysis results were
      presented as the median (q1-q3) and frequency (percentage). P<0.05 was considered
      statistically significant.
