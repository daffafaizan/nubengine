    
      The DASS programme records several data, including mean and absloute errors and standard
      deviations from centre and curve.

      Additionally the response time to a randomly appearing target number is recorded (divided
      attention).

      The standard deviation (curve) is the difference between the steering angle and the road
      angle. Standard deviation (centre) is the standard deviation of the centre of the car from
      the centre of the road.

      Steering performance is quantified as the standard deviation of the error from a theoretical
      perfect path.

      The secondary task of the divided attention test is to respond to a randomly appearing target
      number at the sides of the monitor while trying to keep the car in the centre of the road.

      Average Reaction time is the average time (in seconds) it takes the subject to respond to the
      target numbers.
