        -  Compare the disease-free survival, breast cancer-free interval, distant recurrence-free
           interval and overall survival of premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast
           cancer when treated with tamoxifen + ovarian function suppression (by triptorelin,
           oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation) or exemestane + ovarian function suppression vs.
           tamoxifen alone. The primary comparison is ovarian function suppression with either
           tamoxifen or exemestane vs. tamoxifen alone.

        -  Compare the quality of life, including late side effects of early menopause, of patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and number of
      positive axillary and/or internal mammary lymph nodes (0 vs 1 or more) and intended initial
      method of ovarian function suppression (triptorelin vs oophorectomy vs ovarian irradiation).
      Treatment duration is 5 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 4 years.
