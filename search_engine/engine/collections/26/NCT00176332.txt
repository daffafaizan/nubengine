      either 3 months of rosuvastatin or placebo treatment.

      Before and after the intervention period maximal exercise capacity is measured by
      ergospirometry and endothelial function is determined by high-resolution A-mode ultrasound.
      Skeletal muscle biopsies are obtained at begin and after 3 months and are analyzed for
      inflammatory markers, measures of oxidative stress and vasculogenesis. Blood samples are
      assessed with regard to markers of inflammation and oxidative stress as well.
