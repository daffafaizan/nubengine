      calcium aluminium magnesium silicate hydroxide. Potassium, iron, and other cations are common
      substitutes and the exact ratio of cations varies with source.

      Due to its unique physicochemical properties, such as swelling and cation exchange
      capability, as well its mechanical and thermal stability, MONT can be efficiently used as
      matrix for immobilization of proteins with high molecular weight (e.g. Albumin) and proteins
      with low molecular weight (e.g.Aflatoxines). Therefore, MONT is used for therapeutic
      purposes, in pharmaceutical formulations and in food preparations. In vitro assays made in
      our laboratory, showed that MONT absorbs, in stable manner, alimentary proteins:
      beta-lactoglobulins, alfa lactoalbumines and the ratio MONT-protein (w/w) 1:3, 1:5, 1:15,
      results in the protein capture of 50, 27, 0 % of proteins respectively.

      The aim of this project is to study, in healthy volunteers, the in vivo ability of MONT to
      reduce protein intestinal uptake evaluated with the blood MONT- protein ratio. Furthermore,
      the study analyzed in vitro the MONT ability of immobilizing proteins at different ratio
      (w/w) 1:3, 1:5, 1:15.
