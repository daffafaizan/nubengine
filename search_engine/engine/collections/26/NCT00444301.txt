    
      Subjects will be recruited via physicians and nurses providing their care in clinical sites
      who are members of PC-HEART. PC-HEART is a volunteer collaborative with
      clinician-investigators at 60 sites nationally that include hospice organizations and heart
      failure providers in academic, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and community settings.
      Our goal will be to enroll 400 patients with 135 in hospice care and 265 in outpatient
      settings (a mix of HMO, community practice, VA, and academic centers) who are members of the
      Palliative Care- Heart Failure Education And Research Trials (PC-HEART) collaborative. We
      will strive for broad representation of patients living in the community with about one-third
      African American patients (who often present for initial treatment with advanced heart
      failure) and at least one-half elderly (who have high prevalence of both pain and heart
      failure).

      We will use standardized tools to survey patients, as follows:

      Pain & other symptoms (Assessed at enrollment and one-two weeks later):

      Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale- HF (MSAS-HF) Short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ)
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)

      Heart-failure specific measures (Assessed at Enrollment):

      Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)

      Psycho-social situation & cognitive function (Assessed at Enrollment):

      Physicians Health Questionnaire depression screen (PHQ-9) Mini-cog Social functioning:
      ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) , The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) will
      be collected on 1/2 of subjects Clinical Data (from medical record) Patient's medical
      condition: Charleson Comorbidity Scale, prior diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus, Cancer, Chronic
      lung disease, Coronary Artery Disease, Cirrhosis.

      Known painful conditions (osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, CAD with angina, neuropathy,
      others) Physical examination: Jugular Venous Pressure (as per NIH trial standards: base of
      neck, ½ way up, jaw level), edema (+1 (0-1/4" depression), +2 (1/4-1/2"), +3 (1/2-1"), +4
      (>1")), Blood pressure, Respiratory rate, Heart rate & rhythm Echocardiogram data: Date of
      most recent Echocardiogram, LVEF, LVDD, LA dimension, presence of valvular disease & measure
      of severity (for example, if aortic stenosis then valve area, if mitral regurgitation then
      1+-4+) Laboratory data: BUN, CR, Na+, HgB, BNP, hemoglobin

      Demographic Data Age, Sex, Race & ethnic identification, Marital Status, Living situation
      (alone, with family, with other person), employment status (employed, self-employed, retired,
      unemployed due to disability), highest level of education, religious affiliation, annual
      household income, insurance (none, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Kaiser, other
      Health Maintenance Organization, private fee for service).

      Medications & Treatment (Assessed at Enrollment and 1-2 weeks later) Heart Failure
      medications: ACEI, ARB, β-blocker, digoxin, spironolactone, eplerenone, loop diuretics,
      nesiritide, inotropes, warfarin Analgesics: NSAIDs, Cox-2 inhibitors, Aspirin, Acetaminophen,
      Tramadol, Opioids Antidepressants: SSRI, Tricyclics, Psychostimulants, other Topical agents:
      acetylsalicylate acid creams, capsaicin Physical therapy, cold, heat, other modalities
      Statistical Evaluation We will report frequencies of pain in total, frequencies of levels of
      severity & interference in activities of pain, by occasional versus frequent or constant
      pain, and by location with descriptive statistics. To the extent the etiology of pain is
      identified this will be reported with descriptive statistics. Pearson product-moment
      correlation coefficients, t-test and frequency statistics (Chi-square and Fisher's Exact
      test) will be used to evaluate associations between pain presence, severity and type and
      demographic and clinical variables. If possible, comparison will be made between patients
      without pain and those with pain using chi-square tests and t-test.

      A multivariate analysis of variance will be used to assess relationship between pain and
      measures of heart failure severity, social support, depression and symptom distress other
      than pain.

      Differences in Pain measures will be assessed between enrollment and the second assessment
      1-2 weeks later, and changes will be correlated with changes in treatment for pain.
      Geographic locations of pain will be mapped using the body diagram on the BPI to identify
      areas of greatest frequency.
