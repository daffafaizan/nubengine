      on racial and gender differences in platelet aggregation are lacking.

      We hypothesize that there are significant racial and gender differences on aggregatory
      response of platelets to commonly used agonists to evaluate platelet function such as
      adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine, collagen and arachidonic acid.
