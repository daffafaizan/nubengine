      developing interpersonal relationships can affect the search for care and the response of
      individuals to an illness.

      Self-compassion is a concept developed by Kristin Neff. It refers to the disposition of each
      individual to contain their feelings of suffering by a feeling of warmth, connection and
      care.

      The coping corresponds to the answers, the reactions, that the individual will develop to
      control, reduce or simply tolerate the aversive situation. Coping can take the form of
      cognitions, affects and behaviors that an individual will put in place to deal with a
      situation.

      The three concepts (attachment, self-compassion, coping) seem to be interrelated, and they
      contribute to the explanation and management of chronic pain, in the spectrum of the
      bio-psycho-social model of pain. Yet no study has measured these three variables together in
      chronic pain patients

      Chronic and Newly Assisted Patients at CETD (Neurosurgery Department, Pain Assessment and
      Treatment Center) (ie any patient seen for the first time in pain center, and included in the
      research during one of the three medical consultations preliminary to overall care at the
      CETD).
