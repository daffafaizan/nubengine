    
      Forty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists（ASA） Ⅰ-Ⅲ（no limitation of age and
      gender）are randomized to receive either a continuous adductor canal block(ACB) or a femoral
      nerve block(FNB) via a catheter (a continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine, 5 mL/h for 48
      hours)in the PACU immediately after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
      arthroscopically. Patients were under general anesthesia during the operation and received a
      femoral nerve block with 0.25% ropivacaine 10ml before the surgery.Both groups will receive
      postoperatively IV patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine (bolus 0.8mg,lock-out
      time 15 minutes, background infusion 2ml/h)beside the continuous nerve block. Patients are
      going to be visited for follow-up on the day of surgery and in the following two days.
      Quadriceps strength is assessed with the displacement of patella.VAS at rest time、degree of
      knee flexion、VAS at 45°flexion of the knee、dose of opioids、whether the patient has sleep
      disturbance are also recorded.
