      who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study. Eligible
      patients will be examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and to establish a
      baseline for ocular condition.

      Postoperatively, patients will undergo ophthalmic evaluation at regular intervals as
      specified in this protocol.
