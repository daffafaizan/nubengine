      of the routine dental treatment done at the endodontic postgraduate unit. Potential
      volunteers will be given written information about the process and be given time to consider
      participation. Once any questions have been answered, fully informed written consent will be
      obtained if they are interested in taking part. Patients requiring endodontic treatment with
      varying degrees of tooth structure loss will be detected, diagnosed and treated by endodontic
      MClinDent postgraduate students at Guy's hospital using suitable clinical techniques. The
      teeth will then be restored using CAD CAM restorations. Dental periapical radiograph and cone
      beam computed tomography (CBCT)scans (Morita Accuitomo) will be taken at baseline, 12 months
      and 24 months. Clinical assessment and radiographical evaluation will be carried out
      immediately after endodontic treatments have been accomplished and 1 and 2 years post
      treatment and will be assessed independently by a group of examiners. It is hoped that data
      analysed from this study will provide a definitive clinical evidence base for the success and
      survival of endodontically teeth and/or restorations.
