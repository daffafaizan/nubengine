    
      1. To evaluate in thrombocytopenic subjects the efficacy and safety of platelets treated
           with Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) in Platelet Additive Solution. The
           following safety and efficacy measures will be compared between Mirasol treated and
           untreated platelets stored for 2-4 days and stored for 7 days:

             -  Thrombelastography (TEG®) parameters: reaction time R, alpha angle α and maximal
                amplitude (MA)

             -  Platelet Count Increment and Corrected Count Increment

             -  Time to next platelet transfusion

             -  Incidence of transfusion related (serious) adverse events

             -  Incidence and severity of bleedings

        2. To evaluate the use of the TEG® parameters as a measure for platelet transfusion
           efficacy and to evaluate the correlation between the TEG® parameters and the platelet
           Corrected Count Increments after platelet transfusions in thrombocytopenic subjects.
