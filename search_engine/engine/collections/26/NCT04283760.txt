      performing a particular motor movement. The concept of motor imaging has become more and more
      important in recent years and has allowed us to obtain different ideas about the emergence of
      motor movements. When the literature is analyzed, it was reported that the brain areas
      activated during the motor movement of individuals overlap with the active areas in the
      imaging process.As an individual's ability to imagine movement increases, the centers
      participating in the motor system become so activated. In the literature, it has been stated
      that this motor imaging ability may decrease in people who have had a stroke. For this
      reason, the motor imagination ability of the person should be evaluated before a suitable
      rehabilitation program is decided.When we look at the literature, it was seen that the
      Movement Imagery Questionnaire - Revised Second was used to evaluate the patients with
      subacute and chronic stroke, and there was no validity and reliability study in patients with
      acute stroke. Considering this situation, it was planned to translate the Movement Imagery
      Questionnaire -RS questionnaire into our language within the scope of our study and then to
      investigate the reliability and validity of patients with acute stroke.
