      diabetic macular edema (DME) treatment and has gained FDA approval but it is expansive where
      ziv aflibercept (ZALTRAP) has the same molecule but with high osmilar buffer solution which
      is FDA approved for colon rectus cancer treatment and it is cost effective.

      Studies have shown that intravitreal ziv aflibercept is safe and nontoxic despite the high
      osmolarity and even has short term effect in wet age related macular degeneration.
