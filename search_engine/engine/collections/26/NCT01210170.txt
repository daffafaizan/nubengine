    
      Fifteen non-smokers (males and females between the ages of 18 and 65 years) with
      physician-diagnosed moderate persistent asthma will be recruited for the study. The subjects
      will be allowed to use inhaled controller (including ICS) and rescue medication. At study
      entry, all asthmatic subjects must be clinically stable, and have a forced pre-bronchodilator
      one-second expired volume (FEV1) of < 75% predicted.

      Approval for the protocol will be requested from the University of Miami Institutional Review
      Board. All subjects will provide written informed consent.

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Cardiovascular disease and use of cardiovascular medications

        -  Pregnancy

        -  Use of oral controller medication for asthma (methylxanthines, systemic
           glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers)

        -  An acute respiratory infection within 4 weeks before enrollment.

      Each subject will make 8 visits to the research laboratory.

      Procedures:

      Visit 1 (screening visit): On this visit, after having signed the consent form, the subjects
      will perform spirometry before and 15 min after inhaling 180 µg albuterol from a HFA-MDI
      using a spacer.

      Visit 2-8:Subjects that qualify for the study will be asked to return for 7 more visits for
      the following treatment protocols:

        -  Inhalation of 400 µg mometasone 30 min before inhalation of 180 µg albuterol

        -  Inhalation of mometasone placebo 30 min before inhalation of 180 µg albuterol

        -  Simultaneous inhalation of 400 µg mometasone and 180 µg albuterol

        -  Simultaneous inhalation of mometasone placebo and 180 µg albuterol

      Systemic blood pressure, pulse, O2 saturation, spirometry and airway blood flow ( Qaw) will
      be measured before mometasone or placebo inhalation, and before and 15 min after albuterol
      inhalation except on the day when mometasone and albuterol are co-administered; on that day
      the measurements will be made before and 15 min after the mometasone/albuterol
      co-administration.
