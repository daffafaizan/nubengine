      primary complications after stroke. The incidence of falls ranges from 25% to 75% among
      stroke patients residing in different settings, with greater incidence of falls occurring
      after discharge home. Postural instability has been suggested as one of the main causes
      leading to falls in this population. The recovery of the ability to maintain balance during
      activities of daily living, therefore, is essential for functional independence and safety of
      these patients. In the following paragraphs, the knowledge gaps taht we are proposing to
      bridge in this study and the revelant literature that leads us to identify these gaps are
      discussed.
