    
      Subjects with persistent colonies of MRSA/MSSA in the nostril will be recruited to receive
      either active treatment or placebo. This is a dose escalating study. First grout will receive
      either 1% Lytixar™ or placebo, next group 2% Lytixar™ or placebo and finally 5% Lytixar™ or
      placebo. Dose escalation will be performed after a brief safety evaluation of the
      tolerability after application of Lytixar™/placebo vehicle TID for three days.
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from subjects who are willing. Subjects will be
      followed until 9 weeks after initiation of treatment.
