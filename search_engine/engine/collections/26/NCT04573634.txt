    
      This is a prospective cohort study designed to identify the prevalence of IgG antibodies to
      SARS CoV-2 as well as to assess risk factors for IgG positivity. It will compare rates of
      positivity and risk factors among healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and assess
      the ability of PCR negativity at day 3 or 4, 5, 7, or 10 to predict negativity on day 14 in
      individuals quarantining after a COVID exposure.

      In addition to having a standard of care clinical antibody test, both healthcare workers,
      quarantining individuals, and patients will be asked to fill out a survey to assess risk
      factors for COVID infection and provide a research blood sample. Quarantining individuals
      will also have standard of care PCR testing on days 3 or 4, 5, 7, 10, and 14 of the
      quarantine period.

      Collected blood samples will be used to assess for the presence of neutralizing antibodies
      and measure antibodies with a research test. An annual blood specimen and survey will be
      collected from each study participant for up to 2 years total after study entry.
