      healthy subjects to learn volitional control over their own anterior insula (AI) activity.
      Then the effect of AI regulation will assessed by examining subjects' empathic responses and
      functional connectivity changes. Subjects were separated into two groups randomly. While the
      experimental group received specific neurofeedback from their own AI, the control group
      received sham NF from an unspecific region.
