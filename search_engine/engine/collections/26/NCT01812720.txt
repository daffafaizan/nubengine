      I. To assess the complete response (CR) rate with carfilzomib and dexamethasone consolidation
      following an upfront single stem cell transplant (SCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of carfilzomib and dexamethasone when used as consolidation therapy
      in patients post SCT.

      II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years post SCT. III. To evaluate
      progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negative status.

      II. To assess the HevyLite assay prior to and during treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and dexamethasone orally (PO)
      on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
