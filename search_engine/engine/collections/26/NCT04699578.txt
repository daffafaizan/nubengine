      cold to more serious illnesses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). They are positive-stranded RNA viruses, with a corona-like
      appearance under the electron microscope, whose primary target cells are the epithelial cells
      of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. The 2019/20 COVID-19 respiratory disease
      pandemic, caused by a coronavirus, began in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, the capital
      of the Chinese province of Hubei, which has subsequently spread to several countries around
      the world. In early January 2020, health authorities identified the virus responsible for the
      epidemic, designating it, initially as "Coronavirus 2019-nCoV" but later with the official
      name of "SARS-CoV-2". To date, seven Coronaviruses have been shown to be capable of infecting
      humans: Common Human Coronaviruses: HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (Betacoronavirus) and HCoV-229E
      and HCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronavirus); they can cause common colds but also severe lower
      respiratory tract infections; other human coronaviruses (Betacoronaviruses): SARS-CoV,
      MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV (now referred to as SARS-CoV-2).

      SARS-CoV-2 is therefore the seventh virus of the same family that involves humans, spreads
      through respiratory droplets and direct contact. The most common symptoms of the disease
      include fever, cough, asthenia or myalgia, wheezing and headache, and the most serious
      complication is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The new coronavirus has continued
      to spread to multiple countries and continents so much so that the outbreak was declared a
      public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization
      (WHO) on January 30, 2020.

      In the first phase of world emergency, characterized by high morbidity and mortality,
      scientific interest has been mainly focused on the study of the transmission mechanisms of
      the infection, diagnostic tools and therapies for ARDS, especially in elderly patients and
      with co-morbidities. Interest has rapidly spread to other categories of patients and in
      particular to pregnancy, on which the virus could impact in different ways, with consequences
      for both the mother and the fetus.

      During pregnancy, different changes in the immune system and adaptive changes affecting
      organs and systems are observed in relation to the gestational period, among which those
      affecting the respiratory system are highlighted, particularly evident in the third trimester
      including, upper airway mucosal edema induced by elevated levels of estrogen and
      progesterone, elevation of the diaphragm and consequent limited lung expansion, and high
      oxygen consumption, all conditions that increase the susceptibility of pregnant women to
      respiratory insults.

      The maternal immune system during pregnancy undergoes specific adaptations aimed at
      establishing and maintaining a fetal allogeneic tolerance while preserving the ability to
      protect against external infectious agents. It goes from a pro-inflammatory state in the
      first trimester (important for implantation and placentation) to an anti-inflammatory state
      in the second trimester (necessary for fetal growth), and finally returns to a
      pro-inflammatory state again in the third trimester and during childbirth. In addition,
      innate immunity cells, that is, NK cells and monocytes respond more actively to viral
      insults, while the adaptive immune response is down-regulated (Hong Liu et al). As for CD4 +
      (Th) T cells, involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response through the production
      of cytokines, there is a shift in the maternal immune response from Th1 (with
      pro-inflammatory action) towards Th2 (with anti-inflammatory action ), a crucial modification
      for maintaining maternal-fetal tolerance (Wegmannetal et al.).

      It is widely demonstrated that maternal systemic infections, which cause instability in the
      delicate balance of the immune system, may be related to the onset of complications during
      pregnancy, such as increased risk of miscarriage, intrauterine growth retardation, death
      fetal intrauterine.

      Based on these pathophysiological assumptions, it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 infection
      could clinically modify the course of pregnancy and lead to fetal-neonatal complications.

      Recent studies in the literature have shown that severe forms of COVID-19 disease are
      associated with a cytokine storm, characterized by increased concentrations of IL-2, IL-7,
      IL-10, G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor), interferon-γ-inducible protein, MCP
      (monocyte chemoattractant protein), MIP- α (macrophage inflammatory protein alpha) and TNF α
      (tumor necrosis factor α). It has been hypothesized that during pregnancy this cytokine
      cascade could induce an even more severe inflammatory state, particularly in the first and
      third trimester of pregnancy (Hong Liu et al).

      Recently, Ashary et al. analyzed the possible presence of the virus at the level of the
      syncytiotrophoblast, noting that in 12% of patients with active COVID-19 infection, the virus
      was identifiable at the placental level. Furthermore, the target receptors of the virus for
      entry into the cell, ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, are significantly expressed and used by the virus
      also at the placental level, so SARS-CoV-2 could potentially, interacting with these targets,
      alter the syncytiotrophoblastic unit and, consequently, the placental function (Seethy et
      al.)

      Although the current evidence does not support a vertical intrauterine transmission of
      coronaviruses (Chen et al), it is likely that it is the same maternal infection and the
      inflammatory state in the course of the disease that can negatively influence the
      maternal-fetal outcome.

      Given the multiple characteristics common to SARS-CoV1, MERS and SARS-CoV2 infections, of
      particular relevance were the studies conducted by Wong et al on SARS-CoV-1 infection in the
      first trimester, in which four out of seven women ( 57%), who contracted SARS during the
      first trimester, then had a miscarriage, and that of Alfaraj et al on MERS infection, in
      which there was a single case of a woman with MERS in the first trimester, who never
      developed symptoms of the disease, and carried the pregnancy to term.

      A recent systematic review that included all published reports on Coronaviruses (COVID-19,
      SARS, and MERS) in pregnancy showed that preterm delivery is the most frequently reported
      adverse event in these women, and that COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of
      preeclampsia and caesarean section. Nevertheless, the limited sample size, the main inclusion
      of cases reported for acute respiratory symptoms, the absence of information on previous
      pathologies potentially capable of complicating pregnancy, do not allow to extrapolate strong
      evidence on the course of infection in pregnancy ( Di Mascio et al. 2020).

      At the moment there are no data in the literature on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on
      early pregnancy as the data currently available in the literature concern women hospitalized
      in serious clinical conditions during the first wave of the March 2020 pandemic (Di Mascio et
      al.). Conversely, other studies report low seroconversion rates for the virus. Therefore, the
      current status of the scientific literature does not allow for general and wide-ranging
      implications (La Cour Freiesleben et al.).

      Furthermore, easier access to tests for the identification of COVID-19 and the introduction
      by hospitals of universal screening for COVID-19 at patient admissions, make it easier to
      identify the proportion of positive asymptomatic women. which could be, like what happens in
      the general population, particularly relevant, as well as the proportion of women diagnosed
      and subsequently resolved of the infection during pregnancy.

      The investigators therefore believe it is particularly useful to investigate maternal and
      fetal outcomes in this new broader scenario, including all pregnancies associated with
      asymptomatic or symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, found in any gestational period, in order
      to evaluate in a "real world scenario" "Actual rates of maternal-fetal and neonatal adverse
      events.
