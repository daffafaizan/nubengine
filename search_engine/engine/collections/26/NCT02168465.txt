    
      Stages involve: (1) Develop an Internet-based intervention to improve self-management and
      outcomes related to clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) among people with SCI (2)
      Pretest the Internet application with five persons with SCI using CIC; and (3) Conduct a
      web-based six-month intervention pilot study in a group of 30 with SCI using CIC.

      Outcomes are: catheter-related adverse health outcomes (e.g., UTI, urine leakage), CIC self-
      management, CIC self-efficacy, health related expenditures and quality of life.

      Information from this study will be used to modify the Internet application for a future
      Phase 2 trial in a larger study.
