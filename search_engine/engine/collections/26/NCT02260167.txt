      a certain point, even modest drops in physiologic activity result in dramatic drops in
      clinical function. Though less homogeneous than in other organs, clinical experience and the
      literature suggests a similar process occurs in the brain. The hypothesis is that by using an
      integrated protocol to, essentially, "tune up" neuronal function, a 5-10 % improvement in
      metabolic functioning may translate to significant improvement in clinical functioning. This
      tune-up will include "MIND":
