      glucose metabolism. Evidence from mice indicates that acarbose may prolong lifespan. In
      humans, acarbose improves inflammatory markers and reduces cardiovascular events.
      Consequently, acarbose is of interest in clinical translational aging research since it may
      influence fundamental processes that contribute to age-related diseases. The study described
      herein is an exploratory study to examine the effect of acarbose treatment on the biology of
      aging in humans. Specifically, the investigators plan to study whether treatment with a 10
      week course of acarbose will alter the gene expression profile in adipose tissue and muscle
      in older adults in pathways that are known to be affected by human aging, in a
      placebo-controlled crossover study.
