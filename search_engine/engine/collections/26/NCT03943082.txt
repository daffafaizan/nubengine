      clinical research participation and how it might restrict clinical research access. The
      Lazarex Foundation offers a financial reimbursement program (FRP) to help patients and
      caregivers cover the out-of-pocket costs associated with clinical trial participation for
      almost ten years.

      iMPACT is a pilot study to assess the overall feasibility of conducting a multi-center trial
      of the Lazarex sliding scale FRP among sociodemographically diverse patients of all cancer
      types enrolling/potentially enrolling in therapeutic clinical trials (TCTs). The study will
      formalize informing patients or parents/legal guardians of patients about the Lazarex
      sliding-scale FRP in order to evaluate whether operationalizing intensive follow-up about the
      Lazarex FRP improves recruitment to cancer TCTs.

      All patients or parents/legal guardians of patients will be offered information about the FRP
      at initial time of TCT discussion/consent for the iMPACT study, however, participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive an additional follow-up call about the FRP or no follow-up call
      (usual care). Participants who are randomized to usual care will be provided a phone number
      for the Lazarex Foundation that they or their parent or legal guardian may contact directly.
      Therefore all patients or parents/legal guardians of patients in the study have access to FRP
      eligibility assessment through the Lazarex Foundation.

      Participants or parents/legal guardians of participants will be surveyed at baseline (time of
      consent to iMPACT) and interviewed 30 days after consent to iMPACT. If a participant enrolls
      in a therapeutic clinical trial, he/she will also be given an additional survey after TCT
      participation and interviewed up to 90 days after TCT participation.
