      21-day courses of lenalidomide. For the primary objective, each 28-day cycle was repeated for
      a total of up to 6 cycles. Study completion was defined as 18 cycles of treatment, disease
      progression, or death.

      In phase 1, the objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide 5
      mg, 10 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg, when administered after azacitidine.

      In phase 2, the objective was to assess the efficacy of MTD lenalidomide administered after
      azacitidine, in up to six 28-day cycles.
