      identified. It account for at least 40% of adult-onset epilepsy. Autoimmune encephalitis
      including classic paraneoplastic syndrome and autoimmune synaptic encephalitis is a new
      category of immune-mediated disorders which often has favorable outcome. Recent studies
      reported that immunotherapy improves seizure outcome in medically intractable epilepsy
      patients with clinical and serological evidence of an autoimmune basis. Neural autoantibodies
      were detected in 22% of epilepsy due to unknown cause in a study, mostly from the
      antiepileptic drug(AED)-resistant epilepsy group. Of the patients who received immunotherapy,
      75% archived >50% reduction in seizure frequency.

      Many patients with cryptogenic epilepsy are refractory to AED and significant percent of
      cryptogenic epilepsy harbor neural autoantibody. In those cases, immunotherapy is suggestive
      based on favorable outcome of immunotherapy in autoimmune encephalitis and autoimmune
      epilepsy. Investigators aim to investigate the response to immunotherapy in intractable
      cryptogenic epilepsy patients with neural autoantibodies.
