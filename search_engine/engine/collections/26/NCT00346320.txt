      Primary

        -  Determine the local tumor control rate at 2 years after accelerated hypofractionated
           3-dimensional, conformal radiotherapy in patients with inoperable T1-3 N0 M0 non-small
           cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rates of regional and distant disease recurrence in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the changes in pulmonary function after treatment in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, prospective study.

      Patients undergo accelerated hypofractionated conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for up to
      3 weeks (15 doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 3 of radiotherapy, at 1 month after
      completion of radiotherapy, and then every 4 months for 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
