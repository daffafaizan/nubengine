      surgery for the prevention of upper and extremity lymphedema. The node dissection will be
      performed by Dr. Kang while the LYMPHA technique will be performed by the plastic surgeon,
      Dr. Kim. The LYMPHA procedure consist of performing LVA at the time of the node dissection.
      Patent blue dye will be injected in the volar surface of the upper third of the arm in a
      quantity of about 1-2 ml intradermally, subcutaneously, and under muscular fascia into
      patient approximately 10 minutes before skin incision. This will allow mapping of the
      lymphatic channels for identification for bypass. The node dissection will then be performed
      with preservation of the anterior branch of the axillary vein in the axilla. Afferent
      lymphatic vessels will be sutured into a branch of the axillary vein distal to a competen
      valve. The total duration of the surgery is approximately 3 hours. The LYMPHA technique
      accounts for an additional 30 min to the standard 2-2.5 hours allocated to the node
      dissection.

      Pre-surgery, patients will have baseline limb circumference measurements of both the
      surgery-affected and unaffected arms and by lymphoscintigraphy. Patients will be followed up
      clinically at every 6 months up to a year. At each follow-up visit, patients will have a
      physical examination and their circumference of their limbs taken. Patients will also fill
      out a LyQLI, SF-36, DASH administered by the Clinical Research Coordinator pre-and
      post-surgery. Each patient will have a total of 1 years of participation time.
