      electrical stimulation on brain functioning in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). The findings will help determine "how much"
      stimulation is needed to enhance memory and thinking abilities, how it affects brain
      functioning, and who is most likely to benefit. Ultimately, this information may guide
      treatment efforts for those at various stages of Alzheimer's disease. The study will use
      brain imaging to see whether these treatments change how participants learn and remember
      information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography
      (PET) scans will be used. The study will also use cognitive tests and questionnaires to
      examine whether participants' memory (and related abilities) change because of treatment. The
      study will enroll participants with a diagnosis of MCI or DAT. It is expected but not
      required that participants will be co-enrolled in the University of Michigan Memory and Aging
      Project (UM-MAP; HUM00000382).
