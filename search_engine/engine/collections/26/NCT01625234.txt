      given as a once or twice daily oral dose in 28 day cycles until there is disease progression
      or unacceptable safety issues. X-396 will be given to small groups of patients (1 - 6) at
      each dose level and the patients will be observed to see if there are any adverse safety
      effects. As long as there are no unacceptable safety issues after 28 days, the dose of X-396
      will be increased for the next group of patients. This process will continue until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of X-396 is reached. Once the MTD is reached, up to 170
      additional patients will also be given X-396 to further determine the activity of X-396 in
      patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. These additional patients will be
      enrolled in the following expansion cohorts: ALK TKI-na√Øve patients, patients that progressed
      on crizotinib, patients that progressed on one or more 2nd generation ALK TKIs (patients may
      or may not have also received prior crizotinib), including patients with asymptomatic CNS
      metastases.
