    
      This is a prospective double-masked, randomized controlled trial which evaluates central
      visual field function as it relates to macular pigment optical density, contrast sensitivity,
      and dermal carotenoid levels in the presence of a commercial macular pigment-containing
      medical food (Lumega-Z). Participants will be randomized to twelve weeks of supplement +
      dorzolamide or twelve weeks of placebo. All packaging of supplement and dorzolamide and the
      placebo will be identical and distributed by a third party. Both subjects and the
      investigators examining patients will be masked to placebo and experimental group assignment.
