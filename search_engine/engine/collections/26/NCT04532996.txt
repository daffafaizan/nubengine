      disorder in this population, nor its treatment. This represents an important under-researched
      area in LGBT care and treatment. The purpose of this study is: (a) to preliminarily
      characterize PTSD within an LGBT sample; and (b) to test out the preliminary effects and
      acceptability of a novel PTSD psychotherapy, trauma-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy, in
      this group. Participants identifying as LGBT and meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD per a
      structured, reliable clinical interview for PTSD will receive 20-24 sessions of twice-weekly
      TFPP at no cost. Participants will receive four detailed clinical research assessments, at
      baseline/study entry, Week 5 of treatment, treatment termination/end (Week 12), and 3-months
      after the end of treatment.

      TFPP is adapted from the only empirically supported, non-exposure focused psychodynamic
      therapy for panic disorder and anxiety disorders, panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy.
      TFPP aims to improve patients' ability to understand and manage strong, intense emotions that
      appear seemingly "out of the blue," which links to their tendency to reexperience traumatic
      events in the here-and-now. TFPP addresses the psychological meanings of symptoms and their
      relationship to traumatic events to help the patient understand underlying emotions
      triggering their symptoms and the ways in which trauma influences their current experiences.
      TFPP was developed for patients with complex PTSD, who often have multiple prior trauma
      exposures with no clear "index" trauma. Moreover, TFPP also explicitly considers
      opportunities for patients to explore the broader context of their symptoms and difficulties,
      including but not limited to LGBT identity or experiences of oppression.
