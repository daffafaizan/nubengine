      once every 2 weeks (or 3 weeks if not tolerated) and rucaparib will be given twice daily for
      7-14 days. Each cycle will be 28 days in duration unless we need to switch to the
      intermediate dosing regimen of every 21 days. Both rucaparib and irinotecan will be
      escalated.

      In dose expansion, patients who have received prior PARP inhibitors will go straight to the
      combination arm of irinotecan and rucaparib. If patients are PARP inhibitor na√Øve, they can
      receive single agent rucaparib until progression. Once patients on single agent rucaparib
      progress, they can choose to go on the combination treatment arm. Patients will continue on
      treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
