      traditions for home brewing. The TREAT C-AUD research project, with partners from Makerere
      University in Uganda, University of Bergen and Norwegian University of Science and Technology
      in Norway, will investigate the existence of alcohol drinking among children living under
      adult supervision and care, living within the communities. The investigators will focus on
      the age group 6-13 years overlapping with the recommended age for primary school attendance.
      The project is approaching the research topic from comprehensive perspectives including a
      large cross-sectional study, interviews with parents and carers, children and stakeholders in
      the communities, schools and in the health system. The investigators have been including
      community representatives, expert groups, user groups and stakeholders in the development of
      screening tools and will do so in interpreting and disseminating the results. The
      investigators have to take the Covid-19 situation into account both with regard to its effect
      on the research question at stake and the methods used. The TREAT C-AUD research project will
      therefore document to which degree alcohol drinking is a problem among children in the
      communities in Mbale District, Eastern Ugandan. The data collection is capturing cofactors
      such as other substance use, mental health, parenting, trauma, nutrition and growth. The
      development of alcohol assessment tools can be used by the health- and school-system for
      detection and handling of children having problems with alcohol. The investigators will
      collaborate closely with services in case of identification of children suffering severe harm
      and adhere to Good Clinical Practice guidelines for ethical conduct, the consent procedure,
      follow-up and referral.
