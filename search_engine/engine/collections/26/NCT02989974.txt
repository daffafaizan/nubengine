      longitudinal series of data will be collected from participants. Participants will be
      consented and asked to complete a baseline questionnaire (PRE) which includes topics
      measuring quality of life, distress, symptom management, social support, healthy behaviors,
      demographics and health history. Two similar questionnaires will be administered after
      exposure to the Survivorship Care Program (POST and FOL). In addition, the consent form
      requests permission from survivors to collect clinical data from medical records and the
      Kentucky Cancer Registry regarding diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer. The study will
      enroll 300 participants, with an estimate of approximately 30 participants enrolled at each
      site. However, if a participating site enrolls 30 participants and the overall study accrual
      has not yet been met, the study PI may allow that respective participating site to continue
      to enroll participants. Study accrual is competitive across participating sites until the
      overall study accrual has been met.
