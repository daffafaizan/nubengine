      Participants who are eligible for the study will receive 12 sessions of CBT treatment and
      will be randomly assigned to an ICT or ICT sham condition which will consist of completing
      ICT computer tasks on a daily basis during the first four weeks of treatment and booster
      sessions following treatment. Participants will also complete research assessments at
      mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up intervals. Research assessments include
      a battery of questionnaires, computerized tasks, interviews, and behavioral tasks.
