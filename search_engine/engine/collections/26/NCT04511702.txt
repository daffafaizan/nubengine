      participants will be treated for up to 24 weeks with weekly oral methotrexate and biweekly
      8mg pegloticase infusions. Up to three pegloticase infusion durations will be assessed in the
      study: 60-minute infusion, 45-minute infusion and 30-minute infusion. Safety evaluations will
      be performed regularly throughout the course of the study.
