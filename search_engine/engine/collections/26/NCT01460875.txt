      I. To determine whether selection of the optimal IFN-alpha-2b (recombinant interferon
      alfa-2b) dose can be made using signal transduction data.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of adjuvant IFN-alpha-2b administered at an optimized dose
      in terms of the toxicities that are observed and the ability of patients to receive a full
      year of therapy.

      II. The transcription of a panel of IFN-alpha-induced genes previously identified by
      microarray analysis will be determined by Real-Time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
      reaction (RT PCR) in order that the correlation between signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation and IFN-alpha gene regulation can be evaluated.

      III. Microarray analysis of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be used
      to evaluate the effect of dose-reduction on IFN-alpha gene expression.

      IV. In order to define the clinical role of tumor sensitivity to IFN-alpha, patient tumor
      biopsies taken prior to the administration of IFN-alpha will be systematically evaluated for
      cellular levels of janus kinase (Jak)-STAT signaling intermediates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) thrice weekly. Treatment
      continues for 11 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.
