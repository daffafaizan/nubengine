      frequent the failure of the addiction therapy. Research shows that the majority of dropouts
      occur during the first weeks of the treatment. These are the most serious ones because they
      have the worst prognosis. Some factors, related to the patients and the therapy, have been
      associated with treatment dropout but the diversity of studied variables, the heterogeneity
      of patients and the sparse population of many studies, hampers external validity and
      comparison of results.

      OBJECTIVES: Analyze the treatment adherence of an outpatient treatment program for addicts.
      Identify factors associated with treatment adherence in substance users.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, analytical, longitudinal and retrospective study in
      substance users who completed addiction treatment between November 2013 and January 2016.
      Treatment adherence is measured in terms of medical discharge, regular attendance at
      activities and success in the NOC indicators. Differences in the level of adherence to
      treatment according to patient-related factors, addiction and treatment are analyzed. The
      individual effect of each factor on treatment adherence is assessed.
