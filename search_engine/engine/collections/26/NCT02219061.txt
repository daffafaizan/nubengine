      goal of measles elimination, many measles cases were found to be those aged < 8 months and
      meningitis C is becoming public health issue since meningitis group A has been controlled at
      a very low level and little is known on C group. So the investigators designed the
      observation study on the two antibodies.

      Maternal antibodies are supposed to wane after birth. Serums of the placenta(0 month),
      children of 3 months, 5 months and 7 months old will be collected and the geometric mean
      titers (GMTs) of measles and meningitis C will be confirmed by using the ELISA test.
