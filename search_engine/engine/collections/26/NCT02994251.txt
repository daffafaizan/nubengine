      cisplatin administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. After every 2 cycles
      of systemic chemotherapy, patients will receive contrast-enhanced MRI to assess liver
      disease; conventional trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) will be performed as indicated
      based on this assessment. Patients will receive a maximum of 8 cycles of the
      gemcitabine/cisplatin combination. Up to 3 TACE treatments may be delivered in this same time
      frame, with the first TACE taking place after 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy. Following
      the treatment period, patients will continue clinical follow-up at 3 month intervals until
      study exit at 18 months post the start of treatment.

      It is hypothesized that the addition of conventional transarterial chemoembolization to
      standard chemotherapy will result in an improvement in PFS in patients with advanced,
      unresectable ICC, including patients with extra-hepatic disease.
