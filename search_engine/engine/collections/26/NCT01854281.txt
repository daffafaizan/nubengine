      (PFO) is effective in preventing paradoxical embolization of nitrogen bubbles after simulated
      dives.

      Ultrasonographic detection of venous and arterial nitrogen bubbles will be performed in
      divers after surfacing from simulated dives in hyperbaric chambers. Divers will be observed
      after two different dive profiles - Dive A (dive to 18 m for 80 min bottom time) and dive B
      (dive to 50 m for 20 min bottom time), both performed according to US Navy Air decompression
      procedure 1996. For both dives two groups will be compared: Divers with PFO and divers after
      previous catheter-based closure of PFO.

      The study will be observational. Sonographic detection of bubbles will be performed after
      simulated dives that are part of a training program of the divers. Two different dives,
      previously documented to generate significant amount of venous nitrogen bubbles, were chosen.

      The primary end-point will be a positive transcranial doppler test (defined as one or more
      bubbles detected either during native breathing or after Valsalva maneuver).

      Inclusion criteria are: 1) previously diagnosed PFO or a PFO that has been occluded by a
      catheter-based procedure, 2) signed informed consent

      Exclusion criteria: 1) another dive performed in the preceding 24 hours, 2) another
      previously diagnosed right-to-left shunt, 3) disagreement to be included in the study

      This study will be single-center.
