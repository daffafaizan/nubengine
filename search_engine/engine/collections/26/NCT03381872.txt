      device-related failure or target lesion failure such as restenosis and stent thrombosis has
      been markedly decreased, compared with the era of bare metal stents or 1st generation DES.
      Nevertheless, patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for complex
      lesions, for example, chronic total occlusion (CTO), left main disease, true bifurcation
      lesion, long lesion, multi-vessel PCI, multiple overlapping stents, or severely calcified
      lesions have significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with non-complex lesions.

      During the PCI procedure, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) are useful tools for providing information on preintervention lesion characteristics,
      including vulnerable plaques, lesion severity, length, and morphology; on postintervention
      optimal stent implantation for stent expansion, extension, and apposition; and on possible
      complications after stent implantation. Therefore, intravascular imaging guidance may improve
      clinical outcomes after complex PCI. However, although previous randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) and registries showed significantly lower rates of major adverse clinical events
      following IVUS-guided PCI compared with angiography-guided PCI, the RCTs were limited with
      small sample size and dealt with very selected lesion subsets such as CTO or long lesion.
      Moreover, it is uncertain whether OCT-guided PCI improves clinical outcomes compared with
      angiography-guided PCI. Meanwhile, appropriate imaging modality may differ according to
      patient and lesion characteristics.

      One of the ways to maximize the advantage of intravascular imaging is choice of intravascular
      imaging devices by the operator's discretion. Therefore, the current RENOVATE-COMPLEX-PCI
      (Randomized Controlled Trial of Intravascular Imaging Guidance versus Angiography-Guidance on
      Clinical Outcomes After Complex Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) is designed to
      investigate whether PCI under guidance of intravascular imaging devices (IVUS or OCT) chosen
      by operators would improve clinical outcomes compared with angiography-guided PCI in patients
      with complex lesions.
