      vitro also influence the in vivo activity of CYP2B6 and its responsiveness to metabolic
      inhibition, using the metabolism of efavirenz (100 mg dose) as a marker of activity. The
      metabolism and pharmacokinetics of efavirenz will be determined in a total of 60 healthy
      volunteers with CYP2B6*1/*1, CYP2B6*1*6 and CYP2B6*6*6 at baseline (control) and after
      pretreatment with voriconazole.
