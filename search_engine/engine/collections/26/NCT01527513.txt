      will consist of a 4-week prospective observational baseline period, a 12-week double-blind
      period (4-week up-titration and 8-week maintenance), and a tapering-off period.

      After the screening visit (V1), patients will enter the baseline period. At the end of the
      baseline period (V2), eligible patients will be randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to receive
      double-blind treatment with Eslicarbazepine acetate or Placebo in addition to concomitant
      therapy with 1 or 2 Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs). Concomitant AED therapy will be kept stable
      during the whole study.

      Initial dose of the study treatment will be 10 mg/kg/day. After 2-weeks on 10 mg/kg/day, the
      dose will be up-titrated to 20 mg/kg/day (maximum 1200 mg/day). After 2 weeks on 20
      mg/kg/day, dose will be up-titrated to 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1200 mg/day) and patients will
      receive this dose for 8 weeks. If intolerable adverse events (AEs) occur, the patient can be
      down-titrated to the previous dose (only 1 down-titration step will be allowed) or
      discontinued. After the 8-week maintenance period, the study treatment will be tapered off in
      10 mg/kg/day 2 week steps. However, if a patient experiences an increase in seizure frequency
      (e.g. more than 100% increase vs. baseline) during tapering-off, the patient can proceed
      directly to the open-label part of the study (Part II).

      After completion of the last 2-week 10 mg/kg/day step, patients will have the option to enter
      a 1 year open-label treatment (Part II) with Eslicarbazepine acetate (up to 30 mg/kg/day,
      maximum 1200 mg/day), or will have a 4 week observational follow-up period.
