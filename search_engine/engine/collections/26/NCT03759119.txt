    
      The purpose of this randomized control trial will be to investigate the effects of a tummy
      time intervention, as compared to standard care, on motor outcomes among premature infants
      over a four-week period. Additionally, the study will measure tummy time adherence rates
      between groups post intervention for an additional four weeks.

      To meet this purpose, the following objectives will be addressed:

        1. To determine if there will be a difference in motor outcome scores on the Test of Infant
           Motor Performance (TIMP) among infants born preterm and utilizing a tummy time
           intervention and parent education compared to those in the standard care group receiving
           parent education only.

        2. To determine if there will be a difference in adherence rates (average minutes/day)
           between groups among infants born preterm utilizing a tummy time intervention and parent
           education compared to those in the standard care group receiving parent education only.
