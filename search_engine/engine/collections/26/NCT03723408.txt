      An observational prospective trial was conducted in operating room settings across multiple
      study sites. 120 surgical patients undergoing a variety of interventional and surgical
      procedures were selected, representing multiple patient populations, case types and
      anesthesia setups. The ClearLine IV, a device that detects and removes air from IV tubing,
      was inserted into the IV circuit. Clinicians followed standard protocols. Blood warmers were
      used at the practitioner's discretion. IV fluid was administered at a constant flow rate or
      through a bolus given over 30-60 seconds per standard of care. The volume and duration of
      fluid administration was recorded, along with the frequency, duration and amount of air
      captured by ClearLine IV.
