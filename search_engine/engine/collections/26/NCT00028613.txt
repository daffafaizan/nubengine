        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 in
           patients with previously treated diffuse large cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response of patients to this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody Lym-1 IV over 40 minutes followed 15-30
      minutes later by iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 IV over 2 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 8 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
