      ≤200 mg/day, intravenous (IV) and/or oral suspension for 6 to 10 days, or comparator IV
      and/or oral per local standard of care for 10 to 14 days. The switch from IV to oral
      administration can be made at any time based on 1) no worsening of the primary skin lesion,
      2) last temperature <37.7 °C, and 3) primary acute bacterial skin and skin structure
      infection (ABSSSI) site has not worsened and at least 1 site has improved from Baseline. The
      potential 4-day treatment extension will be based on clinical need as judged by the
      investigator, considering the following criteria: 1) ≥40% reduction in primary lesion size,
      2) reduction in pain, and 3) no new signs and symptoms and no complications attributable to
      ABSSSI compared with Baseline.
