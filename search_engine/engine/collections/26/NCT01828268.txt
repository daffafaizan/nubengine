      of HIV infected patients has been prolonged greatly. However,side effects of ART including
      metabolic abnormalities have become the main factors influencing patients' quality of life.
      Among which the abnormal lipid metabolism plays an important role. Meanwhile, metabolic
      conditions differ from patients applying to different combinations of ART drugs,life style
      and clinical conditions.

      Metabolomics can measure the dynamic metabolic responses of the body to stimuli or
      modifications. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as tools can systematically analyse the
      process of lipid metabolism. Metabolomics fingerprinting can be defined as the complete
      complement of small molecule (< 1500 Da) metabolites found in a specific cell, body fluid,
      organ or organism.

      Therefore, the study of the impact of metabolic changes and anti-retroviral therapy (ART),
      life style and clinical conditions is of importance in enhancing the adherence and improving
      the clinical outcomes of HIV infected patients.
