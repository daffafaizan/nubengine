      response specific for the 2a-antigen of Shigella flexneri 2a bacteria. Healthy adult
      volunteers na√Øve for Shigella flexneri 2a infections at screening will receive two
      administrations of 10 micrograms Flexyn2a or placebo 4 weeks apart. Four weeks after the
      second vaccination, each subject will be challenged with 1500 cfu of the virulent Shigella
      flexneri 2a strain 2457T. In order to assess the ability of Flexyn2a to protect against
      infection with this strain, the attack rate of shigellosis in the group vaccinated with
      Flexyn2a will be compared to the group of the subjects who received placebo injections.
