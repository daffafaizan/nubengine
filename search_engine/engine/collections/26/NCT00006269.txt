      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with octreotide vs placebo. II. Compare
      the duration of diarrhea and need for irinotecan dose reduction/ delay and hospitalization in
      patients treated with these 2 regimens. III. Collect data on tumor response and 1 year
      survival in patients treated with these 2 regimens. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics and
      interaction of irinotecan and octreotide in a subset of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to prior pelvic irradiation (yes vs no), age (under 70 vs 70 and
      over), and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 or 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients receive octreotide intramuscularly (IM) once. Beginning 10-14 days
      later, patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive
      octreotide IM on the same day as irinotecan. Arm II: Patients receive placebo IM once.
      Beginning 10-14 days later, patients receive irinotecan as in arm I. Patients also receive
      placebo IM on the same day as irinotecan. Therapy continues every 3 weeks for at least 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 3 months through year 1.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
