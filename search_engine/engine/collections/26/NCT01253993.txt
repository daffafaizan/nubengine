      study group consist of adolescents with DBD with (n=30) and without (n=30) substance use
      disorders. These adolescents are recruited from orthopsychiatric, forensic psychiatric, and
      judicial institutions.

      The second study group consists of a) ex-patients of the Utrecht Coping Power Program
      (UCPP)who previously participated to a follow-up study, and b) ex-patients who were treated
      as a child at an outpatient clinic of the UMC Utrecht. These latter groups were taken
      together and subdivided into a group with (n=30) and without (n=30) substance use problems.

      For both studies healthy controls (n=80) are recruited. The investigators will start with
      healthy controls from earlier studies, and those are extented and will serve as control group
      for both studies.
