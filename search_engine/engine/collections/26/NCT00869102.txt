      to prevent diabetes who lose body weight and increase insulin sensitivity, however they
      remain impaired glucose tolerant. These individuals show a deterioration in insulin secretory
      function.

      We will identify a highly selected group of subjects with prediabetes that displays a large
      defect in insulin secretory function.We will study 50 individuals who display these
      characteristics and 50 subjects who do not display these characteristics. Their insulin
      secretion capacity in response to different secretagogues (glucose, GLP-1, arginine) will be
      studied. We expect to detect new pathophysiologic aspects that lead to beta cell failure
      particularly in this group.
