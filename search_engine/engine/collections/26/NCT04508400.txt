    
      Participants will randomly assigned 1:1 to receive double-blind study drug ( fosaprepitant
      plus ondansetron with dexamethasone OR placebo to fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with
      dexamethasone). Fosaprepitant or placebo to fosaprepitant were supplied and administered in a
      blinded manner.

      Experimental:

      Participants received a single dose of fosaprepitant (age-based adjustment) administered
      intravenously (IV) on Day 1 prior to chemotherapy plus ondansetron (weight based) IV with
      dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po prior to chemotherapy and up to 72 hours after
      chemotherapy.

      Placebo Comparator:

      Participants received a single dose of matched placebo for fosaprepitant administered
      intravenously (IV) on Day 1 prior to chemotherapy plus ondansetron (weight based) IV with
      dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po prior to chemotherapy and up to 72 hours after
      chemotherapy.
