      guidelines of the Center for Disease Control (CDC 2010) recommend that all asymptomatic
      newborns born to mothers with suspected chorioamnionitis undergo limited evaluation (i.e.
      blood culture at birth and complete blood count) and antibiotic therapy until the blood
      culture result is available.

      However, the prevalence of positive blood cultures in infants born to mothers with suspected
      chorioamnionitis is low, approximately 1%, including also infants requiring intensive care.
      This prevalence is even lower in asymptomatic infants. Moreover, the efficacy of antibiotic
      prophylaxis in preventing early sepsis, death or long-term sequelae in asymptomatic infants
      born to mothers with suspected chorioamnionitis has not been demonstrated.

      Early antibiotic use has been related to obesity and to the modification of microbiota.
      Limiting antibiotic use may prevent the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

      Clinical observation is a reliable method to recognize infants with sepsis.
