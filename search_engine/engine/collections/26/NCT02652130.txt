      participated in MSB-GVHD001. This study will also explore duration of response over time.
      Subjects who participated in MSB-GVHD001 and received at least one dose of remestemcel-L as
      outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160
      and 180 for safety endpoints. Subjects who participated in Protocol MSB-GVHD001 and received
      the first 8 doses of remestemcel-L as outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline
      (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180.
