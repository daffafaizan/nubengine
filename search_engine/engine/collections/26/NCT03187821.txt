      dysphotopsia symptoms, intraocular pressure, anterior chamber angle morphology and corneal
      endothelial cell count Study design: Multicenter randomized, prospective, single masked trial
      Trial setting: Hospitals Trial type: Treatment

      Interventions: South Indian subjects aged 30 years or greater, with primary angle closure
      suspect (PACS) or primary angle closure/ primary angle closure glaucoma(PAC/PACG) will be
      randomized to either bilateral superior or nasal/temporal laser peripheral iridotomy.
      Subjects will undergo noninvasive testing and imaging studies to measure IOP, anterior
      chamber angle morphology and endothelial cell count and asked to answer a questionnaire at
      baseline and again at 2 weeks and 6 months after treatment Primary outcome measures:
      Occurrence of new self-reported general eye or dysphotopsia symptoms.

      Secondary outcome measures: intraocular pressure, anterior chamber and anterior chamber angle
      morphology, endothelial cell count.
