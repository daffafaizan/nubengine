      wave elastography (SWE) measurements with histology. Briefly, patients referred for a native
      kidney biopsy will undergo SWE and the shear wave velocity (SWV) will be correlated with
      degree of fibrosis determined by a pathologist.

      A list of patients who recently underwent a native kidney biopsy will be obtained from the
      pathology department on a weekly basis. Patients will then be contacted about participating
      in the study and consented during a follow up visit with their nephrologist.

      After their biopsies, patients will be scheduled to come for a renal ultrasound and SWE. SWE
      examination will be conducted using an ultrasound machine equipped with a Philips Epiq ARFI
      Shear wave ElastPQ C1-5 mHz transducer. Shear wave velocity will be obtained and an estimate
      of tissue elasticity (Young's modulus) will be calculated. All measurements will be performed
      by one of two qualified radiology physicians who will be blinded to the clinical and
      pathological data. We will allow a period of 90 days to obtain the images after the biopsy;
      otherwise the patient is no longer eligible to participate.

      The primary outcome measure of this study is to determine whether tissue elasticity
      determined by SWE can assess kidney fibrosis. Linear regression analysis will be performed to
      describe the relation of the extent of fibrosis and parenchymal stiffness.
