    
      1. The study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded
           end-point assessment (PROBE) design study.

        2. After successful revascularization, the active blood pressure control group and the
           standard blood pressure control group will be randomized by 1: 1.

        3. Patients who is admitted to the Department of Neurology at the participating hospital
           with acute cerebral infarction will will be included for 5 years from December 2019 to

        4. Collect medical history, laboratory findings and blood pressure parameters (systolic
           blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood pressure variability, etc.),
           neurological scores, functional recovery, and quality of life indicators.

        5. Neurological scores, functional recovery scores, and quality of life indicators are
           performed by independent researchers in the blind state.

        6. All data is collected using e-CRF, and the image study will be anonymized and sent to
           the central adjudication.

        7. Central adjudication will review the image study.

        8. At the end of the first phase in January 2022, one intermediate analysis will be
