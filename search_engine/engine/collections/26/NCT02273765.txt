    
      Phase III multicenter, international, open-label, randomized trial evaluating non-inferiority
      of raltegravir at dose of 400mg BID compared to efavirenz 600mg QD, both in association with
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine in ART-na√Øve HIV-1 infected patients with active
      TB disease receiving a rifampin-based TB treatment initiated <8 weeks before inclusion.
      Patients will be randomized between 2 arms: the raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg bid arm or the
      efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg qd arm, each in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)
      and lamivudine (3TC) and will be followed for 48 weeks after entry in the trial (ART
      initiation).
