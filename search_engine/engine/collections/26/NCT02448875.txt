      independent phase.

      Dose Selection Phase (Cohort 1): Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio and implanted with
      either a CyPass Micro-Stent with targeted delivery of 30 microliters (μl) ophthalmic 5
      viscoelastic, a CyPass Micro-Stent with targeted delivery of 60 μl of ophthalmic
      viscoelastic, or a CyPass Micro-Stent without adjunct viscoelastic in the study eye.

      Expansion Phase (Cohort 2): Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and implanted with either
      the CyPass Micro-Stent without adjunct viscoelastic or the CyPass Micro-Stent with 60 μl of
      ophthalmic viscoelastic (based on Dose Selection results). Subjects were randomized to
      treatment on the day of their surgical procedure. A total of 9 scheduled visits were planned
      including Screening (Day -45 to -2), Baseline (Day -15 to -1), Surgery (Day 0), 1 Day (Day
      1), 1 Week (Day 5-9), 1 Month (Day 21-35), 3 Month (Day 70-98), 6 Month (Day 150-210), and 12
      Month (Day 330-420) visits. The total expected duration of participation for each subject was
      up to 13 months.
