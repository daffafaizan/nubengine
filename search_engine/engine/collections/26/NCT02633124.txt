      population. It has five ports connected to five lumens separated in a single tube of 90 cm,
      combined with a small single tube called annex port. Four ports numbered 1 to 4 are connected
      to four peripheral lumens (residual volume per lumen: 0.6 mL). The fifth port, called central
      access (indicated by the HF icon (High Flow)), is reserved to the administration of
      parenteral nutrition. It is connected to the central lumen (residual volume: 4.5 mL). The
      sixth port on the annex way allows an administration closer to the infant (residual volume:
      0.40 mL). It is thus reserved for emergencies and direct intravenous injections.

      The innovative technological design of Edelvaiss® Multiline NEO device should enable secure
      administration of injectable drugs by preventing variations in drug mass flow rate and the
      occurrence of drug incompatibilities. This device would reduce the number of perfusion
      incidents and therefore, the frequency of manipulations of infusion lines within the
      incubator, direct source of occurrence of bacteremia.

      Moreover, its main interest lies in neonatology in the possibility of being positioned
      outside of the incubator and to have a lifetime of 21 days, contributing to the prevention of
      catheter-related bacteremia. All manipulations are therefore made outside the incubator at
      the room temperature and the relative humidity, and at a distance from the device/catheter
      junction.
