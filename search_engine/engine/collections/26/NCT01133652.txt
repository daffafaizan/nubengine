      performed in the pediatric emergency department (PED). The lack of a clear visual guide for
      IV placement often leads to multiple painful attempts; delays in urgent treatment; increased
      use of human resources; increased costs; and increased anxiety in the patient, the parents
      and the staff. The research plan is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the use of
      two new technologies with the current standard method for vein location and IV placement in
      children.We would like to know if either of these technologies improve rates of successful IV
      placement on first attempt. Furthermore we would like to know if either technology leads to
      decreased time spent by staff on the procedure or decreased overall number of painful
      attempts. Information on nursing satisfaction, parental satisfaction and cost analysis will
      also be obtained.
