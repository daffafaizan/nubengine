      survival in patients with high-risk stage III melanoma treated with 10 MU of interferon alfa
      (IFN-A) for 4 weeks followed by 1 year of IFN-A at 10 MU three times per week vs. 2 years of
      IFN-A at 5 MU three times per week vs. observation alone. II. Assess the toxicity associated
      with IFN-A. III. Compare the quality of life, costs, and compliance associated with each
      treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Following definitive surgical resection, patients are randomly
      assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to Arms A, B, and C, respectively. Arm A: Biological Response
      Modifier Therapy. Interferon alfa-2b (Schering), IFN-A, NSC-377523. Higher dose. Arm B:
      Biological Response Modifier Therapy. IFN-A. Lower dose. Arm C: Control. Observation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be entered over approximately 4 years in
      this multicenter study.
