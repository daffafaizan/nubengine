      antioxidant agent, in patients with early-stage Parkinson's Disease. Subjects will be
      sequentially randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive hydrogen-enriched water or the
      corresponding placebo twice a day, in addition to all standard-of-care treatments. Enrollment
      goal is 70 subjects. Duration of therapy is 52 weeks.

      The primary outcome measures are safety and tolerability of hydrogen-enriched water.
      Secondary outcome measures include: progression of motor symptoms, health-related quality of
      life, progression of cognitive decline, and progression of symptom burden.
