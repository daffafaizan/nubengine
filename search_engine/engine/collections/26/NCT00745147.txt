      constipation is still a common problem in general population. According to some surveys,
      constipation affects approximately 50% to 73% of nursing home residents. Because the symptoms
      cause serious impairment of life quality, laxatives are commonly prescribed for people and
      over-prescribing of laxatives is also common. Despite the large sums spent on laxatives,
      there have been few advances in laxative treatment in the last 50 years and there have been
      minimal research addressing the problem. Therefore constipation was labeled as "the neglected
      symptoms".

      There is unsatisfactory effect by currently pharmacologic therapies and preventive strategies
      for constipation. Contrarily, they had abundant clinical experiences and medical records for
      constipation in traditional Chinese medicine. So we follow the worldly trend to do the
      research of integrative Chinese medicine and Western medicine since WHO launched the first
      global strategy on traditional and complementary/alternative medicine (TM/CAM) to assist
      countries to create a stronger evidence base of the TM/CAM products and practices.

      The study will be performed under randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel
      design. The object of this study is the residents in nursing homes. After intake of Chinese
      herb, improving constipation and care quality, decreasing the need of enema or digital
      maneuver, minimizing the dosage of rescue laxatives and saving the medical expenditure will
      be expected.
