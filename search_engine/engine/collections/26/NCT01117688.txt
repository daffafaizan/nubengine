      the introduction of the endoscope and to secure placement of internal tubes for drainage of
      urine after the procedure.

      However, SGW may be an obstacle to efficient disintegration and retraction of calculi in the
      narrow ureter.

      The intention of this study is to compare the results of endoscopic stone treatment with and
      without the use of SGW.
