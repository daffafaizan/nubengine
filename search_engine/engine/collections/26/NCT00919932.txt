      attempted and completed suicides, and persistent social impairment between episodes (Weissman
      et al 1999). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an accepted first-line therapy for
      mild-moderate depression in adolescents. Integral to CBT is "homework" as it enhances mastery
      of newly learned coping strategies, facilitates generalization of skills to novel situations,
      increases self-efficacy, and ultimately reduces vulnerability to relapse (Detweiler et al
      1999). Adherence to homework is a recognized problem in adults, and is similarly problematic
      in adolescents. One method of implementing CBT homework in a manner that is centric to
      current youth culture is through text messaging. By using a modern modality that many
      adolescents rely on for daily communication, there is the likelihood that they will find it
      more engaging than traditional modalities. Thus the potential that a text message system can
      help improve homework compliance in adolescents is significant, because improved homework
      adherence may ultimately be linked to improved clinical outcomes for these disorders with
      high rates of chronic morbidity and mortality.
