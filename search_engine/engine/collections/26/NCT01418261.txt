      controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of renal denervation in subjects with
      uncontrolled hypertension. Bilateral renal denervation will be performed using the Symplicity
      Catheter - a percutaneous system that delivers radiofrequency (RF)energy through the luminal
      surface of the renal artery.
