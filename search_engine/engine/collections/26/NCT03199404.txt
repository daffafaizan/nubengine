      mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients. Recanalization success (as assessed using a TICI
      Score), along with the time to recanalization and number of passes needed for success will be
      assessed at the conclusion of the procedure. In addition, neurologic recovery (as evaluated
      using the Modified Rankin Scale and National Institutes of Health Score) will be assessed at
      24 hours, discharge, and 90 days after the thrombectomy procedure.
