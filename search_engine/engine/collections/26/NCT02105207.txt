      history of the present illness, physical examination, ECG, and arterial blood gas analysis,
      the emergency physician responsible for patient care will be asked to categorize the
      diagnosis as ADHF or non-cardiogenic dyspnea.

      Then, the patient will be assigned to one of the experimental arms. In the LUS arm, the same
      emergency physician will perform LUS, and express the new integrated presumptive etiology
      ("LUS-implemented" diagnosis). All patients will then undergo CXR.

      In the CXR arm, patients will undergo CXR, and the new integrated etiology will be record
      after CXR and NT-proBNP results will be available.

      After hospital discharge, two expert emergency physicians, blinded to LUS results, will
      independently review the entire medical record, and indicate the final diagnosis. In case of
      disagreement, a cardiologist will review the medical records, and adjudicate the case.

      Statistical analysis The accuracy of each diagnostic tool will be expressed as sensitivity,
      specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios obtained using 2 x 2 tables. "Positive"
      and "negative" results will be considered, for each test, the diagnosis of ADHF or
      non-cardiac dyspnea, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under
      curve (AUC) statistics will be also shown.
