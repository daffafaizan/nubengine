      submitted to a basic pancreatic cythpatology training programme at two institutitions. The
      patients were randomly allocated to the ROSE group - in which the number of needle passes
      required to obtain a sample suitable for cytopathologic categorization was established by the
      endosonographer's on-site evaluation - or to the non-ROSE group - in whom adequacy of the
      specimen was evaluated macroscopically and up to five needle passes could be performed,
      assuring sample adequacy. The gold standard was the final cytopathologist's diagnosis. The
      number of needle passes, procedure duration, specimen adequacy, diagnostic yield and adverse
      events rates were compared between groups and the performance measures of ROSE by
      endosonographer were determined.
