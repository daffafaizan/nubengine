    
      Approximately 800 female volunteers wishing to become pregnant will be recruited locally
      around 5 trial centers within the US.

      Daily urine samples and gestational age dating scan information obtained from the study will
      be used in laboratory tests to assess the accuracy of the Clearblue Pregnancy Test. Product
      assessment will involve testing of early morning urine samples collected by women during the
      cycle in which they conceived. Urine samples will be collected pre-conception to the end of
      the second trimester.
