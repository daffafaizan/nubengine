      pneumonia. Numbers of 30% are reported in literature. Postoperative complications can result
      in prolonged hospital stay and increased health care costs. In cardiac surgery patients a
      reduction of postoperative pneumonia of 50% is reported as a result of a preoperative
      inspiratory muscle training program. While in some surgical centers IMT is already used in
      the preoperative phase in patients undergoing esophageal resection, the effect of this
      promising intervention has not yet been investigated in a randomised and controlled study
      design in large surgical populations other than cardiac surgery.

      Primary objective: Investigate the effect of a preoperative inspiratory muscle training
      program on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal
      resection.

      Study design: Prospective multicenter randomised controlled clinical trial.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: A significant reduction in incidence of postoperative
      pneumonia.
