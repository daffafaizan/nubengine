      of EPA and DHA in red bloods cells and presented as a % of total fatty acids, the so-called
      Omega-3 Index. The index is a validated risk assessment for cardiovascular disease. Different
      fish oils may influence the Omega-3 Index differently depending on their composition. This
      study assesses omega-3 commonly found as a supplement vs a fish oil based on north atlantic
      fish species.
