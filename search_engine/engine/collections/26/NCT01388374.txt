      is a rising demand from patients for acute care at the primary out of hours service (run by
      General Practitioners) as well as for the emergency departments (EDs) at the hospitals. The
      workload for healthcare professionals in these acute care setting is high. Without changes in
      the organization of primary out of hours care and emergency care, the quality, accessibility
      and efficiency of the acute care can't be guaranteed in the future.

      The substitution of care from General Practitioners (GPs) to Nurse Practitioners (NPs) is
      seen as one possible solution to decrease the GPs' workload and improve accessibility and
      efficiency of care without reducing the quality of care.

      It turned out that about 80% of the acute complaints is U3 and U4 (low complex and not
      urgent) and does not necessarily to be seen by a physician.

      Based on previous research we expect that the NPs are competent to diagnose and treat almost
      all low complex and not urgent complaints. During surgery hours (day time) the NPs act in
      about 90% of the consultations independently.

      Hypothetical substitution of care should contribute to enhancing quality, improving
      accessibility and reducing the workload of doctors. It can also benefit the efficiency of the
      acute (primary out of hours) care.

      However, specific scientific evidence for this is lacking.

      In this study we examine whether substitution of care from GPs to NPs in a primary out of
      hours care setting can contribute to a more accessible and efficient patient care. Also the
      feasibility of implementing NPs in a primary our of hours setting is examined.

      Comparison: Care provided by the Nurse Practitioner will be compared to care provided by a
      General Practitioner.
