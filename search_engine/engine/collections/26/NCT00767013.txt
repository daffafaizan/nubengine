      symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. Literature shows a good correlation between MSCT, MRI, TTE
      and TEE for evaluating the severity of the aortic valve stenosis.

      The dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) is capable of assessing coronary arteries with a
      high sensitivity and specificity in term of relevant stenosis (>50%), due to its excellent
      spatial and temporal resolution. This study includes the assessment of patients with
      symptomatic valve stenosis. The severity of the aortic valve stenosis is being assessed by
      DSCT and TTE. Significant coronary artery stenosis and its localisation are assessed by DSCT
      and invasive coronary angiography. We examine the correlation between DSCT on one side and
      either TTE or invasive coronary angiography on the other.
