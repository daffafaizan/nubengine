    
      Objective:

      To determine the effects of smoking versus neutral cues in adolescents who smoke on 1)
      craving, mood, and autonomic responsivity and 2) the relative reinforcing efficacy of tobacco
      cigarettes.

      Study population:

      25 adolescents who smoke at least 5 cigarettes per day.

      Design:

      Comparison-controlled, within-subjects design.

      Outcome Measures:

      During cue trials, primary measures include craving (TCQ-SF, VAS), mood (mood form, VAS), and
      autonomic (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance) responsivity. During
      self-administration trials, primary measures include breakpoint (final ratio completed),
      total number of responses, and number of cigarette puffs earned and taken. Secondary measures
      include baseline smoking history, mood, tobacco craving, smoking expectancies, nicotine
      dependence, and urinary cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine.
