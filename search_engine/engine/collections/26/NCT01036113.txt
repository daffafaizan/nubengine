      treatment will be continued until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of the patient's consent for participation in the study.

      Approximately 160 patients with previously treated MBC will be enrolled in this study. Eighty
      patients in each of two cohorts will be evaluated as follows:

        1. AT Cohort - Patients treated with prior anthracycline and taxane as adjuvant or
           metastatic therapy; no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for MBC

        2. ATX Cohort - Patients treated with prior anthracycline, taxane, and XelodaÂ®
           (capecitabine) as adjuvant or metastatic therapy; no more than 4 prior chemotherapy
           regimens for MBC

      After discontinuation of study treatment, patients will receive care as considered
      appropriate by the investigator. Patients will continue to be followed for disease
      progression, subsequent anticancer therapy, and survival for at least 6 months after
      enrollment of the last patient in the study
