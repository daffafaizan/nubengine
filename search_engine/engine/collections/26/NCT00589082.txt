      activity at least equivalent to the conventional drugs available. In addition, the safety
      profile of DaunoXome either as a single agent either as a combination with Ara-C seems
      improved with respect to the conventionally administered anthracyclines. Therefore, it seems
      warranted to further explore the anti-leukemic activity, the toxicity and the long term
      results of DaunoXome as a treatment for AML in association with Ara-C against the parent
      compound daunorubicin. In particular, we propose a study to evaluate standard 3+7 schedule
      versus the same schedule with DaunoXome instead of daunorubicine as front line treatment in
      AML patients older than 60 years. Patients achieving a CR will receive a consolidation cycle
      with the same drugs at the same doses. After consolidation, patients in CR will be randomized
      to receive a maintenance treatment with low-dose Ara-C plus Atra versus no treatment.
