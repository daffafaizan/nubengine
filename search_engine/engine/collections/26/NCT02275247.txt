      treatment method. At present, the medical treatment is very limited effect to prevent the
      perioperative cerebral ischemia.Stellate ganglion block （SGB）is an effective and
      well-tolerated approach to the treatment of CVS in various clinical settings.Resent study
      indicated that SGB has a protective effect on delayed cerebral vasospasm in an experimental
      rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage.Therefore,we hypothesized that the preoperative SGB
      would be a effective treatment for improvement of vasospasm after cranial aneurysm surgery.
