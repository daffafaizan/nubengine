    
      The study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of a 12-week physical activity intervention.
      Fifty cancer survivors will be recruited and allocated to one of two research arms:
      Fitbit+Only Group or Fitbit+Charity Incentives Group. Participants in both intervention arms
      will be asked to track their physical activities using Fitbit One, an activity monitor that
      monitors steps and physical activity and will receive basic educational materials about
      increasing physical activity. Those in the Fitbit+charity incentives Group will raise money
      for cancer charities if they meet weekly step targets.

      The key outcome variable of the RCT is steps as measured by an activPAL accelerometer. Data
      will be collected at baseline and 12-weeks. Fitbit data will also be collected for the
      duration of the 12-week intervention and for 6-weeks following the end of the intervention
      period to have an initial examination of behavior change maintenance (total 18-weeks).
