    
      Part 1: SAD For the SAD part, there will be 5 cohorts (including 1 cohort for food effect
      assessment). Each subjects per cohort will be enrolled and randomized to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and PK profile.Safety, tolerability, and PK data for each cohort will be
      reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) before the dose escalation in the next cohort.

      * Food Effect (SAD) One of the 5 cohorts (Cohort X) will be crossed-over to the fed condition
      to assess the effect of food. Subjects will receive a TT-00920/placebo single oral regimen on
      Day 1 of each period.

      The dose level in the food effect cohort could be a middle to higher dose level and will be
      decided by the SRC. The dose to be administered in the food effect cohort will not exceed the
      maximum dose tested in the Part 1 SAD study.

      Part 2:MAD MAD may be initiated during dose escalation of SAD based on safety, tolerability,
      and PK data from Part 1 (SAD) cohorts, per the discretion of the SRC.Subjects will receive
      TT-00920 or placebo for 7 consecutive days, assessing multiple PK and safety.
