      kidney injury (AKI) because of the complexity of hemodynamic disorders and adverse effects
      associated with the use of radiopaque diagnostic and treatment methods (Smirnov AV.et
      al.,2009) With wide application of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) technology in
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI)
      has become a serious complication and is the third leading cause of AKI in hospitalized
      patients.(Gleeson.et al. 2004)

      To date,AKI diagnosis has been limited to observation of increasing levels of serum
      creatinine,decrease in urine output,and alterations in urinary chemistry (Bellomo.et
      al.2004;Mehta.et al. 2007) Nevertheless,serum creatinine levels do not increase significantly
      until renal function has decreased to 50% in addition,the level of serum creatinine may be
      affected by the patient's muscle mass,catabolic state,protein intake,weight,sex and tubular
      secretion of creatinine.Therefore,applying serum creatinine as a biomarker for diagnosing AKI
      may result in the loss of valuable time (Mishra.et al.2005;Sirota.et al.2011)

      Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated lipocalin(NGAL) belongs to the lipocalin family and is
      produced predominantly by the liver and white blood cells(Hvidberg.et al.,2005).

      A small polypeptide, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), is one of the most
      promising and best-studied AKI biomarkers (Mishra.et al.,2003; Devarajan.et al 2003) The
      expression of NGAL was predominantly in proliferating and regenerating tubular epithelial
      cells, which suggested a role in repair. (Mori.et al.2005) The majority of NGAL, secreted by
      injured renal tubule epithelial cells, is in a 25kDa monomeric form. In contrast, neutrophils
      have been claimed to release NGAL primarily as a 45kDa homodimer, i.e. two NGAL monomers
      linked by a disulfide bridge. It also exists as a 135-kDa heterodimer, covalently conjugated
      with gelatinase (Cai.et al.2010) NGAL is easily detected in blood and urine due to its small
      size and resistance to degradation. It can be measured non-invasively using routine
      laboratory analysers as well as some point of care devices. Furthermore, NGAL concentration
      in both urine and plasma rises rapidly in a dose-dependent manner that is proportional to the
      degree of acute kidney damage (Haase-Fielitz.et al.2009)

      NGAL has previously been termed the 'troponin-like' biomarker to detect subclinical AKI even
      in the absence of diagnostic increases in SCr (Devarajan.,2010;Haase,et al.2011)
      Additionally, NGAL has been reported to be predictive 48 h prior to the actual time of
      injury; therefore, renal replacement therapy can be planned earlier(Cruz,et al.2010)
