    
      -  Both rituximab and bortezomib will be given to participants intravenously. Each cycle of
           treatment will consist of 21 days. Rituximab will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle
           1 and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles. Bortezomib will be given on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of
           every cycle. Participants will receive a maximum of 4 cycles.

        -  The following study procedures will be performed during each cycle throughout the study:
           Medical history review; Physical exam; Performance Status; Questionnaire; Blood draws
           and; PET/CT scans (After cycles 2, 4 and 6 only).

        -  After Cycle 4, if the study doctor feels the participant has had a complete response to
           treatment, then they will continue onto the Post-Treatment Surveillance period, which
           will consist of regular clinic visits over two years.

        -  However, if the study doctor feels the participant has had a partial response to
           treatment and that they may benefit from continuing, they will receive an additional two
           cycles of bortezomib and be given daily tablets of the antiviral drug valganciclovir to
           help further target EBV.
