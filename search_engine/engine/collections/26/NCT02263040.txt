    
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled, observer blind trial of Fluzone High Dose
      trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (HDTIV) versus Fluzone, standard dose TIV (SDTIV) in
      100 healthcare workers 18-64 years of age. Participants will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, one
      dose of either SDTIV or HDTIV containing the strains of influenza virus as recommended by the
      World Health Organization for the season of recruitment. All adverse events will be collected
      for 7 days following the injection, serious adverse events will be collected through day 21,
      and serum for antibody testing will be obtained on day 0 and day 21. The primary outcome will
      be seroconversion to each strain of vaccine included in the vaccine, as measured by change in
      hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) titer between day 0 to day 21.
