      kg-1 min-1 were randomized into two groups: Either dexmedetomidine 1 microgram per kg -1
      (GroupD) or midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1h-1 (GroupM) were administered intravenously for the first
      10 minutes. Subsequently anesthesia was maintained by using the bispectral index(BIS) as a
      continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 microgram per kg-1h-1 or midazolam 0.05-0.15
      mgkg-1h-1. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, MMSE, sedation and the patient's and surgeon's
      satisfaction were determined.
