      disease, and disproportionately affects African Americans (AA). Although HTN awareness and
      treatment rates among AA are similar to, or exceed non-Hispanic whites, control of HTN among
      AAs remains inadequate. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of
      lifestyle measures in lowering BP, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
      (DASH) diet, which lowers systolic BP 6-14 mmHg. DASH calls for increased consumption of
      fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy, and decreased saturated fat and sodium intake. There
      is limited evidence that DASH has been widely adopted by the public and AA from lower income
      communities may be less able to adopt DASH as currently disseminated due to barriers related
      to income, education, attitudes about foods, health beliefs, and neighborhood availability of
      healthier foods. We propose to utilize quantitative and qualitative research techniques
      (including focus groups and surveys) to assess environmental, intra-personal, interpersonal
      and cultural factors that could affect the translation of the DASH diet in a low-income AA
      community, then utilize the knowledge gathered to adapt existing intervention strategies and
      tools. These will provide the materials for a randomized three month pilot lifestyle
      intervention implementing the DASH diet. The 40 participants will be aged 21+ and have
      pre-HTN or HTN with blood pressure between 120-150/80-95 mmHg on 0,1 or 2 antihypertensive
      agents, and will be AA residents of two zip codes in Winston-Salem (a lower-income area whose
      population is significantly minority).
