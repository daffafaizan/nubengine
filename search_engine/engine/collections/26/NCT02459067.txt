    
      This is an open-label trial of ImmuniCell® treatment of patients with malignant melanoma,
      renal cell cancer (RCC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which are refractory to current
      treatment or who have indolent disease for which immunotherapy may be beneficial. The trial
      is designed to identify a safe dose of ImmuniCell® for future clinical trials, to identify a
      response signal from one or more of the cancers under investigation and to confirm the safety
      and efficacy in the selected target tumour.

      The trial has three stages:

      Stage I comprising a safety cohort of patients to identify a safe dose Stage II comprising an
      expanded patient group for response signal identification Stage III to confirm efficacy and
      safety.
