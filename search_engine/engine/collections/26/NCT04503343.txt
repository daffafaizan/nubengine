      non-pharmacological interventions (physical/psychological) on emotion-related cognitive
      function.This project will use a variety of intervention methods to conduct research in
      healthy individuals and patients with mood disorders. The main intervention methods include:
      (1) mindfulness training;(2) relaxation training;(3) cerebellar electrical stimulation.

      The study will recruit 80 healthy subjects and 40 first-episode depression patients. The
      study consisted of three steps: First, subjects filled in personal data and completed the
      first screening, randomly assigned groups, and filled in the pre-intervention
      questionnaire;Second, give a one-time non-drug intervention (mindfulness training, relaxation
      training or cerebellar electrical stimulation);Step 3: After the intervention, the subjects
      filled in the post-intervention questionnaire and completed the cognitive task test.Clinical
      efficacy and safety assessment will be done at first time. The specific aims are to evaluate
      the effect of non-drug therapy on cognitive function in healthy individuals and patients with
      first episode depression. and the behavior was evaluated by cognitive function task.
