      method, which results in a substantial number of patients suffering from either a lack of
      benefit from drug therapy or severe side effects. Approximately 40% of all anti-depressant
      and anti-anxiety medications prescribed are ineffective, and patients who need to be on
      medication often discontinue taking their medications, which can have potentially dangerous
      consequences. Clinical features often fail to predict the drug response and tolerability of a
      patient to a prescription medication.

      Genetics can help guide therapeutic decisions for patients exhibiting neuropsychiatric
      disorders and improve patient outcomes by maximizing drug efficacy and minimizing the risk of
      adverse events. Genetics and drug interactions can alter both the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of a multitude of drug compounds and in turn influence both the safety and
      efficacy of selected therapeutic regimens.

      Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection using the IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel can
      enhance patient response and tolerability by facilitating the selection of the most
      appropriate medication at the most effective dose in the shortest possible time.

      In this prospective, randomized, single-blind study, new patients presenting to the clinical
      site with evidence of depression or anxiety as determined by a qualified clinician will be
      invited to participate. Study participants will be randomized to one of two groups with
      respect to the IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test Panel result: group with testing results
      revealed to the medical provider prior to treatment selection (Experimental Group) or group
      without testing results prior to treatment selection (Control Group). Participant outcomes
      will be measured at baseline and throughout the 4-month duration of the study.
