      gene respectively code polycystin 1 and polycystin 2. Currently the hypotheses for increased
      intracranial aneurysm rate in ADPKD patients is that mutation of polycystin is not only
      confined to nephron tissues but also in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells
      and results in mutation of vascular phenotype. Also recent studies show polycystin complex
      causes cystic changes through mutation in primary cilia in renal epithelium. Wild type
      endothelial cells respond to fluid shear stress by regulating levels of intracellular calcium
      and nitric oxide, however, PKD1 or PKD2 mutation in fetal aortic endothelial cells revealed
      loss of these responses.

      During kidney transplantation, bilateral nephrectomies are routinely performed to ADPKD
      patients. In this study, blood, urine, iliac artery and renal artery tissues will be
      collected from ADPKD patients receiving kidney transplantation to analyze the arterial
      characteristic and gene mutation of ADPKD patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      mechanisms associated with intracranial aneurysm occurence in ADPKD patients by analyzing the
      genetic mutation and vascular deformities of these patients.
