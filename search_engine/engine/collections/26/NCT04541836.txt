      a similar incidence in men and women. The pathophysiology of PSP is remaining unclear, but it
      is known to be related to the abnormal accumulation of 4R tau protein in the brain. Recently,
      new generation of novel radiotracer 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607), which can be labeled with 4R
      PHF-tau without significant off-target binding, has been successfully developed. The study
      will enroll 20 PSP and 8 normal subjects with complete neurological examination, 18F-PMPBB3
      (APN-1607) PET and MRI assessment. To explore: (1) whether 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) can detect
      the 4R tau protein in the brain of PSP patients; (2) whether 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) can
      distinguish the clinical characteristics of PSP; (3) Whether the distribution of tau
      deposition is related to disease severity, progression, and prognosis. The research results
      will help to understand the potential of 18F-PMPBB3 (APN-1607) as a biomarker for diagnosis
      and therapeutic assessment tool for progressive nuclear paralysis as well as other tau
      proteinopathy.
