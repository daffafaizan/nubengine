      study in 4 healthy volunteers, 2 men and 2 women. After screening, healthy eligible
      volunteers will be hospitalized in the study unit from study Day 2 to Day 4. On Day 1 (the
      day before hospitalization), volunteers will enter the study unit from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.
      for baseline prolactin blood sampling and sedation assessment. Each volunteer will have a
      control magnetic resonance imaging (at screening) and 3 PET measurements using the
      radioligand [11]C raclopride to measure central D2 receptor occupancy in the putamen. Blood
      samples to measure plasma concentrations of paliperidone will be collect immediately before
      and at scheduled time points after dose administration on Day 2, and immediately before,
      halfway through, and immediately after the PET-2 and PET-3 measurements. Serum prolactin
      levels will be measured immediately before and at several scheduled time points after dose
      administration, and immediately before and after each PET measurement. At scheduled time
      points, supine and standing blood pressures, pulse, sensorium changes, temperature, and
      degree of sedation will be recorded, volunteers will be questioned about adverse events, and
      they will be evaluated for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Adverse events will be recorded and
      followed throughout the study. The rationale for the study design is based on previous PET
      studies with risperidone, which indicated that PET measurement of D2 receptor occupancy after
      a single dose of medication is useful in predicting an effective clinical dose range. Single
      oral dose (6 mg) of OROS paliperidone
