    
      Doneguebougou, Mali, is an area of seasonal malaria transmission that is being investigated
      as a suitable site for testing investigational malaria vaccines. The overall goal of this
      study is to characterize the population of this site in terms of common hematologic and
      biochemistry parameters that may be used to determine eligibility for participation in
      vaccine trials, as well as in terms of preexisting medical conditions and preexisting
      immunity to potential malaria vaccine antigens, both of which might impact on the assessment
      of vaccine safety and efficacy. The development of high quality laboratory proficiency to
      assess these parameters in Mali will also be achieved by this study.
