      treatment for depression in patients with Parkinson's Disease. We have designed a clinical
      trial in which volunteers that fulfill inclusion criteria will receive 15 sessions of tDCS
      during 1 week (3 sessions a day, with 30 minutes interval in between). Subjects will be
      randomly allocated into two groups, one that will receive the real intervention (active) and
      the other that will receive the placebo intervention (sham). The collaborator in charge of
      administering the session will not participate in the evaluations, keeping both subjects and
      evaluators blinded to the nature of the sessions. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, and
      after the end of sessions, 1 week, 4 weeks and 8 weeks, the latter being the main outcome.

      We aim to enroll 50 subjects, 25 for each arm. The sample size calculation took into
      consideration previous clinical trials using tDCS for depression in different settings.
