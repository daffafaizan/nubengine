      screened by required assessments per protocol. Eligible subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Group 1, Group 2, or
      Control Group, receiving either ID93+GLA-SE or saline placebo on Days 0, 28, and 56. The
      investigator will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the Investigational
      Product in the subjects throughout the study.

      For safety assessment, subjects will be instructed to record any adverse events in the
      subject diary after each vaccination. Subject's safety will be reported to the investigators
      after 7 days from each vaccination (Days 7, 35, 63) via site visit or a phone call. Solicited
      AEs will be collected up to 7 days after the final vaccination with the Investigational
      Product and un-solicited AEs will be collected up to 28 days after the final vaccination with
      the Investigational Product. For long-term safety assessment of the Investigational Product,
      serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be monitored up to 12
      months after the final vaccination with the Investigational Product.

      For immunogenicity assessment, blood samples for immunology assays will be collected and
      analyzed before and after each vaccination. For efficacy assessment, QFT-Gold Plus testing
      will be performed after 3 months and 14months from the first vaccination with the
      Investigational Product.
