      years, undergoing inguinal hernia surgery. Patients will exclude if receiving asthma
      treatment, if they had upper respiratory tract infection in the last week and if the
      laryngeal mask airway (LMA) could not be placed at a single attempt.

      Patients will be separated into 3 groups as Group E (n=10) with high immunoglobulin E (IgE),
      Group C (n=10) with normal IgE and Group M (n=10) who were administered with 4mg peroral
      Montelukast Sodium, 10 days before surgery because of high IgE.

      With spontaneous breathing after anaesthesia induction, a classic LMA will be placed.
      Anaesthesia will be maintained with a mixture of 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)
      sevoflurane 500%2 - N2O. At 5-minute intervals, oxygen saturation (sPO2), End-Tidal carbon
      dioxide, Heart Rate, tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (f) and peak airway pressure (PAP)
      will be monitored and coughing, apnea, laryngospasm , bronchospasm, desaturation and need for
      steroids will be noted.
