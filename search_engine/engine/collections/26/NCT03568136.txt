      established in the therapy of psoriasis with a highly favorable benefit to risk ration and
      IL-17 has been described in atopic dermatitis this study aims to investigate the effects of
      anti-IL-17 in atopic dermatitis.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blinded study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Secukinumab compared to placebo in 45 adults with atopic
