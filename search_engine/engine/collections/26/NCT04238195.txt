    
      This is a randomized, double-blind (with respect to TBPM-PI-HBr / placebo only), placebo- and
      active-control, single-dose, 4-way crossover study. Twenty-four (24) healthy, adult, male and
      female subjects will be enrolled. Screening of subjects will occur within 28 days prior to
      the first dosing.

      All subjects will receive a single dose of 4 different study treatments over 4 separate
      treatment periods, each separated by a 7-day washout period.

      On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 12 treatment sequences. Sentinel
      group: In Period 1 only, 4 subjects will be dosed 24 hours prior to the remaining 20
      subjects. Each of the 4 subjects from the sentinel group will receive a different treatment.

      On Day 1 of each period, subjects will receive a single oral therapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr
      (Treatment A), supratherapeutic dose of TBPM-PI-HBr (Treatment B), placebo (Treatment C), or
      moxifloxacin (Treatment D) according to the randomization scheme.

      In each period, cardiodynamic ECGs and PK blood samples will be collected pre-dose and for 24
      hours post-dose. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and
      laboratory evaluations.

      Discontinued subjects who have received study drug will not be replaced.
