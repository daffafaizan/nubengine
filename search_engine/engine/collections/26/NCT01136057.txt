      oseltamivir (commonly known as Tamiflu), as resistance to this medication has been observed
      in people infected with the seasonal influenza virus. Because of the possibility of drug
      resistance, additional treatment options for influenza are needed. The purpose of this study
      is to collect blood from people who have recovered from influenza or who have received a
      seasonal influenza vaccine. The blood will then be processed into Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)-licensed fresh frozen plasma (FFP). In a future clinical trial, this
      plasma will be used as a treatment for people hospitalized with influenza.

      This study will enroll people who have recovered from influenza or received a seasonal
      influenza vaccine. Participants will donate blood at FDA-licensed blood donor centers up to
      three times during the 240-day study period.
