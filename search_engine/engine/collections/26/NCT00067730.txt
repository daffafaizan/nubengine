      leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma patients who develop sever sepsis within 60 days of starting
      chemotherapy in preparation for bone marrow transplant (BMT). The study will evaluate the
      safety of Xigris by assessing the risk of serious bleeding events, including bleeding within
      the brain and serious bleeding leading to death.
