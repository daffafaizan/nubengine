      (interventional toothpaste) compared to conventional toothpaste (control) for 30 days in
      participants with confirmed mild to severe PD will significantly reduce hsCRP levels, a
      sensitive marker of inflammation and predictor of CVD. By completing the COHESION trial, we
      will collect important and relevant data to support application for investigator-initiated
      research funding from the US National Institutes of Health to directly test whether Plaque HD
      reduces CVD in larger, scaled multi-center randomized trial.

      Participants will be asked to participate in three visits. During Visit One, we will be
      reviewing their medical and dental information as well as performing an oral evaluation to
      determine their level of gingivitis or periodontal disease. If the participant remains
      eligible, their blood will be drawn to determine whether the baseline hsCRP level falls
      within the eligible range (≥0.5 to ≤10.0 mg/L).

      During Visit Two, if the participant remains eligible, they will be randomized and given a
      30-day supply of the interventional or control toothpaste along with a study diary to track
      their progress.

      The participant will receive a follow-up call 15 days after Visit Two to track compliance
      with study activity and monitor for any adverse events.

      30-days later, during Visit Three, the participants will undergo another oral evaluation in
      addition to a second blood draw to measure the hsCRP level after using their assigned
      toothpaste for 30 days.
