    
      This is a randomized, open label, multicenter, multinational Phase 3 study of TLK286
      (Telcyta) in combination with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil/Caelyx) as compared to the active
      control therapy with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil/Caelyx) as second line therapy in patients
      with platinum refractory or resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either TLK286 (Telcyta) in combination with liposomal doxorubicin
      (Doxil/Caelyx) or active control liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil/Caelyx).
