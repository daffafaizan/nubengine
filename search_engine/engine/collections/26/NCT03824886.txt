      Aged and care dependent patients suffer from many adverse skin conditions like xerosis cutis
      (including pruritus), pressure ulcers, skin tears, intertrigo and incontinence-associated
      dermatitis. Separate preventive strategies for these particular risks and diseases are
      available and partly implemented. Although distinct clinical diagnoses, there are substantial
      overlaps in terms of etiology (e.g. skin fragility, immobility) pathophysiology, prevention
      (e.g. safe handling, off-loading) and treatment (e.g. skin protection and care). Facilities
      are challenged to implement fragmented, condition-specific guidelines, neglecting shared
      etiologies and prevention and treatment principles, which has been shown to be an important
      barrier for implementation of evidence-based practice.

      Recently an evidence-based comprehensive skin care algorithm was developed. The objective of
      this trial is to investigate the feasibility of the implementation of this skin care package,
      to describe context factors for implementation, to estimate effect sizes and intracluster
      coefficients.

      Study design:

      An exploratory cluster randomized trial in aged nursing home residents will be conducted. The
      cluster design was chosen to avoid contamination between groups. A total of n = 500 residents
      from n = 20 nursing homes (randomly selected from the population of nursing homes of the
      state of Berlin) will be included in the study. In the intervention group (n = 10 nursing
      homes), the developed evidence-based algorithm will be implemented. The control group (n = 10
      nursing homes) receives the usual standard care of the respective nursing home.
