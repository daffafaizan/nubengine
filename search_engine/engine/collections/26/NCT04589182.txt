    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled cross-over trial to assess the
      efficacy as well as safety and tolerability of auditory SWS enhancement on measured outcomes
      in PD patients with disturbed nighttime sleep. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups: Group
      1 will first be treated with auditory stimulation for 3 nights and then - after a wash-out
      period of 4 nights - switched to 3 nights of sham stimulation. Group 2 will first receive
      sham-stimulation for 3 nights and then switch to 3 nights of auditory stimulation treatment.
      The wash-out period in between will be 4 nights. Patients and investigators assessing the
      outcomes will be blinded to the conditions. All interventions will take place at the
      patients' homes.

      The pilot study is aimed at assessment of safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of
      auditory SWS enhancement on measured outcomes in MCI and HD patients with disturbed nighttime
      sleep. Patients will be treated with verum or sham auditory stimulation for 2 consecutive
      nights. All interventions will take place at the patients' homes.
