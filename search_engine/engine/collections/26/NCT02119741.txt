      restorative dentists, and to the patients. The loss of papilla can cause cosmetic deformities
      (black triangles), phonetic problems, and food debris accumulation. Often the loss of papilla
      is a consequence of periodontal disease because of gingival inflammation, attachment loss and
      interproximal bone height resorption.

      Several reasons also lead to absence of interdental papillae including:

      1) Plaque associated lesions, 2) Traumatic oral hygiene procedures, 3) Abnormal tooth shape,
      4) Improper contours of the restoration, 5) Spacing between teeth, 6) Loss of teeth.
