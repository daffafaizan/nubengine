    
      This is a single-center, pilot study to assess the feasibility of a study show the
      effectiveness of the genicular artery embolization (GAE) in reducing arthritic pain and
      dysfunction associated with mild to moderate Bilateral or unilateral osteoarthritis of the
      knee. Patients with bilateral or unilateral Grade 1-3 Osteoarthritis as diagnosed on standing
      weight-bearing knee radiographs per the Kellen-Lawrence Grading scale, will be offered
      enrollment to the study. Following a screening questionnaire, these patients will then be
      enrolled in this study. Baseline MRI will be obtained prior to the GAE procedure. Follow up
      intervals will include 3, 6, 9, and 12 months with the primary objective measured by a
      clinician as the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index)
      score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) score, and Oswestry Disability Index at
      the 12-month follow up visit. Patients will also undergo 1 year follow up MRI to be
      interpreted by a diagnostic radiologist with subspecialty training in musculoskeletal
      radiology. This radiologist will compare the treated knee to the baseline screening according
      to the WORMS classification (Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Scoring) to assess for radiologic
      changes of osteoarthritis and any adverse effects.
