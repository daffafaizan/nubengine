      increases the time to the first occurrence of any of the components of the TACT2 primary
      endpoint: all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or
      hospitalization for unstable angina compared to the placebo chelation strategy.

      TACT2 is a 2x2 factorial trial testing 40-weekly edetate disodium-based chelation infusions
      and twice daily high-dose oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) in a placebo-controlled
      design.

      TACT2 is being carried out to replicate the findings of TACT1, which found a striking
      reduction of recurrent cardiovascular events in post-MI diabetic patients receiving edetate
      disodium-based chelation therapy.
