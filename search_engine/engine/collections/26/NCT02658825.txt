    
      This is a two-part Phase 1 study consisting of a dose escalation part (Panel 1) and a
      thorough QT (TQT) part (Panel 2). Panel 1 will be a double-blind (neither the researchers nor
      the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study
      medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo-controlled dose escalation study in
      healthy participants to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      JNJ-63623872 after administration of single doses of 2400 milligrams (mg) and 3000 mg under
      fasted conditions. The final dose to be used in the Panel 2 will be determined based on the
      results of this dose escalation part. An interim analysis will be conducted on Panel 1 to
      select the dose for Panel 2. Panel 2 will be a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized,
      3-period crossover (the same medications provided to all participants but in different
      sequence), placebo- and positive controlled study to evaluate the effect of JNJ-63623872 on
      the QT/QTc interval in healthy participants. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
