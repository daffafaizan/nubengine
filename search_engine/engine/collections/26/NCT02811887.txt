      potential to increase physical functioning and capacity, but also to affect fundamental
      aspects of disease, increase quality of life, and may even increase survival in patients with
      liver cirrhosis.

      Instruction and advice about a healthy lifestyle and physical activity are attractive as it
      limits time spent on supervised rehabilitation at an outpatient clinic. Further,
      self-management can be attractive to society as it can conserve health care resources.
      However, instructions and advice can only be effective if the patients adhere to them, and
      there is a need for initiatives that enhance the motivation to follow the advice and change
      undesirable behaviours.

      Mobile phone short-message service (SMS) messages are increasingly used to deliver
      interventions and enhance healthy behaviour. The technology is simple, cost-effective, can be
      automated, and can reach any mobile phone owner. In a recent systematic review, SMS-messages
      have been shown effective in a broad range of healthy behaviours, which was also highlighted
      in a randomized trial showing positive effects of lifestyle-focused SMS-messages on
      cardiovascular risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease. An SMS-message-based
      lifestyle intervention therefore seems like a feasible and effective means of enhancing
      motivation to follow advice about healthy lifestyle and physical activity among patients with
      liver cirrhosis.
