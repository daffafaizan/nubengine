    
      This study will evaluate patients with inflammatory forms of arthritis within the first year
      of onset. The study will attempt to clarify factors that may predict disease course such as
      evolution into rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other chronic inflammatory arthropathies.
      Synovial biopsies and synovial fluid will be obtained to search for microbial agents and
      other initiating and modulating factors that may be most readily distinguished early in the
      disease and to determine the stage of disease at which certain immunologic and hormonal
      changes become evident. The study will also search for genetic and other features that may be
      associated with specific forms of inflammatory arthropathies that might predict the
      subsequent clinical disease course or response to different agents used in treatment of RA,
      Reiter's syndrome and other types of chronic inflammatory arthropathies.
