      the same time, the tip of used catheter and blood from the patient are checked whether the
      pathogenic bacteria exists or not by general bacterial protocol and blood culture test on a
      routine application. Unfortunately, these tests not always clarified their cause of SIRS.
      Therefore we conduct this investigation to establish the useful protocol for pathogenic
      bacteria. We check the pathogenic bacteria not only tip but through the whole catheter in
      Central Venous Catheter using general bacterial protocol and SEM observation. Additionally,
      we compared that sputum, urine, skin and blood from the patient for bacteria check.
