      I. To determine the freedom from local progression (FFLP) of TACE versus (vs) SABR in
      patients with persistent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after TACE.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of TACE vs SABR in patients with
      persistent HCC after initial TACE.

      II. To determine the overall survival (OS) of TACE vs SABR for persistent HCC. III. To
      determine the toxicities associated with TACE or SABR for persistent HCC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo TACE.

      ARM II: Beginning within 2 weeks of the radiation set-up scan and within 4 weeks of fiducial
      seed implantation (if applicable), patients undergo image guided SBRT 3 fractions within 1
      week or 5 fractions within 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1-2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12, and
      18 months, and every 6 months up to 3 years.
