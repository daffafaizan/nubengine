    
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of a hypopressive abdominal exercise program
      versus a general strengthening exercise program on inter-recti distance, abdominal and lumbar
      muscle thickness, lumbopelvic and abdominal pain and function, pelvic floor dysfunction, and
      quality of life in postpartum women. To evaluate the effects of the hypopressive exercise,
      the subjects will be assessed at pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and at
      3-months follow-up.

      It will consist of a randomized controlled trial study. The sample will consist of women in
      the early postpartum period (6-8 weeks after delivery). Subjects will be randomly allocated
      to two different exercise programs: hypopressive abdominal exercise program and general
      strengthening exercise program. Both interventions will have a total duration of 6 weeks (18
      sessions), 3 times a week, 30 minutes each session.

      To evaluate the effects of the interventions, the subjects will be assessed at
      pre-intervention (6th-8th week postpartum), immediately post-intervention (12th-14th week
      postpartum) and at 3-months follow-up (24th-26th week postpartum). Inter-recti distance,
      abdominal and lumbar muscle thickness, lumbopelvic and abdominal pain and function, pelvic
      floor dysfunction, and quality of life will be measured.
