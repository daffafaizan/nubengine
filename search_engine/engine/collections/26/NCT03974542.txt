    
      The colorectal cancer screening programme(CRCSP) adopts a two-tier approach, offering faecal
      occult blood test (FOBT) by FIT as first line screening followed by colonoscopy examination
      for cases with positive FIT result. Under the CRCSP, participants with negative or
      uninformative FIT result in the first round should be re-screened after 24 months.

      The objective is to conduct a randomised control trial to test the effectiveness of telephone
      outreach programme to improve the uptake rate of repeat fecal occult blood test in CRCSP.
