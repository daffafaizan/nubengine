      seventh decades. It can cause significant pain and disability. Previous studies have
      demonstrated increased prevalence of abnormal glucose handling, when these patients were
      tested with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). On the other hand, many of the neuropathy
      patients suffer from pain and depression and obesity; and abnormal OGTT in these patients may
      be the result of these factors. We assume that if abnormal handling of blood sugar is the
      cause of neuropathy, these patients may have evidence of damage to other organs (like eyes
      and kidneys) as a result of abnormal blood sugar. In a pilot study, we will determine the
      incidence of subtle damage to kidneys, eyes and also look for other factors associated with
      abnormal glucose handling in patients with neuropathy and abnormal OGTT and compare it to age
      matched controls with normal OGTT.
