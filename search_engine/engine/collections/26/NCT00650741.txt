      The results from 3 patient groups (see below) will be compared

      1: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD) ,
      Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD), no repetition of
      test 2: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD)
      , Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound FMD), Repetition
      with Nitroglycerin 3: 10 subjects, Half with Endothelial Dysfucntion (according to previous
      ultrasound FMD) , Half with no endothelial dysfucntion (according to previous ultrasound
