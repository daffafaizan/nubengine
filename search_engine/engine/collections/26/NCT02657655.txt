      adult volunteers that have been clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Subjects will
      have a confirmed history of motor fluctuation with a variety of Parkinson's disease symptom
      severities. All subjects will user the Kinesia 360 system and complete motor diaries several
      times per month during the study period. Symptom reports will be provided to the treating
      clinical team. Motor function, quality of life, engagement, and satisfaction with care will
      be tracked throughout the study.
