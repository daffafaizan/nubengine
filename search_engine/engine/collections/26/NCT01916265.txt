      will include a total of 6 completing patients. The study is not blinded due to the
      exploratory nature.

      At each of the 3 periods, different blood glucose level will be established in 4 steps (8, 6,
      4, and 2.8 mmol/L), and a prefixed glucagon dose will be given per glucose level. The
      sequence of glucagon dose strength for the three dosing days will be randomized.
