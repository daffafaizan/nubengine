    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      multiple intra-articular injections of LRX712 in the knee when treating patients with knee
      osteoarthritis of mild/moderate severity, in order to support the further clinical
      development. This study will also allow refinement of the systemic and local pharmacokinetics
      of LRX712 and the exploration of drug effects on biomarkers of cartilage breakdown and
      regeneration in OA patients.
