      I. Determine the 3- and 6-month survival rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with 3-AP (Triapine^Â®) as first- or second-line
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the
      time to treatment failure in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine overall survival
      and disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine tumor response in patients treated with this drug. V. Determine laboratory
      studies that will increase our understanding of Triapine and its effects on cellular
      processes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (yes vs no).

      Patients receive triapene IV over 2 hours on days 1-4 and 15-18. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months for 3 years.
