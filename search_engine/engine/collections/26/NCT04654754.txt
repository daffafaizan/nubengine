      potentially increased virus transmission when utilizing high-flow devices and aerosol devices
      among COVID-19 patients. For spontaneous breathing patients with tracheostomy, whose lower
      airway is directly opened to the room air, the aerosol particles generated by the patients
      would be directly dispersed into the room air, which might be an direct resource of virus
      transmission. However, the transmission risk of tracheostomy during spontaneous breathing has
      not been evaluated and the appropriate humidification therapy is unknown. Thus this study is
      aimed to investigate the aerosol particle concentrations among different oxygen devices for
      spontaneous breathing patients with tracheostomy, in order to reflect the transmission risk.
