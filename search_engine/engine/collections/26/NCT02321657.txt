      intravenous cannulation.1 This is commonly performed in the anaesthetic room prior to
      induction of anaesthesia. At Chelsea and Westminster Foundation Trust (CWFT) over 5000
      children undergo operations every year. Traditional methods of distracting the child during
      have included blowing bubbles, storybooks, and a variety of toys and games. These methods are
      not always effective and may present an infection risk due to inability to clean between
      uses.

      The use of an android/iPad provides a platform for effectively distracting the child with a
      choice of games, video and music, with the advantage of being cleaned between uses. Users of
      this platform are required to select the application that is most appropriate for the age,
      sex, method of anaesthesia, and compliance level of the child. To assist with this, the
      investigators have developed an application system that will select a range of entertainment
      applications appropriate for each child based on these four variables and hopefully help to
      keep children calm before their operations.
