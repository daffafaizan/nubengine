      independent predictor of mortality. However, the optimal intensity of renal replacement
      therapy for such patients is still controversial. we randomly assigned the patients with
      Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) to continuous renal replacement
      therapy with different treatment dose (35ml / kg / h or 25ml/kgÔºèh),The primary study outcome
      was death from any cause within 14, 28 and 90 days.
