    
      Primarily, this study is designed to assess the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam in
      reducing the cases of colonization and infection of extended-spectrum betalactamases (ESBLs)
      producing E.coli or K pneumoniae, S aureus methicillin resistant (MRSA) and Enterococcus
      vancomycin resistant (VRE). Secondly, this study plans to determine the acquisition rate of
      ESBL producing E Coli or K pneumoniae, methicillin resistant S Aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin
      resistant Enterococcus spp (VRE), both pre- and post-intervention.
