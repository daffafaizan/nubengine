      PC1 is a prospective cohort study of men within one year of their first diagnosis of prostate
      cancer, or who are within one month of commencing Androgen Deprivation Therapy for the first
      time. Its goal will be to identify factors associated with the development of cardiovascular
      disease among men with prostate cancer, with a particular focus on Androgen Deprivation
      Therapy.RADICAL PC2 is a randomized, controlled trial embedded in RADICAL PC1. RADICAL PC2
      will test a systematic approach to modifying cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors in men
      within one year of their first diagnosis of prostate cancer, or who are within one month of
      commencing Androgen Deprivation Therapy for the first time.
