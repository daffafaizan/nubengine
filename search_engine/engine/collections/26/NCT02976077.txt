    
      Methods:

      This is a randomized controlled trial to establish the validity of the RC2S+ program in
      schizophrenia.

      The project's main objective is to assess the impact of RC2S+ on social cognitive impairments
      in schizophrenia compared with a cognitive remediation program (control therapy) focusing on
      neurocognition, equivalent in terms of number, duration and rhythm of sessions.

      The study has four other objectives:

        1. To assess the influence of the RC2S+ therapy versus control therapy on neurocognitive
           processes

        2. To assess the impact of the RC2S+ therapy versus control therapy on social functioning

        3. To assess the impact of the RC2S+ therapy versus control therapy on both positive and
           negative symptoms

        4. To study the maintenance of benefits 3 months forward

      Outcomes:

      To treat social cognitive impairments in people with schizophrenia.
