    
      This is a monocentric, open pilot study, with the aim to evaluate the effect of vitamin d
      supplementation on regulatory FoxP3+ T cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa in healthy women
      and men.

      The primary goal is to evaluate the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the regulatory
      FoxP3+ T cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa under controlled conditions within 2 months.

      The secondary study goals are to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      peripheral induced tregs and on other important immune cells in the tissue (NK, NKT cells and
      LPCD) and in the blood (NK, NKT cells, Th17, Th1, Th2 cells) within 2 months.
