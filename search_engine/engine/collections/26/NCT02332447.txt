      significance level of 5% (two-tailed), assuming a hazard ratio of 2.414 calculated, i.e based
      on an effect size similar to the effect size of oxygenotherapy in a delay of 60 seconds
      (Rheims et al., 2019), 40 events should be observed to reject the null hypothesis in 80% of
      cases,. A proportion of 89% of patients being expected to recover SpO2 â‰¥ 90% 120 seconds
      after the end of the seizure and considering a proportion of unusauble records for technical
      reasons of 20%, at least 54 patients should be randomized.

      Assuming that about 10% of patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy who undergo
      long-term video-EEG monitoring develop at least one partial secondary generalized
      tonic-clonic seizure, a total of 554 patients will be included in the study.
