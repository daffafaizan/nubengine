      to undergo systemic therapy. In this study we will utilize a novel technology for circulating
      tumor DNA detection in order to evaluate their presence in patients with lung cancer by
      comparing blood samples at six time points. We will obtain baseline blood and then collect
      blood at five time points during the course of the patient's chemotherapy treatments and at
      the end of treatment. These same blood collections will be used for the detection of soluble
      immune markers and evaluation of PBMCs.
