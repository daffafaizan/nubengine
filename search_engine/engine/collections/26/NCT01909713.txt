      tolerability of Cetaphil® DermaControl™ skin care products used at least once daily for 22
      days in male and female subjects age 7 to 11 with acne prone skin. There were 4 visits during
      the course of the study: screening (within 7 days of visit 1), visit 1(baseline /day1), visit
      2 (day 8), and visit 3 (day 22/exit). Tolerability assessments were performed by a board
      certified dermatologist at all visits. Subjects completed the baseline skin care regimen
      questionnaire at visit 1. Hydration assessments were competed at visits 1, 2, and 3. A
      subject satisfaction questionnaire was completed at visit 3. Adverse event assessments were
      conducted for all subjects at every clinic visit after informed consent/assent was signed.
