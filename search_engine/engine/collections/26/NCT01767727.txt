      two-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing. The range of motion of
      the proximal interphalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joint of the injured finger
      is measured by a goniometer. The cold intolerance of the injured finger is measured using the
      self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire that is rated into mild,
      moderate, severe, and extreme. The pain of the injured finger and the donor site is given
      subjectively by the patient using the visual analogue scale, which ranges from 0 to 10 cm and
      groupes into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe (7-10 cm).
