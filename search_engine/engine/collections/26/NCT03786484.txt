    
      The phase I dose escalations will be conducted utilizing the standard 3+3 dose escalation
      method. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be obtained for PBF-999.

      The phase I dose expansion will consist of 1 group including immunotherapy na√Øve and
      pretreated (previous immune checkpoint inhibitors; anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and/or
      combinations) solid tumors cancer patients. Pharmacodynamic (PD) data will be obtained for
      potential biomarker analysis with pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies.

      Phase I Dose Escalation (3+3 Design):

      1. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level at which less than 2 out of 6 patients
      (<33%) experience DLT in Cycle 1 (first 28 days).

      Phase I Safety Expansion Once RP2D has been declared for PBF-999 using the standard 3+3
      design, up to 20 additional solid tumor cancer patients may be treated at the RP2D to further
      explore safety and tolerability of the selected PBF-999 dose.

      Patients in this study will be males or females 18 years of age or older. Patients must have
      histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer with at least one measurable lesion, with
      adequate organ and marrow function, and with ECOG performance status of 0-1. Eligible
      patients must have received at least one prior line of therapy for their disease.
