      protect energy stores from changes to the food environment. Accordingly, many individuals
      remain remarkably weight stable over years without carefully considering how much they eat or
      how much energy they expend, which has given rise to the theory that body weight is regulated
      around an individual biological 'set point'. Notably, overfeeding humans in experimentally
      controlled conditions, support this phenomenon, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown.

      To systematically map out the components of the overfed state, the investigators will execute
      a 2-week randomized controlled overfeeding trial in lean and overweight individuals. The
      trial is preceded by a 1-week lead-in period and followed by a 2-wk controlled ad libitum
      study period. The comparison between lean and overweight subjects, men and women, enables the
      determination of whether a differential response in overfeeding-induced signals is present in
      relation to BMI and sex.
