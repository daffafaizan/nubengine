      off-loading of pressure on the wound via specialized shoes, cast braces, or casts, 2) removal
      of infected or necrotic tissue vial surgery or non-surgical methods, and 3) optimization of
      wound healing by interventions that promote wound repair such as nutritional support,
      provision of optimal moisture balance and growth factor therapy.

      Application of casts or cast braces [below knee, removable boots with protective padding] to
      protect and immobilize the ankle and foot have been demonstrated to provide superior wound
      healing than less cumbersome types of shoe gear (1-3). The benefit of casting may be the
      result of more effective off-loading of pressure than can be achieved with other devices, but
      the inability of patients to remove their casts also appears to an important factor, as
      non-compliance with removable cast-braces has been shown to be a pervasive and significant
      issue (4,5). One critical concept in diabetic foot ulcer management is the relation between
      chronically and limb loss - for each year a wound persists, a patient has a 25% risk for
      major amputation due to complications from infection (6-8). Limb loss has a profound effect
      on Diabetics' quality of life and rate of lower limb loss among diabetics is four per 1,000
      person years in comparison with three per 10,000 person years (9-10).
