      the period of food intake to 8 h/d (e.g. 10 am to 6 pm) without calorie counting. Recent
      findings from short-term uncontrolled trials suggest that TRF is effective for weight loss
      and cardio-protection in obese adults. In view of these pilot findings, it is of great
      interest to see whether subjects can adhere to TRF for longer periods of time, and to see
      what degree of weight loss that can be achieved with TRF. Accordingly, the aims of this trial
      are: Aim 1: To determine if TRF can be implemented to facilitate weight loss in obese adults,
      and Aim 2: To determine if TRF can produce clinically meaningful reductions in plasma lipids,
      blood pressure, insulin resistance, and inflammatory markers. To test the study objectives, a
      14-week randomized, controlled, parallel-arm trial, divided into 2 consecutive periods: (1)
      2-week baseline; and (2) 12-week weight loss, will be implemented. Obese subjects (n = 40)
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) TRF (n = 20), or (2) control (n = 20). This study
      will be the first randomized controlled trial of TRF, and will show that TRF can be
      implemented to help obese individuals lose weight and lower risk of coronary heart disease.
