      and treat tobacco use disorder will improve rates of remission from tobacco use disorder in
      the clients served by each system.

      This is a cluster randomized comparative effectiveness trial that compares intervention
      clinics (offer smoking cessation group counseling and medication management) integrated into
      primary care and community mental health clinics with treatment as usual (offering
      information about the California Smoker's Helpline and informal provider counseling). The
      specific aim is to randomize 17 clinics (11 at LACDHS and 6 at LACDMH), with a 5:1 ratio in
      the assignment of clinical sites assigned to offer smoking cessation services as compared to
      the treatment as usual (TAU).

      In addition to providing support for the implementation of the smoking cessation services,
      the study will enroll 1,200 clients with tobacco use disorder from all 17 participating
      clinics for an outcome study; 1000 people from clinical sites where smoking cessation
      treatment are being offered and 200 people with tobacco use disorder from the TAU clinical
      sites. The primary study outcome is to determine if there will be higher rates of smoking
      cessation in the implementation sites as compared with TAU sites that do not offer smoking
      cessation treatment.
