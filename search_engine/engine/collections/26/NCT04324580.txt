    
      188 patients treated for distal radius fractures with open reduction internal fixation using
      volar locked plating will be split into two study groups: a group that is immobilized in a
      splint post operatively and given formal physical therapy and a group that does not receive
      either of these post operative interventions. The primary outcome will be loss of fixation.
      Secondary outcomes will include pain, cost, Quick Dash, range of motion, and grip strength.
      Data will be recorded at the pre-operative visit, as well as at post-operative visits at 2
      weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.
