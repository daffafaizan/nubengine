      in modulating strength and physical function in breast cancer survivors that have recently
      completed chemotherapy. The primary hypothesis for this objective is that creatine will lead
      to significantly greater gains in strength and physical function in breast cancer survivors
      compared to exercise alone. The secondary objective is to determine if supplemental creatine
      can increase intramuscular storage of creatine and alter energy storage. The hypothesis for
      this objective is that creatine supplementation will significantly increase intramuscular
      concentrations of creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in
      the vastus lateralis (VL) compared to controls. The secondary hypothesis for this objective
      is that the creatine group will have significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area and
      significantly lower intramuscular fat compared to controls. The final objective for this
      study is to test the hypothesis that creatine supplementation will improve body composition
      in breast cancer survivors.
