      explain the study. We will draw some blood for tests (about 4-6 tablespoons), including
      Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). If not already obtained, you will have a bone scan and a
      computed tomography scan (CT scan) to establish a baseline.

      You will be receiving hormone suppression treatment with monthly injections of a luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog such as Lupron or Zoladex and an antiandrogen such as
      Eulexin or Casodex as part of your standard care for prostate cancer. About 3 months before
      your next "off-treatment" period, you will start 1 Exisulind pill 250 mg (2 x 125mg capsules)
      by mouth twice a day. It is necessary for you to start the Exisulind treatment 3 months prior
      to your next "off-treatment" period so that the medication can build up in your system enough
      to be effective.

      Per our standard follow-up procedures, we will ask you to have blood draws every 2 weeks for
      up to 12 weeks after starting Exisulind to check liver function. Thereafter you will be asked
      to have monthly blood draws, and return to the clinic every 3 months for a physical
      examination, to determine how well you are tolerating the study medication, how your cancer
      is responding to the treatment, and to give you more study medication. You will continue
      taking Exisulind during your "off-treatment" period until your PSA reaches a threshold level.
      PSA threshold is defined by your primary treatment. If you have had your prostate removed,
      the threshold is 1.0 ng/dL. If you have an intact prostate, your threshold is 4 ng/dL. Once
      your PSA reaches this level, you will restart your hormone suppression treatment as directed
      by your doctor.
