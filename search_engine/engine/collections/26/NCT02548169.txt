    
      This is a single center, exploratory pilot safety, open label, phase I trial that will
      evaluate the combination of DC vaccination in 2 groups of patients when combined with
      chemotherapy including FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel in patients with pancreatic
      cancer. The investigations will accrue 20 evaluable subjects over 20 months with 10 patients
      in each group. Subjects will be assigned to group 1 or group 2 according to the subject's
      disease stage.

      The protocol will be conducted in two stages:

      The 1st 3 patients will be enrolled to either group to receive DC vaccinations combined with
      standard chemotherapy. A safety analysis will be performed after the first 3 patients have
      completed 6 vaccines. If no vaccine dose-limiting toxicity occurs in any of the 3 patients
      then the study will proceed with stage 2. Stage 2 will include the enrollment of the
      remaining 17 patients.
