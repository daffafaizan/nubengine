    
      This randomized controlled equivalence trial (RCT) implemented at eight hospitals and Health
      centres in Central Uganda will include 1192 eligible women with incomplete abortion of
      uterine size >12 weeks up to 18 weeks. Following informed consent, each participant will be
      randomly assigned to undergo a clinical assessment and treatment by either a midwife
      (intervention arm) or physician (control arm); receive 400mcg of misoprostol administered
      sublingually 3 hourly up to 5 doses within 24 hours at the health facility until a complete
      abortion is confirmed. Women who do not achieve a complete abortion within 24 hours will
      undergo a surgical method of uterine evacuation. Pre-discharge information on danger signs,
      contraceptive counselling and provision will be done with follow up 14 days later to assess
      secondary outcomes and acceptability. Analyses will be by Intention-to-Treat (ITT).
      Background characteristics and outcomes will be presented using descriptive statistics.
      Differences between groups will be analyzed using risk difference (95% CI) and equivalence
      established if it lies between the pre-defined range of -5% to +5%. Chi-square test will be
      used for comparison of outcome and t test used to compare mean values. P-values equal to or
      lower than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
