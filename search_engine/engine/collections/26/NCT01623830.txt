      manipulation that triggers the fear memory and presumably allows it to be changed in a way
      that prevents the fear from returning later (i.e., prevents relapse). The investigators
      propose to randomly assign eligible participants to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) VRE therapy
      preceded by a reminder of the feared stimulus (a VR clip of a virtual airplane taxiing and
      taking off) presented 10 minutes prior to all VRE therapy sessions, or 2) VRE therapy
      preceded by a neutral cue (a VR clip of a virtual living room) presented 10 minutes prior to
      all VRE therapy sessions. Participants will be evaluated pre- and post-treatment and at a 3
      month and 6 month follow-up visit to assess long-term effects.
