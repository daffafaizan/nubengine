      pacemaker implantation by the electrophysiology group at Oregon Health and Sciences
      University Hospital during the period between 01/2003 and 01/2013 for chronic RV pacing after
      AV node ablation or for AV node dysfunction.

      Goal The goal of this study is to determine if patients requiring RV pacing after AV nodal
      ablation are at increased risk for developing worsening cardiac function secondary to chronic
      RV pacing compared to patients requiring RV pacing for AV node dysfunction.

      Specific Objectives

        -  To determine the number of patients that have a permanent pacemaker implanted after AV
           node ablation and for AV node dysfunction within the last 10 years at OHSU Hospital.

        -  To determine the number of patients that have a biventricular pacemaker implanted with
           or without an implantable cardiac defibrillator within the last 10 years at OHSU
           Hospital (control group).

        -  Amongst those patients identified determine (1) left ventricular ejection fraction prior
           to permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation and over time (2) left
           ventricular volume and/or diameter prior to permanent pacemaker placement and over time
           (3) all cause mortality

        -  Amongst those patients identified determine incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation
           after permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation

        -  Amongst those patients identified determine incidence of inpatient admission of heart
           failure exacerbation defined as presenting symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal
           nocturnal dyspnea, increased lower extremity edema requiring IV diuretics

      Methods

      This is a retrospective chart review of patients that have undergone permanent pacemaker
      medical record system used at OHSU Hospital) with the help of an EPIC representative. If the
      patient was referred for permanent pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker implantation from a
      physician or medical group outside of OHSU records will be requested from that physician or
      medical group.
