      Musculoskeletal alterations have been described related to techniques used during surgery,
      that it produces an inhibition of deep abdominal muscles. These muscles are in charge of
      lumbopelvic stabilization muscle linked to reduced ability to maintain independence in daily
      activity life that could have affected their quality of life

      Objective: The aim objective will be evaluated short and long-term effects of physical
      activity program for muscle stabilization.

      Methods: 20 colorectal cancer survivors will be recruited from the Department of Oncology of
      Cl√≠nico San Cecilio Hospital. Patients will be randomized in physical activity program group
      and usual care group. Physical activity groups will receive an eight week program form
      improve the muscle stabilization.

      Discussion: Researchers attempts to increase the fitness level and reduce musculoskeletal
      disorders in colorectal cancer survivors through a physical activity interventions focusing
      in muscle stabilization.
