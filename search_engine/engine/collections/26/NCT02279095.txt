      and efficacy of different palovarotene dosing regimens in subjects with FOP.

      In Part A, all subjects who completed Study PVO-1A-201 and enrolled into the current study
      received daily treatment with open-label palovarotene for an eligible flare-up at a dose of
      10 mg for 14 days, followed by 5 mg for 28 days (or the weight-based equivalent). Part A is
      completed.

      In Part B, subjects with at least 90% skeletal maturity were treated with 5 mg palovarotene
      on a daily basis (ie, chronically). In the event of an eligible flare-up, all subjects
      received 20 mg palovarotene daily for 28 days, followed by 10 mg for 56 days (dosing was
      weight-based in subjects who were skeletally immature). Dosing could be extended if the
      flare-up was not resolved by Flare-up Day 84 and continued until the flare-up resolved. Dose
      reduction, as directed by the Investigator, occurred in the event of intolerable side
      effects. The duration of Part B is up to 24 months.

      In Part C, the dosing regimens implemented in Part B will continue except that subjects with
      less than 90% skeletal maturity will now receive chronic daily administration of palovarotene
      (5 mg, or the weight-based equivalent). The assessment of HO will occur every 12 months using
      low-dose, whole body computed tomography (WBCT), excluding head; other efficacy and safety
      outcomes will be evaluated remotely every 3 months, or monthly during flare-up based
      treatment. The duration of Part C is 36 months.
