      I. To pilot-test an interdisciplinary Palliative Care Planning Intervention (PCPI) in
      pancreatic cancer. Specifically, to describe patients' satisfaction with the timing, content,
      and delivery of the PCPI intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To pilot-test all selected measures for the study, including measures for healthcare
      resource utilization, overall cost, and patient/family out of pocket expenses.

      II. The long-term objective of this pilot study is to conduct a larger PCPI intervention
      study for pancreatic cancer patients and evaluate its impact on quality of life (QOL),
      symptom intensity, healthcare resource utilization, and healthcare costs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a handbook titled "Supporting You During Cancer Treatment" with educational
      material on QOL issues. Patients undergo 2 education sessions on handbook material in-person
      or by telephone, with session 1 focusing on physical and social well-being issues and session
      2 focusing on psychological and spiritual well-being issues. At the beginning of each
      session, patients select 3 priority topics from a list, and content is tailored to patient
      needs.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.
