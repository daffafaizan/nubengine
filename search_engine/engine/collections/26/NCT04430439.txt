      physiological processes for maternal and child health outcomes. Although maternal diet is a
      key regulator of this process, its effects vary widely across individuals. Maternal stress
      could represent a moderator of considerable importance in this regard, yet little is known
      about the effects of stress on glycemic control in pregnancy and whether the effects of
      stress may vary as a function of diet quality. This project will investigate the effects of
      acute psychosocial stress exposure on the postprandial metabolic response to a meal of
      varying glycemic index (GI) among women with overweight/obesity in mid-pregnancy.
