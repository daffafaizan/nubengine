      of non-union and bone defects due to congenital disease and infection. Despite the
      development of bone engineering, none of the allogeneic bone products can match the
      osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and immunogenic properties of autogenous bone. The iliac
      crest is one of the most harvested sites other than the fibula, ribs, and ulna. An iliac
      crest bone graft (ICBG) can supply a larger amount of cortical and cancellous bone than
      grafts from other donor sites. Pelvic osteotomy is widely used for treating developmental
      dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Tricortical structural bone such
      as that in the ilium is needed to stabilize the pelvis after osteotomy, and the anterior and
      posterior iliac crest are the two most used graft donor sites. When surgery is planned in the
      prone position, such as that for posterior spinal fusion, surgeons generally prefer to adopt
      the posterior approach for ICBG procedures. In supine position surgeries such as pelvic
      osteotomy for DDH or Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, surgeons prefer the anterior approach for
      ICBG procedures. There are many studies on iliac bone growth and complications after ICBG
      procedures. Most of the studies demonstrated good outcomes and few complications. However,
      according to our literature review, none of the previous studies used the iliac bone for
      transplantation in pelvic osteotomy. In this study, we compared the results between an inner
      table harvest site and an inner-outer table harvest site for ICBG used to maintain stability
      in pelvic osteotomy.
