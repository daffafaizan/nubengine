    
      Purpose: In community-dwelling seniors aged 70 years and older who attend the Vancouver Falls
      Prevention Clinic and who consent to allowing their data to form part of the Falls Prevention
      Clinic Database, we will audit charts to answer the following questions: 1) In terms of
      mobility and functional status, what characterizes the patient population that is referred to
      the Falls Prevention Clinic? 2) What is the physiological profile assessment (PPA) of
      individuals at the Falls Prevention Clinic? 3) What are the demographic characteristics? 4)
      What are factors that explain differences in health related quality of life and healthcare
      resource utilization? and 5) For individuals who have a high falls risk profile, what are
      their specific clinical outcome measures that indicate better or worse health related quality
      of life?

      Objective: To develop a Falls Prevention Clinic Database for subjects who attend the Falls
      Prevention Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital and Lion's Gate Hospital.
