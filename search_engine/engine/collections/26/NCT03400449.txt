      the setting of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) uptake and immediate provision. At
      two urban public hospitals with large adolescent populations, participants were randomized to
      a structured, in-person conversation with a trained counselor or a 14-minute video providing
      the same information. Both participant groups were provided written materials and both had
      the opportunity to ask questions of the counselor. The total time to complete counseling was
      measured, as well as participant satisfaction, pre- and post-intervention contraceptive
      knowledge, and intended postpartum contraceptive method.
