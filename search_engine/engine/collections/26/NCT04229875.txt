      depressed and remitted states, frequently leaving patients with decreased quality of life and
      impaired psychosocial function. Traditionally, psychiatry has been sparsely subspecialized in
      Denmark as well as internationally during the last four decades leaving patients in
      generalized psychiatric settings. At the same time, demands to clinical skills, research and
      education have increased, and IT solutions have emerged as a possible way to optimize
      treatment.

      Effects of organizational changes and digital health interventions are rarely investigated
      scientifically in health care services. This is a randomized controlled trial conducted in
      the entire Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark including all psychiatric
      centers in the region.

      The CAG Bipolar study is a large-scale pragmatic randomized controlled trial aiming to
      investigate whether specialized and more centralized treatment (into a clinical academic
      group (CAG)) improves lives and outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder (N= 1000
      patients). Findings from the study will have great impact on future organization and
      optimization of treatment within psychiatry in Denmark as well as internationally.
