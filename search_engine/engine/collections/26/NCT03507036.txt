      thermal heat to stimulate neocollagenesis. Based on the its effect on facial skin, it can be
      hypothesized that bipolar fractional radiofrequency will stimulate similar effect on
      suprapatellar skin, lifting and reducing laxity of the skin in that region.

      This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of the Profound System on suprapatellar
      skin, which has been FDA approved for treatment of facial wrinkles and improvement in the
      appearance of cellulite. This device is a well studied and frequently used on facial skin,
      however, there are no studies showing its effectiveness elsewhere on the body.

      There are alternative treatments that have been shown to decrease laxity of the suprapatellar
      skin, however, the studies include a small and limited population, and have not produced the
      desired effects in practice. The Profound device may be able to produce clinically
      significant improvement in laxity of the suprapatellar skin.
