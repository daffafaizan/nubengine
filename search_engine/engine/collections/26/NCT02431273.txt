      through woman-controlled sustained local delivery of ARTs via intravaginal rings. The
      short-term general investigational plan is to evaluate IVRs releasing TDF, TDF-FTC and
      TDF-FTC-MVC in healthy women for up to 7 days in an open-label study to determine safety and
      drug concentrations in plasma and cervicovaginal lavage and secretions. Additional
      exploratory studies will be considered and planned based in part on the results obtained in
      this study. The long-term investigational plan is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      sustained release TDF, TDF-FTC and TDF-FTC-MVC for their ability to decrease HIV transmission
      to vulnerable women.
