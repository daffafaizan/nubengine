      especially distal lower extremity amputations have the same problem with healing and patients
      often need to be re-amputated more proximally. In these patients oxygen levels are often the
      decisive factor. Providing additional oxygen under hyperbaric conditions will increase tissue
      oxygen concentration sufficient for the amputation stump to heal. This will give the patients
      a more distal amputation with better condition for ambulation.
