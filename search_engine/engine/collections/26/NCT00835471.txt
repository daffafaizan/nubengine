    
      Open randomized multicenter phase II study in patients in need of 2nd line treatment for
      advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Efficacy and safety of monotherapy with erlotinib will be compared
      with combination therapy of erlotinib and chemotherapy. In recent studies it was established
      that pemetrexed activity is more pronounced in non-squamous NSCLC in comparison to squamous
      cell carcinoma. Therefore in patients with non-squamous carcinoma pemetrexed will be used. As
      in second line treatment of NSCLC docetaxel is registered also for usage in patients with
      squamous cell carcinoma, docetaxel will be used in patients with squamous histology.

      Chemotherapy will be limited to 4 courses. Erlotinib will be continued until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Erlotinib as monotherapy will be administered continuously. In combination with chemotherapy,
      erlotinib will be given from day 2-16 of every course of 3 weeks.
