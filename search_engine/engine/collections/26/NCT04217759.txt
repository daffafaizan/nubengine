      Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based PA and dietary strategies implemented for 12 weeks through
      face-to-face group sessions and social media tools effective in the initiation and
      maintenance of increased PA level and healthy balanced dietary intake, resulting in
      improvements of T2DM risk score, anthropometrics, metabolic parameters and SCT-related
      psychosocial factors among Bruneian young adults at risk of T2DM?'.

      Study design was two-arm parallel, stratified with simple randomisation, and assessor-blinded
      randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated into intervention group and
      control group. Participants were students and alumni of Universiti Brunei Darussalam and
      Universiti Teknologi Brunei who were overweight-obese at risk of T2DM with a mean age of 23.1
      (2.48) years old. Intervention group went through a healthy lifestyle intervention using
      evidence-based SCT strategies emphasising on PA and diet for 12 weeks, while the control
      group only received leaflets on healthy lifestyle with no further guidance. Outcomes measured
      were changes from baseline at week 0 to post-intervention at week 13 between intervention and
      control groups. Outcomes were changes in diabetes risk score, anthropometrics, metabolic
      parameters, PA, dietary intake and SCT-related psychosocial factors, with repeated-measures
      ANOVA as the main analysis.
