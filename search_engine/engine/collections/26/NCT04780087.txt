    
      Pregnant women who are experienced in heavy, free-weight resistance exercise training, and
      who choose to continue their exercise regimes during pregnancy, are recruited in social media
      to regularly respond to an online questionnaire on personal health, foetus development, and
      the newborn child health.

      A reference group of pregnant women being regularly physical active (still not lifting free
      weights of high loads) are concurrently recruited.

      All will respond to questionnaire at mid-term, and week 23, 30 and 40 of pregnancy. During
      maternity leave the women will be asked to respond to questionnaires at 1 month, 3 months, 6
      months and 12 months post-delivery.
