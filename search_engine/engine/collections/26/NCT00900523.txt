        -  Determine the level of prostaglandin E_2 metabolite (PGE-M) in 24-hour urine samples
           collected prior to surgery or chemotherapy from patients with ovarian cancer.

        -  Determine cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression by western
           blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in ovarian tumor tissue samples and matched normal
           ovarian tissue samples, if available, from these patients.

        -  Correlate urine PGE-M levels with corresponding tissue COX-1 and COX-2 levels in urine
           and tissue samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients submit 24-hour urine specimens prior to surgery for evaluation of urinary levels of
      prostaglandin E_2 metabolite (PGE-M).

      Patients also undergo assessment of tissue obtained at the time of surgery, including ovarian
      tumor tissue, normal surface ovarian epithelium tissue (if available), and fixed tissue
      embedded in a paraffin block. Tissue samples are analyzed by western blot and IHC for
      cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 expression.
