      treatment. However their use is associated with a lot of undesirable effects. From this comes
      the idea of using opioid free anesthesia intra-operatively in an attempt to decrease opioids
      postoperative use and accordingly, their associated side effects.

      Intravenous (IV) lidocaine has been found to have analgesic, antihyperalgesic, and
      anti-inflammatory properties. It was found to significantly improve postoperative pain, when
      its intraoperative use was compared with placebo .

      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-two adrenergic receptor agonist that has
      antinociceptive, analgesic, opioid sparing and sedative properties. Similar to lidocaine,
      dexmedetomidine was shown to lower postoperative pain, opioid consumption and accordingly,
      opioid related side effects.
