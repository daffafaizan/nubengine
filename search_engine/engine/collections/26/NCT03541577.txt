      long-term clinical outcomes and reduced costs compared with angiography-guided coronary
      revascularization alone. Current guidelines emphasize the measurement of FFR as the standard
      of reference when determining the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis in
      stable patients when evidence of ischemia is not available (class IA indication). But FFR is
      still underutilized in clinical practice. One of the reasons may be the difficulty in
      manipulating the Pressure Wire.

      TruePhysioTM Microcatheter is a novel device for evaluating the functional significance of
      coronary stenosis, which may simplify FFR measurements by allowing the use of standard
      guidewires best suited to negotiating the patients' anatomy. This study is a prospective,
      open label, multi-center study with the purpose of comparing the differences, if any, between
      FFR measured by the TruePhysioTM Microcatheter and Pressure Wire. The secondary purpose is to
      analyze the correlation between FFR measured by the TruePhysioTM Microcatheter and Pressure
      Wire. A total of 239 patients will be recruited at 4 centers in China.
