        1. intensity-modulated radiotherapy of whole pelvis: 60 Gy in 30 fx Re-simulation with
           pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging at 46 Gy in 23 fx and intensity-modulated radiotherapy
           on the gross cervical and nodal tumor (initially Positron emission tomography-positive),
           14 Gy in 7 fx

        2. intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost of gross cervical tumor or Intra-cavitary
           radiotherapy (ICR)

             -  Re-staging pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging , if complete response occurs
                Intra-cavitary radiotherapy to A point, 25 Gy in 5 fx for 2 weeks

             -  Re-staging pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging I, partial response or stable disease
                occurs intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost , 10 Gy in 4 fx to the gross cervical
                tumor for 1 week
