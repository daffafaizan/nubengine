      mean= 14.0 +- 2.4). Teeth were randomly assigned to the incremental filling technique (Filtek
      Z230/Vitremer, 3M-ESPE, n = 31) or high viscosity bulk fill technique (Filtek Bulk Fill
      Posterior, 3M-ESPE, n = 37). The restorations were clinically evaluated at baseline, 12 and
      24 months by two independent raters using modified United States Public Health Service
      criteria. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney and Friedman
      non-parametric tests, and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis.
