      is expected to continuously rise within Canada. The MASCC Oral agent Teaching Tool (MOATT)
      interventional tool relies on the concept of improved patient education in turn leading to
      improved adherence. Although the MOATT intervention is currently endorsed by Cancer Care
      Ontario, there is no data using the MOATT intervention in patients with myeloma or within
      Canada. Prior to embarking on a larger, multi-center study, a pilot study is necessary to 1)
      understand the feasibility, acceptability of the MOATT intervention and its preliminary
      efficacy 2) to determine the rates of adherence to OMT and explore factors associated with
      non-adherence and 3) to determine the feasibility of a larger multi-centre trial.
