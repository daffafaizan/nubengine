      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa vs epoetin alfa for anemia in patients with
           non-myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to screening hemoglobin concentration (less than 10.0 g/dL vs 10.0-11.0 g/dL) and
      type of concurrent chemotherapy (platinum-based vs non-platinum-based). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive darbepoetin alfa subcutaneously (SC) every other week for 12
           weeks (i.e., on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive epoetin alfa SC once weekly for 12 weeks. Patients are followed
           at 1 and 3 weeks .

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 6 months.
