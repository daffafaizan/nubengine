      Methotrexate, an anti-folate drug, is a widely accepted and commonly used DMARD for the
      treatment of PsA. Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor, and relatively new drug for this condition.

      Aims:

      To assess and compare safety and efficacy of Tofacitinib and Methotrexate in the treatment of
      PsA.

      Methodology:

      This open label, randomized, prospective study was conducted in Department of Rheumatology,
      BSMMU, Dhaka for 1½ years from September, 2017 to February, 2019. 61 patients, aged >18 years
      with the diagnosis of PsA for ≥3 months were randomized into two groups. 29 patients
      (Tofacitinib 5mg BD) and 32 patients (MTX from 15 mg/week to 25 mg/week over 1 month) were
      enrolled and followed-up at the end of 1, 3 and 6 months. Primary endpoint was ACR 20
      response at the end of 3 months. Patients who achieved treatment target on the basis of DAPSA
      score at the end of 3 months were allowed to continue previuos treatment and assessed for
      safety and efficacy till 6 months. Patients not achieving treatment target in Tofacitinib
      group were put on Tofacitinib 10 mg BD and in MTX group were put on Tofacitinib 5 mg BD.
      These patients were followed-up for safety and efficacy at the end of 6 months. Secondary
      outcome measures were EULAR response, 66/68 joints SJC/TJC, VAS for pain, ESR, CRP, DAPSA,
      DAS28, PASI, PASI 75 response, MASES and HAQ-DI. Safety assessment was done on the basis of
      clinical history, examination and laboratory findings at each follow-up. Ethical clearance
      was obtained from IRB, BSMMU at the beginning. Statistical analysis was done using chi-square
      test, Fisher's exact test, paired sample t-test and independent sample t-test. Missing data
      were dealt with intention to treat (ITT) analysis.
