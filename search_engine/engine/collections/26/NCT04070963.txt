    
      The study aims to determine the incidence of undiagnosed and poorly controlled diabetes among
      surgical patients in Singapore using preoperative HbA1c as a screening tool.

      The investigators aim to follow up on the incidence of perioperative complications in this
      cohort. In the longer term, the investigators hope to evaluate the role of a preoperative
      diabetic screening and intervention program as an opportunistic "teachable moment" for
      surgical patients. This may help to achieve greater control of the disease burden in
      Singapore.

      Specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To establish the incidence of undiagnosed diabetes/prediabetes among surgical
      patients in Singapore, based on HbA1c level ≥ 6.1% prior to surgery Specific Aim 2: To
      establish the incidence of poorly-controlled diabetes among surgical patients in Singapore,
      based on HbA1c level ≥ 8% prior to surgery Specific Aim 3: To identify and characterize any
      association between preoperative HbA1c level and postoperative outcomes
