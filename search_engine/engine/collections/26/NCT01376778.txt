      congenitally infected infants in the U.S. per year. A substantial proportion of these infants
      will die or suffer permanent injury as a result of their infection. The severity of
      congenital infection is greatest with primary maternal CMV infection. Currently, there is no
      proven method of preventing congenital CMV infection, and the approach to primary maternal
      CMV infection in the United States is haphazard and ineffective. One small, non-randomized
      study suggests that maternal administration of CMV hyperimmune globulin may significantly
      reduce the rate of congenital CMV infection following maternal primary infection. The MFMU
      CMV Trial will address the primary research question: does maternal administration of CMV
      hyperimmune globulin lower the rate of congenital CMV infection among the offspring of women
      who have been diagnosed with primary CMV infection during early pregnancy?

      The research study is funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child
      Health and Human Development (NICHD). Sixteen medical centers across the country are
      participating in this research study. In all, 800 pregnant women who are identified with a
      primary CMV infection will be enrolled in this research study. The children of these women
      will be evaluated and tested at one and two years of age.
