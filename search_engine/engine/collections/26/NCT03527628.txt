      substituted with Cyclophosphamide (ACVD cycle) in patients with a PET-2 negative. All
      advanced stage HL patients will receive 2 cycles of the standard treatment ABVD and assessed
      with PET-2 scan.

      Knowing that Cyclophosphamide toxicities include cytopenias, amenorrhea and male infertility.
      These toxicities are mainly dependent on the total cumulative dose. Doses less than 4 g/m2
      are not associated with sterility or major toxicity, doses higher than this can lead to
      azoospermia which was reversible in many cases therefore the cumulative dose will be used in
      this study is 3200 mg. Additionally, Brentuximab Vedotin has shown significant activity in
      relapsed refractory HL with minor toxicities.

      PET scan after 2 cycles of ABVD has proven to be an excellent tool to identify patients that
      will have long term PFS of 95% when it is negative and only progression-free survival (PFS)
      of less than 15% when it is positive.

      The primary endpoint of the study will be to assess the overall 3-Y PFS of the entire cohort
      of patients.
