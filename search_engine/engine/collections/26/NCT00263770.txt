      disorder which is increasingly recognized by health care providers and lay people alike as an
      important factor in impaired daytime executive function as well as cardiovascular disease
      risk. Along with an increase in its recognition and diagnosis have come a growing pool of
      patients with milder disease and the associated challenge of ideal management. Positive
      airway pressure (PAP) is well established as the mainstay of treatment for OSA since it is
      effective at reversing daytime neurocognitive sequelae and may be a useful adjunct to therapy
      in those with cardiovascular disease coexisting with OSA. In patients with mild OSA, however,
      the response to PAP therapy appears muted, which is related in part to poor adherence to
      treatment. In response, a number of alternative treatments have evolved. The most recent
      innovation is soft palatal implants, which, in non-randomized, uncontrolled studies have
      demonstrated reasonable efficacy in the treatment of snoring and mild to moderate OSA. How
      the implants compare with standard therapy and their effect on cardiovascular variables are
      unknown. Because of the ease and rapidity with which this system is implanted, and because
      treatment effect is independent of patient compliance, there is high potential for widespread
      use in patients with milder OSA. We therefore are conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial to compare the impact of palatal implants with PAP on sleep disordered
      breathing, daytime symptoms and blood pressure, as well as patient / bed partner acceptance.
