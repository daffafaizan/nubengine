    
      A comparative, prospective, randomized study.

      Study objectives: Comparison between study groups of the assigned study treatment's effect on
      the rate of wound healing, cost per episode of care, severity of wound pain, and the
      occurrence of adverse events.

      Subject recruitment: Consecutive, prospective subjects admitted to the study site will be
      screened for study enrollment and potential randomization. Prospective data will be collected
      on study subjects until at least 10 subjects are randomized into each of three treatment
      groups: MIST Therapy; NPWT; or MIST Therapy and NPWT.

      Protocol and procedures: All randomized subjects will continue to receive standard of care
      treatment appropriate for their wound for the duration of their study treatment regardless of
      their assigned treatment group. Subjects will continue to receive assigned study treatment as
      long as their wound continues to show improvement, as determined by the investigator. Study
      treatment will continue until wound closure, or for up to 6 weeks without wound closure. A
      baseline evaluation will include a medical history assessment, VAS pain score, wound history
      and evaluation including: wound dimension measurements, overall wound assessment, digital
      photography, and appropriate sharp debridement, if necessary. Weekly wound assessments will
      include a wound evaluation, digital photography and VAS pain score. Prospective data will
      also be collected on specific wound care supplies and interventions provided. These data will
      be tracked as interventions occur while the wound continues to be treated with the assigned
      study treatment. Economic data will include type, quantity, duration, associated frequency,
      and professional time requirements.
