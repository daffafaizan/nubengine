      fluorescent tracking microspheres called CIVO GLO that mark the sites of drug microdose
      injection, enabling rapid assessment of multiple oncology drugs or drug combinations
      simultaneously within a patient's tumor. Tumor responses to cancer treatments are highly
      context-specific and often involve complex interactions between the anti-cancer therapy,
      genetically diverse tumor cells, and a heterogeneous TME. This complexity is rarely modeled
      accurately in preclinical translational models of cancer. By utilizing intratumoral microdose
      injections with CIVO in advance of scheduled surgical intervention, this study will evaluate
      anti-cancer therapies directly in patients each with their own unique tumor genomic profile,
      intact TME, and immune system functional status. Because the platform delivers microdose
      amounts of each test agent or combination directly into the patient's tumor tissue,
      hypotheses can be tested earlier in the drug development process, consistent with the goals
      of the 2006 FDA Exploratory IND Guidance for Industry.

      The CIVO device penetrates solid tumors and simultaneously delivers subtherapeutic microdoses
      of up to eight anti-cancer agents or combinations of anti-cancer agents co-injected with CIVO
      GLO into discrete regions of the tumor as drug columns. At the time of the planned surgical
      intervention (at least four hours to up to seven days after the CIVO microdose injection),
      the injected tumor tissue is then excised and tumor responses are assessed via histological
      staining of tumor cross-sections sampled perpendicular to each injection column. Co-injection
      with CIVO GLO enables identification of each injection site during resection as well as in
      tissues stained for analysis. This Phase 0 Master Protocol is aimed at distinguishing
      promising candidates earlier in the drug development process while also avoiding systemic
      toxicities associated with typical clinical exposures to these therapies.
