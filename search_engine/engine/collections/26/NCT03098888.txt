        -  assess the frequency of poor quality bronchoalveolar lavages (as defined by either more
           than 5% bronchial epithelial cell count to less than 50,000 alveolar cells per mL)

        -  assess the contribution of a given bronchoalveolar lavage to the diagnostic work up

        -  assess the contribution of a given bronchoalveolar lavage results to therapeutic
           decision

        -  assess the induced short term respiratory side effects

        -  identify risk factors for poor respiratory tolerance
