    
      This study is based on the combined application of sub-occipital muscle inhibition technique
      associated with interferential electrotherapy improves symptoms in patients with tension type
      headache and cervicogenic headache.

      The purposes of this study are:

        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of treatment based on the combined application of
           sub-occipital muscle inhibition technique associated with interferential electrotherapy
           in patients with tension type headache.

        -  Evaluate the effects of treatment caused in upper cervical movement.

        -  Evaluate the effects of treatment caused in neck pain.

        -  Evaluate the effects of treatment caused in headache.
