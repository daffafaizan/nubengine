      among newborns admitted for treatment of jaundice at 5 regional centers in Nigeria and
      identifies social/behavioral/medical factors associated with ABE. Information gained in phase
      1 identified high risk sub-populations and guided selection of instructional materials for
      phase 2. Core data sheets submitted monthly by participating centers included clinical data,
      demographic information, number of antenatal clinic visits, birth place (hospital, clinic,
      home) and attendant, distance from care centers and reasons for delay, if any, in seeking
      care. Receipt of jaundice instruction by mothers is self-reported. Statistical analysis
      includes Chi square and logistic regression analysis of risk factors. Sample size: 1,000
      subjects in each phase are required to demonstrate a 20% decrease in disease prevalence
      (baseline ABE incidence anticipated to be 15% of jaundiced babies) at 95% confidence level.
