    
      Group 1 will assess pharmacokinetics, Group 2 will assess pharmacodynamics. PK interim
      analysis to determine requirement for PK extension.

      Group 1 (PK) blood sampling and safety assessments up to 36 hours post-dose for 3 study
      periods. Results from PK stage will determine if Group 2 (PD) is required. Group 2 (PD) will
      assess LABA only effects (as confirmed in interim analysis).

      Group 2 (PD) to include 2 overnight stays for 5 study periods. Volunteers will receive a

      Study treatments are fluticasone/formoterol BAI, fluticasone/formoterol pMDI with/without
      spacer, formoterol alone without spacer, and low dose fluticasone/formoterol without spacer.

      Volunteers will undergo blood sampling, and safety assessments up to the morning of
      discharge. An inspiratory flow recorder (IPR) will be used for training and to monitor
