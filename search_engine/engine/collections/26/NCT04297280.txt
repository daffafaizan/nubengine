      hepatocellular carcinoma. Early randomized trials suggested that TACE can be accepted as the
      standard treatment for advanced stage disease. However, outcome of patients treated with TACE
      in real-life cohorts is still very poor.

      Recent studies have also supported a safe combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with
      TACE. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE
      combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
