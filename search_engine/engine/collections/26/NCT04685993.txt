      drug, to subjects with NASH who have completed the LPCN 1144-18-002 protocol. Enrolled
      subjects will be given LPCN 1144 for up to 36 weeks. Subjects will be seen periodically to
      evaluate safety clinical laboratory tests, tolerability of LPCN 1144, adverse events, and
      overall subject health. Subjects will be given the option of having a liver biopsy performed
      at Week 36.
