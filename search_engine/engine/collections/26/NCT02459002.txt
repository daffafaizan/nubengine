    
      Advanced lung cancer (ALC) will be assessed for participant outcomes in a sample which is
      prior initiation of palliative consultation and in a sample after the initiation of early
      palliative consultation.

      Study goals are:

      I. To determine the differences in participant outcomes including quality of life (QOL);
      symptom distress [Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS)] and caregiver outcomes [Zarit
      Burden Interview {ZBI}, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale(HADS) and FAMCARE] at week 12
      in advanced lung cancer (ALC) patients receiving early palliative care consultation versus
      those who don't.

      II. Identify the cellular, molecular, and immune basis for the development of symptoms in
      patients with ALC.
