      fibrillation. Linear ablation is frequently used in the procedure for persistent atrial
      fibrillation. Multiple studies have shown benefit of linear ablation. However, it has a
      limitation because of technical difficulty. Incomplete block is common and an important cause
      of atrial tachycardia.

      Contact-force (CF) monitoring during procedure has recently been available. This technology
      appears to significantly decrease procedure time and short term reconnection incidence in
      pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. It also helped to resolve the cause of PV reconnection. Some
      reports demonstrated that the association between reconnection and lower CF value.

      Linear ablation has more variation to interrupt block and reconnection was more often than PV
      isolation. The association between CF values and successful linear block has not been
      revealed yet. In addition, the investigators aim to the effectiveness and safety of linear
      ablation by using CF sensing catheter.
