    
      Subjects requiring cesarean delivery and without exclusion criteria will be informed by the
      obstetrical team about the study and asked for permission to contact the study personnel.
      Written informed consent will be obtained by person-to-person contact. The research staff
      will be responsible for the informed consent.

      Subjects who agree to participate in the study will be randomized to one of the two groups
      below in a 1/1 allocation:

        -  Standard Wound Care: Wound dressing and care as per our current practice. Compression
           dressing consisting of gauze, tefla and adhesive tape will be placed intraoperatively.
           Dressing will be removed after 24 hours from surgery completion and subjects will have
           an absorption pad with overlying garments for the remaining postoperative days until
           standard postoperative visit for wound check.

        -  CHG Wound Care: ReliaTectâ„¢ Post-Op Dressing will be applied as per the manufacturer's
           instructions (Appendix A) intraoperatively. The dressing will be in place until the
           postoperative clinic visit on postoperative day 7.

      The remainder of the subjects' care will be similar for both arms and will follow current
      standard clinical practice at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).
