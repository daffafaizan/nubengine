      in English To evaluate the functionality. DASI was used primarily to assess patients with
      cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial ischemia,
      and infarction. In clinical practice, DASI can be used to know the effects of medical
      treatments and cardiac rehabilitation and to assist clinical decisions In controlled clinical
      trials, DASI can also be used to assess interventions and as a component for assessing the
      costs/benefits of treatment.

      Studies demonstrated that DASI is characterized as a questionnaire with good functional
      ability, evidence of validity, usefulness, and great clinical and scientific applicability,
      it seems to be a useful tool for evaluating cardiac patients. So, to be used with Brazilian
      CVD patients it is necessary to validate DASI and verify its psychometric properties in this
      population.
