      breast cancer risk and genetic testing for inherited cancer risk. These methods include
      providing printed educational materials, using an educational computer program, and using the
      computer program with the assistance of a lay health worker (a promotora).

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire that will ask
      about your personal health as well as your knowledge and attitudes toward cancer and genetic
      testing. After the questionnaire is completed, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll
      of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. One group will be asked to read educational materials.
      Another group will use an educational computer program to learn about breast cancer risk and
      genetic testing without guidance. Another group will use the computer program with the
      guidance of a promotora.

      Each of the 3 study groups should take between 30 and 60 minutes to complete.

      Immediately after participating in your assigned group, you will be asked to complete another
      questionnaire that will ask about your knowledge and attitudes toward cancer and genetic
      testing. You will also be contacted later by telephone to complete similar questionnaires at
      about 1 month and 6 months after your study visit. Some women will be asked to complete an
      additional questionnaire by telephone 1 week after reading the educational materials or the
      computer program, and researchers will ask for permission to audiotape this interview. It
      will take about 20 minutes to complete each of the questionnaires used in this study.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 414 women will take part in this study.
