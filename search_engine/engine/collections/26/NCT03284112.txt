      underestimate personal dementia risk; minority populations are more likely to have low
      dementia literacy and be unaware of it. Cultural dementia belief in minority groups are
      complex and pose barriers to diagnosis, with dementia symptoms being considered a part of
      normal aging, or that discussion may be taboo even when recognized. A key barrier to timely
      AD diagnosis in African Americans is delayed physician contact, often years-long, following
      the onset of first symptoms. Despite studies demonstrating that dementia concepts first
      develop in elementary school periods, apart from our work, no dementia awareness programs
      focus on children. This intervention therefore addresses a major gap regarding optimal
      approaches for shifting cultural perceptions of dementia in low-income minority populations
      and reducing barriers to its timely diagnosis.
