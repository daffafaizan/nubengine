      experimental conditions: (1) control, (2) dress for success (low effort), and (2) exercise
      for success (high effort). The investigators' hypothesis is that incentivizing a low effort,
      indirect/workout-related behavior (i.e., "dressing for success") will be more effective in
      motivating workouts than the control, despite a lack of economic incentive for the workout
      itself. Additionally, the investigators will compare workout levels for groups 2 and 3; if
      there is no difference between the two groups (or if 2 has higher exercise rates than 3),
      this would suggest that indirect incentives may be as effective as direct ones.
