      to the tumor tissues of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), so they could be ablated
      and detached from the surface.

      The patients who are suffering from NMIBC will be randomly allocated into two groups: The
      first group (control group): 25 patients will be exposed to sham treatment before
      transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) without using LESW therapy. The second group
      (LESW group): 25 patients will be exposed to LESW therapy before TURBT. The shock wave
      applicator (Dornier AR2, shock wave device, Dornier MedTech 2010, Wessling, Germany) will be
      gently placed directly on the ultrasound transmission gel over the skin surface of the
      suprapubic region above the urinary bladder at the site of the papillary lesion (US guided)
      and at other five points. Points 1 and 2 will be at the level of transverse crease 2 cm above
      the pubic bone and 5 cm from each, points 3 and 4 will 2 cm above points 1 and 2, and point 5
      will be centered of points 1-4. A total of 2000 pulses at 0.25 mJ/mm2 will be delivered with
      a frequency of 3 pulses per second. The position of the shock wave applicator will be changed
      after every 400 pulses.

      The apoptotic effect of LESW will be studied via histopathological examination for the type
      of bladder tumor, pathological stage, grade, association of carcinoma in situ and
      morphological features of apoptosis in terms of compaction of the nuclear chromatin
      (pyknosis), loss of cellular volume and chromatin condensation on the nuclear envelope
      (nuclear crescents), Immunohistochemical analysis of anti-caspase-3 antibody and molecular
      studies of Bax (an apoptotic promotor), BCL-2 and Survivin (apoptotic inhibitors) Relative
      Gene Expression in the resected bladder tissues.

      The patients will receive intravesical chemotherapy or BCG immunotherapy and they will be
      followed up at outpatient clinic for two years by MRI, outpatient cystoscopy and cytology to
      identify the recurrence and progression rate of NMIBC.
