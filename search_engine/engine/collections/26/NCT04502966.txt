      enrolled) with moderate to severe seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic sensitization to
      grass pollen. Eligible participants who demonstrate a positive response defined by a Total
      Nasal Symptom Score [TNSS] ≥ 5 (Scale 0-12 in response to a Nasal Allergen Challenge [NAC]
      with grass pollen extract), will be randomized to one of the following 3 groups in a 1:1:1
      ratio:

        -  Grass allergen sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) + dupilumab (n=36)

        -  Grass allergen SLIT +dupilumab placebo (n=36)

        -  Grass allergen SLIT placebo + dupilumab placebo (n=36)

      Grazax® is a sublingual grass allergen immunotherapy product approved for clinical use in the
      United Kingdom and will be used as SLIT in this study. Grazax (and its matching placebo) will
      be self-administered daily by participants for a duration of two years.

      Dupixent®is the brand name for dupilumab and is a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin
      4 (IL-4) receptor. Dupilumab (and its matching placebo) will be administered every two weeks
      by subcutaneous injection through for a duration of two years, administered by study
      personnel. The treatment phase of two years will be followed by an observation phase of 1
      year.
