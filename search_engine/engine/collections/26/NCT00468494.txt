      control before, during and after surgery with patient variables, surgical variables and
      anesthetic variables. Serum glucose levels will be measured preoperatively and then at 30
      minute intervals during surgery. Pain score, pain medication and glucose levels will be
      measured in the post anesthesia recovery room. Subjects will be contacted 2 weeks following
      the date of surgery to determine the incidence of postoperative complications.
