      to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death. Breast surgery is commonly performed as a part of
      the management of breast cancer, is associated with considerable acute postoperative pain.
      Ultrasound guided Regional anesthesia is recommended to be a part of multimodal analgesia in
      order to manage the acute post-operative pain. New techniques are proposed to give adequate
      control of postoperative analgesia with less opioid needs in the first day postoperative.
      They include pectoralis nerve modified pectoralis, and erector spinae blocks.

      The investigators will compare Modified pectoralis nerve block (Pecs II) plus transversus
      thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block versus Erector spinae block on morphine consumption during
      first 24 h following modified radical mastectomy.
