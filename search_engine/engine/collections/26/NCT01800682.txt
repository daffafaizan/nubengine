    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      randomized (study drug assigned by chance), and 3-way crossover (method used to switch
      participants from one study group to another in a clinical trial) study of tramadol
      extended-release (ER). All participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 possible
      treatment sequences of tramadol. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (within 20 days
      before study commences on Day -1); Open-label treatment (consisting of 3 single-dose
      treatment periods separated with washout period of 4-14 days, and dosing will be under
      fasting conditions on Day 1 in each treatment period); and Follow-up (up to 48-hour blood
      sample collection on Day 3 of Period 3). The duration of study is anticipated to be 6-8 weeks
      per participant. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
