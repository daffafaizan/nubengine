      methods for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA). Digital patient journey solution has potential to enhance adherence to preoperative
      preparation and postoperative rehabilitation, and further improve patient experience, while
      reducing potential adverse events.

      The purpose of this study is to assess a digital patient journey solution developed for
      patients undergoing elective hip and knee arthroplasty. The digital solution aims to support
      patient's preparation to and recovery from a hip and knee arthroplasty through provision of
      timely information and support related to preoperative preparation and postoperative
      rehabilitation. The information on the application is aligned with the patient's individual
      needs and requirements, and contains exercises to be completed daily for the duration of the
      program.
