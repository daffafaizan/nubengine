      lower protection in the elderly. Here we hypothesize that this is due to intrinsic defects in
      innate responses to the live attenuated virus, which translates into sub-optimal functional
      adaptive immune responses. Therefore, early innate signatures of vaccination should correlate
      with, and predict the immunogenicity of Zoster vaccine in the young and elderly.

      STUDY DESIGN: Double center, open label study in which adult healthy volunteers will be
      vaccinated with Zoster vaccine. Blood samples will be collected on day D-30 (pre-
      vaccination) D0 (at vaccination) and D1, D3, D7, D14, D30, D90 and D180 (post vaccination) to
      study innate and adaptive immunity responses. Even though Zoster vaccine is considered safe,
      volunteers are asked to report and record any local or systemic AEs for 7 days
      post-vaccination. Also AEs will be reported for 30 days post-vaccination any SAE for 180 days
      post vaccination. AEs developing the day of the blood draw will also be reported
