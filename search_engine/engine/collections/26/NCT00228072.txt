      hair-bearing area of the axilla. This technique is associated with a risk of impaired wound
      healing, infections, wide scars and a risk of impairment in the movement of the arm (seldom).

      A new technique suction-curettage, much alike the liposuction technique, in which the dermis
      is curettage from a sub-dermal approach with a cutting and sucking devise, may be promising
      in regard to recovery and cosmetic appearance postoperatively, but the effect of the sweat
      production is not well known. This study compares liposuction vs. standard excision in
      individuals with isolated excessive isolated axillary sweating randomized to treatment with
      one of each technique in both axillas.
