    
      Injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most common injuries of the
      knee. Since May 2016, patients with proximal ruptures of the ACL have been treated with
      direct repair and InternalBraceTM Ligament Augmentation at the University Hospital of Basel.

      The remodelling of hamstring grafts used for ACL reconstruction is completed at the earliest
      2 years after the surgery. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical, biomechanical and
      functional outcome 2 years after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair and InternalBraceTM
      augmentation now in direct comparison to ACL reconstruction and to identify potential
      deficits compared to the contralateral healthy side as well as with a knee-healthy
      age-matched collective. In addition, socio-economic aspects such as return to work and sports
      and treatment cost will be compared between both techniques.
