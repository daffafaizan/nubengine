      for reading, driving and recognizing faces) is colored an intense yellow due to the
      deposition of two carotenoid compounds, lutein and zeaxanthin. These xanthophyll carotenoids
      are derived exclusively from the diet, and are hypothesized to protect the macula from
      light-induced oxidative damage by virtue of their light-screening and antioxidant properties.

      Epidemiological studies have shown that high dietary intake and blood levels of lutein and
      zeaxanthin are associated with lower rates of vision loss due to age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD).

      It is of interest to correlate carotenoid levels in the eye and skin tissues with blood
      levels of carotenoid compounds.
