      produced by individuals attending a TB clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Bioaerosol sampling
      will be performed on all eligible individuals presenting with symptoms indicative of TB and
      repeated at 14 days if initially positive for viable Mtb. Participants will be classified
      into three distinct groups based on the National TB Control Program (NTBCP) criteria: Group
      A, TB notification with sputum-based laboratory confirmation; Group B, TB notification with
      empiric diagnosis; and Group C, individuals not notified. Group C individuals with detectable
      Mtb bioaerosol will be monitored until resolution of clinical and laboratory status.
      Collection of bioaerosol specimens will be via two consecutive sampling modalities: (1)
      direct sampling of a specific respiratory manoeuvre; and (2) indirect sampling following
      passive respiratory activity and environmental sampling. microscopy. Mtb genomes and
      mycobacterial and host lipids will be detected using droplet digital PCR and mass
      spectrometry analyses, respectively. The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of
      Mtb bioaerosols in all TB clinic attendees and in each of the mutually exclusive groups A, B
      and C. Secondary objectives are to investigate differences in prevalence of Mtb bioaerosol by
      HIV status, current isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) use and pre and post initiation of
      anti-TB chemotherapy.
