      patient outcome, suggesting that greater intensivist coverage might be better still. However,
      the effects of 24-hour intensivist coverage in ICUs are unknown. In FY11, leadership of the
      Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) decided to roll-out a program for partial
      night-coverage of the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). In light of this natural
      experiment, the investigators propose to study the comparative effectiveness of nocturnal
      intensivist staffing in the HUP Medical Intensive Care Unit. To do so, the investigators
      propose a randomized clinical trial comparing the presence of a nocturnal intensivist
      (in-hospital call) to a traditional model of nocturnal coverage with an intensivist available
      by phone (home call) in the HUP MICU, with respect to patient-centered outcomes and resource
      utilization. The investigators will randomly assign seven consecutive days (Monday through
      Sunday) at a time to in-hospital or home call, in two-week blocks. The investigators will
      conduct primary analyses of all patients admitted during night hours and secondary analyses
      of various subgroups of patients admitted during night hours as well as all patients admitted
      during any time of day during the study period from September, 2011, to June, 2011.

      A sub-study designed to measure sleep and work duration, sleepiness, and attention in Daytime
      Intensivists (faculty and fellows) during their medical ICU rotation will be conducted. The
      variables measured will be compared between periods with and without in-house nocturnal
      intensivist staffing. All fellows and faculty who rotate through the medical ICU during this
      study period, Jan 2012 to Dec 2012 will be approached for possible recruitment.
