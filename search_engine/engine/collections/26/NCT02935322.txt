      and sodium fluoride (NaF) during a 4-day period of non-brushing and a 6-week period of
      brushing. Two studies were designed as double-blind, randomized, cross-over clinical trials.
      In study I, 16 healthy subjects rinsed twice daily for 1 min during 4 days of no tooth
      brushing with four mouthrinse solutions: 1) 0.12% CHX + 0.2% NaF, 2) 0.2% NaF, 3) 0.12% CHX,
      and 4) placebo. In study 2, 16 healthy subjects rinsed with the same four solutions twice
      daily after tooth brushing during a 6-week period. Primary outcomes were plaque formation and
      gingivitis. Secondary outcomes were fluoride retention and microbiological parameters in
      plaque and saliva (total bacterial counts and mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and
      streptococci sanguinis counts). One way analyses of variance with post hoc
      Student-Newman-KeulÂ´s statistical test was performed for comparisons between mouthrinses.
      Intragroup changes over time were analyzed with a paired t-test.
