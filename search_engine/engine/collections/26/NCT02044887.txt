    
      Methodology: Design: Clinical, multicentric and randomized trial. A simple random sampling to
      select 134 patients diagnosed with dementia will be carried out. After contacting their
      relatives, his/her participation in the trial will be requested. A basal assessment will be
      made and the participants will be assigned to control or intervention group (1:1). Variables:
      The main measure will be the assessment of PA (pedometer and 7-Day PAR) in patients and
      caregivers. In patients: ADAS-cog, functional degree and cardiovascular risk. In caregivers:
      cardiovascular risk, general health and quality of life.

      INTERVENTION: For 3 months, participants will receive instructions to do PA with an adapted
      PA program. This program will be designed and applied by Primary Health Care professionals in
      patients with dementia and caregivers. The control group will receive regular care.

      ANALYSIS: An intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out by comparing the observed
      differences between basal, 6 and 12 months measures. Change in the mean of daily steps
      assessed with the pedometer and 7-day PAR will If the main hypothesis is confirmed , it could
      be useful to improve the cardiovascular risk of all of them , as well as the cognitive state
      of patients with dementia..
