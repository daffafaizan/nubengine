        -  To determine the activity, safety, and feasibility of gemcitabine hydrochloride and
           cisplatin in combination with sunitinib malate as first-line therapy in patients with
           locally advanced and/or metastatic transitional carcinoma of the urothelium.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, cisplatin IV
      over 3-4 hours on day 1, and oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 2-15. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months and 1 year.
