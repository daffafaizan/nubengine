      efficacy of ranibizumab treatment administered in subjects with radiation retinopathy.
      Subjects will be randomized into one of 3 arms; intravitreal (IVT) monthly vs. ranibizumab
      treatment administered IVT monthly combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation vs.
      ranibizumab treatment administered IVT for three months followed by as needed treatment of
      ranibizumab combined with peripheral targeted photocoagulation over 48 weeks. From week 52 to
      week 101, all 3 treatment arms will employ a treat and extend protocol for IVT ranibizumab
      treatment.
