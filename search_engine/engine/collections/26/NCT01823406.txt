      diabetes with and without microvascular complications and to understand intrinsic differences
      from non-diabetics in metabolite levels and flux.

      The hypothesis is that diabetic complications arise from tissue-specific metabolic
      reprogramming resulting in alterations in fuel utilization which lead to dysfunction of the
      tissue. To test this hypothesis, we will use sensitive and specific mass spectrometer based
      metabolomic analysis to measure steady state metabolite levels in plasma and urine from
      controls subjects and subjects with T1DM, without and with diabetic complications during
      euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies.
