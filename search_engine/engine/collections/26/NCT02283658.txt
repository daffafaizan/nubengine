      I. Demonstrate that the combination of letrozole and everolimus leads to a higher percentage
      of patients who are free of progression at 12 weeks (PFS 12) as compared with that observed
      in a previously reported phase 2 trial of letrozole alone for relapsed ovarian carcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Cancer antigen (CA)-125 response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
      the confirmed response rate, and adverse events.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify molecular biomarkers associated with a response to treatment with letrozole and
      everolimus in patients with relapsed ovarian carcinomas.

      II. Develop and determine if response rates to letrozole and everolimus in patient derived
      xenograft (PDX) avatars correlate to responses noted in the patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) and letrozole PO QD on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
