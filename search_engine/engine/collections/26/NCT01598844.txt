    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of the
      CE-marked JenaValve System Transapical in an elderly patient population with severe aortic
      stenosis and/or aortic insufficiency who are at high risk for open surgical aortic valve
      replacement.

      The target study population will consist of elderly patients suffering from severe
      symptomatic degenerative aortic valve stenosis and/or aortic insufficiency who show an
      increased risk for an open aortic valve replacement surgery due to existing co-morbidities.
