      to develop, test, and implement novel treatments and care delivery models that address
      barriers to effective pain management and that can be practicably applied in VA primary care
      settings for chronic low back pain (CLBP). The CAMEO trial is a 2-arm randomized clinical
      trial to compare the effectiveness of pharmacological vs. behavioral approaches for CLBP.

      The investigators' study sample will include 450 Veterans with moderate to severe CLBP
      despite long-term opioid therapy. Patients from five primary care clinics at the Roudebush VA
      Medical Center and two community based outpatient clinics will be recruited to participate in
      CAMEO and randomized to one of two treatment arms. The pharmacological arm will involve
      guideline-concordant opioid management coupled with algorithm-based co-analgesic treatment
      (PHARM). Patients in the behavioral arm (BEH) will receive pain self-management/coping skills
      training. The trial will last 12-months and all participants will undergo comprehensive
      outcome assessments at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      Study Aims: Among Veterans with chronic low back pain refractory to long-term opioid therapy

        1. To compare the interventions' (PHARM vs. BEH) effects on pain intensity and function at
           6 months (primary end point) and 12 months (sustained effect)

        2. To compare the interventions' effects (PHARM vs. BEH) on other relevant outcomes

             -  Patient global impression of change

             -  Health-related quality of life

             -  Opioid dose

        3. To compare the cost-effectiveness of the interventions
