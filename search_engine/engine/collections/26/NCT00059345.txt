      at the time of the encounter. Phase 1 of this study identified patient-related determinants
      of placebo response, such as beliefs and expectations toward treatment of knee OA with
      acupuncture. Phase 2 of the study evaluated an assessment tool to measure these determinants.
      Phase 3 of the study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether placebo effects in
      patients with knee OA can be enhanced by the acupuncturists' communicative style, which can
      affect a patient's cognitive expectancies and beliefs.

      Patients will initially be randomized to one of two groups, each with a different model for
      practitioner-patient interaction. Acupuncture practitioners will be trained to follow
      semi-structured communicative styles, including traditional approaches in Chinese medicine
      and techniques previously described in patient-doctor communications studies. Within each of
      these groups, patients will be further randomized to receive either acupuncture or sham
      acupuncture. Patients will have 6 weeks of biweekly treatment visits. Patients will be
      followed for 6 months. Visits will be weekly during the first 6 weeks of the study and
      monthly thereafter.

      The study will also include a natural cohort group composed of patients on a study waiting
      list; these patients will be offered acupuncture 3 months after study entry.
