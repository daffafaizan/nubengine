      receive 500mg of curcumin orally twice daily for 12 weeks. Colposcopies will be performed at
      the participants' baseline, 6 week, and 12 week visits. Two biopsies will be performed at the
      baseline and 12 week visit, and if there is suspicion for cancer formation or invasion, at
      the 6-week visit. One sample will be used for histologic examination, while the other sample
      will be used for p65 assays. Based on the biopsy, if cancer is present, then the patient will
      be referred to gynecologic oncology for further care and the trial will be terminated. At the
      end of the 12 week period, if CIN3 persists, Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)
      or Cold knife conisation (CKC) will be performed to remove the dysplastic cells as this is
      considered standard of care.
