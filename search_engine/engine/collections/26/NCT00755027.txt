      with Parkinson's disease (PD) and apathy. Secondary objectives are 1) to evaluate the
      affective and cognitive response to rasagiline and their correlates to apathy and 2) to
      investigate the metabolic and neurophysiologic correlates of the behavioural, cognitive and
      emotional, aspects of apathy in PD. This will be an exploratory, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled, parallel-group study. 40 PD patients with apathy and without dementia
      will be recruited. Rasagiline 1 mg or matching placebo will be administered once daily in
      conjunction with the subjects' usual oral antiparkinsonian medications for up to 12 weeks.
      Patients will be evaluated at screening (-7 days) and baseline (0), as well as at weeks 4, 8,
      and 12. A perfusion SPECT will be performed at baseline and at week 12. The study will be
      conducted at the Movement Disorders Unit of the Neurology Department at Sant Pau Hospital
      (Barcelona, Spain).
