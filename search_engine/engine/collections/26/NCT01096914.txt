      resection or liver transplantation is not possible. Among the various percutaneous local
      ablative therapies, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has attracted the greatest interest because
      of its effectiveness and safety for single HCC ≤ 5.0cm or ≤3 HCC nodules ≤3cm. Some studies
      have shown that laser ablation (LA) may be as effective as RFA in the treatment of HCC.
      However, RFA and LA are different techniques and, in different cases (for example: size or
      site of HCC nodule), each of these procedures may have some advantages or disadvantages.
      Therefore there is the need for a prospective randomized controlled study to compare RFA and
      LA in patients with small HCC.
