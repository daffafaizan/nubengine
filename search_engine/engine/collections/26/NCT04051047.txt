      prior to having standard-of-care surgery. During surgery, biopsies will be obtained for
      clinical and research purposes along with a blood sample. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is
      optional and will only be obtained if clinically indicated. This will be determined by the
      investigators and the provider performing the procedure.

      Because patients will be undergoing a biopsy/resection as part of their standard-of-care
      therapy, this is an optimal time to obtain a tumor biopsy for this study. The biopsy will
      serve to see if the study drug is penetrating the tumor. Patients will then enter a follow-up
      period for 30 days post-surgery.

      This trial is in conjunction with a University of Colorado trial started in 2016,
      "Gemcitabine in Children With Newly-Diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma"
      (NCT02992015).
