      malformation (AVM) that are not surgically accessible or in patients with comorbidities that
      make them poor surgical candidates At University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW),
      investigator routinely perform interventional cerebral arteriography on the day of the SRS
      procedure for improved target delineation. Even though the addition of angiography is time
      consuming and requires multi-modality team care, this approach has allowed UTSW to treat the
      smallest possible target, yet achieve excellent obliteration rates of AVM with very low
      toxicity from the procedure. At UTSW the investigator also use CT angiogram at the treatment
      team's discretion to further enhance the accurate delineation of the final treatment target
      volume. However, it had not been routinely done due to uncertain benefit in treatment
      planning and a concern for renal burden from additional intravenous (IV) contrast usage.

      This prospective enrollment and conduct open-label, retrospective analysis study is to
      evaluate whether a target volume based on CT angiography can serve as a reliable substitute
      for a target based on interventional cerebral arteriography. Patients on this protocol will
      still get treated based on target generated by interventional cerebral arteriography but also
      receive CT angiography. If the target volume based on CT angiography are adequate compared to
      their invasive counterpart, future investigators may selectively omit performing
      interventional cerebral arteriography in the treatment planning for SRS of AVM. Use of CT
      angiography may lead to reduction in the risk from the procedure and cost, improve the
      efficiency of the treatment process ideally without compromising the success of the
      procedure, with greater patient comfort and satisfaction.
