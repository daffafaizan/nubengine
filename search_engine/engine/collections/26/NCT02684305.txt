      Iatrogenic stimulation of uterine contractions prior to the onset of spontaneous labor is
      undertaken for various maternal and fetal indications and spans 20% of deliveries today

        1. During the past years there has been an additional rise due to elective inductions

        2. Induction is undertaken when potential risks of prolonging pregnancy outweigh the risks
           of induced delivery, particularly those associated with post-term pregnancy, rupture of
           membranes, oligohydramnios and additional fetal and maternal conditions that pose risks
           to mother and fetus.

      In many circumstances of women with an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score of 7 or less)
      sequential induction with more than one agent is necessary. To date, no trial has compared
      the optimal subsequent ripening method after the preliminary use of dinoprostone
      (prostaglandin E2). In this trial investigators aim to compare the obstetrical outcomes of
      subsequent induction in women admitted for induction of labor with Bishop score <7 or less 24
      hours after the insertion of vaginal prostaglandin insert (Propess). Two methods of routine
      induction of labor will be compared: An additional Propess induction for another 24 hours vs.
      intravenous oxytocin infusion combined with intra-cervical balloon insertion.
