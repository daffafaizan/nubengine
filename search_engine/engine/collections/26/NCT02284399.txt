      on the need for and frequency of invasive testing, and the indications for testing are
      important for the clinicians in this country to not only understand the impact that this
      testing has had but also to plan for allocation of personnel and resources in their prenatal
      testing units, as well as many other more subtle changes including describing changes to
      referring clinicians and patients and projecting financial impacts. Information on pregnant
      women undergoing NIPT at one of the Obstetrix Medical Groups Outpatient Centers between
      January 2012 and June 2014 will be retrospectively gathered and compared to a control group
      of pregnant women in those same practices undergoing invasive prenatal diagnostic testing for
      fetal karyotype (IDTFK) during the months of January 2010-July 2010. An analysis of the
      impact of NIPT will be done.
