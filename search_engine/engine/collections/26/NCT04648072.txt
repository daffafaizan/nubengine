    
      This study is a double blinded, randomized control trial. In order to create a blinded study,
      each participant will receive two injections; a single shot adductor canal block (ACB) and a
      periarticular injection (PI). All syringes will be non-identifiable to the surgeon,
      anesthetist and the patient.

      Specifically, the two arms are:

      Arm 1: PI (Ropivacaine + Ketorolac + Epinepherine) + ACB (Ropivacaine)

      Arm 2: PI (Ropivacaine + Ketorolac + Epinepherine) + ACB (Normal Saline)

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether combining these two techniques have an added
      benefit, compared to periarticular injection alone. The investigators hypothesize that the
      addition of an adductor canal block will translate to a superior quality of recovery, as well
      as an improvement in functional return, discharge readiness and less short-term and long-term
      post-operative narcotic use.
