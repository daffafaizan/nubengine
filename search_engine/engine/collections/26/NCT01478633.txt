      involved know the identity of the intervention), single-arm (one group of patients receiving
      the same treatment), multi-centered study of galantamine in patients with Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). Galantamine has been approved for treatment of mild to moderate dementia of AD.
      Galantamine is available as film-coated tablet in 68 countries including the United States
      and Europe, and is also available as oral syrup and extended-release capsule in 65 counties.
      In Japan, galantamine was approved in January 2011 and is available in three dosage forms of
      film-coated tablet, oral disintegrant tablet, and oral syrup. The target population is
      patients with mild to moderate dementia of Alzheimer's type (ie, Mini-Mental State
      Examination [MMSE] ranging from 10 to 22) who failed to benefit from donepezil. Patients must
      have diagnosis of probable AD according to the diagnostic criteria National Institute of
      Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders
      Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) study group. To ensure that at least 100 subjects complete the
      study, 125 subjects will be enrolled. The treatment group is to receive flexible dosing of 16
      mg/day or 24 mg/day. Patients will receive the study treatment for 24 weeks in accordance
      with the dosing regimen specified in the protocol.
