      tolerability of an investigational drug ficlatuzumab when combined with Nab-paclitaxel and
      Gemcitabine, with the goal of determining the maximally tolerated dose of ficlatuzumab when
      combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.

      Ficlatuzumab is a type of drug called a "monoclonal antibody." It is thought to work by
      targeting hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) which is a HGF-c-Met inhibitor. The activation of
      the receptor tyroside kinase c-Met via its ligand, HGF, mediates proliferation, motility, and
      differentiation in a variety of cancers including pancreatic cancer.

      Subjects must have a newly diagnosed stage 4 untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer
      and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Treatment consists of 4 week treatment cycles. Ficlatuzumab will be administered on day 1 and
      15 of each cycle. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be administered on days 1,8, and 15.

      Subjects continue in study until disease progression, adverse event/toxicity, death or either
      the subject or sponsor discontinues the study.
