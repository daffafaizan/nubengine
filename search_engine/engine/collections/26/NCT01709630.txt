      sulfate administered antenatally to expectant mothers and exposed fetuses with the aim of
      optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes while preventing maternal and neonatal overdosing and
      morbidity associated with current magnesium treatment protocols. Once we have developed a
      PK/PD model in our own hospital cohort, we will apply this model to a large existing NICHD
      database to mathematically calculate optimal dosing protocols.
