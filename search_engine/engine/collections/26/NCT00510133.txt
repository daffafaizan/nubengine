      patients with AML in complete clinical remission. Patients will undergo leukapheresis prior
      to or shortly after completing consolidation chemotherapy. Dendritic cells will be
      transfected with the messenger RNA encoding human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)
      and a portion of the lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP-1 (LAMP), matured, aliquoted,
      and cryopreserved. The final autologous vaccine product is referred to as GRNVAC1. Patients
      will be vaccinated with weekly for 6 weeks,will "rest" for 4 weeks, then will receive 6 boost
      injections, each administered every other week for 12 weeks. Patients will be followed every
      4 weeks until Week 54, then every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months up to
      approximately 5 years from the first vaccination or until relapse/progression.
