      I. To evaluate the biological effects of cetuximab, dasatinib, or the combination on
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- and Src-signaling pathways in resected colorectal
      cancer liver metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are initially enrolled in cohort A. Once
      cohort A is completed, additional patients are enrolled and randomized to treatment in either
      cohorts B or C. If a significant biological effect is seen in cohorts B or C, additional
      patients are enrolled in cohort D.

      COHORT A: Patients receive no systemic neoadjuvant therapy between enrollment and the time of
      definitive surgical resection of liver metastases. Liver biopsies were performed at surgery
      since this cohort received no systemic therapy.

      COHORT B: Patients receive 400 mg/m2 cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on day 1
      and 250 mg/m^2 cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on day 8. Definitive surgical resection of
      liver metastases will take place on day 15.

      COHORT C: Patients receive dasatinib 100 mg orally once daily on days 1-14. Definitive
      surgical resection of liver metastases will take place on day 15.

      COHORT D: Patients receive 400 mg/m^2 cetuximab IV over 120 minutes on day 1 and 250 mg/m^2
      cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on day 8 AND dasatinib 100 mg orally once daily on days
      1-14. Definitive surgical resection of liver metastases will take place on day 15.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue (from initial liver tumor biopsies and liver resection
      samples), serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample collection periodically for
      biomarker analysis via immunohistochemistry (IHC).
