      placebo-controlled trial, with high-level soccer players as volunteers.

      Twenty-two volunteers will be randomly allocated to two intervention groups: active or
      placebo PBMT before a progressive running test (ergospirometry test).

      The blood samples for biochemical analysis will be obtained before and after a progressive
      running test, and another outcomes (functional) will be obtained during the test.

      The data will be collected by a blind assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the
      intention-to-treat principles and data on functional analysis will be analyzed using the
      paired and two-tailed t-student test. Data on biochemical analysis will be analyzed using
      two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test.

      The investigators will analyze: functional aspects (rates of oxygen uptake -VO2max (absolute
      and relative), aerobic and anaerobic threshold and time until exhaustion), muscle damage
      (creatine-kinase -CK and lactate dehydrogenase -LDH), inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6 and
      TNF-α) and oxidative stress markers (Thiobarbituric acid -TBARS, catalase - CAT,
      superoxidedismutase - SOD and carbonylated proteins).
