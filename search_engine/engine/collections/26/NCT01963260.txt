      participants. In Part 2 of the trial, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics will be
      evaluated among participants with ITP. In Part 1, dose escalation will occur in up to 5
      serial panels of participants; each participant will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose
      of MK-8723 (or placebo). In Part 2, dose escalation will occur in up to 3 serial panels of
      participants with ITP; each participant will receive a single IV dose of MK-8723 (or
      placebo), once safety and tolerability of the corresponding dose is shown in Part 1.
      Amendment 3 specified a re-enrollment procedure for eligible participants in Part 2 to
      participate in more than one dosing panel.
