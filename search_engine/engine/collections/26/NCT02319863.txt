      is surgical resection or liver transplantation, the former of which is more feasible at
      present. However, postoperative recurrence or metastasis is an ominous feature for this
      disease. Innovation of the surgical procedure for improving prognosis is under emergency
      request. This study examines the role of this simple technique on postoperative metastasis
      and long term survival.

      During the past 20 years, more 600 patients with primary HCC were performed hepatectomy with
      the new hemorrhage control technique, and prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was
      applied. We further applied a mice model ligating the pedicle of the lesion-located hepatic
      lobe before hepatectomy to imitate the clinic practice, and evaluated the role of the new
      technique on postoperative metastasis and survival.
