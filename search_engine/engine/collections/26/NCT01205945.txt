    
      Old population, aged from 60 to 85 years, are randomized into two groups; one group is
      invited for ultrasonographic screening for AAA, and the other acts as age- and sex-matched
      controls.

      For screening group, The anterioposterior and transverse diameter of the infrarenal aorta is
      measured at their maximal sizes. The subsequent surveillance of screened patients is done as
      follows

        -  Aortic diameter less than 3.0cm, no further testing

        -  AAA 3 to 4cm, ultrasonographic follow-up every year

        -  AAA 4 to 5cm, ultrasonographic follow-up every 6 months

        -  AAA greater than 5cm, referral to a vascular surgeon

      For control group, the information for any causes of death is collected every year.
