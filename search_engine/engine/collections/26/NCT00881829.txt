      during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 as compared to arterial blood
      samples assessed by CO-Oximetry for SpO2 validation. The end goal is to show the SpO2
      accuracy performance of the pulse oximeters. It is expected that the Accuracy Root Mean
      Square (Arms) performance of pulse oximeters will meet a specification of 3 or better in
      non-motion conditions for the range of 70-100% SaO2 thereby demonstrating an acceptable SpO2
      accuracy performance specification
