    
      In this pilot study, we will assess the disease control rate (Continued Complete
      Response-CCR, Complete Response-CR, Partial Response-PR and Stable Disease-SD) as well as
      survical rate (overall survival- OS and progression free survival- PFS) in children with
      newly diagnosed HGG with TRK fusion who receive 2 cycles of larotrectinib monotherapy
      administered orally, twice daily, at 100 mg/m2 continuously on a 28-day cycle schedule. After
      2 monotherapy cycles of larotrectinib, patients with CCR or CR will continue to receive
      larotrectinib maintenance therapy as monotherapy for a total of 12 cycles. Patients ≤ 48
      months with PR or SD after 2 cycles of larotrectinib will go on to receive combination
      therapy with standard backbone chemotherapy (BABYPOG or HIT-SKK). Patients > 48 months of age
      (or patients ≥ 36 months of age, or patients with DIPG >18 months of age, at the discretion
      of the local investigator) will receive focal radiation therapy. A surgical cohort study will
      be explored whereby patients who have had a tumor biopsy/partial resection at their local
      institution and are planned to subsequently undergo definitive resection will receive 3-5
      days (6-10 doses) of larotrectinib pre-surgery.

      The study design of this trial requires 15 patients evaluable for disease control and for
      safety/ toxicity of larotrectinib as monotherapy. The surgical cohort will enroll up to 4
      patients and will count towards the total 15 evaluable patients. A minimum of 6 patients will
      be evaluable for safety toxicity of larotrectinib in combination with standard-of-care
      chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
