      unpleasant sensations and an urge to move the legs when the person is at rest. The sensations
      are relieved by movement. Loss of sleep associated with RLS can cause extreme fatigue,
      affecting concentration, which may produce anxiety and depression, resulting in a poor
      quality of life. Prevalence in the general population is 5% to 10%. In approximately 3%,
      symptoms are so severe that treatment is sought. Potent drugs, such as opioids, central
      nervous system depressants, anticonvulsants, and dopamine agonists have been used to ease
      symptoms, each with several side effects.

      Anecdotal evidence suggested that pressure on specific foot muscles decreases symptoms of
      moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome. In the RESTIFFIC™ study, patients served
      as their own negative controls, wearing the RESTIFFIC™ devices intermittently, while
      completing surveys related to RLS throughout the study. Physicians also completed surveys
      related to quality of life. Meta-analysis was used to compare RESTIFFIC™ to historic reports
      of ropinirole and placebo pill. Demographics, disease severity,inclusion/exclusion criteria,
      assessment tools were similar among studies.
