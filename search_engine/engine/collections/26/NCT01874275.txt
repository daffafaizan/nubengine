      performed at the MedCenter Therapy clinic in Houston, Texas. JTech computerized testing
      system was utilized including Goniometry, Grip testing, Inclinometry, Muscle Testing and
      Joint Range of Motion testing occurred on Day 0, 30, 60, 90, 180, and repeated at 12 months
      to determine muscular strength and joint Range of Motion. JTech computerized testing system
      was chosen on the basis of reliability and accuracy. At each of the testing intervals, the
      testing was administered by the same technician with the same equipment to all of the
      participants. Inter-and intra-tester reliability of the JTech computerized testing system has
      been the subject of multiple studies. Each of which found high ICCs (>0.93) for both inter-
      and intra-tester reliability.

      All sleep studies were performed at Sleep Diagnostics of Texas in The Woodlands, Texas. Prior
      to the clinical trial, all of the participants spent two nights in the sleep unit and their
      sleep study examinations were performed. The second night was used as the Day 0 data. Sleep,
      breathing, arousals and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines set forth
      by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The sleep studies were repeated at 6 months and 1
      year.
