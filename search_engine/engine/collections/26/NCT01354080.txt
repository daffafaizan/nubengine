      about 20-25% of the population, women as well as men, but occurs more frequently in women
      (female:male ratio of 2.2:1). Persons of different age suffer from it. Constipation is a
      bothersome ailment which negatively affects the general physical and mental state, lowers
      physical and mental fitness, significantly hinders professional work, and decreases life
      comfort As the factors which contribute to the occurrence of constipation are very diverse
      and complex, the treatment is a long-term and slow process. There are numerous conservative
      treatment methods for constipation, such as physical treatments, reflexotherapy, biofeedback,
      pharmacotherapy, and modification of lifestyle. There is also a possibility of applying
      classical massage in persons with constipation. However, observations of the authors suggest
      it is not a therapy commonly applied.
